'''Alderley Park''' was a country house in a park of the same name at [[Nether Alderley]], Cheshire, England, between Macclesfield and Knutsford. It was purchased by Bruntwood in 2014.  The site has an international reputation as a home for bio and life sciences. 

The house was constructed in brick with a stone facade for the [[John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley|7th Baronet Stanley]]. Building started in 1818 on a site in the south of the park. The new house grew to a size of sixty bedrooms and six entertaining rooms, of which only one room, with its oak panelling and coats of arms intact, remains. Behind the house a walled garden and a water garden were created and the mill pond enlarged. In 1931, however, the house was severely damaged by fire and left empty for nearly twenty years until converted in 1950 by the [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] chemical group to serve as the headquarters of their new pharmaceutical division. The gardens and some outbuildings have been preserved and many thousands of trees planted.

==History==
The manor of Over Alderley came into the Stanley family when heiress Elizabeth Weever married John Stanley, a brother of the Earl of Derby. In the 1580s John Stanley's descendant, Thomas Stanley, built a [[Alderley Old Hall|mansion house]] on a moated site near the [[Nether Alderley Mill|mill]] at Nether Alderley. Thomas died in 1591.

The adjacent manor of Nether Alderley had been confiscated by the crown in 1508 from the estate of [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|Sir William Stanley]] after his conviction and execution for supporting [[Perkin Warbeck]]. It was sold in 1556 to Sir Edward Fitton of Gawsworth who sold it on for £2000 to Thomas Stanley, jnr in 1602.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/hs1864/alderley.htm| title = Stanley of Alderley|accessdate = 2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas was knighted by King James in 1603. The Stanley family subsequently occupied the hall for around two hundred years until it was severely damaged by fire in 1779; part of the old hall survives, dating from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1139591|desc=The Old Hall|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th Baronet then commissioned a new hall to be constructed in 1818, in the south of the estate on a site then occupied by Park House.

The new hall was subsequently occupied by further generations of the Stanley family until 1931, when it too was damaged by fire during the occupation of [[Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley]] and had to be partially demolished and left unoccupied. The sixth Lord's finances had suffered from the effects of two expensive divorces, gambling losses and death duties and in 1938 he decided to sell the estate piecemeal, involving the disposal of 77 farms and 166 houses. No offers were received for the hall itself and it stood empty for nearly twenty years.

==Business use==
In 1950 the dilapidated hall and {{Convert|350|acre}} of surrounding parkland were purchased, with planning permission to develop, by ICI Pharmaceuticals for £55,000. Work began in 1957 on a site by Radnor Mere (the enlarged mill pond) to provide office and laboratory facilities, initially for ICI and latterly for AstraZeneca, and which came to house some 3,500 staff. It became a global lead centre for cancer research and a number of anti-cancer treatments were developed at the site including [[Nolvadex]], [[Zoladex]], [[Casodex]], [[Arimidex]] and [[Iressa]].

Work on the latest Alderley Hall began in 1963, and incorporates a surviving part of the previous building. Originally the ballroom, this part is now named the [[James Black (pharmacologist)|Sir James Black]] Conference Centre in honour of the discoverer of [[beta-blocker]]s. The gardens and the woodlands have been restored and the nearby Grade II listed Home Farm buildings preserved. The latter includes coach-houses, cottages and barns of hand-made English orange brick and a six-sided columbarium or dovecote.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1139596|desc=Training Centre and Stores at Alderley Park|access-date=20 August 2017|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1221289|desc=Dovecote at Alderley Park|access-date=20 August 2017|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, AstraZeneca announced plans to cease R&amp;D work at Alderley Park. A total of 1,600 jobs were to be relocated over three years, mainly to [[Cambridge]], but the company planned to continue non-R&amp;D work at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-21833207 BBC News: AstraZeneca axes 700 jobs in Cambridge move] (accessed 19 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Alderley Park was purchased by Manchester Science Parks – a partnership between Manchester's academic centres and local councils, and investment company [[Bruntwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/alderley_park_will_remain_flagship_bioscience_location_552479|title=Alderley Park 'will remain flagship bioscience location'|last=|first=|date=12 March 2014|website=PMLive|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Redevelopment ==
In February 2016, planning consent was granted for a £160m masterplan to re-develop the Park which will include significant investment into re-purposing the bioscience campus to one of multiple occupancy, up to 275 homes, a farm shop, village shop, gastropub and new leisure facilities.  Construction of the first two phases of houses by PH Homes and PJ Livesey commenced in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PH's Alderley Park homes start at £735k|url=https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/news/phs-alderley-park-homes-start-at-735k/|website=Place North West|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ADAM Architecture|Robert Adam]], one of the architects for PH Homes' Alderley Park development, was awarded the 2017 [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]], the highest value architecture award in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Architect For Alderley Park Wins Major Prize|url=https://www.alderleypark.co.uk/news/2017/8/8/architect-for-alderley-park-scheme-robert-adam-receives-major-architectural-prize/|website=Alderley Park|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, over 150 companies are based at Alderley Park, including the Medicines Discovery [[Catapult centres|Catapult]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://md.catapult.org.uk/contact-us/|title=Contact Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Medicines Discovery Catapult|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the AMR Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amrcentre.com/|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=www.amrcentre.com|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artificial neural membrane''' ('''ANM''') refers to a new class of functional structure developed through research adaptive and evolutionary neural networks and programmable materials.  The greatest interest in ANM structures surround their potential as [[open architecture]] environments for the integration of [[Micrometre|microscale]] and [[Nanometre|nanoscale]] devices.

Originally based on the [[Neurogenesis]] Algorithms developed by [[mathematician]] and engineering [[physicist]] Dr. P. A. Menges.  While working as a postdoctoral research associate at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], Dr. Menges became interested in thin film materials used in specialized sensors also referred to as smart skins.  After leaving the laboratory she established a computational method allowing networks to automatically embed or simulate on other networks based in functional materials. 

Artificial neural membrane technology development has been funded by the [[NASA]] Institute for Advanced Concepts, for application to flapping wing flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/abstracts/1121Menges.pdf |title=ARTIFICIAL NEURAL MEMBRANE FLAPPING WING |first=Pamela |last=Menges }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently [[Aerospace Research Systems, Inc]] – the agency that pioneered work in developing artificial neurons for use in control of multifunctional smart structures – is applying the technology to reusable launch vehicles.  Other applications include [[biotechnology]] processes, morphing aircraft and spacecraft, adaptive [[wind turbine|wind generators]], and [[artificial organ]]s.  Recent research also indicates that ANM systems may provide the first truly automated intentional or conceptual programming environment.  The ANM technology has been referred as being as significant as [[semiconductors]] in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

In [[physics]], the '''baryon asymmetry''' problem, also known as the '''matter asymmetry''' problem or the '''matter-antimatter asymmetry''' problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The matter-antimatter asymmetry problem | website=CERN | url=https://home.cern/topics/antimatter/matter-antimatter-asymmetry-problem | accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Mystery of the Matter Asymmetry | author=Sather, Eric | website=Vanderbuilt University | url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/physics/panvini/babar/sakharov.pdf | accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the observed imbalance in [[baryonic matter]] (the type of matter experienced in everyday life) and [[antibaryonic matter]] in the [[observable universe]]. Neither the [[Standard Model|standard model]] of [[particle physics]], nor the theory of [[general relativity]] provides a known explanation for why this should be so, and it is a natural assumption that the universe be neutral with all conserved [[charge (physics)|charge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Particle and astroparticle physics |first=Utpal |last=Sarkar |pages=429 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=1-58488-931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Big Bang]] should have produced equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]]. Since this does not seem to have been the case, it is likely some physical laws must have acted differently or did not exist for [[matter]] and [[antimatter]].
Several competing hypotheses exist to explain the imbalance of matter and antimatter that resulted in [[baryogenesis]]. However, there is as of yet no consensus theory to explain the phenomenon. As remarked in a 2012 research paper, "The origin of matter remains one of the great mysteries in physics."&lt;ref name=MatterAndAntimatterInTheUniverse/&gt;

* [[Baryon number]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; violation.
* [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] violation.
* Interactions out of [[thermal equilibrium]].

===Baryon number violation===
Baryon number violation is obviously a necessary condition to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. But C-symmetry violation is also needed so that the interactions which produce more baryons than anti-baryons will not be counterbalanced by interactions which produce more anti-baryons than baryons. CP-symmetry violation is similarly required because otherwise equal numbers of [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|left-handed]]  baryons and [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|right-handed]] anti-baryons would be produced, as well as equal numbers of left-handed anti-baryons and right-handed baryons. Finally, the interactions must be out of thermal equilibrium, since otherwise [[CPT symmetry]] would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number.&lt;ref name=FarrarShaposhnikov1993&gt;

Currently, there is no experimental evidence of particle interactions where the conservation of baryon number is broken [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbatively]]: this would appear to suggest that all observed particle reactions have equal baryon number before and after. Mathematically, the [[commutator]] of the baryon number [[operator (mathematics)|quantum operator]] with the (perturbative) [[Standard Model]] [[hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] is zero: &lt;math&gt;[B,H] = BH - HB = 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, the Standard Model is known to violate the conservation of baryon number only non-perturbatively: a global U(1) anomaly. To account for baryon violation in baryogenesis, such events (including proton decay) can occur in [[Grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] (GUTs) and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] (SUSY) models via hypothetical massive bosons such as the [[X and Y bosons|X boson]].

===CP-Symmetry Violation===
{{Main|CP violation}}
The second condition for generating baryon asymmetry&amp;nbsp;– violation of charge-parity symmetry&amp;nbsp;– is that a process is able to happen at a different rate to its antimatter counterpart. In the [[Standard Model]], CP violation appears as a complex phase in the [[CKM matrix|quark mixing matrix]] of the [[weak interaction]]. There may also be a non-zero CP-violating phase in the [[PMNS matrix|neutrino mixing matrix]], but this is currently unmeasured. CP violation was first observed in the 1964 [[Fitch-Cronin experiment]] with neutral [[kaon]]s, which resulted in the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] (direct CP-violation, that is violation of CP-symmetry in a decay process, was discovered later, in 1999). Due to CPT symmetry, violation of CP-symmetry demands violation of time inversion symmetry, or [[T-symmetry]].  Despite the allowance for CP-violation in the Standard Model, it is insufficient to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe given the limits on baryon number violation, meaning that [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|beyond-Standard Model]] sources are needed.

A possible new source of CP violation was found at the [[Large Hadron Collider|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]] by the [[LHCb experiment|LHCb]] collaboration during the first three years of LHC operations (beginning March 2010). The experiment analyzed the decays of two particles, the [[Lambda baryon|bottom Lambda]] (Λ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) and its antiparticle, and compared the distributions of decay products. The data showed an asymmetry of up to 20% of CP-violation sensitive quantities, implying a breaking of CP-symmetry. This analysis will need to be confirmed by more data from subsequent runs of the LHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://home.cern/about/updates/2017/01/new-source-asymmetry-between-matter-and-antimatter|title=New source of asymmetry between matter and antimatter {{!}} CERN|website=home.cern|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactions out of thermal equilibrium===
In the out-of-equilibrium decay scenario,&lt;ref name=Riotto99&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author1=A. Riotto |author2=M. Trodden | year = 1999
 | title = Recent progress in baryogenesis
 | journal = [[Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science]]
 | volume = 49 | pages = 46
 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nucl.49.1.35
|arxiv = hep-ph/9901362 |bibcode = 1999ARNPS..49...35R }}&lt;/ref&gt; the last condition states that the rate of a reaction which generates baryon-asymmetry must be less than the rate of expansion of the universe. In this situation the particles and their corresponding antiparticles do not achieve thermal equilibrium due to rapid expansion decreasing the occurrence of pair-annihilation.

==Other explanations==
===Regions of the universe where antimatter dominates===
Another possible explanation of the apparent baryon asymmetry is that matter and antimatter are essentially separated into different, widely separated regions of the [[universe]]. The formation of antimatter galaxies was originally thought to explain the baryon asymmetry, as from a distance, antimatter atoms are indistinguishable from matter atoms; both produce light (photons) in the same way. Along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions, however, annihilation (and the subsequent production of [[gamma radiation]]) would be detectable, depending on its distance and the density of matter and antimatter. Such boundaries, if they exist, would likely lie in deep intergalactic space. The density of matter in intergalactic space is reasonably well established at about one atom per cubic meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Keay |last2=Smoot |first2=George |author2link=George Smoot |title=Wrinkles in Time |publisher=Avon |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=0061344443 |pages=158–163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silk |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Silk |title=Big Bang |location=New York |publisher=Freeman |year=1977 |page=299 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLwe1lUmz5kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming this is a typical density near a boundary, the gamma ray luminosity of the boundary interaction zone can be calculated. No such zones have been detected, but 30 years of research have placed bounds on how far they might be. On the basis of such analyses, it is now deemed unlikely that any region within the observable universe is dominated by antimatter.&lt;ref name=MatterAndAntimatterInTheUniverse&gt;{{cite journal|first=L. |last=Canetti |first2=M. |last2=Drewes |first3=M. |last3=Shaposhnikov |title=Matter and Antimatter in the Universe |journal=New J. Phys. |year=2012 |volume=14 |pages=095012 |doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/9/095012 |arxiv = 1204.4186 |bibcode = 2012NJPh...14i5012C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One attempt to explain the lack of observable interfaces between matter and antimatter dominated regions is that they are separated by a [[Leidenfrost effect|Leidenfrost]] layer of very hot matter created by the energy released from annihilation. This is similar to the manner in which water may be separated from a hot plate by a layer of evaporated vapor, delaying the evaporation of more water.

===Electric dipole moment===
The presence of an [[electric dipole moment]] (EDM) in any fundamental particle would violate both parity (P) and time (T) symmetries. As such, an EDM would allow matter and antimatter to decay at different rates leading to a possible matter-antimatter asymmetry as observed today. Many experiments are currently being conducted to measure the EDM of various physical particles. All measurements are currently consistent with no dipole moment. However, the results do place rigorous constraints on the amount of symmetry violation that a physical model can permit. The most recent EDM limit, published in 2014, was that of the ACME Collaboration, which measured the EDM of the electron using a pulsed beam of [[thorium monoxide]] (ThO) molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The ACME Collaboration |title=Order of Magnitude Smaller Limit on the Electric Dipole Moment of the Electron |journal=Science |volume=343 |issue=269 |pages=269–72 |date=17 January 2014 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6168/269.full |doi=10.1126/science.1248213 |display-authors=etal |pmid=24356114|bibcode = 2014Sci...343..269B |arxiv=1310.7534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baryon asymmetry parameter==
The challenges to the physics theories are then to explain ''how'' to produce this preference of matter over antimatter, and also the ''magnitude'' of this asymmetry. An important quantifier is the ''asymmetry parameter'',
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{n_\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.
This quantity relates the overall number density difference between baryons and antibaryons (n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;{{overline|B}}&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively) and the number density of [[cosmic background radiation]] [[photon]]s n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;.

According to the Big Bang model, matter decoupled from the [[cosmic background radiation]] (CBR) at a temperature of roughly {{val|3000}} [[kelvin]], corresponding to an average kinetic energy of {{val|3000|u=K}} / ({{val|10.08|e=3|u=K/eV}}) = {{val|0.3|u=eV}}. After the decoupling, the ''total'' number of CBR photons remains constant. Therefore, due to space-time expansion, the photon density decreases. The photon density at equilibrium temperature T per cubic centimeter, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;n_\gamma = \frac{1}{\pi^2} {\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \int_0^\infty \frac{x^2}{e^x - 1} dx =
  \frac{2\zeta(3)}{\pi^2}{\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \approx
  20.3 \left(\frac{T}{1\text{K}}\right)^3 \text{cm}^{-3}
&lt;/math&gt;,
with k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; as the [[Boltzmann constant]], ħ as the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2π and c as the speed of light in vacuum, and ζ(3) as
[[Apéry's constant]]. At the current CBR photon temperature of {{val|2.725|u=K}}, this corresponds to a photon density n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; of around 411 CBR photons per cubic centimeter.

Therefore, the asymmetry parameter η, as defined above, is ''not'' the "good" parameter. Instead, the preferred asymmetry parameter uses the [[entropy]] density s,
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_s = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{s}&lt;/math&gt;
because the entropy density of the universe remained reasonably constant throughout most of its evolution. The entropy density is
:&lt;math&gt;s \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\mathrm{entropy}}{\mathrm{volume}} = \frac{p + \rho}{T} = \frac{2\pi^2}{45}g_{*}(T) T^3&lt;/math&gt;
with p and ρ as the pressure and density from the energy density tensor T&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;, and g&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; as the effective number of degrees of freedom for "massless" particles (inasmuch as mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≪ k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T holds) at temperature T,
:&lt;math&gt;g_*(T) = \sum_\mathrm{i=bosons} g_i{\left(\frac{T_i}{T}\right)}^3 + \frac{7}{8}\sum_\mathrm{j=fermions} g_j{\left(\frac{T_j}{T}\right)}^3&lt;/math&gt;,
for bosons and fermions with g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; degrees of freedom at temperatures T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. At the present era, s = {{val|7.04|s=n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

'''Basophils''' are a type of [[white blood cells]]. Basophils are the least common of the [[granulocyte]]s, representing about 0.5 to 1% of circulating [[white blood cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood differential test|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003657.htm|work=Medline Plus|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=22 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421001053/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003657.htm|archivedate=21 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are the largest type of granulocyte.

Basophils were discovered in 1879 by German physician [[Paul Ehrlich]], who one year earlier had found a cell type present in tissues that he termed ''mastzellen'' (now mast cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blank|first1=U.|last2=Falcone|first2=F. H.|last3=Nilsson|first3=G.|title=The history of mast cell and basophil research – some lessons learnt from the last century|journal=Allergy|date=2013|volume=68|issue=9|pages=1093–1101|doi=10.1111/all.12197|pmid=23991682|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/all.12197/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich received the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries.

The name comes from the fact that these leukocytes are basophilic, i.e., they are susceptible to [[staining]] by [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[dye]]s, as shown in the picture.

==Structure==

Basophils contain large [[cytoplasm]]ic granules which obscure the [[cell nucleus]] under the [[microscope]] when stained. However, when unstained, the nucleus is visible and it usually has two [[wikt:lobe#English|lobes]]. The [[mast cell]], another granulocyte, is similar in appearance and function. Both cell types store [[histamine]], a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated. However, they arise from different branches of [[hematopoiesis]], and mast cells usually do not circulate in the blood stream, but instead are located in connective tissue. Like all circulating granulocytes, basophils can be recruited out of the [[blood]] into a tissue when needed.

==Function==
[[File:Reference ranges for blood tests - white blood cells.png|thumb|500px|right|[[Reference ranges for blood tests]] of white blood cells, comparing basophil amount (shown in violet) with other cells.]]

Basophils appear in many specific kinds of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reactions, particularly those that cause [[allergy|allergic]] symptoms. Basophils contain anticoagulant [[heparin]], which prevents blood from clotting too quickly. They also contain the vasodilator [[histamine]], which promotes blood flow to tissues. They can be found in unusually high numbers at sites of [[Parasitism#Types|ectoparasite]] infection, e.g., [[tick]]s. Like [[eosinophils]], basophils play a role in both parasitic infections and allergies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Voehringer D |title=The role of basophils in helminth infection |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=551–6 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19782643 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2009.09.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in tissues where allergic reactions are occurring and probably contribute to the severity of these reactions. Basophils have protein receptors on their cell surface that bind [[immunoglobulin|IgE]], an [[immunoglobulin]] involved in macroparasite defense and [[allergy]]. It is the bound IgE antibody that confers a selective response of these cells to environmental substances, for example, [[pollen]] [[protein]]s or [[helminth]] antigens. Recent studies in mice suggest that basophils may also regulate the behavior of [[T cell]]s and mediate the magnitude of the secondary immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nakanishi|first=Kenji|title=Basophils as APC in Th2 response in allergic inflammation and parasite infection|journal=Current Opinion in Immunology|date=December 2010|volume=22|issue=6|pages=814–820|doi=10.1016/j.coi.2010.10.018|pmid=21095110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CD200===
Basophil function is inhibited by [[CD200]].  [[Herpesvirus 6, human|Herpesvirus-6]], herpesvirus-7, and herpesvirus-8 produce a CD200 [[Homology (biology)|homolog]] which also inhibits basophil function.  This suggests that basophils may play a role in the immune response to these viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jimmunol.org/content/175/7/4441|title=Down-Regulation of Basophil Function by Human CD200 and Human Herpesvirus-8 CD200|first1=Ikuo|last1=Shiratori|first2=Masao|last2=Yamaguchi|first3=Maho|last3=Suzukawa|first4=Kazuhiko|last4=Yamamoto|first5=Lewis L.|last5=Lanier|first6=Takashi|last6=Saito|first7=Hisashi|last7=Arase|date=1 October 2005|publisher=|journal=The Journal of Immunology|volume=175|issue=7|pages=4441–4449|accessdate=4 May 2018|via=www.jimmunol.org|doi=10.4049/jimmunol.175.7.4441|pmid=16177086|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504172711/http://www.jimmunol.org/content/175/7/4441|archivedate=4 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secretions===

Basophils arise and mature in [[bone marrow]]. When activated, basophils [[degranulation|degranulate]] to release [[histamine]], [[proteoglycan]]s (e.g. [[heparin]] and [[chondroitin]]), and [[proteolytic enzyme]]s  (e.g. [[elastase]] and [[lysophospholipase]]). They also secrete [[lipid]] mediators like [[leukotriene]]s ([[LTD-4]]), and several [[cytokine]]s. Histamine and proteoglycans are pre-stored in the cell's granules while the other secreted substances are newly generated. Each of these substances contributes to inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that basophils are an important source of the [[cytokine]], [[interleukin-4]], perhaps more important than [[T cells]]. Interleukin-4 is considered one of the critical cytokines in the development of allergies and the production of [[IgE]] antibody by the immune system. There are other substances that can activate basophils to secrete which suggests that these cells have other roles in inflammation.&lt;ref name=Janeway5&gt;{{cite book | author = Janeway CA Jr. | author-link = Charles Janeway | title = Immunobiology. | edition = 5th | publisher = Garland Publishing | year = 2001 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=imm.TOC&amp;depth=10 | isbn = 0-8153-3642-X | format = electronic full text via NCBI Bookshelf | display-authors = etal | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090628195820/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=imm.TOC&amp;depth=10 | archivedate = 2009-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degranulation of basophils can be investigated ''in vitro'' by using [[flow cytometry]] and the so-called basophil-activation-test (BAT). Especially, in the diagnosis of allergies including of drug reactions (e.g. induced by [[contrast medium]]), the BAT is of great impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Böhm I, Speck U, Schild HH |title=Pilot study on basophil activation induced by contrast medium |journal=Fundam Clin Pharmacol |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=267–76 |date=April 2011 |pmid=20412314 |doi=10.1111/j.1472-8206.2010.00826.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basopenia]] (a low basophil count) is difficult to demonstrate as the normal basophil count is so low; it has been reported in association with  autoimmune [[urticaria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grattan CE, Dawn G, Gibbs S, Francis DM |title=Blood basophil numbers in chronic ordinary urticaria and healthy controls: diurnal variation, influence of loratadine and prednisolone and relationship to disease activity |journal=Clin Exp Allergy |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=337–41 |date=Mar 2003 |pmid=12614448 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0954-7894&amp;date=2003&amp;volume=33&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=337 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2222.2003.01589.x }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a chronic itching condition). [[Basophilia]] is also uncommon but may be seen in some forms of [[leukaemia]] or [[lymphoma]].

==Clinical significance==

{{Refimprove|date=April 2009}}
The '''Berlin Circle''' ({{lang-de|die Berliner Gruppe}}) was a group that maintained [[Logical positivism|logical empiricist]] views about [[philosophy]].

==History==
Berlin Circle was created in the late 1920s by [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Kurt Grelling]] and [[Walter Dubislav]] and composed of philosophers and scientists such as [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[David Hilbert]] and [[Richard von Mises]]. Its original name was ''Die Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie'', which in English may be translated as "the society for empirical philosophy". Together with the [[Vienna Circle]], they published the journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]'' ("Knowledge") edited by [[Rudolf Carnap]] and Reichenbach, and organized several congresses and colloquia concerning the [[philosophy of science]], the first of which was held in [[Prague]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/berlincr/ "Berlin Circle" entry in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin Circle had much in common with the Vienna Circle, but the philosophies of the circles differed on a few subjects, such as [[probability]] and [[conventionalism]]. Reichenbach insisted on calling his philosophy logical empiricism, to distinguish it from the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle. Few people today make the distinction, and the words are often used interchangeably.

Members of the Berlin Circle were particularly active in analyzing the philosophical and [[logical consequence]]s of the advances in contemporary [[physics]], especially the [[theory of relativity]]. Apart from that, they denied the [[soundness]] of [[metaphysics]] and traditional philosophy and asserted that many philosophical problems are indeed meaningless.

After the rise of [[Nazism]], several of the group's members emigrated to other countries, including Reichenbach, who moved to [[Turkey]] in 1933  and later to the United States in 1938; Dubislav emigrated in 1936; Hempel moved to Belgium in 1934 and later to the United States in 1939; and Grelling was killed in a [[concentration camp]]. A younger member of the Berlin Circle or Berlin School to leave Germany was [[Olaf Helmer]] who joined the [[RAND Corporation]] and played an important role in the development of the [[Delphi method]] used for predicting future trends, and other early forms of [[social technology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Berlin School of Logical Empiricism'' by [[Nicholas Rescher]] (Springer, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

After emigrating to various countries the group effectively came to an end, but not without influencing a wide range of philosophers of the 20th century, its method having been especially influential on [[analytic philosophy]] and [[futurology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14969">A '''binding neuron''' (BN) is an abstract mathematical model of the electrical activity of a neuron, closely related to well-known [[Biological neuron model#integrate-and-fire|integrate-and-fire]] model.  The BN model originated in a 1998 paper by A. K. Vidybida 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidybida | first1 = A.K. | year = 1998 | title = Inhibition as binding controller at the single neuron level | url = | journal = BioSystems | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 263–267 | doi = 10.1016/S0303-2647(98)00073-2 | pmid = 9886656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the concept ==

For a generic neuron the stimuli are excitatory impulses. Normally, more than single input impulse is necessary for exciting neuron up to the level when it fires and emits an output impulse.
Let the neuron receives &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; input impulses at consecutive moments of time &lt;math&gt;t_1,t_2,\dots,t_n&lt;/math&gt;. In the BN concept the temporal coherence &lt;math&gt;tc&lt;/math&gt; between input impulses is defined as follows

&lt;math&gt;tc = \frac{1}{t_n-t_1}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The high degree of temporal coherence between input impulses suggests that in external media all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; 
impulses can be created by a single complex event. Correspondingly, if BN is stimulated by a highly coherent set of input impulses, it fires and emits an output impulse. In the BN terminology, BN binds the elementary events (input impulses) into a single event (output impulse). The binding happens if the input impulses are enough coherent in time, and does not happen if those impulses do not have required degree of coherence.

Inhibition in the BN concept (essentially, the slow somatic potassium inhibition) controls the degree of temporal coherence required for binding: the higher level of inhibition, the higher degree of temporal coherence is necessary for binding to occur.

[[File:Scheme Eng.svg|thumb|Scheme of signal processing in accordance with binding neuron concept. &lt;math&gt;t_1,t_2,\dots,t_n&lt;/math&gt; --- the moments of receiving of input impulses.]]

The emitted output impulse is treated as abstract representation of the compound event (the set of coherent in time input impulses), see Scheme.

== Origin ==
''"Although a neuron requires energy, its main function is to receive signals and to send them out that is, to handle information."'' --- this words by [[Francis Crick]] point at the necessity to describe neuronal functioning in terms of processing of abstract signals &lt;ref&gt;F. Crick. The Astonishing Hypothesis. Touchstone., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two abstract concepts, namely, the "coincidence detector" and "temporal integrator" are offered in this course,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abeles | first1 = M. | year = 1982 | title = Role of the cortical neuron: integrator or coincidence  detector? | url = | journal = Israel Journal of Medical Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 83–92 | pmid = 6279540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = König | first1 = P. | last2 = Engel | first2 = A. K. | last3 = Singer | first3 = W. | year = 1996 | title = Integrator or coincidence detector? the role of the cortical neuron revisited | url = | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 130–137 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(96)80019-1 | pmid = 8658595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first one expects that a neuron fires a spike if a number of input impulses are received at the same time. In the temporal integrator concept a neuron fires a spike after receiving a number of input impulses distributed in time.
Each of the two takes into account some features of real neurons since it is known that a realistic neuron can display
both coincidence detector and temporal integrator modes of activity depending on the stimulation applied,
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rudolph | first1 = M. | last2 = Destexhe | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Tuning neocortical pyramidal neurons between integrators and coincidence detectors | url = | journal = Journal of Computational.Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 239–251 | doi = 10.1023/A:1023245625896 | pmid = 12766426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time, it is known that a neuron together with excitatory impulses receives also inhibitory stimulation.
A natural development of the two above mentioned concepts could be a concept which endows inhibition with its own signal processing role.

In the neuroscience, there is an idea of [[binding problem]]. 
For example, during visual perception, such features as form, color and stereopsis are represented in the brain by 
different neuronal assemblies. The mechanism ensuring those features to be perceived as belonging to a single real object is called "feature binding",
.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Sougné. Binding problem. In Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
The experimentally approved opinion is that precise temporal coordination between neuronal impulses is required for the binding to occur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Treisman | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Gelade | first2 = G. | year = 1980 | title = A feature-integration theory of attention | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 97–136 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5 | pmid = 7351125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coordination mainly means that signals about different features must arrive to certain areas in the brain within a certain time window.

The BN concept reproduces at the level of single generic neuron the requirement, which is necessary for the feature binding to occur, and which was 
formulated earlier at the level of large-scale neuronal assemblies.
Its formulation is made possible by the analysis of response of the 
Hodgkin–Huxley model to stimuli similar to those the real neurons receive
in the natural conditions, see "Mathematical implementations", below.

== Mathematical implementations ==

=== Hodgkin–Huxley (H-H) model ===

[[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] — physiologically substantiated neuronal model, 
which operates in terms of
transmembrane ionic currents, and describes mechanism of generation of  [[action potential]].

In the paper
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidybida | first1 = A. K. | year = 1996 | title = Neuron as time coherence discriminator | url = | journal = Biological Cybernetics | volume = 74 | issue = 6| pages = 537–542 | doi = 10.1007/BF00209424 | pmid = 8672560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
the response of the H-H model was studied numerically to stimuli &lt;math&gt;U(t)&lt;/math&gt; composed of many
excitatory impulses distributed randomly within a time window &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
U(t)=\sum_{k=1}^{NP} V(t-t_{k}),\qquad
t_{k} \in [0;W].
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;V(t)&lt;/math&gt; denotes magnitude of 
[[excitatory postsynaptic potential]] at moment &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; 
&lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; — is the moment of arrival of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th impulse; &lt;math&gt;NP&lt;/math&gt; — is the total number of impulses the 
stimulus is composed of. The numbers &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; are random, 
distributed uniformly within interval
&lt;math&gt;[0;W]&lt;/math&gt;. The stimulating current applied in the H-H equations 
is as follows

&lt;math&gt;
I(t)=-C_{M}\ \frac{d U(t)}{dt},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_M&lt;/math&gt; — is the capacity of unit area of excitable membrane.
The probability to generate action potential was calculated as a function 
of the window width &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.
Different constant potassium conductances were added to the H-H equations 
in order to create certain levels of 
inhibitory potential. The dependencies obtained, if recalculated as functions of &lt;math&gt;TC=\frac{1}{W}&lt;/math&gt;, 
which is analogous to temporal coherence of impulses in the compound stimulus, have step-like form.
The location of the step is controlled by the level of inhibition potential, 
see Fig. 1. 
Due to this type of dependence, the H-H equations can be treated as mathematical model of the BN concept.

[[File:Step Ukr.svg|thumb|Fig. 1. Firing probability (&lt;math&gt;fp&lt;/math&gt;) of Hodgkin–Huxley type neuron, 
stimulated with the set of &lt;math&gt;NP&lt;/math&gt; input impulses as a function of 
temporal coherence of the impulses. 
The curves from the left to the right correspond to increasing potassium 
conductance, that is to increasing degree of inhibition.]]

===Leaky integrate and fire neuron (LIF)===

[[Biological neuron model|Leaky integrate and fire neuron]] is a widely used  abstract neuronal model.
If to state a similar problem for the LIF neuron with appropriately chosen 
inhibition mechanism,
then it is possible to obtain step-like dependencies similar to the Fig. 1 
as well.
Therefore, the LIF neuron as well can be considered as mathematical model of the BN concept.

===Binding neuron model===

The binding neuron model implements the BN concept in the most refined form.
In this model each input impulse is stored in the neuron during fixed 
time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and then disappears.
This kind of memory serves as surrogate of the 
[[excitatory postsynaptic potential]].
The model has a threshold &lt;math&gt;N_{th}&lt;/math&gt;: if the number of stored in 
the BN impulses exceeds &lt;math&gt;N_{th}&lt;/math&gt;
then the neuron fires a spike and clears it internal memory. The presence of 
inhibition results in the decreased &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

In the BN model, it is necessary to control the time to live of any stored 
impulse during calculation of the neuron's
response to input stimulation. This makes the BN model more complicated 
for numerical simulation than the LIF model.
On the other hand, any impulse spends finite time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; 
in the BN model neuron. This is in contrast to the
LIF model, where traces of any impulse can be present infinitely long. 
This property of the BN model allows to
get precise description of output activity of BN stimulated with random 
stream of input impulses, see
&lt;ref name=Vidybida2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidybida | first1 = A. K. | year = 2007 | title = Output stream of a binding neuron | url = | journal = Ukrainian Mathematical Journal | volume = 59 | issue = 12| pages = 1819–1839 | doi = 10.1007/s11253-008-0028-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidybida | first1 = A. K. | last2 = Kravchuk | first2 = K. G. | year = 2013 | title = Delayed feedback makes neuronal firing statistics non-markovian | doi = 10.1007/s11253-013-0753-2 | journal = Ukrainian Mathematical Journal | volume = 64 | issue = 12| pages = 1793–1815 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arunachalam | first1 = V. | last2 = Akhavan-Tabatabaei | first2 = R. | last3 = Lopez | first3 = C. | year = 2013 | title = Results on a Binding Neuron Model and Their Implications for Modified Hourglass Model for Neuronal Network | doi = 10.1155/2013/374878 | journal = Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine | volume = 2013 | issue = | page = 374878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limiting case of BN with infinite memory, ''τ''→∞, corresponds to 
the temporal integrator.
The limiting case of BN with infinitely short memory, ''τ''→0, corresponds 
to the coincidence detector.

==Integrated circuit implementation==
The above-mentioned and other neuronal models and nets made of them can be implemented in microchips. Among different chips it is worth mentioning the [[field-programmable gate array]]s. These chips can be used for implementation of any neuronal model, but the BN model can be programmed most naturally because it can use only integers and do not need solving differential equations. Those features are used, e.g. in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosselló | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Canals | first2 = V. | last3 = Morro | first3 = A. | last4 = Oliver | first4 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Hardware implementation of stochastic spiking neural networks | url = | journal = International Journal of Neural Systems | volume = 22 | issue = 4| page = 1250014 | doi = 10.1142/S0129065712500141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = R. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = G. | last3 = Stiefel | first3 = K. M. | last4 = Hamilton | first4 = T. J. | last5 = Tapson | first5 = J. | last6 = Schaik | first6 = A. van | year = 2013 | title = An fpga implementation of a polychronous spiking neural network with delay adaptation | journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 14 | doi = 10.3389/fnins.2013.00014 | pmid = 23408739 | pmc=3570898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
As an abstract concept the BN model is subjected to necessary limitations. Among those are such as ignoring neuronal morphology, identical magnitude of input impulses, replacement of a set of transients with different relaxation times, known for a real neuron, with a single time to live, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, of impulse in neuron, the absence of refractoriness and fast (chlorine) inhibition. The BN model has the same limitations, yet some of them can be removed in a complicated model, see, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kravchuk | first1 = K. G. | last2 = Vidybida | first2 = A. K. | year = 2014 | title = Non-markovian spiking statistics of a neuron with delayed feedback in presence of refractoriness | doi = 10.3934/mbe.2014.11.81 | journal = Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 81–104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the BN model is used with refractoriness and fast inhibition.

In 1931, Pettersson's son [[Hans Pettersson|Hans]], who was a professor at the [[University of Gothenburg]] expanded the research on the island and then in 1932 the SHBK was able to purchase the island for the government.&lt;ref name="Börnö Station"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersson|first1=Eugenia|title=Börnö Station|url=http://ipd.gu.se/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=404490&amp;languageId=100001&amp;contentId=-1|publisher=University of Gothenburg|accessdate=8 January 2016|location=Gothenburg, Sweden|date=27 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125074026/http://ipd.gu.se/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=404490&amp;languageId=100001&amp;contentId=-1#|archive-date=2016-01-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island has been considered by many Swedes to be the birthplace of Swedish oceanography.&lt;ref name="Bornö Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bornö Institute for Ocean and Climate Studies|url=http://www.bornoinstitute.o.se/ENGELSKA.HTM|publisher=Bornö Institute|accessdate=8 January 2016|location=Bornö, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1908, Otto Pettersson collected daily records on the temperature and salinity of the waters at the Bornö Station.&lt;ref name="Börnö Station" /&gt; With few interruptions, mostly during conflicts in World War I and World War II, these daily observations continued until the 1980s.{{sfn|Fonselius|2001|p=115}} Petterson also discovered internal tidal waves by studying variations of the boundary surfaces between the brackish and ocean waters, which led him to develop a photographic current meter.{{sfn|Fonselius|2001|p=116}} When his son took over the investigations at the institute in the 1930s, he began to focus on the radioactive dating of sediments{{sfn|Fonselius|2001|p=119}} and forged research collaborations with the scientists at the [[Institute for Radium Research, Vienna|Institute for Radium Research of Vienna]].{{sfn|Rentetzi|2004|p=360}}

The station grounds, covering {{convert|19000|m2|abbr=on}}, are a nature reserve.&lt;ref name="Börnö Station" /&gt; It is currently owned and operated by a foundation named the Bornö Institute for Ocean and Climate Studies and provides educational facilities for the University of Gothenburg.

[[Image:Yellow-rattle close 700.jpg|thumb|right|Papery (upper) and leafy bracts on hay rattle (''[[Rhinanthus minor]]'').  All the "leaves" in this image are bracts.]]
In [[botany]], a '''bract''' is a modified or specialized [[leaf]], especially one associated with a reproductive structure such as a [[flower]], [[inflorescence]] axis or [[cone scale]]. Bracts are often (but not always) different from foliage leaves. They may be smaller, larger, or of a different color, shape, or texture. Typically, they also look different from the parts of the flower, such as the petals or [[sepals]]. The state of having bracts is referred to as '''bracteate'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bracteate|title=the definition of bracteate|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-04-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428051604/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bracteate|archivedate=2017-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bracteolate''', and conversely the state of lacking them is referred to as '''ebracteate'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greengonzo.com/dictionary/Ebractiate.html|title=Definition of Ebractate|website=www.greengonzo.com|access-date=2017-04-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428052240/http://www.greengonzo.com/dictionary/Ebractiate.html|archivedate=2017-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''ebracteolate''', without bracts.

==Variants==

Some bracts are brightly-coloured and serve the function of attracting pollinators, either together with the [[perianth]] or instead of it. Examples of this type of bract include ''[[Euphorbia pulcherrima]]'' (poinsettia) and ''[[Bougainvillea]]'': both of these have large colourful bracts surrounding much smaller, less colourful flowers.

In grasses, each floret (flower) is enclosed in a pair of papery bracts, called the '''lemma''' (lower bract) and '''palea''' (upper bract), while each spikelet (group of florets) has a further pair of bracts at its base called '''glumes'''.  These bracts form the [[chaff]] removed from [[cereal]] grain during [[threshing]] and [[winnowing]].

Bats may detect acoustic signals from dish-shaped bracts such as those of ''[[Marcgravia evenia]]''.&lt;ref name=Simon11&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ralph Simon|author2=Marc W. Holderied|author3=Corinna U. Koch|author4=Otto von Helversen|title=Floral acoustics: Conspicuous echoes of a dish-shaped leaf attract bat pollinators|journal=Science|volume= 333| issue=6042|pages=631–633|DOI=10.1126/science.1204210|pmid=21798950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prophyll''' is a leaf-like structure, such as a bracteole, subtending (extending under) a single flower or [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]. The term can also mean the lower bract on a [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]].

The frequently showy pair of bracts of ''[[Euphorbia]]'' species in subgenus ''Lacanthis'' are the '''cyathophylls'''.

Bracts subtend the cone scales in the seed cones of many [[conifer]]s, and in some cases, such as ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'', they extend beyond the cone scales.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Bracteole==
A small bract is called a '''bracteole''' or '''bractlet'''. Technically this is any bract that arises ''on'' a pedicel instead of subtending it.

== Involucral bracts ==
[[Image:Leafy-bract-Beggar-ticks.we.jpg|100px|right|thumb|Beggar-tick (''[[Bidens comosa]]'')]]

Bracts that appear in a [[Whorl (botany)|whorl]] subtending an [[inflorescence]] are collectively called an '''involucre'''. An involucre is a common feature beneath the inflorescences of many [[Apiaceae]], [[Asteraceae]], [[Dipsacaceae]] and [[Polygonaceae]]. Each flower in an inflorescence may have its own whorl of bracts, in this case called an '''involucel'''. In this case they may be called ''chaff'', ''paleas'', or ''receptacular bracts'' and are usually minute scales or bristles.  Many [[Asteraceae|asteraceous]] plants have bracts at the base of each inflorescence.

The term involucre is also used for a highly conspicuous bract or bract pair at the base of an inflorescence. In the family [[Betulaceae]], notably in the genera ''[[hornbeam|Carpinus]]'' and ''[[hazel|Corylus]]'', the '''involucre''' is a leafy structure that protects the developing nuts. Beggar-tick (''[[Bidens comosa]]'') has narrow involucral bracts surrounding each inflorescence, each of which also has a single bract below it. There is then a pair of leafy bracts on the main stem and below those a pair of leaves.

==Epicalyx==
[[Image:Hibiscus rosa-sinensis3 ies.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Epicalyx of ''[[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis]]'']]
 
An epicalyx, which forms an additional whorl around the [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of a single flower, is a modification of bracteoles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darpan|first=Pratiyogita|title=Competition Science Vision|date=June 2006|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the epicalyx is a ''group of bracts resembling a calyx'' or ''bracteoles forming a whorl outer to the calyx''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/books/12/std12-botany-em.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214091359/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/12/Std12-Botany-EM.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a calyx-like extra whorl of floral appendages.  Each individual segment of the epicalyx is called an '''episepal''' because they resemble the sepals in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://botanydictionary.org/epicalyx.html |title=epicalyx – Dictionary of botany |publisher=Botanydictionary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120501223013/http://botanydictionary.org/epicalyx.html |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are present in the [[Malvaceae]], the ''Hibiscus'' family. ''[[Fragaria]]'' (strawberries) may or may not have an epicalyx.

==Spathe==
[[Image:Anthurium scherzerianum 2.jpg|right|100px|thumb|''[[Anthurium]] scherzerianum'' [[inflorescence]] with spathe and [[spadix (botany)|spadix]]]]

A ''spathe'' is a large bract or pair of bracts forming a sheath to enclose the flower cluster of such plants as [[Arecaceae|palm]]s, [[arum]]s, [[Iris (plant)|irises]],&lt;ref name=Lynch&gt;Richard Lynch {{Google books|grvYTul5CSUC|The Book of the Iris|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crocus]]es,&lt;ref&gt;Alex Casha {{Google books|Poo9CgAAQBAJ|Flora of the Maltese Islands|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dayflower]]s (''Commelina''). ''[[Habranthus tubispathus]]'' in the [[Amaryllidaceae]] derives its [[botanical nomenclature|specific name]] from its tuberous spathe. In many arums ([[Araceae]] family), the spathe is petal-like, attracting pollinators to the flowers arranged on a type of spike called a [[spadix (botany)|spadix]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Canadian Information Technology Body of Knowledge''' ('''CITBOK''') is the project sponsored and undertaken by [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] (CIPS) to define and outline the [[body of knowledge]] that defines a Canadian [[Information Systems Professional]] (ISP).

CIPS recognizes that in order to strengthen the criteria of the ISP designation successfully while still maintaining high standards, the association needs to develop a Canadian Information Technology Body of Knowledge (CITBOK) that will set standards for knowledge.  The CITBOK is an outline of the knowledge bases that form the intellectual basis for the IT profession.  CIPS has identified a core CITBOK that all professionals would be expected to master and specialty bodies of knowledge that would depend on your area of practice.  When setting this Canadian standard for Information Technology (IT) knowledge, CIPS looked to other organizations and internationally for standards and bodies of knowledge that CIPS could adopt or adapt, especially for the specialty areas.  For example, in 2004, CIPS adopted the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) Professional Examination Study Guide Syllabus Diploma level (Core and 11 specialist modules) as the initial Body of Knowledge for CIPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=2065 |title=Moving towards a Canadian IT Body of Knowledge |accessdate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230307/http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=2065 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CITBOK aims to:

* be an industry structure model that can be used to define the set of performance, training and development standards for all IT practitioners (CIPS members and non-members) in [[Canada]];
* create alternate paths to certification based on concepts of CITBOK;
* establish guidelines for accreditation criteria based on concepts of CITBOK; and
* create a professional development model that sets the standards criteria for the knowledge base including knowledge, skills, and professional activities for IT practitioners.

A '''chemistry set''' is an [[educational toy]] allowing the user (typically a [[teenager]]) to perform simple [[chemistry]] [[experiment]]s.

==History==

===Forerunners===
[[File:Natural Magick by Giambattista della Porta.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''Natural Magick'', Giambattista della Porta, 1658]]
[[File:Gottling Description of a portable chest of chemistry title page 1791.jpg|thumb|right|120px| ''Description of a portable chest of chemistry'', 1791]]
[[File:Griffin’s Chemical Laboratory.jpg |thumb|upright=1.2|right| Griffin’s Chemical Laboratory, Glasgow, ca.1850.]]

The earliest forerunners of the chemistry set are 17th century books on "natural magick", "which all excellent wise men do admit and embrace, and worship with great applause; neither is there any thing more highly esteemed, or better thought of, by men of learning."&lt;ref name="Deckard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deckard|first1=Michael Funk|last2=Losonczi|first2=Péter|title=Philosophy begins in wonder : an introduction to early modern philosophy, theology, and science|date=2010|publisher=Pickwick Publications|location=Eugene, Or.|isbn=978-1556357824|pages=55–57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYcSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Giambattista della Porta]] included chemical magic tricks and scientific puzzles along with more serious topics.&lt;ref name="Deckard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macrakis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macrakis|first1=Kristie|title=Prisoners, lovers, &amp; spies : the story of invisible ink from Herodotus to al-Qaeda|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=9780300179255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest chemistry sets were developed in the 18th century in England and Germany, with the purpose of teaching chemistry to adults.  In 1791, ''Description of a portable chest of chemistry : or, Complete collection of chemical tests for the use of chemists, physicians, mineralogists, metallurgists, scientific artists, manufacturers, farmers, and the cultivators of natural philosophy'' by [[Johann Friedrich August Göttling]], translated from German, was published in English.&lt;ref name="Goettling"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goettling|first1=Johann Friedrich August|title=Description of a portable chest of chemistry : or, Complete collection of chemical tests for the use of chemists, physicians, mineralogists, metallurgists, scientific artists, manufacturers, farmers, and the cultivators of natural philosophy / invented by J.F.A. Gottling ; translated from the original German|date=1791|publisher=Printed for C. and G. Kearsley|location=London|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435018354548;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Accum]] of London, England also sold portable chemistry sets and materials to refill them.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;    Used primarily for training druggists and medical students, they could also be carried and used in the field.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

Scientific kits also attracted well-educated members of the upper class who enjoyed experimenting and demonstrating their results.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=James M.|title=The Chemistry Set: Chemistry's legacy of the home laboratory|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=12–13, 34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Woodhouse]] of Philadelphia presented a ''Young Chemist's Pocket Companion'' (1797) with an accompanying portable laboratory, specifically targeted ladies and gentlemen. [[Jane Marcet]]'s books on chemistry helped to popularize chemistry as a well-to-do pastime for both men and women.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Rosie|title=Chemistry at Play|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=2010|volume=28|issue=1|pages=20–25|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/chemistry-at-play|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1850s [[John Joseph Griffin|John J. Griffin &amp; Sons]] sold a line of "chemical cabinets", eventually offering 11 categories. These were marketed primarily to adults including elementary school teachers as well as students at the Royal Naval College, the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society]], and the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;

In the mid to late 1800s England, magic and illusion toys enabled children to make their own fireworks, create disappearing inks and cause changes in color, tricks which were mostly chemically based.&lt;ref name="Nicholls"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nicholls|first1=Henry|title=The chemistry set generation|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/issues/2007/december/thechemistrysetgeneration.asp|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=Royal Society of Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Columbian Cyclopedia'' of 1897 defines "CHEMISTRY TOYS" as "mostly [[pyrotechnic]]; recommended as illustrating to the young the rudiments of chemistry, but probably more dangerous than efficient for such use", listing a variety of hazardous examples.&lt;ref name="Columbian"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Columbian Cyclopedia|date=1897|publisher=Garretson, Cox &amp; Company|location=New York|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007958177|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry sets as toys===
[[File:Porter Chemcraft Senior Set No. 6105 2004046 closed.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Porter Chemcraft Senior Set, 1957, at the [[Science History Institute]] ]]

Beginning in the early 1900s, modern chemistry sets targeted younger people with the intention to popularize chemistry. In the United States, [[Porter Chemical Company]] and the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]] produced the best known sets. Although Porter and Gilbert were the largest American producers of chemistry sets, other manufacturers such as the [[Skilcraft]] corporation were also active.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

[[John J. Porter]] and his brother [[Harold Mitchell Porter]] began The Porter Chemical Company in 1914. Their initial purpose was to sell packaged chemicals, but they soon introduced kits. John researched the experiments, while Harold wrote the instruction manuals. Their earliest toys, under the "Chemcraft" trademark, were "chemical magic" sets, selling for less than one dollar (or about $25 in 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=1&amp;year1=191401&amp;year2=201711&lt;/ref&gt;). By the 1920s, they sold six different sets, the largest of which sold for $25 (or about $320 in 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=25.00&amp;year1=192001&amp;year2=201711&lt;/ref&gt;). Their range of toys broadened throughout the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; In the 1950s it was possible to buy toys featuring radioactive ores, such as the "[[Gilbert U-238 Atomic Energy Laboratory]]," which included a [[Geiger counter]] and [[cloud chamber]].&lt;ref name="Kingson"/&gt;

[[File:1940s Gilbert chemistry set 04.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A 1940s [[A. C. Gilbert Company|Gilbert]] chemistry set]]

[[Alfred Carlton Gilbert]] earned money by performing magic tricks while a medical student at Yale. He and John Petrie formed the Mysto Manufacturing Company (later the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]]) in 1909, and began selling boxed magic sets. By 1917, they sold chemistry sets, which they produced through [[World War II]], in spite of restrictions on materials. [[Robert Treat Johnson]], noting the number of chemistry students at Yale whose interest in the science began with a chemistry set, argued the production of chemistry sets was a "patriotic duty."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

Toy companies promoted chemistry sets through advertising campaigns, the "Chemcraft Chemist Club" and its accompanying "Chemcraft Science Magazine", comic books, and essay contests such as Porter's "Why I want to be a scientist". The goal of attracting students to a potential career in chemistry was often explicit in the sets' naming and promotion.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; Chemistry sets may have been the first American toys marketed toward parents with the goal of "improving" children for success in later life.&lt;ref name="Kingson"/&gt;

[[File:Gilbert Lab Technician Set for Girls 1958.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Gilbert Lab Technician Set for Girls, 1958, at the [[Science History Institute]] ]]

The target market for chemistry sets was almost exclusively at boys, whom they deemed "young men of science." However, during the 1950s, Gilbert managed to introduce a set targeting girls. They sold the set in an attractive pink box, but the set identified girls as "laboratory assistants" or "lab technicians," not scientists.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingson|first1=Jennifer A.|title=A Brief History of Chemistry Sets: Practical to Career-Oriented to Just Plain Fun|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/science/a-brief-history-of-chemistry-sets.html?_r=0|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=New York Times|date=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known chemistry sets from the United Kingdom include the 1960s and 1970s sets by [[Thomas Salter (company)|Thomas Salter]] Science (produced in Scotland) and later [[Salter Science]], then the [[J &amp; L Randall|"MERIT"]] sets through the 1970s and 1980s. [[Dekkertoys]] created a range of sets which were similar, complete with glass test tubes of dry chemicals.

==Decline== 
Around the 1960s, increasing social distrust of chemistry, safety concerns, and government regulation began to limit the range of materials and experiments available in chemistry sets. In the United States, the [[Federal Hazardous Substances Labeling Act]] of 1960, the [[Toy Safety Act]] of 1969 and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], established in 1972, and the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] of 1976 all introduced new levels of regulation,&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; which led to the decline of chemistry sets' popularity during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Monahan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monahan|first1=Maureen|title=The Dynamic History of the Toy Chemistry Set|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/72452/dynamic-history-toy-chemistry-set|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=Mental Floss|date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The A. C. Gilbert Company went out of business in 1967, and the Porter Chemical Company went out of business in 1984.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;

Modern chemistry sets, with a few exceptions, tend to include a more restricted range of chemicals and simplified instructions. Many chemistry kits are single use, containing only the types and amounts of chemicals for a specific application.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1563">[[Chemotaxis]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] are expressed in the surface membrane with diverse dynamics, some of them have long-term characteristics as they are determined genetically, others have short-term moiety as their assembly is induced ''ad hoc'' in the presence of the ligand. The diverse feature of the chemotaxis receptors and ligands provides the possibility to select chemotactic responder cells with a simple [[chemotaxis assay]]. By chemotactic selection we can determine whether a still not characterized molecule acts via the long- or the short-term receptor pathway. Recent results proved that [[chemokines]] (e.g. [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]], [[RANTES]]) are working on long-term chemotaxis receptors, while vasoactive peptides (e.g. [[endothelin]]) act more on the short-term ones.  Term ''chemotactic selection'' is also used to design a technique which separates [[eukaryotic]] or [[prokaryotic]] cells upon their chemotactic responsiveness to selector ligands.

This article provides introductory information about the RGB, HSV, and HSL color models from a computer graphics (Web page, image) perspective. An introduction to colors is also provided to support the main discussion.

==Basics of color==
[[Image:Simple RGB color wheel.png|right|A simple color wheel based on the additive colors.]]

===Primary colors and hue===
{{further|Color perception|Additive color|Hue}}

First, "color" refers to the human brain's subjective interpretation of combinations of a narrow band of wavelengths of light. For this reason, the definition of "color" is not based on a strict set of physical phenomena. Therefore, even basic concepts like "primary colors" are not clearly defined. For example, traditional "Painter's Colors" use red, blue, and yellow as the primary colors, "Printer's Colors" use cyan, yellow, and magenta, and "Light Colors" use red, green, and blue.&lt;ref name=ArtDesignVisualThinking&gt;{{cite web|last=Jirousek|first=Charlotte|title=Color, Value, and Hue|url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/color/color.htm|work=Art, Design, and Visual Thinking|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Light colors", more formally known as additive colors, are formed by combining red, green, and blue light. This article refers to additive colors and refers to red, green, and blue as the primary colors.

Hue is a term describing a pure color, that is, a color not modified by tinting or shading (see below). In additive colors, hues are formed by combining two primary colors. When two primary colors are combined in equal intensities, the result is a "secondary color".

===Color wheel===
{{main|Color wheel}}

A color wheel is a tool that provides a visual representation of the relationships between all possible hues. The primary colors are arranged around a circle at equal (120 degree) intervals. (Warning: Color wheels frequently depict "Painter's Colors" primary colors, which leads to a different set of hues than additive colors.) The illustration shows a simple color wheel based on the additive colors. Note that the position (top, right) of the starting color, typically red, is arbitrary, as is the order of green and blue (clockwise, counter-clockwise). The illustration also shows the secondary colors, yellow, cyan, and magenta, located halfway between (60 degrees) the primary colors.

==Complementary color==
{{main|Complementary color}}

The complement of a hue is the hue that is opposite it (180 degrees) on the color wheel. Using additive colors, mixing a hue and its complement in equal amounts produces white.

===Tints and shades===
{{main|Tints and shades}}

The following discussion uses an illustration involving three projectors pointing to the same spot on a screen. Each projector is capable of generating one hue. The "intensities" of each projector are "matched" and can be equally adjusted from zero to full. (Note: "Intensity" is used here in the same sense as the RGB color model. The subject of matching, or "[[gamma correction]]", is beyond the level of this article.)

A ''shade'' is produced by "dimming" a hue. Painters refer to this as "adding black". In our illustration, one projector is set to full intensity, a second is set to some intensity between zero and full, and third is set to zero. "Dimming" is accomplished by decreasing each projector's intensity setting to the same fraction of its start setting.

In the shade example, with any fully shaded hue, that all three projectors are set to zero intensity, resulting in black.

A ''tint'' is produced by "lightening" a hue. Painters refer to this as "adding white". In our illustration, one projector is set to full intensity, a second is set to some intensity between zero and full, and third is set to zero. "Lightening" is accomplished by increasing each projector's intensity setting by the same fraction from its start setting to full.

In the tinting example, note that the third projector is now contributing. When the hue is fully lightened, all three projectors are each at full intensity, and the result is white.

Note an attribute of the total intensity in the additive model. If full intensity for one projector is 1, then a primary color has a combined intensity of 1. A secondary color has a total intensity of 2. White has a total intensity of 3. Tinting, or "adding white", increases the total intensity of the hue. While this is simply a fact, the HSL model will take this fact into account in its design.

===Tones===
{{further|Colorfulness}}

''Tone'' is a general term, typically used by painters, to refer to the effects of reducing the "colorfulness" of a hue.;&lt;ref name=ArtDesignVisualThinking /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boddy-Evans|first=Marion|title=Painting Color Class: Tones or Values|url=http://painting.about.com/od/colourtheory/ss/ColorClassTones.htm|work=About.Com Guide|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; painters refer to it as "adding gray". Note that gray is not a color or even a single concept but refers to all the range of values between black and white where all three primary colors are equally represented. The general term is provided as more specific terms have conflicting definitions in different color models. Thus, shading takes a hue toward black, tinting takes a hue towards white, and tones cover the range between.

==Choosing a color model==
No one color model is necessarily "better" than another. Typically, the choice of a color model is dictated by external factors, such as a graphics tool or the need to specify colors according to the CSS2 or CSS3 standard. The following discussion only describes how the models function, centered on the concepts of hue, shade, tint, and tone.

===RGB===
{{main|RGB color model}}

The RGB model's approach to colors is important because:
* It directly reflects the physical properties of "[[Color depth#Truecolor|Truecolor]]" displays
* As of 2011, most graphic cards define pixel values in terms of the colors red, green, and blue. The typical range of intensity values for each color, 0–255,  is based on taking a binary number with 32 bits and breaking it up into four bytes of 8 bits each. 8 bits can hold a value from 0 to 255. The fourth byte is used to specify the "[[Alpha compositing|alpha]]", or the opacity, of the color. Opacity comes into play when layers with different colors are stacked. If the color in the top layer is less than fully opaque (alpha &lt; 255), the color from underlying layers "shows through".

In the RGB model, hues are represented by specifying one color as full intensity (255), a second color with a variable intensity, and the third color with no intensity (0).

The following provides some examples using red as the full-intensity and green as the partial-intensity colors; blue is always zero:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Red !! Green !! Result
|-
| 255 || 0 ||&lt;span style="background: #ff0000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;red (255, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| 255 || 128 ||&lt;span style="background: #ff8000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;orange (255, 128, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| 255 || 255 ||&lt;span style="background: #ffff00;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;yellow (255, 255, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|}

Shades are created by multiplying the intensity of each primary color by 1 minus the shade factor, in the range 0 to 1. A shade factor of 0 does nothing to the hue, a shade factor of 1 produces black:
:new intensity = current intensity * (1 – shade factor)

The following provides examples using orange:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 0 !! .25 !! .5 !! .75 !! 1.0
|-
|&lt;span style="background: #ff8000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 128, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #C06000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(192, 96, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #804000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(128, 64, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #402000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(64, 32, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #000000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|}

Tints are created by modifying each primary color as follows: the intensity is increased so that the ''difference'' between the intensity and full intensity (255) is ''decreased'' by the tint factor, in the range 0 to 1. A tint factor of 0 does nothing, a tint factor of 1 produces white: &lt;br /&gt;
:new intensity = current intensity + (255 – current intensity) * tint factor

The following provides examples using orange:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 0 !! .25 !! .5 !! .75 !! 1.0
|-
|&lt;span style="background: #ff8000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 128, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #ffa040;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 160, 64)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #ffc080;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 192, 128)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #ffe0c0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 224, 192)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #ffffff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 255, 255)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|}

Tones are created by applying both a shade and a tint. The order in which the two operations are performed does not matter, with the following restriction: when a tint operation is performed on a shade, the intensity of the dominant color becomes the "full intensity"; that is, the intensity value of the dominant color must be used in place of 255.

The following provides examples using orange:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! 0 !! .25 !! .5 !! .75 !! 1.0
|-
! 0
|&lt;span style="background: #ff8000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 128, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #C06000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(192, 96, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #804000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(128, 64, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #402000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(64, 32, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #000000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
! .25
|&lt;span style="background: #ffa040;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 160, 64)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #c07830;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(192, 120, 48)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #805020; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(128, 80, 32)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #402810; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(64, 40, 16)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #000000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
! .5
|&lt;span style="background: #ffc080;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 192, 128)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #C09060;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(192, 144, 96)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #806040; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(128, 96, 64)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #403020; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(64, 48, 32)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #000000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
! .75
|&lt;span style="background: #ffe0c0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 240, 192)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #c0a890;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(192, 168, 144)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;

===HSV===
{{main|HSL and HSV}}

The HSV, or HSB, model describes colors in terms of hue, saturation, and value (brightness). Note that the range of values for each attribute is arbitrarily defined by various tools or standards. Be sure to determine the value ranges before attempting to interpret a value.

Hue corresponds directly to the concept of hue in the Color Basics section. The advantages of using hue are
*The angular relationship between tones around the color circle is easily identified
*Shades, tints, and tones can be generated easily without affecting the hue

Saturation corresponds directly to the concept of tint in the Color Basics section, except that full saturation produces no tint, while zero saturation produces white, a shade of gray, or black.

Value corresponds directly to the concept of intensity in the Color Basics section.
*Pure colors are produced by specifying a hue with full saturation and value
*Shades are produced by specifying a hue with full saturation and less than full value
*Tints are produced by specifying a hue with less than full saturation and full value
*Tones are produced by specifying a hue and both less than full saturation and value
*White is produced by specifying zero saturation and full value, regardless of hue
*Black is produced by specifying zero value, regardless of hue or saturation
*Shades of gray are produced by specifying zero saturation and between zero and full value
The advantage of HSV is that each of its attributes corresponds directly to the basic color concepts, which makes it conceptually simple. The perceived disadvantage of HSV is that the saturation attribute corresponds to tinting, so desaturated colors have increasing total intensity. For this reason, the CSS3 standard plans to support RGB and HSL but not HSV.&lt;ref name="CSS3 HSL"&gt;{{cite web|last=W3C|title=4.2.4. HSL color values|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#foreground|work=CSS Color Module Level 3|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HSL===
{{main|HSL and HSV}}

The HSL model describes colors in terms of hue, saturation, and lightness (also called luminance). (Note: the definition of saturation in HSL is substantially different from HSV, and lightness is not intensity.) The model has two prominent properties:
*The transition from black to a hue to white is symmetric and is controlled solely by increasing lightness
*Decreasing saturation transitions to a shade of gray dependent on the lightness, thus keeping the overall intensity relatively constant
The properties mentioned above have led to the wide use of HSL, in particular, in the CSS3 color model.&lt;ref name="CSS3 HSL"/&gt;

As in HSV, hue corresponds directly to the concept of hue in the Color Basics section. The advantages of using hue are
*The angular relationship between tones around the color circle is easily identified
*Shades, tints, and tones can be generated easily without affecting the hue

Lightness combines the concepts of shading and tinting from the Color Basics section. Assuming full saturation, lightness is neutral at the midpoint value, for example 50%, and the hue displays unaltered. As lightness decreases below the midpoint, it has the effect of shading. Zero lightness produces black. As the value increases above 50%, it has the effect of tinting, and full lightness produces white.

At zero saturation, lightness controls the resulting shade of gray. A value of zero still produces black, and full lightness still produces white. The midpoint value results in the "middle" shade of gray, with an RGB value of (128,128,128).

Saturation, or the lack of it, produces tones of the reference hue that converge on the zero-saturation shade of gray, which is determined by the lightness. The following examples uses the hues red, orange, and yellow at midpoint lightness with decreasing saturation. The resulting RGB value and the total intensity is shown.

Note that the physical nature of additive color prevents the scheme from working exactly except for hues halfway between the primary and secondary colors. However, the total intensity of the tones resulting from decreasing saturation are much closer than tinting alone, as in HSV.

The [[harpsichord]] was largely obsolete, and seldom played, during a period lasting from the late 18th century to the early 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ukpianos.co.uk/harpsichord-history.html | title=Harpsichord History | accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument was successfully revived during the 20th century, first in an [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]] form strongly influenced by the piano, then with historically more faithful instruments. The revival was the joint work of performers, builders, and composers who wrote new harpsichord pieces. However the harpsichord never completely disappeared from the public eye as it was used through the mid-19th century for basso continuendo because despite its low volume, it had considerable power to "cut through" the orchestra. The earliest revival efforts began in the mid-19th century due to its increasingly infrequent usage and there was concern that the instrument could become a forgotten relic of the past.

==Instruments==
[[File:Clavecin 1979.JPG|thumb|300px|A heavy-framed mid-century harpsichord by the Sperrhake firm. Such instruments were harshly criticized during the 1960s by [[Wolfgang Zuckermann|Zuckermann]], who described their sound as feeble and their appearance as tubby, a betrayal of the tradition of beauty seen in historical instruments.]]
[[File:Deless-10.jpg|thumb|300px|Harpsichords played today tend to follow closely the building practices established in the historical period. This modern instrument was built by Jean-Paul Rouaud based on a historical instrument made in 1707 by Nicolas Dumont.]]
In the earlier stages, 20th-century harpsichords were heavily influenced by the technology of the modern piano, and usually included metal framing (which was entirely absent in historical instruments). It was felt that such construction would increase the stability of tuning. Since heavy framing tends to stifle harpsichord sound, instruments were bolstered by other means, notably the addition of a [[Eight foot pitch|16']] stop (an additional set of strings that played an octave below normal pitch); such stops were somewhat unusual in the historical period but became widespread in the first half of the 20th century. An example was the harpsichord produced by [[Pleyel et Cie]] at the request of Landowska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harpsichord.org.uk/EH/Vol2/No5/pleyel.pdf | title=The Pleyel Harpsichord | last=Richard | first=J.A. | publisher=The British Harpsichord Society | year=1979 | accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the mid-20th century, instruments were introduced whose construction followed historical principles, with thinner cases, historical dispositions (arrangements of choirs of strings) and no metal framing. Among the leaders of this shift were [[Frank Hubbard]], [[William Dowd]], and [[Martin Skowroneck]]. With time, such instruments came to dominate the scene, and the older heavy-frame instruments are almost never manufactured today. They retain historical value, however, since they were the instruments that early to mid-20th-century composers had in mind when they wrote their works.&lt;ref&gt;Thus the [[Neupert]] firm still offers its mid-century "Bach" model for sale, defending it explicitly on the grounds of its suitability for 20th-century music ([http://www.jc-neupert.de/en/node/48]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition of harpsichord building toward historicist principles is covered in detail by Hubbard (1965), Zuckermann (1969), and Kottick (2003), cited below.

==Music written for the contemporary harpsichord==

===Classical music===
In the 20th century, classical composers returned to the harpsichord as they sought out variation in the sounds available to them. Under the influence of [[Arnold Dolmetsch]], the [[harpsichordist]]s [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]] (1872–1951) and in France, [[Wanda Landowska]] (1879–1959), were at the forefront of the instrument's renaissance.

[[Harpsichord concerto|Concertos]] for the instrument were written by [[Francis Poulenc]] (the ''[[Concert champêtre]]'', 1927–28), [[Manuel de Falla]], [[Walter Leigh]], [[Bertold Hummel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bertoldhummel.de/english/register/register.html Bertold Hummel list of works]: Op. 15 is his ''Divertimento capriccioso'' for harpsichord and chamber orchestra.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henryk Mikołaj Górecki]], [[Michael Nyman]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[Viktor Kalabis]]. [[Bohuslav Martinů]] wrote both a [[concerto]] and a [[sonata (music)|sonata]] for the instrument, and [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Double Concerto'' is scored for harpsichord, piano and two chamber [[orchestra]]s. The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] composer [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] also wrote a harpsichord concerto for chamber ensemble (1951), and the instrument featured in one of his most famous works, ''[[Petite Symphonie Concertante]]''. 

In chamber music, [[György Ligeti]] wrote a small number of solo works for the instrument (including ''[[Continuum (Ligeti)|Continuum]]''), and [[Henri Dutilleux]]'s ''Les Citations'' (1991) is scored for harpsichord, oboe, double bass and percussions. [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and Harpsichord'' (1952) and his ''Double Concerto For Piano, Harpsichord, and Two Chamber Orchestras'' (1961) explore the timbre possibilities of the modern harpsichord.

[[Iannis Xenakis]] is also one of the composers who have written for harpsichord, with works like ''A l'lle de Gorée'' for amplified harpsichord and chamber orchestra, ''Komboi'' and ''Oophaa'' for harpsichord (again amplified) and percussion, and the two solo works ''Khoai'' and ''Naama''.

[[Josef Tal]] wrote ''Concerto for harpsichord &amp; electronic music'' (1964), ''Three Compositions for recorder &amp; harpsichord'' (1966) and ''Chamber Music'' (1982) for s-recorder, marimba &amp; harpsichord. Both [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (''Hamlet'', 1964) and [[Alfred Schnittke]] (''Symphony No.8'', 1994) wrote works that use the harpsichord as part of the orchestral texture. [[John Cage]] and [[Lejaren Hiller]] wrote ''[[HPSCHD]]'' (1969) for 1-7 harpsichords and 1-51 computer-generated tapes. [[John Zorn]] has also used harpsichord in works like ''Rituals'' (1998), ''Contes de Fées'' (1999), and ''La Machine de l'Etre'' (2000).

In the Preface to his piano collection ''[[Mikrokosmos (Bartók)|Mikrokosmos]]'', [[Béla Bartók]] suggests some ten pieces as being suitable for the harpsichord.

American composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] composed a number of sonatas for the harpsichord. 

[[Benjamin Britten]] included harpsichord parts in his opera ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and his [[cantata]] ''[[Phaedra (cantata)|Phaedra]]''.

Harpsichordist [[Hendrik Bouman]] has composed pieces in the 17th- and 18th-century style, including works for solo harpsichord, harpsichord concerti, and other works that call for harpsichord continuo. Other contemporary composers writing new harpsichord music in period styles include [[Grant Colburn]], and [[Fernando De Luca]]. Notable performers include [[Oscar Milani]] and [[Mario Raskin]].

Works for harpsichord in the 21st century include Northern Irish composer Alan Mills's ''Two Cubist Inventions'' (2000 / 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Two Cubist Inventions (no date) Available at: http://www.musichaven.co.uk/Two-Cubist-Inventions.html (Accessed: 13 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and French composer Karol Beffa's ''Suite'' (2008), ''Sarabande et Doubles'' (2015) and 'Destroy'' (2007) for harpsichord and string quartet.

===Folk music===
[[Seán Ó Riada]] used the harpsichord both for the soundtracks of film music, and for interpretations of the Irish harper [[Turlough O'Carolan]] during Riada's work with the band [[Ceoltori Cualann]] (later to become [[The Chieftains]]). Riada used harpsichord for the latter with the justification that the harpsichord best replicated the sound of the metal strings of the early [[Irish harp]].&lt;ref name="CooperDawe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Cooper|author2=Kevin Dawe|title=The Mediterranean in Music: Critical Perspectives, Common Concerns, Cultural Differences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di1KQc6-HCwC&amp;pg=PA220|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5407-9|pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Love2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Mason Love|title=The Film Music of Sean O Riada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zq2J4F7cAXIC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2009|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-1-109-20305-9|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music===
The revival of the harpsichord spilled over into [[popular music]]. Its first appearance in [[jazz music]] happened around 1940, when pianist [[Johnny Guarnieri]] was asked to play a harpsichord in [[Artie Shaw]]'s [[quintet]] "[[Gramercy Five]]".&lt;ref name="berindei"&gt;Berindei, Mihai (1976). ''Jazz Dictionary'', Scientific and Encyclopedic Publishing House, Bucharest, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The band recorded eight albums between 1940 and 1945, which were reissued in 1990 (''The Complete Gramercy Sessions'').

In the 1960s and 1970s, the harpsichord was used by groups including [[The Beatles]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Monkees]], [[The Partridge Family]], [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]], and [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]]. A great number of other artists since then have used harpsichord in their work such as [[Jens Johansson]] from [[Stratovarius]].

The harpsichord also appeared in film and on television.  For example, it appeared on the television show ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', played by [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]]. It appeared in the 1960s [[Miss Marple]] films featuring [[Margaret Rutherford]] and the cult show ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

[[Boys for Pele]], the third album of American singer-songwriter [[Tori Amos]], is notable for featuring the harpsichord as the main instrument on several songs, including the lead single [[Caught a Lite Sneeze|Caught A Lite Sneeze]].

==Career==

=== Philosophy ===

Derrick Jensen is primarily an advocate for indigenous peoples and wild nature, and an opponent of civilization, rejecting the notion that it can ever be an ethical or sustainable model for human society. He describes the linguistically and historically defensible definition of ''[[civilization]]''&lt;ref name="lecture"&gt;{{cite speech|publisher=YouTube|year=2011|title=Derrick Jensen - Endgame|time=4:57 to 6:52|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9os1GFuWJ0#t=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as "a culture&amp;nbsp;— that is, a complex of stories, institutions, and artifacts&amp;nbsp;— that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities (''civilization'', see ''civil'': from ''civis'', meaning ''citizen'', from Latin ''civitatis'', meaning ''state'' or ''city''),"&lt;ref name="Endgame17"&gt;Jensen, Derrick. (2006). ''Endgame, Volume 1: The Problem of Civilization'', Seven Stories Press ({{ISBN|1-58322-730-X}}), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and the definition of ''city'' as a group of "people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life."&lt;ref name="Endgame17"/&gt; He explains that, by such definitions, civilizations and cities are both unsustainable:

{{quote|Two things happen as soon as you require the importation of resources.

An outspoken critic of [[human supremacy]], Jensen advocates non-[[anthropocentrism]], or [[ecocentrism]], according to which humans should first of all actively support the flourishing of entire [[ecosystem|natural communities]] and their many individual species, rather than the flourishing of humans alone; and second, that they should extend the status of [[personhood]] to all organisms and ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Earth at Risk: Building a Resistance Movement to Save the Planet|first=Derrick|last=Jensen|page=132|publisher=PM Press|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1Oa8cBLN1IC&amp;q=%22people+are+we%22e}}&lt;/ref&gt; including non-human animals and plants. For example, in an article on [[water management]], he refers to "both human people and fish people".&lt;ref name = "showers"/&gt; His view, which moves central moral focus away from civilized humans, also names and castigates some of the values most championed by modern civilization, including technological advancement, economic growth, the [[inevitability of progress]], and [[sustainable development|sustainability as seen through the lens of "development"]]. Jensen advocates a way of life that is harmonious in a truly ecological sense, and is thus lastingly sustainable, such as the diverse ways of life historically exhibited by many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and other indigenous, non-civilized cultures. He also claims that "the fundamental difference between Western and indigenous ways of being is that even the most open-minded Westerners generally perceive listening to the natural world as a metaphor, as opposed to the way the world really is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Derrick Jensen Reader: Writings on Environmental Revolution|year=2012|editor=Lierre Keith|publisher=Seven Stories Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LGL8PCVc_pcC&amp;pg=PT9&amp;dq=0AjcUp3NBK3lsASCloGgBg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=%22westerners%20generally%20perceive%20listening%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; While indigenous peoples understand the world as consisting of other beings with whom we can enter into relationship, he argues that Westerners believe the world consists merely of objects or resources to be exploited or used.

Jensen argues that dysfunctional and antisocial behaviors pervade civilization. His analysis views macrocosmic abuses through the microcosmic lens of domestic abuse and violence, noting the connection between abusive personal relationships and the oppressive, expansionist culture as a whole. The psychopathology of modern civilization's global, industrial economy obliterates healthy personal relationships as well as the [[natural environment]], and [[indigenous people|indigenous ways of life]]. Accordingly, he exhorts readers and audiences to help bring an end to [[industrial civilization]], promoting its dismantling by any means necessary,&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9os1GFuWJ0&lt;/ref&gt; thus challenging [[pacifism]], since he believes that [[violence]] may be justified at times, particularly as a form of [[self-defense]] or resistance against oppression. In ''A Language Older Than Words'' and also in an article entitled "Actions Speak Louder Than Words", Jensen states "Every morning when I awake I ask myself whether I should write or blow up a dam. I tell myself I should keep writing, though I'm not sure that's right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|title=Actions Speak Louder Than Words|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/derrick-jensen-actions-speak-louder-than-words}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the potential for success of the crushed [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] (when compared to the inevitable annihilation of Warsaw's non-rebelling Jews) and his being attacked by various mother animals in perceived defense of their babies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacifism as Pathology|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/derrick-jensen-pacifism-as-pathology-introduction|publisher=The Anarchist Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen supports the violence used by oppressed people and wild creatures in their own defense as a viable strategy against even their most powerful enemies. Jensen has clarified, however, that "I get accused of being the 'violence guy' ... but I don't ever think that's really fair, because I really consider myself the 'everything guy', that I want to put everything on the table and talk about all forms of resistance ... We can certainly parse out cases where we think it's appropriate to have militant response or non-militant response."&lt;ref name="dominant culture killing"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]]|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|date=26 November 2010|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/26/author_and_activist_derrick_jensen|title=Author and Activist Derrick Jensen: "The Dominant Culture is Killing the Planet ...

Jensen also considers himself an [[anti-capitalist]], a critic of [[organized religion]] ([[Criticism of Buddhism|including Buddhism]]), a [[Criticism of science|critic of science]], an [[anti-racist]], and a [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]], and seems to agree with those critics who have called him an "anti-civilizationist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/10/18/greetings-from-echo-park/ An Open Letter to Jann Wenner: Greetings from Echo Park]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been called [[anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivistic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Integral ecology: uniting multiple perspectives on the natural world |author1=Sean Esbjörn-Hargens |author2=Michael E.

He prefers to be called "[[indigenism|indigenist]]" or an "ally to the indigenous," because "indigenous peoples have had the only sustainable human social organizations, and... we need to recognize that we [colonizers] are all living on stolen land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zoeblunt.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/uncivilized/ |title=Uncivilized |first=Zoe |last=Blunt |work=[[Canadian Dimension]] |year=2011 |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the question of [[human overpopulation]], Jensen concedes that it is a social and environmental problem, but only at a "tertiary" level, and that [[overconsumption]]&amp;mdash;along with [[civilization]] and its ruthless, expansionist cultural mindset&amp;mdash;is the primary problem faced by the world.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Recurrent topics in his books and talks include critiques of cosmeticism (as e.g. [[William R.

=== Writings ===

''A Language Older Than Words'' uses the lens of [[domestic violence]] to look at the larger violence of [[western culture]]. ''The Culture of Make Believe'' begins by exploring [[racism]] and [[misogyny]] and moves to examine how this culture's economic system leads inevitably to hatred and atrocity. ''Strangely Like War'' is about [[deforestation]]. ''Walking on Water'' is about [[education]] (It begins: "As is true for most people I know, I've always loved learning. As is also true for most people I know, I always hated school. Why is that?").&lt;ref&gt;''Walking on Water'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Welcome to the Machine'' is about [[surveillance]], and more broadly about science and what he perceives to be a Western obsession with control.

''Endgame'' is interspersed with what he describes as the inherent [[wikt:unsustainability|unsustainability]] of civilization. In this book he asks: "Do you believe that this culture will undergo a voluntary transformation to a sane and sustainable way of living?" Nearly everyone he talks to says no. His next question is: "How would this understanding&amp;nbsp;— that this culture will not voluntarily stop destroying the natural world, eliminating indigenous cultures, exploiting the poor, and killing those who resist&amp;nbsp;— shift our strategy and tactics? The answer? Nobody knows, because we never talk about it: we're too busy pretending the culture will undergo a magical transformation." ''Endgame'', he says, is "about that shift in strategy, and in tactics."&lt;ref&gt;''Endgame'' V.1, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Jensen's writing uses the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[anecdotal evidence|personal experiences]] to construct arguments. His books are written like narratives, lacking a linear, hierarchical structure. They are not divided into distinct sections devoted to an individual argument. Instead, his writing is conversational, leaving one line of thought incomplete to move on to another, returning to the first again at some later point. Jensen uses this [[creative non-fiction]] style to combine his artistic voice with logical argument. Jensen often uses quotations as reference points for ideas explored in a chapter. (For example, he introduces the first chapter of ''Walking on Water'' with a quote from [[Jules Henry]]'s book ''[[Culture Against Man]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;Jensen D., 2004, ''Walking on Water: Reading, Writing, and Revolution'', Chelsea Green ({{ISBN|1-931498-48-2}}), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Jensen wrote ''Thought to Exist in the Wild'' (with photographs by Karen Tweedy-Holmes), which discussed the keeping of animals in zoos on both a physical and philosophical level. The book won the 2008 grand prize for the [[Eric Hoffer Award]] for Books.

Jensen wrote and [[Stephanie McMillan]] illustrated the [[graphic novel]]s ''As the World Burns'' (2007) and ''Mischief in the Forest'' (2010).

''Resistance Against Empire'' consists of interviews with J. W. Smith (on poverty), [[Kevin Bales]] (on slavery), Anuradha Mittal (on hunger), [[Juliet Schor]] ('globalization' and environmental degradation), [[Ramsey Clark]] (on US 'defense'), Stephen Schwartz (editor of ''The Nonproliferation Review'', on nukes), [[Alfred W. McCoy|Alfred McCoy]] (politics and heroin), [[Christian Parenti]] (the US prison system), [[Katherine Albrecht]] (on RFID), and [[Robert W. McChesney|Robert McChesney]] (on (freedom of) the media) conducted between 1999 and 2004.

Jensen co-wrote the book ''Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet'' with [[Lierre Keith]] and Aric McBay. Jensen's contribution consists of end-of-chapter responses to common queries he gets regarding bringing down civilization. The bulk of the book is written by the other two authors and covers the history of effective militant resistance movements such as parts of the U.S. civil rights movement and the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ([[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta|MEND]]), while also outlining potential strategies for above- and below-ground resistance to civilization, termed Decisive Ecological Warfare.

After the publication of this book, the authors co-founded an organization by the same name.  Aric McBay left the organization at the beginning of 2012, however, attributing his departure to the alleged cancellation of a transgender-inclusive policy by Derrick Jensen and Lierre Keith.&lt;ref&gt;Aric McBay, [http://www.aricmcbay.org/2013/05/14/dgr-and-transphobia/ "DGR and Transphobia"], May 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Green Resistance has disputed this account, saying that the decision to restrict women's spaces was made by the women of DGR, and not by Derrick Jensen or Lierre Keith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/reponse-to-aric-mcbay/ |title=Reponse(sic) to Aric McBay |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Jensen also published ''Dreams'', which draws on the mythologies of ancient cultures and the wisdom of contemporary thinkers like [[Jack Forbes]], [[Waziyatawin]] (a Dakota activist), [[Paul Stamets]], and [[Stanley Aronowitz]] and is Jensen's challenge to the view that there is no knowledge outside that gained by science, and ''Truths Among Us'', a thought-provoking collection of interviews with 10 leading writers, philosophers, teachers, and activists who argue against society's belief that corporations and governments know what is best for the future.

Jensen convened the conferences "Earth at Risk", which were held in November 2010 and 2011 in San Francisco and Berkeley, CA, respectively, with presentations by D.J., [[Arundhati Roy]], [[William R. Catton, Jr.|William Catton]], Rikki Ott, Thomas Linzey, [[Gail Dines]], Jane Caputi, Waziyatawin, Aric McBay, [[Minimum Security|Stephanie McMillan]], Lierre Keith, and [[Flashpoints (radio program)|Nora Barrows-Friedman]], which were also published on DVD and as a book.

Jensen has written three novels: ''Lives Less Valuable''; ''Songs of the Dead''; and ''The Knitting Circle Rapist Annihilation Squad''.

===Criticism===
Derrick Jensen's views are broadly controversial. The radical magazine ''[[CounterPunch]]'', in addition to publishing interviews with and articles written by Jensen, has also published commentaries by others who are critical of the potential for Jensen's philosophy to lead followers towards [[nihilism]] due to his "apocalyptic" warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2007/09/11/specters-of-malthus-scarcity-poverty-apocalypse/ |last=Boal|first=Ian|interviewer=David Martinez|year=2007|title=Specters of Malthus: Scarcity, Poverty, Apocalypse |website=Counterpunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/02/08/apocalypse-and-the-left/ |first=Osha|last=Neumann|year=2013|publisher=CounterPunch|title=Apocalypse and the Left |website=Counterpunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization [[Deep Green Resistance]] (DGR), of which Jensen is a founding member, has been accused of [[transphobia]] in relation to its [[radical feminism|radical feminist]] advocacy.&lt;ref name="Jolie's Choice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/06/03/jolies-choice/|year=2013|last=Donnelly|first=Michael|title=Jolie's Choice|website=Counterpunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Be|last=Scofield|url=http://www.decolonizingyoga.com/how-derrick-jensens-deep-green-resistance-supports-transphobia/|title=How Derrick Jensen's Deep Green Resistance Supports Transphobia|publisher=Decolonizing Yoga|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DGR has denied this, stating that it merely has "a difference of opinion about the definition of gender" with [[Transgender activism|transgender activists]]. According to DGR's radical feminism, gender refers to a patriarchal caste system rather than a subjective set of feelings about sexual identity.&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/protect-women-feminism-and-free-speech/ |title=Protect Women, Feminism, and Free Speech  |year=2013 |website=Deep Green Resistance|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members claim to be "critical of gender itself. We are not gender reformists—we are gender abolitionists."&lt;ref name=radfem&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/faq-radical-feminism/ |title=FAQ: Radical Feminism |year=2013 |website=Deep Green Resistance|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earth First!]], another radical environmental organization, has dissociated itself from and criticized Jensen and DGR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/articles/deep-green-resistance-a-critique|title=Deep Green Resistance — a critique|first1=Michelle|last1=Matisons|first2=Alexander Reid|last2=Ross|publisher=[[Earth First!]] Journal|year=2014–2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803103416/http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/articles/deep-green-resistance-a-critique/|archivedate=2014-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishing an online article claiming that leaked private emails reveal Jensen's animosity towards trans people and anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/2013/05/17/deep-green-transphobia-iii-derrick-jensens-hateful-tirade/ Deep Green Transphobia III: Derrick Jensen’s Hateful Tirade]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|group=note|In the alleged "leaked emails," Jensen comments that DGR members were assaulted and violently threatened by transgender anarchist activists at an anarchist event. In the emails, Jensen condemns the failure of anarchists to intervene to help the DGR members; generally calls anarchists liars; and says to a [[transwoman]] that "You are not a woman. You are a man who believes he is a woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dysophia.org.uk/a-short-letter-to-earth-first-and-anarchists-on-the-transphobia-and-anti%C2%AD-anarchist-positions-of-deep-green-resistance/|title=A Short Letter to Earth First! and Anarchists on the transphobia and anti-anarchist positions of Deep Green Resistance|publisher=Dysophia|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jensen has rarely commented publicly on transgender politics, though, in his 2006 book ''Endgame'', Jensen does briefly mention and even identify with transgender people, along with other [[Social exclusion|marginalized groups]], in a call for [[solidarity|political solidarity]].&lt;ref&gt;''Endgame'', V.2, p. 829: "We are the oppressed. We are prisoners, family farmers, animal liberators, women, children, American Indians, blacks, Mexicans, poor whites, Asians, people of the Third World, the indigenous. We are lesbians, homosexuals, transgendered."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ''[[CounterPunch]]'' published an article by Jensen in which he claims that trans activists criticize him primarily because he believes ([[cisgender]]) women should not be forced "to share their most intimate spaces with men ... I believe that women have the right to bathe, sleep, gather, and organize free from the presence of men," which these critics have regarded as offensive towards [[transgender women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/08/10/liberals-and-the-new-mccarthyism/|first=Derrick|last=Jensen|year=2015|publisher=CounterPunch|title=Liberals and the New McCarthyism|website=Counterpunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have defended Jensen's stance on gender, claiming that in challenging "trans activists on their assertions that ... their brain is 'female',"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/07/01/too-many-notes/ Gaslighting in the Age of ‘Misgendering']&lt;/ref&gt; he is correctly calling into question their problematically [[essentialist]] position that has centered an individual's self-perceived gender.

Jensen was featured in the documentaries ''[[What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire]]'' (2007), ''Blind Spot'' (2008),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285158/ Blind Spot @IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; ''First Earth: Uncompromising Ecological Architecture'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1380891/ First Earth @IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Call of Life'' (2010) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1002965/ Call of Life @IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''END:CIV'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830585/ END:CIV @IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Response surface metodology.jpg|thumb|Design of experiments with full [[factorial design]] (left), [[response surface]] with second-degree polynomial (right)]]

The '''design of experiments''' ('''DOE''', '''DOX''', or '''experimental design''') is the design of any task that aims to describe or explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation. The term is generally associated with [[experiments]] in which the design introduces conditions that directly affect the variation, but may also refer to the design of [[quasi-experiment]]s, in which [[naturalistic observation|natural]] conditions that influence the variation are selected for observation.

In its simplest form, an experiment aims at predicting the outcome by introducing a change of the preconditions, which is represented by one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables]], also referred to as "input variables" or "predictor variables." The change in one or more independent variables is generally hypothesized to result in a change in one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variables]], also referred to as "output variables" or "response variables." The experimental design may also identify [[controlling for a variable|control variables]] that must be held constant to prevent external factors from affecting the results. Experimental design involves not only the selection of suitable independent, dependent, and control variables, but planning the delivery of the experiment under statistically optimal conditions given the constraints of available resources.  There are multiple approaches for determining the set of design points (unique combinations of the settings of the independent variables) to be used in the experiment.

Main concerns in experimental design include the establishment of [[Validity (statistics)|validity]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[Reproducibility|replicability]]. For example, these concerns can be partially addressed by carefully choosing the independent variable, reducing the risk of measurement error, and ensuring that the documentation of the method is sufficiently detailed. Related concerns include achieving appropriate levels of [[statistical power]] and [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]].

Correctly designed experiments advance knowledge in the natural and social sciences and engineering. Other applications include marketing and policy making.

==History==

===Systematic clinical trials===
{{original research|section|date=September 2015}}
{{primary sources|section|date=September 2015}}
In 1747, while serving as surgeon on [[HMS Salisbury (1746)|HMS ''Salisbury'']], [[James Lind (physician)|James Lind]] carried out a systematic clinical trial to compare remedies for [[scurvy]].&lt;ref name="ADC1997"&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Dunn | first =Peter | title =James Lind (1716-94) of Edinburgh and the treatment of scurvy  | journal =Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition | volume =76 | issue = 1| pages =64–65 | publisher =British Medical Journal Publishing Group | location =United Kingdom |date = January 1997| url =http://fn.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/76/1/F64 | doi = 10.1136/fn.76.1.F64| pmc =1720613 | accessdate =2009-01-17 | pmid=9059193}}&lt;/ref&gt; This systematic clinical trial constitutes a type of DOE.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{dubious|date=September 2015}}

Lind selected 12 men from the ship, all suffering from scurvy. Lind limited his subjects to men who "were as similar as I could have them," that is, he provided strict entry requirements to reduce extraneous variation. He divided them into six pairs, giving each pair  different supplements to their basic diet for two weeks. The treatments were all remedies that had been proposed:
*   A quart of cider every day.
*   Twenty five gutts (drops) of [[vitriol]] (sulphuric acid) three times a day upon an empty stomach.
*   One half-pint of seawater every day.
*   A mixture of garlic, mustard, and horseradish in a lump the size of a nutmeg.
*   Two spoonfuls of vinegar three times a day.
*   Two oranges and one lemon every day.

The citrus treatment stopped after six days when they ran out of fruit, but by that time one sailor was fit for duty while the other had almost recovered. Apart from that, only group one (cider) showed some effect of its treatment.  The remainder of the crew presumably served as a control, but Lind did not report results from any control (untreated) group.

===Statistical experiments, following Charles S. Peirce===
{{Main|Frequentist statistics}}
{{See also|Randomization}}
A theory of statistical inference was developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] in "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" (1877–1878) and "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|A Theory of Probable Inference]]" (1883), two publications that emphasized the importance of randomization-based inference in statistics.

====Optimal designs for regression models====

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] also contributed the first English-language publication on an [[optimal design]] for [[Regression analysis|regression]] [[statistical model|models]] in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce, C.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pioneering [[optimal design]] for [[polynomial regression]] was suggested by [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne|Gergonne]] in 1815. In 1918, [[Kirstine Smith]] published optimal designs for polynomials of degree six (and less).

===Sequences of experiments===
{{Main|Sequential analysis}}
{{See also|Multi-armed bandit problem|Gittins index|Optimal design}}
The use of a sequence of experiments, where the design of each may depend on the results of previous experiments, including the possible decision to stop experimenting, is within the scope of [[Sequential analysis]], a field that was pioneered&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, N.L. (1961). "Sequential analysis: a survey." ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'', Series A. Vol. 124 (3), 372&amp;ndash;411. (pages 375&amp;ndash;376)&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Abraham Wald]] in the context of sequential tests of statistical hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, A. (1945) "Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses", [[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]], 16 (2), 117&amp;ndash;186.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Chernoff]] wrote an overview of optimal sequential designs,&lt;ref name="ref3"/&gt; while [[Minimisation (clinical trials)|adaptive designs]] have been surveyed by S. Zacks.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, S. (1996) "Adaptive Designs for Parametric Models". In: Ghosh, S. and Rao, C. R., (Eds) (1996). "Design and Analysis of Experiments," ''Handbook of Statistics'', Volume 13. North-Holland. {{ISBN|0-444-82061-2}}.  (pages 151&amp;ndash;180)&lt;/ref&gt; One specific type of sequential design is the "two-armed bandit", generalized to the [[multi-armed bandit]], on which early work was done by [[Herbert Robbins]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1952-09620-8 | last1 = Robbins | first1 = H. | year = 1952 | title = Some Aspects of the Sequential Design of Experiments | url = | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 58 | issue = 5| pages = 527–535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fisher's principles==

A methodology for designing experiments was proposed by [[Ronald Fisher]], in his innovative books: ''The Arrangement of Field Experiments'' (1926) and ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'' (1935).  Much of his pioneering work dealt with agricultural applications of statistical methods.  As a mundane example, he described how to test the [[lady tasting tea]] [[hypothesis]], that a certain lady could distinguish by flavour alone whether the milk or the tea was first placed in the cup. These methods have been broadly adapted in the physical and social sciences, are still used in [[agricultural engineering]] and differ from the design and analysis of [[computer experiment]]s.

;Comparison
:In some fields of study it is not possible to have independent measurements to a traceable [[Standard (metrology)|metrology standard]].  Comparisons between treatments are much more valuable and are usually preferable, and often compared against a [[scientific control]] or traditional treatment that acts as baseline.

;[[Randomization]]
:Random assignment is the process of assigning individuals at random to groups or to different groups in an experiment, so that each individual of the population has the same chance of becoming a participant in the study. The random assignment of individuals to groups (or conditions within a group) distinguishes a rigorous, "true" experiment from an observational study or "quasi-experiment".&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008), ''Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd edition)'', Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008, p. 300. {{ISBN|0-13-613550-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an extensive body of mathematical theory that explores the consequences of making the allocation of units to treatments by means of some random mechanism (such as tables of random numbers, or the use of randomization devices such as playing cards or dice). Assigning units to treatments at random tends to mitigate [[confounding]], which makes effects due to factors other than the treatment to appear to result from the treatment.

:The risks associated with random allocation (such as having a serious imbalance in a key characteristic between a treatment group and a control group) are calculable and hence can be managed down to an acceptable level by using enough experimental units. However, if the population is divided into several subpopulations that somehow differ, and the research requires each subpopulation to be equal in size, stratified sampling can be used. In that way, the units in each subpopulation are randomized, but not the whole sample. The results of an experiment can be generalized reliably from the experimental units to a larger [[statistical population]] of units only if the experimental units are a [[Sampling (statistics)|random sample]] from the larger population; the probable error of such an extrapolation depends on the sample size, among other things.

;[[Replication (statistics)|Statistical replication]]
:Measurements are usually subject to variation and [[measurement uncertainty]]; thus they are repeated and full experiments are replicated to help identify the sources of variation, to better estimate the true effects of treatments, to further strengthen the experiment's reliability and validity, and to add to the existing knowledge of the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dr. Hani|title=Replication study|url=http://www.experiment-resources.com/replication-study.html|accessdate=27 October 2011|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain conditions must be met before the replication of the experiment is commenced: the original research question has been published in a [[peer-review]]ed journal or widely cited, the researcher is independent of the original experiment, the researcher must first try to replicate the original findings using the original data, and the write-up should state that the study conducted is a replication study that tried to follow the original study as strictly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Burman|first=Leonard E.|title=A call for replication studies|url=http://pfr.sagepub.com|journal=[[Public Finance Review]] | volume=38 |accessdate=27 October 2011|author2=Robert W. Reed |author3=James Alm |pages=787–793|doi=10.1177/1091142110385210|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Blocking (statistics)|Blocking]]
:Blocking is the non-random arrangement of experimental units into groups (blocks/lots) consisting of units that are similar to one another. Blocking reduces known but irrelevant sources of variation between units and thus allows greater precision in the estimation of the source of variation under study.

;[[Orthogonality#Statistics.2C econometrics.2C and economics|Orthogonality]]
[[File:Factorial Design.svg|thumb|Example of orthogonal factorial design]]
:Orthogonality concerns the forms of comparison (contrasts) that can be legitimately and efficiently carried out. Contrasts can be represented by vectors and sets of orthogonal contrasts are uncorrelated and independently distributed if the data are normal. Because of this independence, each orthogonal treatment provides different information to the others. If there are ''T'' treatments and ''T'' – 1 orthogonal contrasts, all the information that can be captured from the experiment is obtainable from the set of contrasts.

;[[Factorial experiment]]s
:Use of factorial experiments instead of the one-factor-at-a-time method.  These are efficient at evaluating the effects and possible [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] of several factors (independent variables). Analysis of [[experiment]] design is built on the foundation of the [[analysis of variance]], a collection of models that partition the observed variance into components, according to what factors the experiment must estimate or test.

==Example==
[[File:Balance à tabac 1850.JPG|right|240px]]
This example is attributed to [[Harold Hotelling]].&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;[[Herman Chernoff]], ''Sequential Analysis and Optimal Design'', [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]] Monograph, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  It conveys some of the flavor of those aspects of the subject that involve combinatorial designs.

Weights of eight objects are measured using a [[pan balance]] and set of standard weights.  Each weighing measures the weight difference between objects in the left pan vs. any objects in the right pan by adding calibrated weights to the lighter pan until the balance is in equilibrium. Each measurement has a [[errors and residuals in statistics|random error]].  The average error is zero; the [[standard deviation]]s of the [[probability distribution]] of the errors is the same number σ on different weighings; errors on different weighings are [[statistical independence|independent]].  Denote the true weights by

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_1, \dots, \theta_8.\,&lt;/math&gt;

We consider two different experiments:

# Weigh each object in one pan, with the other pan empty.  Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the measured weight of the object, for ''i'' = 1, ..., 8.
# Do the eight weighings according to the following schedule and let ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the measured difference for ''i'' = 1, ..., 8:

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcc}
&amp; \text{left pan} &amp; \text{right pan} \\
\hline
\text{1st weighing:} &amp; 1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5\ 6\ 7\ 8 &amp; \text{(empty)} \\ 
\text{2nd:} &amp; 1\ 2\ 3\ 8\ &amp; 4\ 5\ 6\ 7 \\
\text{3rd:} &amp; 1\ 4\ 5\ 8\ &amp; 2\ 3\ 6\ 7 \\
\text{4th:} &amp; 1\ 6\ 7\ 8\ &amp; 2\ 3\ 4\ 5 \\
\text{5th:} &amp; 2\ 4\ 6\ 8\ &amp; 1\ 3\ 5\ 7 \\
\text{6th:} &amp; 2\ 5\ 7\ 8\ &amp; 1\ 3\ 4\ 6 \\
\text{7th:} &amp; 3\ 4\ 7\ 8\ &amp; 1\ 2\ 5\ 6 \\
\text{8th:} &amp; 3\ 5\ 6\ 8\ &amp; 1\ 2\ 4\ 7
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

: Then the estimated value of the weight ''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is

:: &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}_1 = \frac{Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + Y_4 - Y_5 - Y_6 - Y_7 - Y_8}{8}. &lt;/math&gt;

:Similar estimates can be found for the weights of the other items. For example

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\theta}_2 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 + Y_2 - Y_3 - Y_4 + Y_5 + Y_6 - Y_7 - Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_3 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 + Y_2 - Y_3 - Y_4 - Y_5 - Y_6 + Y_7 + Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_4 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 - Y_2 + Y_3 - Y_4 + Y_5 - Y_6 + Y_7 - Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_5 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 - Y_2 + Y_3 - Y_4 - Y_5 + Y_6 - Y_7 + Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_6 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 - Y_2 - Y_3 + Y_4 + Y_5 - Y_6 - Y_7 + Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_7 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 - Y_2 - Y_3 + Y_4 - Y_5 + Y_6 + Y_7 - Y_8} 8. \\[5pt]
\widehat{\theta}_8 &amp; = \frac{Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + Y_4 + Y_5 + Y_6 + Y_7 + Y_8} 8.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The question of design of experiments is: which experiment is better?

The variance of the estimate ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; if we use the first experiment.  But if we use the second experiment, the variance of the estimate given above is σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/8.  Thus the second experiment gives us 8 times as much precision for the estimate of a single item, and estimates all items simultaneously, with the same precision. What the second experiment achieves with eight would require 64 weighings if the items are weighed separately. However, note that the estimates for the items obtained in the second experiment have errors that correlate with each other.

Many problems of the design of experiments involve [[combinatorial design]]s, as in this example and others.&lt;ref name="yout_Howt"&gt;{{Cite web

==Avoiding false positives==
[[False positive]] conclusions, often resulting from the [[Publish or perish|pressure to publish]] or the author's own [[confirmation bias]], are an inherent hazard in many fields. A good way to prevent biases potentially leading to false positives in the data collection phase is to use a double-blind design. When a double-blind design is used, participants are randomly assigned to experimental groups but the researcher is unaware of what participants belong to which group. Therefore, the researcher can not affect the participants' response to the intervention.  
Experimental designs with undisclosed degrees of freedom are a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Simmons| first = Joseph|author2=Leif Nelson |author3=Uri Simonsohn | title = False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant| journal = Psychological Science| volume = 22| issue = 11| pages = 1359–1366| publisher = Association for Psychological Science| location = Washington DC| date = November 2011| url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359.full| issn = 0956-7976| doi = 10.1177/0956797611417632| accessdate = 29 January 2012| pmid = 22006061}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  This can lead to conscious or unconscious "[[p-hacking]]": trying multiple things until you get the desired result.  It typically involves the manipulation - perhaps unconsciously - of the process of [[statistical analysis]] and the degrees of freedom until they return a figure below the p&lt;.05 level of statistical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate=2014-06-12 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  So the design of the experiment should include a clear statement proposing the analyses to be undertaken. P-hacking can be prevented by preregistering researches, in which researchers have to send their data analysis plan to the journal they wish to publish their paper in before they even start their data collection, so no data manipulation is possible (https://osf.io). Another way to prevent this is taking the double-blind design to the data-analysis phase, where the data are sent to a data-analyst unrelated to the research who scrambles up the data so there is no way to know which participants belong to before they are potentially taken away as outliers.

Clear and complete documentation of the experimental methodology is also important in order to support replication of results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Discussion topics when setting up an experimental design==
An experimental design or randomized clinical trial requires careful consideration of several factors before actually doing the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Ader, Mellenberg &amp; Hand (2008) "Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion"&lt;/ref&gt; An experimental design is the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment. Some of the following topics  have already been discussed in the principles of experimental design section:

# How many factors does the design have, and are the levels of these factors fixed or random?
# Are control conditions needed, and what should they be?
# Manipulation checks; did the manipulation really work?
# What are the background variables?
# What is the sample size. How many units must be collected for the experiment to be generalisable and have enough [[Statistical power|power]]?
# What is the relevance of interactions between factors?
# What is the influence of delayed effects of substantive factors on outcomes?
# How do response shifts affect self-report measures?
# How feasible is repeated administration of the same measurement instruments to the same units at different occasions, with a post-test and follow-up tests?
# What about using a proxy pretest?
# Are there lurking variables?
# Should the client/patient, researcher or even the analyst of the data be blind to conditions?
# What is the feasibility of subsequent application of different conditions to the same units?
# How many of each control and noise factors should be taken into account?

The independent variable of a study often has many levels or different groups. In a true experiment, researchers can have an experimental group, which is where their intervention testing the hypothesis is implemented, and a control group, which has all the same element as the experimental group, without the interventional element. Thus, when everything else except for one intervention is held constant, researchers can certify with some certainty that this one element is what caused the observed change. In some instances, having a control group is not ethical. This is sometimes solved using two different experimental groups. In some cases, independent variables cannot be manipulated, for example when testing the difference between two groups who have a different disease, or testing the difference between genders (obviously variables that would be hard or unethical to assign participants to). In these cases, a quasi-experimental design may be used.

==Causal attributions==
In the pure experimental design, the independent (predictor) variable is manipulated by the researcher - that is - every participant of the research is chosen randomly from the population, and each participant chosen is assigned randomly to conditions of the independent variable. Only when this is done is it possible to certify with high probability that the reason for the differences in the outcome variables are caused by the different conditions. Therefore, researchers should choose the experimental design over other design types whenever possible. However, the nature of the independent variable does not always allow for manipulation. In those cases, researchers must be aware of not certifying about causal attribution when their design doesn't allow for it. For example, in observational designs, participants are not assigned randomly to conditions, and so if there are differences found in outcome variables between conditions, it is likely that there is something other than the differences between the conditions that causes the differences in outcomes, that is - a third variable. The same goes for studies with correlational design. (Adér &amp; Mellenbergh, 2008).

==Statistical control==
It is best that a process be in reasonable statistical control prior to conducting designed experiments.  When this is not possible, proper blocking, replication, and randomization allow for the careful conduct of designed experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Bisgaard, S (2008) "Must a Process be in Statistical Control before Conducting Designed Experiments?", ''Quality Engineering'', ASQ, 20 (2), pp 143 - 176&lt;/ref&gt;
To control for nuisance variables, researchers institute '''control checks''' as additional measures.  Investigators should ensure that uncontrolled influences (e.g., source credibility perception) do not skew the findings of the study.  A [[manipulation checks|manipulation check]] is one example of a control check.  Manipulation checks allow investigators to isolate the chief variables to strengthen support that these variables are operating as planned.

One of the most important requirements of experimental research designs is the necessity of eliminating the effects of [[spurious relationship|spurious]], intervening, and [[antecedent variable]]s. In the most basic model, cause (X) leads to effect (Y). But there could be a third variable (Z) that influences (Y), and X might not be the true cause at all. Z is said to be a spurious variable and must be controlled for. The same is true for [[intervening variable]]s (a variable in between the supposed cause (X) and the effect (Y)), and anteceding variables (a variable prior to the supposed cause (X) that is the true cause). When a third variable is involved and has not been controlled for, the relation is said to be a [[zero order (statistics)|zero order]] relationship. In most practical applications of experimental research designs there are several causes (X1, X2, X3). In most designs, only one of these causes is manipulated at a time.

==Experimental designs after Fisher==
Some efficient designs for estimating several main effects were found independently and in near succession by [[Raj Chandra Bose]] and K. Kishen in 1940 at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], but remained little known until the [[Plackett–Burman design]]s were published in ''[[Biometrika]]'' in 1946. About the same time, [[C. R. Rao]] introduced the concepts of [[orthogonal array]]s as experimental designs. This concept played a central role in the development of [[Taguchi methods]] by [[Genichi Taguchi]], which took place during his visit to Indian Statistical Institute in early 1950s. His methods were successfully applied and adopted by Japanese and Indian industries and subsequently were also embraced by US industry albeit with some reservations.

In 1950, [[Gertrude Mary Cox]] and [[William Gemmell Cochran]] published the book ''Experimental Designs,'' which became the major reference work on the design of experiments for statisticians for years afterwards.

Developments of the theory of [[linear model]]s have encompassed and surpassed the cases that concerned early writers. Today, the theory rests on advanced topics in [[linear algebra]], [[algebraic statistics|algebra]] and [[combinatorial design|combinatorics]].

As with other branches of statistics, experimental design is pursued using both [[frequentist statistics|frequentist]] and [[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian]] approaches: In evaluating statistical procedures like experimental designs, [[frequentist statistics]] studies the [[sampling distribution]] while [[Bayesian statistics]] updates a [[Bayesian probability|probability distribution]] on the parameter space.

Some important contributors to the field of experimental designs are [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]], [[R. A. Fisher]], [[Frank Yates|F. Yates]], [[C. R. Rao]], [[R. C. Bose]], [[Jagdish N. Srivastava|J. N. Srivastava]], [[Shrikhande S. S.]],  [[D. Raghavarao]], [[William G. Cochran|W. G. Cochran]], [[Oscar Kempthorne|O. Kempthorne]], W. T. Federer, V. V. Fedorov, A. S. Hedayat, [[John Nelder|J. A. Nelder]], [[Rosemary A. Bailey|R. A. Bailey]], [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|J. Kiefer]], W. J. Studden, A. Pázman, F. Pukelsheim, [[David R. Cox|D. R. Cox]], H. P. Wynn, A. C. Atkinson, [[G. E. P. Box]] and [[Genichi Taguchi|G. Taguchi]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  The textbooks of D. Montgomery, R. Myers, and G. Box/W. Hunter/J.S. Hunter have reached generations of students and practitioners.

==Human participant constraints==
Laws and ethical considerations preclude some carefully designed 
experiments with human subjects.  Legal constraints are dependent on 
[[Human subject research|jurisdiction]].  Constraints may involve 
[[institutional review board]]s, [[informed consent]] 
and [[confidentiality]] affecting both clinical (medical) trials and 
behavioral and social science experiments.&lt;ref&gt;

In the field of toxicology, for example, experimentation is performed 
on laboratory ''animals'' with the goal of defining safe exposure limits 
for ''humans''.&lt;ref&gt;

"... if no one knows which therapy is better, there is no ethical 
imperative to use one therapy or another." (p 380)  Regarding 
experimental design, "...it is clearly not ethical to place subjects 
at risk to collect data in a poorly designed study when this situation 
can be easily avoided...". (p 393)

'''Digital Media Academy''' (commonly referred to as "DMA") is a [[digital art]] and technology education company, located in [[Los Gatos]], CA, primarily offering art and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] [[summer camp]] programs for kids, age 6-18, at several universities in the US and Canada, including [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[New York University|NYU]], [[University of British Columbia|UBC]], [[University of Toronto|UoT]], among other prestigious ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/#locations Digital Media Academy Website - Locations]&lt;/ref&gt; DMA now also licenses curriculum and other STEM resources to schools internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/tools-for-educators/|title=Tools for Educators - Digital Media Academy|work=Digital Media Academy|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMA was officially incorporated in 2002,  but was incubated at [[Stanford University]] in the late 1990s as the Academy for New Media, a program of Stanford's Academic Computing department. The Academy for New Media was created at Stanford by [https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-gibson-247a966/ Phil Gibson] in 1999 as an outreach to K-12 educators and high-school students interested in learning the latest digital media software tools from award-winning creative professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/june20/newmedia-620.html Stanford Report], June 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  In Fall 2001, the Academy for New Media fell victim to University budget cuts and the program was transitioned away from Stanford to a private entity – and Digital Media Academy was born. The [[Stanford University]] Continuing Studies department offered CEU credit through Digital Media Academy from 2002-2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/adults/courses/certification-dma-credits.html Digital Media Academy Website - Certifications and Credits]&lt;/ref&gt;
Students may attend Digital Media Academy summer camps with the [[day camp]] or residential camp option.  These camps offer sports and recreation, while being known as a [[tech camp]] primarily.

'''DockNET''' is an intelligent control system for [[cargo]] handling developed by Portsystem in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsystem.com/it-system/|title=About: DockNET|accessdate=October 14, 2011|publisher=Portsystem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The control system was created for being able to analyze, communicate, supervise, direct, record and to document everything that happens in and around a loading door hole in a modern cargo terminal. Cargo terminals often suffer damage to loading houses and vehicles incurred in connection with drive into and away from the loading house. This is usually not just mistake out of the driver, but lack of communication between driver and loading dock. DockNET solves this lack of communication and secures while running the work environment and cargo handling. The result is increased efficiency where technology makes everything measurable around the loading space.

Brauer. Jacobsen has taught at [[Messiah College]] in Mechanicsburg, PA, since 1984 and is currently Distinguished [[Professor]] of Church History and Theology. He has also been a visiting scholar at [[Pepperdine University]].

Jacobsen, a member of the [[United Church of Christ]], is an [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] theologian whose thinking has been influenced by [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]], [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]], and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] perspectives. In 2006, he co-authored (with Rodney Sawatsky) a short introduction to theology entitled ''Gracious Christianity'' that emphasizes the role of love and gratitude in Christian life and thought.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Douglas and Rodney J.

All of these phenomena can be generalised by a few theoretical results that qualitatively describe these non-equilibrium steady states. A common example of this is the derivation of the force exerted by a non-equilibrium system on two embedded walls. It is characteristic of a narrow, unimodal spectrum for the force to be dependent on the width and peak within a fluctuation spectrum, which oscillates between repulsion and attraction.

Some common generalisations of this theory can be applied to the [[Maritime Casimir Effect]] and through the motion of active [[Brownian motion|Brownian]] particles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Erik G.|last2=Braun|first2=Anthony R.|last3=Sachs|first3=Jonathan N.|last4=Nagle|first4=John F.|last5=Edholm|first5=Olle|date=2011-05-04|title=Interpretation of Fluctuation Spectra in Lipid Bilayer Simulations|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=100|issue=9|pages=2104–2111|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2011.03.010|issn=0006-3495|pmc=3149257|pmid=21539777|bibcode=2011BpJ...100.2104B}}&lt;/ref&gt; within a closed system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1953">'''Fuzzy Control Language''', or '''FCL''', is a language for implementing [[fuzzy logic]], especially [[fuzzy control]]. It was standardized by IEC 61131-7. It is a [[domain-specific programming language]]: it has no features unrelated to fuzzy logic, so it is impossible to even print "[[Hello world program|Hello, world!]]". Therefore, one does not write a program in FCL, but one may write ''part'' of it in FCL.

== Example ==

 RULE 0: IF (Temperature IS Cold) THEN (Output IS High)

== Limitations ==

FCL is not an entirely complete fuzzy language, for instance, it does not support "hedges", which are adverbs that modify the set. For instance, the programmer cannot write:

 RULE 0: IF (Temperature IS VERY Cold) THEN (Output IS VERY High)

However, the programmer can simply define new sets for "very cold" and "very high". FCL also lacks support for higher-order fuzzy sets, subsets, and so on. None of these features are essential to fuzzy control, although they may be nice to have.

{{Update|date=November 2018|reason=Much of the information on this article is old (not out of date). There have been many other studies, critiques, etc. of gender bias on Wikipedia and the article must be updated to reflect that.}}
[[File:LE15_Gender_overall_in_2018.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Pie chart for gender of Wikipedia editors: 90% male, 9% female, and 1% transsexual or transgender|Wikipedia editors surveyed by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] in 2018 were predominantly male.]]

'''Gender bias on Wikipedia''' reflects the fact that a dominant majority of volunteer Wikipedia editors, particularly on the [[English Wikipedia|English-language site]], are male. This has led to Wikipedia having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women.

It figures among the most frequent [[criticism of Wikipedia|criticisms of Wikipedia]], and part of a more general criticism about [[systemic bias in Wikipedia]]. The [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which runs Wikipedia, agrees with these criticisms and has made an ongoing attempt to increase female editorship of Wikipedia. [[Edit-a-thon]]s have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.

''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out that Wikipedia's female participation rate may be in line with other "public thought-leadership forums".&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt; In 2009, a Wikimedia Foundation survey revealed that 6% of editors who made more than 500 edits were female, with the average male editor having twice as many edits.&lt;ref name=Clubhouse&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lam/papers/wp-gender-wikisym2011.pdf |title = WP:Clubhouse?

In the English Wikipedia and five other language editions that were studied by researchers, the ratio of articles about women to articles about men was higher than in three other databases. However, analysis with computational linguistics concluded that the way women and men are described in articles demonstrates bias, with articles about women more likely to overuse words relating to gender and family. The researchers believe that this is a sign Wikipedia editors consider male the "null gender" (in other words, that "male" is assumed unless otherwise specified).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/534616/computational-linguistics-reveals-how-wikipedia-articles-are-biased-against-women/ |title = Computational Linguistics Reveals How Wikipedia Articles Are Biased Against Women |last = arXiv |first = Emerging Technology from the |work = MIT Technology Review |access-date = 21 August 2017 |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critique of Wikipedia's approach, from a 2014 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial, is that it has difficulty making judgments about "what matters". To illustrate this point they noted that [[List of pornographic actresses by decade|the page listing pornographic actresses]] was better organized than [[List of women writers|the page listing women writers]].&lt;ref name=GuardianAugust2014&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'' 2014 (London) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth The Guardian view on Wikipedia: evolving truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112212758/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth |date=November 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[United Nations University]] and [[UNU-MERIT]] jointly presented an overview of the results of a global Wikipedia survey.&lt;ref name=WPSurvey2010&gt;{{cite web |title = Wikipedia Survey: Overview Results |url = http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |last1 = Glott |first1 = Ruediger |last2 = Schmidt |first2 = Philipp |last3 = Ghosh |first3 = Rishab |date = March 2010 |website =  |publisher =  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100414165445/http://wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |archivedate = 14 April 2010 |accessdate = 11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 30 January 2011, ''New York Times'' article cited this [[Wikimedia Foundation]] collaboration, which indicated that fewer than 13% of contributors to Wikipedia are women.  [[Sue Gardner]], then executive director of the foundation, said that increasing diversity was about making the encyclopedia "as good as it could be." Factors the article cited as possibly discouraging women from editing included the "obsessive fact-loving realm", associations with the "hard-driving hacker crowd," and the necessity to be "open to very difficult, high-conflict people, even misogynists”.&lt;ref name=Cohen110130&gt;{{cite news |last = Cohen |first = Noam |date = 30 January 2011 |title = Define Gender Gap?

In February 2011, ''The New York Times'' followed up with a series of opinions on the subject under the banner, "Where Are the Women in Wikipedia?"&lt;ref name=WhereAretheWomen&gt;{{cite news |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = 2 February 2011 |title = Where Are the Women in Wikipedia? |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 9 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715112226/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Herring|Susan C. Herring]], a professor of information science and linguistics, said that she was not surprised by the Wikipedia contributors gender gap. She said that the often contentious nature of Wikipedia article "talk" pages, where article content is discussed, is unappealing to many women, "if not outright intimidating."&lt;ref name=Herring110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Herring |first = Susan C. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Communication Styles Make a Difference |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140724050237/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |archivedate = 24 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Reagle|Joseph M. Reagle]] reacted similarly, saying that the combination of a "culture of hacker elitism," combined with the disproportionate effect of high-conflict members (a minority) on the community atmosphere, can make it unappealing. He said, "the ideology and rhetoric of freedom and openness can then be used (a) to suppress concerns about inappropriate or offensive speech as "censorship" and (b) to rationalize low female participation as simply a matter of their personal preference and choice."&lt;ref name=Reagle110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Reagle |first = Joseph M. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = 'Open' Doesn't Include Everyone |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715113229/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justine Cassell]] said that although women are as knowledgeable as men, and as able to defend their point of view, "it is still the case in American society that debate, contention, and vigorous defense of one’s position is often still seen as a male stance, and women’s use of these speech styles can call forth negative evaluations."&lt;ref name=Cassell110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Cassell |first = Justine |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Editing Wars Behind the Scenes |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170227113525/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |archivedate = 27 February 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[International Journal of Communication]]'' published research by Reagle and Lauren Rhue that examined the coverage, gender representation, and article length of thousands of biographical subjects on the English-language Wikipedia and the online ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. They concluded that Wikipedia provided better coverage and longer articles in general, that Wikipedia typically has more articles on women than ''Britannica'' in absolute terms, but Wikipedia articles on women were more likely to be missing than articles on men relative to ''Britannica''. That is, Wikipedia dominated ''Britannica'' in biographical coverage, but more so when it comes to men. Similarly, one might say that ''Britannica'' is more balanced in whom it neglects to cover than Wikipedia. For both reference works, article length did not consistently differ by gender.&lt;ref name="Reagle-Rhue"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Reagle |first1 = Joseph |last2 = Rhue |first2 = Lauren |title = Gender Bias in Wikipedia and ''Britannica'' |url = http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631 |year = 2011 |journal = International Journal of Communication |volume = 5 |publisher = Joseph Reagle &amp; Lauren Rhue |pages = 1138–1158 |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160322081809/http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631 |archivedate = 22 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation conducted its first semi-annual Wikipedia survey. It suggested that 9% of Wikipedia editors are women.

A study published in 2014 found that there is also an "Internet skills gap" with regard to Wikipedia editors. The authors found that the most likely Wikipedia contributors are high-skilled men and that there is no gender gap among low-skilled editors, and concluded that the "skills gap" exacerbates the gender gap among editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Hargittai |first1 = Eszter |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Aaron |title = Mind the skills gap: the role of Internet know-how and gender in differentiated contributions to Wikipedia |journal = Information, Communication &amp; Society |date = 4 November 2014 |pages = 1–19 |doi = 10.1080/1369118X.2014.957711 |volume = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–14, women made up 61% of participants of the college courses arranged by the Wiki Education Foundation program that included editing Wikipedia as part of the curriculum. Their contributions were found to shift the Wikipedia content from pop-culture and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] towards social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |title = Wikipedia grows up on college campuses |author = Bruce Maiman |date = 23 September 2014 |website = [[The Sacramento Bee]] |accessdate = 23 September 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140923224639/http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |archivedate = 23 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors also found structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities.

A 2017 study found that women participating in an experiment by editing a Wikipedia-like site tended to view other editors as male, and to view their responses as more critical than if the other editor was [[gender-neutral]]. The study concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Shane-Simpson |first1=Christina |last2=Gillespie-Lynch |first2=Kristen |title=Examining potential mechanisms underlying the Wikipedia gender gap through a collaborative editing task |journal=[[Computers in Human Behavior]] |date=January 2017 |volume=66 |pages=312–328 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.043|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01612306/document }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote |text = ...visible female editors on Wikipedia and broader encouragement of the use of constructive feedback may begin to alleviate the Wikipedia gender gap. Furthermore, the relatively high proportion of anonymous editors may exacerbate the Wikipedia gender gap, as anonymity may often be perceived as male and more critical.}}

A study by Ford and Wajcman observes that research on the gender bias continues to frame the problem as a deficit in women. In contrast, their central argument states that infrastructure studies in [[feminist technoscience]] allows the gender analysis to be taken to a further level. It looks at three issues within the infrastructure: content policies, software and the legalistic framework of operation. It suggests that progress can be made through altering that culture of [[knowledge production]] through encouraging alternate knowledge, reducing the technical barriers to editing, and addressing the complexity of Wikipedia policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ford |first1 = Heather |last2 = Wajcman |first2 = Judy |title = 'Anyone can edit', not everyone does: Wikipedia and the gender gap |journal = Social Studies of Science |date = 2017 |url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228081909/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |archivedate = 28 December 2016 |df = dmy-all | doi = 10.1177/0306312717692172 |volume=47 |pages=511–527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, mathematician [[Marie A.

In October 2018, when [[Donna Strickland]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], numerous write-ups mentioned that she did not previously have a Wikipedia page.

Several causes for this gender disparity have been suggested.

As well, Wikipedia "...editors that publicly identify as women face harassment" from other Wikipedia editors.&lt;ref name="Montellaro" /&gt;

Lam ''et al''. suggest that there may be a culture which is non-inclusive of women on Wikipedia, which may be due to a disparity in male-to-female centric topics represented and edited, the tendency for female users to be more active in the [[Community of Wikipedia|social and community aspects of Wikipedia]], an increased likelihood that edits by new female editors are reverted, and/or that articles with high proportions of female editors are more contentious.&lt;ref name=WPClubhouse /&gt;

In July 2014, the [[National Science Foundation]] announced that it would spend $200,000 to study systemic gender bias on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/ |title=Government-Funded Study: Why Is Wikipedia Sexist? |work=[[Washington Free Beacon]] |date=30 July 2014 |author= Elizabeth Harrington |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801062009/http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/ |archivedate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Julia Adams and Hannah Brückner that was supported by the funding was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Julia |last1=Adams |first2=Hannah |last2=Brückner |title=Wikipedia, sociology, and the promise and pitfalls of Big Data |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951715614332|journal=Big Data &amp; Society |date=27 December 2015 |issn=2053-9517 |volume=2 |issue=2 |doi=10.1177/2053951715614332}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|reason=Please tell us what the report's findings were.

== Reactions ==

The Wikimedia Foundation has officially held, since at least 2011 when Gardner was executive director, that gender bias exists in the project. It has made some attempts to address it but Gardner has expressed frustration with the degree of success achieved. She has also noted that "in the very limited leisure time women had, they tended to be more involved in social activities instead of editing Wikipedia. 'Women see technology more as a tool they use to accomplish tasks, rather than something fun in itself.{{'"}}&lt;ref name=Huang130811&gt;{{cite news |last = Huang |first = Keira |date = 11 August 2013 |title = Wikipedia fails to bridge gender gap |url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1295872/wikipedia-fails-bridge-gender-gap |newspaper = South China Morning Post |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160115195821/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1295872/wikipedia-fails-bridge-gender-gap |archivedate = 15 January 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wikistorm2013&gt;{{cite web |url = http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wikistorming/ |title = Wikistorming |date = Fall 2013 |website = FemTechNet |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150717034630/http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wikistorming/ |archivedate = 17 July 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Foundation set a target of having 25 percent of its contributors identifying as female by 2015.&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt; In August 2013, Gardner said, "I didn't solve it. We didn't solve it. The Wikimedia Foundation didn't solve it. The solution won't come from the Wikimedia Foundation."&lt;ref name=Huang130811 /&gt;

Writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in 2011, [[Heather Mac Donald]] called Wikipedia's gender imbalance a "non-problem in search of a misguided solution." Mac Donald asserted, "The most straightforward explanation for the differing rates of participation in Wikipedia—and the one that conforms to everyday experience—is  that, on average, males and females have different interests and preferred ways of spending their free time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Mac Donald |first = Heather |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/02/wikipedia_is_maledominated_that_doesnt_mean_its_sexist.html |title = Wikipedia Is Male-Dominated.

In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] announced in a BBC interview the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]'s plans for "doubling down" on the gender content gap at Wikipedia. Wales said the Foundation would be open to more outreach and more software changes.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772 Wikipedia 'completely failed' to fix gender imbalance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004148/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772 |date=29 December 2016 }}, [[BBC]] interview with [[Jimmy Wales]], 8 August 2014; starting at 45 seconds.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to increase female editorship ==

[[File:Giants in the field of Women in the Arts 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Attendees at the 2013 Women in the Arts edit-a-thon in Washington, DC]]

Dedicated [[edit-a-thon]]s have been organized to increase the coverage of women's topics in Wikipedia and to encourage more women to edit Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |title = Closing Wikipedia’s Gender Gap — Reluctantly |work = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date = 11 February 2014 |accessdate = 27 August 2014 |author = Stoeffel |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140902160836/http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |archivedate = 2 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events are supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, which sometimes provides mentors and technology to help guide newer editors through the process.

The [[Wikipedia:Teahouse/About|Wikipedia Teahouse]] project was launched with the goal to provide a user-friendly environment for newcomers, with a particular goal of boosting women's participation in Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dub.washington.edu/pubs/364 |title = Tea &amp; Sympathy: Crafting Positive New User Experiences on Wikipedia |website = washington.edu |publisher = Proc.

An early-2015 initiative to create a "women-only" space for Wikipedia editors was strongly opposed by Wikipedians.&lt;ref&gt;Paling, Emma, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/how-wikipedia-is-hostile-to-women/411619/ How Wikipedia Is Hostile to Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021174625/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/how-wikipedia-is-hostile-to-women/411619/ |date=21 October 2015 }}", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 21 October 2015 {{Subscription or advertising}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''glass tax''' was introduced in Great Britain in 1746, during the reign of King [[George II of England|George II]]. Glass was at that time sold by weight, and manufacturers responded by producing smaller, more highly decorated objects, often with hollow stems, known today as "Excise glasses".{{sfnp|Hurst-Vose|1980|p=|ps=none}} In 1780, the government granted Ireland free trade in glass without taxation, resulting in the establishment of glassworks in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Waterford]]. In 1825, the tax in Ireland was restored, and gradually the industry declined, until the glass tax was abolished by Sir [[Robert Peel]]'s government in 1845.{{sfnp|Tait|2004|p=|ps=none}}

A contemporary account in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' described the glass tax as an "absurd impost on light":
{{quote|In a hygienic point of view, the enormous tax on glass, amounting to more than three hundred per cent on its value, is one of the most cruel a Government could inflict on the nation&amp;nbsp;... The deficiency of light in town habitations, in a great measure caused by the enormous cost of glass, is universally admitted to be one of the principal causes of the unhealthiness of cities ...{{r|Lancet}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5127">'''Gloger's rule''' is an [[ecogeographical rule]] which states that within a species of [[Warm-blooded|endotherms]], more heavily [[biological pigment|pigmented]] forms tend to be found in more [[humid]] environments, e.g. near the [[equator]]. It was named after the zoologist [[Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger]], who first  remarked upon this phenomenon in 1833 in a review of [[covariation]] of climate and [[aves|avian]] [[plumage]] color.&lt;ref&gt;Gloger (1833)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Stresemann]] noted that the idea was already expressed by [[Peter Simon Pallas|Pallas]] in ''Zoographia Rosso-Asiatica'' (1811).&lt;ref&gt;Stresemann (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Gloger found that birds in more humid habitats tended to be darker than their relatives from regions with higher [[arid]]ity. Over 90% of 52 North American bird species studies conform to this rule.&lt;ref&gt;Zink &amp; Remsen (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation of Gloger's rule in the case of birds appears to be the increased resistance of dark feathers to feather- or hair-degrading bacteria such as ''[[Bacillus licheniformis]]''. Feathers in humid environments have a greater bacterial load, and humid environments are more suitable for microbial growth; dark feathers or hair are more difficult to break down.&lt;ref&gt;Burtt &amp; Ichida (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; More resilient [[eumelanin]]s – dark brown to black – are deposited in hot and humid regions, whereas in arid regions, [[pheomelanin]]s – reddish to sandy color – predominate due to the benefit of [[crypsis]].

Among [[mammal]]s, there is a marked tendency in equatorial and [[tropical]] regions to have a darker skin color than poleward relatives. In this case, the underlying cause is probably the need to better protect against the more intense solar [[UV radiation]] at lower latitudes. However absorption of a certain amount of UV radiation is necessary for the production of certain [[vitamin]]s, notably [[vitamin D]] (''see also'' [[Osteomalacia]]).

This principle is also vividly demonstrated among human populations.&lt;ref&gt;Ember ''et al.'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Populations that evolved in sunnier environments closer to the equator tend to be darker-pigmented than populations originating farther from the equator. There are exceptions, however; among the most well known are the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s and [[Inuit]], who have darker skin than might be expected from their native latitudes. In the first case, this is apparently an adaptation to the extremely high UV irradiation on the [[Tibetan Plateau]], whereas in the second case, the necessity to absorb UV radiation is alleviated by the Inuit's diet naturally rich in [[vitamin D]].

The '''Gordon–Loeb''' /ˈgȯr-dən ˈlōb/ '''Model''' is a mathematical [[economic model]] analyzing the optimal investment level in [[information security]].

Investing to protect company data involves a cost that, unlike other investments, usually does not generate profit. It does, however, serve to prevent additional costs. Thus, it’s important to compare how expensive it is to protect a specific set of data, with the potential loss in case said data is stolen, lost, damaged or corrupted. To draft this model, the company must possess knowledge of three parameters: how much the data is worth; how much the data is at risk; the probability an attack on the data is going to be successful. This last parameter, Gordon and Loeb defined as '''vulnerability'''. The product of said parameters provides the medium money loss with no security investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Big Data e Privacy by design|author=Giuseppe D'Acquisto, Maurizio Naldi|publisher=G.Giappichelli Editor|isbn=978-88-921-0629-1|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=Ig9EDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Gordon-Loeb.png|thumb|Ideal level of investment in company computer security, given decreasing incremental returns]]

From the model we can gather that the amount of money a company spends in protecting information should, in most cases, be only a small fraction of the predicted loss (for example, [[expected value]] of a loss following a [[security breach]]). Specifically, the model shows that it is generally inconvenient to invest in informatics security (including [[cybersecurity]] or [[computer security]] related activities) for amounts higher than '''37%''' of the predicted loss. The Gordon-Loeb model also shows that, for a specific level of potential loss, the amount of resources to invest in order to protect an information set does not always increase with the increase in [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] of said set. Thus, companies can enjoy greater economic returns by investing in cyber/information security activities aimed to increase the security of data sets with a medium level of vulnerability. In other words, the investment in safeguarding a company’s data reduces vulnerability with '''decreasing incremental returns'''.

'''Example''': suppose an estimated data value of '''1.000.000 euros''', with an attack probability of '''15%''', and an '''80%''' chance that an attack would be successful. In this case, the potential loss is given by the product '''1.000.000 euros x 0.15 x 0.8 = 120.000 euros'''. According to Gordon and Loeb, the company’s investment in security should not exceed '''120.000 euros x 0.37 = 44.000 euros'''.

The Gordon–Loeb Model was first published by [[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [[Martin P. Loeb]] in their 2002 paper, in [http://tissec.acm.org/ ''ACM Transactions on Information and System Security''], entitled "The Economics of Information Security Investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Lawrence|author2=Martin Loeb|title=The Economics of Information Security Investment|journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security|date=November 2002|volume=5|issue=4|pages=438–457|doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}&lt;/ref&gt;" The paper was reprinted in the 2004 book [https://www.springer.com/computer/theoretical+computer+science/book/978-1-4020-8089-0 Economics of Information Security]. Gordon and Loeb are both Professors at the [[University of Maryland]]'s [[Robert H. Smith School of Business]].

[[File:Great Chain of Being 2.png|250 px|thumb|1579 drawing of the Great Chain of Being from [[:es:Diego de Valadés|Didacus Valades]], ''Rhetorica Christiana'']]

The '''Great Chain of Being''' is a strict hierarchical structure of all matter and life, thought in medieval [[Christianity]] to have been decreed by [[God]]. The chain starts with God and progresses downward to angels, demons (fallen/renegade angels), stars, moon, kings, princes, nobles, commoners, wild animals, domesticated animals, trees, other plants, precious stones, precious metals and other minerals.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

The Great Chain of Being ({{lang-la|scala naturae}}, "Ladder of Being") is a concept derived from [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] (in his ''[[Historia Animalium]]''), [[Plotinus]] and [[Proclus]]. Further developed during the Middle Ages, it reached full expression in early modern [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;"This idea of a great chain of being can be traced to Plato's division of the world into the Forms, which are full beings, and sensible things, which are imitations of the Forms and are both being and not being. Aristotle's teleology recognized a perfect being, and he also arranges all animals by a single natural scale according to the degree of perfection of their souls. The idea of the great chain of being was fully developed in Neoplatonism and in the Middle Ages.", Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, p. 289 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Mahoney, "Lovejoy and the Hierarchy of Being", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' Vol. 48, No 2, pp. 211-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
The Chain of Being is composed of a great number of hierarchical links, from the most basic and foundational elements up through the very highest perfection: [[God]].&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964p59/&gt;

God sits at the top of the chain, and beneath him sit the [[angel]]s, both existing wholly in ''[[spirit]]'' form. Earthly flesh is fallible and ever-changing, mutable. Spirit, however, is unchanging and permanent. This sense of permanence is crucial to understanding this conception of reality. It is generally impossible to change the position of an object in the hierarchy. (One exception might be in the realm of [[alchemy]], where alchemists attempted to transmute base elements, such as [[lead]], into higher elements, either [[silver]] or, more often, [[gold]]—the highest ''element''.)&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

In the natural order, earth (rock) is at the bottom of the chain; this [[Classical element|element]] possesses only the attribute of existence. Each link succeeding upward contains the positive attributes of the previous link and adds at least one other. Rocks possess only existence; the next link up is plants which possess life ''and'' existence. Animals add motion and appetite as well.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

Man is both mortal flesh, as those below him, and also spirit, as those above. In this dichotomy, the struggle between flesh and spirit becomes a moral one. The way of the spirit is higher, more noble; it brings one closer to God. The desires of the flesh move one away from God. The Christian fall of [[Lucifer]] is thought of as especially terrible, as angels are wholly spirit, yet Lucifer defied God (who is the ultimate perfection).&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

==Subdivisions==
[[File:Nine orders of angels.jpeg|thumb|[[Orthodox Christian]] icon of [[Christian angelology|nine orders of angels]]]]

Each link in the chain might be divided further into its component parts. In medieval secular society, for example, the king is at the top, succeeded by the aristocratic lords and the [[clergy]], and then the peasants below them.  Solidifying the king's position at the top of humanity's social order is the doctrine of the [[Divine Right of Kings]]. The implied permanent state of inequality became a source of popular grievance, and led eventually to political change as in the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Censer, Jack R. Censer; Hunt, Lynn |title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSDNl6Ydq_oC&amp;pg=PA21 |year=2001 |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=0-271-04013-0 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the family, the father is head of the household; below him, his wife; below her, their children.

Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' ranked the angels (c.f. [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]'s ranking of angels), and Christian culture conceives of angels in orders of [[archangels]], [[seraphim]], and [[cherubim]], among others.

Subdivisions are equally apparent among animals. At the top of the animals are wild beasts (such as lions), which were seen as superior as they defied training and domestication. Below them are domestic animals, further sub-divided so that useful animals (such as [[dog]]s and [[horse]]s) are higher than docile creatures (such as [[sheep]]). [[Bird]]s are also sub-divided, with [[eagle]]s above [[Columbidae|pigeons]], for example. [[Fish]] come below birds and are subdivided between actual fish and other sea creatures. Below them come [[insect]]s, with useful insects such as [[spider]]s and [[bee]]s and attractive creatures such as [[ladybird]]s and [[dragonflies]] at the top, and unpleasant insects such as [[fly|flies]] and [[beetle]]s at the bottom. At the very bottom of the animal sector are [[snake]]s, which are relegated to this position as punishment for the serpent's actions in the [[Garden of Eden]].

Below animals comes the division for plants, which is further subdivided. Trees are at the top, with useful trees such as oaks at the top, and the traditionally demonic [[Taxus baccata|yew tree]] at the bottom. Food-producing plants such as [[cereals]] and [[vegetables]] are further subdivided.

At the very bottom of the chain are [[minerals]]. At the top of this section are metals (further sub-divided, with [[gold]] at the top and [[lead]] at the bottom), followed by [[rock (geology)|rocks]] (with [[granite]] and [[marble]] at the top), [[soil]] (subdivided between nutrient-rich soil and low-quality types), [[sand]], grit, [[dust]], and dirt at the very bottom of the entire great chain.

The central concept of the Chain of Being is that everything imaginable fits in somewhere, giving order and meaning to the universe.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt;

== The Chain ==
[[File:Carlo Crivelli 007.jpg|thumb|upright|St Thomas Aquinas classified all beings by rank.]]

===God===
God is at the top of the chain and is also external to creation. God is believed to exist outside the physical limitations of time and space. He possessed the spiritual attributes of reason, love, and imagination, like all spiritual beings, but he alone possessed the divine attributes of [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], and [[omnipresence]]. God serves as the model of authority for the strongest, most virtuous, most excellent type of being within any category.

===Angelic beings===
{{further|Christian angelology}}

Angels were beings of pure spirit who had no physical bodies of their own. In order to affect the physical world, angels were thought to build temporary bodies for themselves out of particles of earthly elements.{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Medieval and Renaissance theologians believed angels to possess reason, love, imagination, and, like God, to stand outside the physical limitations of time.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They possessed sensory awareness unbound by physical organs, and they possessed language. They lacked, however, the divine attributes of omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence of God, and they simultaneously lacked the physical passions experienced by humans and animals. Depending upon the author, the class of angels was further subdivided into three, seven, nine, or ten ranks, variously known as triads, orders, or choirs. Each rank had greater power and responsibility than the entities below them. The most common classification is that of St. Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aquinas, Thomas | url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.pdf | title=Summa Theologica | authorlink=Thomas Aquinas |date= |origyear=1265–1274 | via=Christian Classics Ethereal Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

===Humanity===
[[File:Die Leiter des Auf- und Abstiegs.jpg|thumb|upright|The mediaeval ''scala naturae'' as a staircase, implying the [[orthogenesis|possibility of progress]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramon Lull]]'s ''Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind'', 1305]]

For [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] thinkers, humans occupied a unique position on the Chain of Being, straddling the world of spiritual beings and the world of physical creation. Humans were thought to possess divine powers such as reason, love, and imagination. Like angels, humans were spiritual beings, but unlike angels, human souls were "knotted" to a physical body. As such, they were subject to passions and physical sensations—pain, hunger, thirst, sexual desire—just like other animals lower on the Chain of Being. They also possessed the powers of reproduction unlike the minerals and rocks lowest on the Chain of Being. Humans had a particularly difficult position, balancing the divine and the animalistic parts of their nature. For instance, an angel is only capable of intellectual sin such as [[pride]] (as evidenced by [[Lucifer]]'s fall from heaven in [[Christian]] belief). Humans, however, were capable of both intellectual [[sin]] and physical sins such as [[lust]] and [[gluttony]] if they let their animal appetites overrule their divine reason. Humans also possessed sensory attributes: sight, touch, taste, hearing, and smell. Unlike angels, however, their sensory attributes were limited by physical organs (they could only know things discerned through the five senses). The highest-ranking human being was the [[king]].

===Animals===
[[File:BonnetChain.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Bonnet]]'s chain of being from ''Traité d'insectologie'', 1745]]

Animals, like humans higher on the chain, were animated (capable of independent motion). They possessed physical appetites and sensory attributes, the number depending upon their position within the Chain of Being. They had limited intelligence and awareness of their surroundings. Unlike humans, they were thought to lack spiritual and mental attributes such as immortal souls and the ability to use logic and language. The primate of all animals (the "king of beasts") was variously thought to be either the lion or the elephant. However, each subgroup of animals also had its own primate, an avatar superior in qualities of its type.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

* Mammalian primate: [[lion]] or [[elephant]]
** Wild animals (large cats, etc.)
** "Useful" domesticated animals ([[horse]], [[dog]], etc.)
** "Tame" domesticated animals ([[housecat]], etc.)
* Avian primate: [[eagle]]
** Birds of prey ([[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, etc.)
** Carrion birds ([[vulture]]s, [[crow]]s)
** "Worm-eating" birds ([[American robin|robin]], etc.)
** "Seed-eating" birds ([[sparrow]], etc.)

Note that avian creatures, linked to the [[Classical element|element of air]], were considered superior to aquatic creatures linked to the element of water. Air naturally tended to rise and soar above the surface of water, and analogously, aerial creatures were placed higher in the chain.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

* Piscine primate: [[whale]]
** Aquatic mammals
** [[Shark]]s
** Fish of various sizes and attributes

The chart would continue to descend through various reptiles, amphibians, and insects. The higher up the chart one went, the more noble, mobile, strong, and intelligent the creature in Renaissance belief. At the very bottom of the animal section, we find sessile creatures like the [[oyster]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[barnacle]]s. Like the plants below them, these creatures lacked mobility, and were thought to lack various sensory organs such as sight and hearing. However, they were still considered superior to plants because they had tactile and gustatory senses (touch and taste).

===Plants===
Plants, like other living creatures, possessed the ability to grow in size and reproduce. However, they lacked mental attributes and possessed no sensory organs. Instead, their gifts included the ability to eat soil, air, and "heat." Plants did have greater tolerances for heat and cold, and immunity to the pain that afflicts most animals. At the very bottom of the botanical hierarchy, fungi and mosses, lacking leaf and blossom, were so limited in form that Renaissance thinkers thought them scarcely above the level of minerals. However, each plant was also thought to be gifted with various edible or medicinal virtues unique to its own type.

* Trees, with the primate: the oak tree
* Shrubs
* Bushes
* "Crops" (such as wheat)
* Herbs
* [[Fern]]s
* Weeds
* [[Moss]]es
* [[Fungus|Fungi]]

===Minerals===
Creations of the earth, the lowest of elements, all minerals lacked the plant's basic ability to grow and reproduce. They also lacked mental attributes and sensory organs found in beings higher on the chain. Their unique gifts, however, were typically their unusual solidity and strength. Many minerals, in fact, were thought to possess magical powers, particularly gems. The mineral primate is the diamond.

* Lapidarical primate: [[diamond]]
** Diamonds
** [[Rubies]]
** [[Emerald]]s
** [[Sapphire]]s, etc.
* Metallic primate: [[gold]]
** Gold
** [[Silver]]
** [[Iron]] (and steel)
** [[Bronze]]
** [[Copper]], etc.
* Geological primate: [[marble]]
** Marble
** [[Granite]]
** [[Sandstone]]
** [[Limestone]], etc.
* Minute particles (gravel, sand, soil, etc.)

==Natural science==

===From Aristotle to Linnaeus===
[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|right|thumb|[[Linnaeus]]' [[biological classification|classification of animals]] with mammals ("Quadrupedia") first and worms ("[[Vermes]]") last, echoing the ''scala naturae'']]
{{further|Aristotle's biology#Classification}}

The basic idea of a ranking of the world's organisms goes back to [[Aristotle's biology]]. In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', where he ranked animals over plants based on their ability to move and sense, and graded the animals by their reproductive mode and possession of blood (he ranked all invertebrates as "bloodless").&lt;ref name="Singer, Charles 1931"&gt;Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology: A General Introduction to the Study of Living Things''. Oxford 1931.{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's non-religious concept of higher and lower organisms was taken up by [[natural philosophers]] during the [[scholasticism|Scholastic period]] to form the basis of the ''Scala Naturae''. The ''scala'' allowed for an ordering of beings, thus forming a basis for classification where each kind of mineral, plant and animal could be slotted into place. In medieval times, the great chain was seen as a God-given ordering: God at the top, dirt at the bottom, every grade of creature in its place. Just as rock never turns to flowers and worms never turn to lions, humans never turn to angels. This was not our lot in life. In the [[Northern Renaissance]], the scientific focus shifted to biology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Debus]], ''Man and Nature in the Renaissance'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The threefold division of the chain below humans formed the basis for [[Linnaeus]]'s ''[[Systema Naturæ]]'' from 1737, where he divided the physical components of the world into the three familiar [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of minerals, plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Linn1758" &gt;{{cite book |first=Carl |last=Linnaeus |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |location=Stockholm |date=1758 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542 |language=Latin |edition=[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Scala naturae'' in evolution===
[[File:Human pidegree.jpg|thumb|right|The human pedigree [[recapitulation theory|recapitulating its phylogeny]] back to [[amoeba]] shown as a reinterpreted chain of being with living and [[fossil]] animals. From a critique of [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s theories, 1873.]]

The set nature of species, and thus the absoluteness of creatures' places in the great chain, came into question during the 18th century. The dual nature of the chain, divided yet united, had always allowed for seeing creation as essentially one continuous whole, with the potential for overlap between the links.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964/&gt; Radical thinkers like [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] saw a progression of life forms from the simplest creatures striving towards complexity and perfection, a schema accepted by zoologists like [[Henri de Blainville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Appel |first=T.A. |title=Henri De Blainville and the Animal Series: A Nineteenth-Century Chain of Being |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1980 |volume=13 | issue = 2 |pages=291–319 |jstor=4330767 |doi=10.1007/BF00125745|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very idea of an ordering of organisms, even if supposedly fixed, laid the basis for the idea of [[transmutation of species]], for example [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt;

The Chain of Being continued to be part of [[metaphysics]] in 19th century education, and the concept was well known. The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] used it as a metaphor in his 1851 ''Elements of Geology'' description of the [[Geologic time scale|geological column]], where he used the term "[[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing links]]" in relation to missing parts of the continuum. The term "missing link" later came to signify [[transitional fossil]]s, particularly those bridging the gulf between man and beasts.&lt;ref name="hm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoxfulmonsters.com/2009/06/why-the-term-missing-links-is-inappropriate/ |title=Why the term "missing links" is inappropriate |date=10 June 2009 |publisher=Hoxful Monsters |accessdate=10 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402093028/http://www.hoxfulmonsters.com/2009/06/why-the-term-missing-links-is-inappropriate/ |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the great chain as well as the derived "missing link" was abandoned in early 20th century science,&lt;ref name=Prothero2008&gt;{{cite journal |last=Prothero |first=Donald R. |authorlink=Donald Prothero |date=1 March 2008 |title=Evolution: What missing link? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726451.700-evolution-what-missing-link.html?full=true |journal=[[New Scientist]] |issue=2645 |pages=35–41 |accessdate=4 August 2018 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(08)60548-5 |volume=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the notion of [[Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny|modern animals representing ancestors of other modern animals]] was abandoned in biology.&lt;ref name=Ehrlich1963&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ehrlich | first1=Paul R. |author2=Holm, R.

==Politics==

Allenby and Garreau propose the Catholic Church's narrative of the Great Chain of Being kept the peace for centuries in Europe.  The very concept of rebellion simply lay outside the reality within which most people lived for to defy the King was to defy God. King James I himself wrote, "The state of monarchy is the most supreme thing upon earth: for kings are not only God's Lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne, but even by God himself they are called Gods."&lt;ref name=Snyder/&gt;

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] broke this supposed divine plan and fought the last vestiges of feudal hierarchy by creating secular governmental structures that vested power into the hands of ordinary citizens rather than divinely ordained monarchs.&lt;ref name=Snyder&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://faculty.grandview.edu/ssnyder/121/121%20great%20chain.htm |title=The Great Chain of Being|website=faculty.grandview.edu |author=Snyder, S. |access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, scholars such as Brian Tierney&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/cornell-law-review/upload/Reid.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Novak&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crisismagazine.com/1990/thomas-aquinas-the-first-whig-what-our-liberties-owe-to-a-neapolitan-mendicant&lt;/ref&gt; have noted the medieval contribution to democracy and human rights.

==Adaptations and similar concepts==
The American spiritual writer and philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] uses a concept called the "Great Nest of Being" which is similar to the Great Chain of Being, and which he claims to belong to a culture-independent "[[perennial philosophy]]" traceable across 3000 years of mystical and esoteric writings. Wilber's system corresponds with other concepts of [[transpersonal psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Freeman, Anthony |date=2006 |title=A Daniel Come to Judgement?

In the 1977 book ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'', British philosopher and economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] wrote that fundamental gaps exist between the existence of minerals, plants, animals and humans, where each of the four classes of existence is marked by a level of existence not shared by that below. Clearly influenced by the great chain of being, but lacking the angels and God, he called his hierarchy the "levels of being". In the book, he claims that science has generally avoided seriously discussing these discontinuities, because they present such difficulties for strictly materialistic science, and they largely remain mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph (2008).

[[Image:Herodotos Met 91.8.jpg|right|thumb|230px|[[Herodotus]] ({{c.}} 484–{{c.}} 425 BC) was a Greek historian who lived in the 5th century BC and one of the earliest historians whose work survives.]]

A '''historian''' is a person who studies and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it.&lt;ref name="wordnetprinceton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Historian |title= Historian |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding [[recorded history|written history]], the individual is a historian of [[prehistory]].  Some historians are recognized by publications or training and experience.&lt;ref name="HermanAM"&gt;Herman, A. M. (1998). Occupational outlook handbook: 1998-99 edition. Indianapolis: JIST Works. Page 525.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Historian" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere.

==Objectivity==
During the ''[[Irving v Penguin Books Ltd|Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt]]'' trial, it became evident that the court needed to identify what was an "objective historian" in the same vein as the [[reasonable person]], and reminiscent of the standard traditionally used in English law of "[[the man on the Clapham omnibus]]".{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1531}} This was necessary so that there would be a legal bench mark to compare and contrast the scholarship of an objective historian against the illegitimate methods employed by [[David Irving]], as before the ''Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt'' trial, there was no legal precedent for what constituted an objective historian.{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1531}}

[[Charles Gray (English judge)|Justice Gray]] leant heavily on the research of one of the expert witnesses, [[Richard J. Evans]], who compared [[Historical revisionism (negationism)#Revisionist techniques|illegitimate distortion of the historical record]] practice by [[holocaust denier]]s with established historical methodologies.{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1534}}

By summarizing Gray's judgement, in an article published in the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', Wendie E. Schneider distils these seven points for what he meant by an objective historian:{{sfn|Schneider|2001|pp=1534, 1535}}
{{quote|
#The historian must treat sources with appropriate reservations;
#The historian must not dismiss counter evidence without scholarly consideration;
#The historian must be even-handed in treatment of evidence and eschew "cherry-picking";
#The historian must clearly indicate any speculation;
#The historian must not mistranslate documents or mislead by omitting parts of documents;
#The historian must weigh the authenticity of all accounts, not merely those that contradict his or her favored view; and
#The historian must take the motives of historical actors into consideration.
}}

Schneider uses the concept of the "objective historian" to suggest that this could be an aid in assessing what makes an historian suitable as an expert witnesses under the [[Daubert standard]] in the United States. Schneider proposed this, because, in her opinion, Irving could have passed the standard Daubert tests unless a court was given "a great deal of assistance from historians".{{sfn|Schneider|2001|pp=1534, 1538}}

Schneider proposes that by testing an historian against the criteria of the "objective historian" then, even if an historian holds specific political views (and she gives an example of a well-qualified historian's testimony that was disregarded by a United States court because he was a member of a feminist group), providing the historian uses the "objective historian" standards, he or she is a "conscientious historian". It was Irving's failure as an "objective historian" not his right wing views that caused him to lose his libel case, as a "conscientious historian" would not have "deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence" to support his political views.{{sfn|Schneider|2001|p=1539}}&lt;ref&gt;"deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence" Justice Charles Gray {{harv|Schneider|2001|p=1533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History analysis==
{{Main article|Historical method}}

The process of historical analysis involves investigation and analysis of competing ideas, facts, and purported facts to create coherent [[narrative]]s that explain "what happened" and "why or how it happened". Modern historical analysis usually draws upon other social sciences, including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[politics]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[linguistics]]. While ancient writers do not normally share modern historical practices, their work remains valuable for its insights within the cultural context of the times. An important part of the contribution of many modern historians is the verification or dismissal of earlier historical accounts through reviewing newly discovered sources and recent scholarship or through parallel disciplines like [[archaeology]].

==Historiography==
{{Main article|Historiography}}

===Ancient===
[[File:Thucydides Manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|Reproduction of part of a tenth-century copy of [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.]]
Understanding the past appears to be a universal human need, and the telling of history has emerged independently in civilizations around the world. What constitutes history is a philosophical question (see [[philosophy of history]]). The earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], though no historical writers in these early civilizations were known by name.

[[Greek historiography|Systematic historical thought]] emerged in [[ancient Greece]], a development that became an important influence on the writing of history elsewhere around [[History of the Mediterranean region|the Mediterranean]] region. The earliest known critical historical works were ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', composed by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484 – {{annum|c.&amp;nbsp;425|[[Before Common Era|BCE]]}}) who later became known as the "father of history" ([[Cicero]]). Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts, and personally conducted research by travelling extensively, giving written accounts of various [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] cultures. Although Herodotus' overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men, he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events. [[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta, establishing a rationalistic element that set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, while his successor [[Xenophon]] ({{c.|lk=no|431}} – {{annum|355|BCE}}) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]].

[[Image:Leonardo Bruni - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Leonardo Bruni]] (c.1370–1444), the historian who first divided history into the three eras of [[Ancient history|Antiquity]], the [[Middle Ages]], and [[Modern history|Modern times]].]]
The [[Roman historiography|Romans adopted the Greek tradition]]. While early Roman works were still written in Greek, the ''Origines'', composed by the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] ({{annum|234–149|BCE}}), was written in Latin, in a conscious effort to counteract Greek cultural influence. [[Strabo]] ({{annum|63|BCE}} – {{annum|{{c.|lk=no|24}}|[[Common Era|CE]]}}) was an important exponent of the Greco-Roman tradition of combining geography with history, presenting a descriptive history of peoples and places known to his era. [[Livy]] ({{annum|59|BCE}} – {{annum|17|CE}}) records the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] from [[city-state]] to [[empire]]. His speculation about what would have happened if [[Alexander the Great]] had marched against Rome represents the first known instance of [[alternate history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html |title=Livy's History of Rome: Book 9 |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese historiography]], the ''[[Classic of History]]'' is one of the [[Five Classics]] of [[Chinese classic texts]] and one of the earliest narratives of China.  The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|BCE}}, is among the earliest surviving Chinese historical texts arranged on [[Annals|annalistic]] principles. [[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|BCE}}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum|16th century|BCE}}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jörn Rüsen|title=Time and History: The Variety of Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvGyzu-nLaUC&amp;pg=PA54|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-349-7|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Beda Petersburgiensis f3v.jpg|left|upright|thumb|A page of [[Bede]]'s ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'']]
Christian historiography began early, perhaps as early as [[Luke-Acts]], which is the [[primary source]] for the [[Apostolic Age]]. Writing history was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the [[Middle Ages]]. They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, that of the Church and that of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers.  In the [[early medieval|Early Middle Ages]] historical writing often took the form of [[annals]] or [[chronicle]]s recording events year by year, but this style tended to hamper the analysis of events and causes.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, John (1998). ''The past and its presenters: an introduction to issues in historiography'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton, {{ISBN|0-340-67934-4}}, pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type of writing is the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]s, which were the work of several different writers: it was started during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] in the late 9th&amp;nbsp;century, but one copy was still being updated in 1154.

[[Muslim]] [[Historiography of early Islam|historical writings]] first began to develop in the 7th century, with the reconstruction of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s life in the centuries following his death. With numerous conflicting narratives regarding Muhammad and his [[Sahaba|companions]] from various sources, scholars had to verify which sources were more reliable. To evaluate these sources, they developed various methodologies, such as the ''[[Ilm ar-Rijal|science of biography]]'', ''[[science of hadith]]'' and ''[[Isnad]]'' (chain of transmission). They later applied these methodologies to other historical figures in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. Famous historians in this tradition include [[Urwah ibn Zubayr|Urwah]] (d.&amp;nbsp;712), [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] (d.&amp;nbsp;728), [[Ibn Ishaq]] (d.&amp;nbsp;761), [[al-Waqidi]] (745–822), [[Ibn Hisham]] (d.&amp;nbsp;834), [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] (810–870) and [[Ibn Hajar Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]] (1372–1449).

===Enlightenment===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the modern development of historiography through the application of scrupulous methods began.

[[File:Voltaire-Baquoy.gif|thumb|[[Voltaire]]'s works of history are an excellent example of [[Enlightenment era]] history writing. Painting by [[Pierre Charles Baquoy]].]]
French ''[[Philosophes|philosophe]]'' [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) had an enormous influence on the art of history writing. His best-known histories are ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), and ''Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations'' (1756). "My chief object," he wrote in 1739, "is not political or military history, it is the history of the arts, of commerce, of civilization – in a word, – of the human mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Sreedharan|title=A Textbook of Historiography: 500 BC to AD 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJVoi3PIejwC&amp;pg=PA115|year=2004|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history, and achievements in the arts and sciences. He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture, and political history.

[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) was a masterpiece of late 18th-century history writing.]]
At the same time, philosopher [[David Hume]] was having a similar impact on history in [[Great Britain]]. In 1754, he published the ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|History of England]]'', a six-volume work that extended from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688. Hume adopted a similar scope to Voltaire in his history; as well as the history of Kings, Parliaments, and armies, he examined the history of culture, including literature and science, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wertz | first1 = S.

B., ''Church and Society in the Scottish Enlightenment: The Moderate Literati of Edinburgh'', Princeton, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarship was painstaking for the time and he was able to access a large number of documentary sources that had previously been unstudied. He was also one of the first historians who understood the importance of general and universally applicable ideas in the shaping of historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/committees/commissions/centennial/history/021hoebel.pdf|title=William Robertson: An 18th Century Anthropologist-Historian|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apex of Enlightenment history was reached with [[Edward Gibbon]]'s, monumental six-volume work, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', published on 17 February 1776. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of [[primary source]]s, at the time its methodology became a model for later historians. This has led to Gibbon being called the first "modern historian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yH9rdaF1CckC|title=Theorists of the Modernist Novel: James Joyce, Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf|author=Deborah Parsons|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book sold impressively, earning its author a total of about £9000. Biographer [[Sir Leslie Stephen|Leslie Stephen]] wrote that thereafter, "His fame was as rapid as it has been lasting."

===19th century===
The tumultuous events surrounding the [[French Revolution]] inspired much of the historiography and analysis of the early 19th century. Interest in the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] was also rekindled by the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 in [[England]].

[[Thomas Carlyle]] published his magnum opus, the three-volume ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H.E. |last=Marshall |chapter-url=http://marshall.thefreelibrary.com/English-Literature-For-Boys-And-Girls/82-1 |chapter=Carlyle – The Sage Of Chelsea |title=English Literature For Boys And Girls |via=Farlex Free Library |access-date=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=8890 |title=Thomas Carlyle| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=2009-09-20|work=Professional Works|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting work had a passion new to historical writing. [[Thomas Macaulay]] produced his most famous work of history, ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second]]'', in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, Thomas Babington, ''History of England''. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., 1878. Vol. V, title page and prefatory "Memoir of Lord Macaulay".&lt;/ref&gt;  His writings are famous for their ringing prose and for their confident, sometimes dogmatic, emphasis on a progressive model of British history, according to which the country threw off superstition, autocracy and confusion to create a balanced constitution and a forward-looking culture combined with freedom of belief and expression. This model of human progress has been called the [[Whig history|Whig interpretation of history]].&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Western, ''Monarchy and Revolution. The English State in the 1680s'' (London: Blandford Press, 1972), p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jules Michelet portrait older.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Jules Michelet, later in his career.]]
In his main work ''Histoire de France'', French historian [[Jules Michelet]] coined the term [[Renaissance]] (meaning "Re-birth" in [[French language]]), as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The nineteen-volume work covered French history from [[Charlemagne]] to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. Michelet was one of the first historians to shift the emphasis of history to the common people, rather than the leaders and institutions of the country. Another important French historian of the period was [[Hippolyte Taine]]. He was the chief theoretical influence of French [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], a major proponent of [[sociological positivism]] and one of the first practitioners of [[Historicism|historicist]] criticism. Literary historicism as a critical movement has been said to originate with him.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, R. Gordon, ''"Literature and the Historian"'', American Quarterly, Vol. 26, No. 2 (1974), 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major progenitors of the history of [[cultural history|culture]] and [[art history|art]], was the Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/history/historian/Jacob_Burckhardt.html Jakob Burckhardt Renaissance Cultural History &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Burckhardt's best-known work is ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'' (1860). According to [[John Lukacs]], he was the first master of cultural history, which seeks to describe the spirit and the forms of expression of a particular age, a particular people, or a particular place.&lt;ref&gt;John Lukacs, Remembered Past: John Lukacs on History, Historians, and Historical Knowledge, ed. Mark G Malvasi and Jeffrey O. Nelson, Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, 2004, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, scholars were beginning to analyse the history of institutional change, particularly the development of constitutional government. [[William Stubbs]]'s  ''Constitutional History of England'' (3 vols., 1874–78) was an important influence on this developing field. The work traced the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain until 1485, and marked a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature/Stubbs, William]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] introduced the concept of [[historical materialism]] into the study of world historical development. In his conception, the economic conditions and dominant modes of production determined the structure of society at that point. Previous historians had focused on cyclical events of the rise and decline of rulers and nations. Process of [[nationalization of history]], as part of [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]]s in the 19th century, resulted with separation of "one's own" history from common [[universal history]] by such way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that constructed history as history of a nation.&lt;ref name = "laboratory"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f52rawP96lYC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22nationalisation+of+history%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nationalisation%20of%20history%22&amp;f=false|title=A Laboratory of Transnational History Ukraine and recent Ukrainian historiography|accessdate=October 18, 2010|author=Georgiy Kasianov, Philipp Terr|pages=7|quote=This essay deals with, what I call, "nationalized history", meaning a way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that requires separation of "one's own" history from "common" history and its construction as history of a nation.|isbn=978-1-84545-621-4|date=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new discipline, [[sociology]], emerged in the late 19th century and analyzed and compared these perspectives on a larger scale.

===Professionalization in Germany===
[[Image:Leopold Von Ranke 1877.jpg|thumb|200x200px|right|[[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]] established history as a professional academic discipline in Germany.]]
The modern academic study of history and methods of historiography were pioneered in 19th-century German universities. [[Leopold von Ranke]] was a pivotal influence in this regard, and is considered as the founder of modern source-based [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick C. Beiser (2011) ''The German Historicist Tradition'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=w2c6YaKf9usC&amp;pg=PA254 p.254]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janelle G. Reinelt, Joseph Roach (2007), ''Critical Theory and Performance'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=asORYuvznpQC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=rankean+positivism&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kH2XUI65MuTc4QTU8YHwBw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6wEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rankean%20positivism&amp;f=false p. 193]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern (ed.), ''The Varieties of History'', p. 54: "Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886) is the father as well as the master of modern historical scholarship."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green and Troup (eds.), ''The Houses of History'', p. 2: "Leopold von Ranke was instrumental in establishing professional standards for historical training at the University of Berlin between 1824 and 1871."&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, he implemented the seminar teaching method in his classroom, and focused on archival research and analysis of historical documents. Beginning with his first book in 1824, the ''History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514'', Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for an historian of the age, including "memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses". Over a career that spanned much of the century, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on [[primary source]]s ([[empiricism]]), an emphasis on [[narrative history]] and especially international politics (''[[political history|aussenpolitik]]'').&lt;ref&gt;E. Sreedharan, ''A textbook of historiography, 500&amp;nbsp;BC to AD&amp;nbsp;2000'' (2004) p 185&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources had to be hard, not speculations and rationalizations. His credo was to write history the way it was. He insisted on primary sources with proven authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Boldt, "Ranke: objectivity and history." ''Rethinking History'' 18.4 (2014): 457-474.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
The term [[Whig history]] was coined by [[Herbert Butterfield]] in his short book ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' in 1931, (a reference to the British [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]s, advocates of the power of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]) to refer to the approach to historiography that presents the past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater [[liberty]] and [[wikt:enlightenment|enlightenment]], culminating in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]]. In general, Whig historians emphasized the rise of [[constitutional government]], [[personal freedom]]s, and [[scientific progress]]. The term has been also applied widely in historical disciplines outside of [[British history]] (the [[history of science]], for example) to criticize any [[Teleology|teleological]] (or goal-directed), hero-based, and [[Transhistoricity|transhistorical]] narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mayr, "When Is Historiography Whiggish?" ''Journal of the History of Ideas,'' April 1990, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 301–309 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709517 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Butterfield's antidote to Whig history was "...to evoke a certain sensibility towards the past, the sensibility which studies the past 'for the sake of the past', which delights in the concrete and the complex, which 'goes out to meet the past', which searches for 'unlikenesses between past and present'."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Wilson and T. G. Ashplant, "Whig History and Present-Centred History," ''The Historical Journal'', 31 (1988): 1–16, at p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Butterfield's formulation received much attention, and the kind of historical writing he argued against in generalised terms is no longer academically respectable.&lt;ref&gt;''G. M. Trevelyan'' (1992), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marc Bloch.jpg|thumb|left|200x200px|The 20th century saw the creation of a huge variety of historiographical approaches. [[Marc Bloch]]'s focus on social history rather than traditional political history was of tremendous influence.]]
The French [[Annales School]] radically changed the focus of historical research in France during the 20th century by stressing long-term social history, rather than political or diplomatic themes. The school emphasized the use of quantification and the paying of special attention to geography.&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ Editions.ehess.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; An eminent member of this school, [[Georges Duby]], described his approach to history as one that &lt;blockquote&gt;relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society, and civilisation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marxist historiography]] developed as a school of historiography influenced by the chief tenets of [[Marxism]], including the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', which was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics from then on, e.g. the [[Fabian Society]]. [[R. H. Tawney]]'s ''The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century'' (1912)&lt;ref&gt;[[William Rose Benét]] (1988) p.&amp;nbsp;961&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (1926), reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. A [[Communist Party Historians Group|circle of historians]] inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946 and became a highly influential cluster of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]], who contributed to [[history from below]] and class structure in early capitalist society. Members included [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[E. P. Thompson]].

[[World history]], as a distinct field of historical study, emerged as an independent academic field in the 1980s. It focused on the examination of [[history]] from a global perspective and looked for common [[pattern]]s that emerged across all cultures. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s ten-volume ''A Study of History'', written between 1933 and 1954, was an important influence on this developing field. He took a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations and demonstrated that they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]] wrote ''The Rise of the West'' (1965) to improve upon Toynbee by showing how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNeill | first1 = William H. | year = 1995 | title = The Changing Shape of World History | url = | journal = History and Theory | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 8–26 | doi=10.2307/2505432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An undergraduate history degree is often used as a stepping stone to graduate studies in business or law. Many historians are employed at universities and other facilities for post-secondary education.&lt;ref name="blsgov"&gt;[http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos054.htm Bls.gov : Social Scientists, Other] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830051426/http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos054.htm |date=August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is normal for colleges and universities to require the PhD degree for new full-time hires, and a master's degree for part-timers. Publication is increasingly required by smaller schools, so graduate papers become journal articles and PhD dissertations become published monographs. The graduate student experience is difficult—those who finish their doctorate in the United States take on average 8 or more years; funding is scarce except at a few very rich universities. Being a teaching assistant in a course is required in some programs; in others it is a paid opportunity awarded a fraction of the students. Until the 1970s it was rare for graduate programs to teach how to teach; the assumption was that teaching was easy and that learning how to do research was the main mission.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kammen, "Some Reminiscences and Reflections on Graduate Education in History, ''Reviews in American History'' Volume 36, Number 3, Sept 2008 pp. 468-484 {{doi|10.1353/rah.0.0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Nugent, "Reflections: "Where Have All the Flowers Gone . . . When Will They Ever Learn?", ''Reviews in American History''  Volume 39, Number 1, March 2011, pp. 205-211 {{doi|10.1353/rah.2011.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional historians typically work in colleges and universities, archival centers, government agencies, museums, and as freelance writers and consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton and Robert B. Townsend, "The Parlous Paths of the Profession" [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2008/0810/0810pro1.cfm ''Perspectives on History'' (Sept. 2008) online]&lt;/ref&gt; The job market for new PhDs in history is poor and getting worse, with many relegated to part-time "adjunct" teaching jobs with low pay and no benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Townsend and Julia Brookins, "The Troubled Academic Job Market for History." ''Perspectives on History'' (2016) 54#2 pp 157-182 echoes Robert B. Townsend, "Troubling News on Job Market for History PhDs," [http://blog.historians.org/articles/953/troubling-news-on-job-market-for-history-phds ''AHA Today''  Jan. 4, 2010 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kino Border Initiative (KBI)''' since 2008 has united six [[Catholic church|Catholic]] organizations in an effort to be a humanizing presence and to foster bi-national solidarity on the issue of migration on the U.S.-Mexico border through direct assistance and accompaniment, education, research, and advocacy.

==History==
In 2008 and 2009 in [[Nogales, Arizona]], and [[Nogales, Sonora]], Mexico, this work was begun by six organizations: the California Province of the [[Society of Jesus]], [[Jesuit Refugee Service]]/USA, the Missionary Sisters of the Eucharist, the Mexican Province of the Society of Jesus, the [[Diocese of Tucson]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hermosillo|Archdiocese of Hermosillo]]. Its purpose is to break down barriers to humane, just, and workable migration, affirming human dignity and solidarity. KBI gives direct assistance and accompanies migrants, educates communities on both sides of the border, and collaborates with networks of research and advocacy to transform policy at all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asucatholic.org/MissionTrip|title=Mission Trip|website=All Saints Catholic Newman Center|language=en|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sees its work in continuity with the historic record of the USA in welcoming immigrants, and in support of international standards for the treatment of refugees.

'''Mining Machinery Engineering''' is an interdisciplinary branch of [[engineering]] that applies the principles of [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]] and [[mining engineering]] for analysis, design, manufacturing and maintenance of [[:Category:Mining equipment|mining equipment]]. It includes study of various aspects of equipment used in [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], [[mineral processing]], [[bulk material handling]], [[drilling]]  and [[construction]].

==History==

Surface mining equipment evolved at a high pace in the 20th century as the scale of mining grew up. In the first twenty years of the 1900s, steam power was largely replaced by [[internal combustion engines]] and [[electric motors]]. Till the 1970s such equipment mainly used mechanical system and cables for power transmission after which they started to be replaced by [[hydraulic drive system]] for small machines. However, mechanical and cable drives are still dominant in large machines.
Similar development took place in the development of underground machinery. [[Drilling]] and [[Rock blasting|blasting]] replaced manual cutting of ores. Lately, use of [[continuous mining machines]] has become order of the day to comply with environmental regulations, protect surface features and also to achieve increased production rate.
As the concern for safety in mines increased and highly stringent regulations were put in place, it required mining machinery engineers to be highly conversant with such regulations.

==Employment==

Since Mining Machinery Engineering is a wholesome branch, the course of which covers disciplines like [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Mining Engineering]], [[Mineral Engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering]], the employment opportunities are tremendous. Mining Machinery Engineering provides excellent career opportunities in various industries such as [[mining]], [[heavy earth moving equipment]], [[construction industry]], mineral processing and other related industries. It is recognized by the [[Ministry of Labor]], Government of India as equivalent to mechanical and electrical engineering for working in mines.

[[File:Model atmospheres Bengt Gustafsson.jpg|thumb|Some essential steps in model-atmosphere analysis for determining stellar abundances (Figure by Bengt Gustafsson, Astronomical Observatory, Uppsala).]]

The [[photosphere]] denotes those solar or stellar surface layers from which optical radiation escapes.  These stellar outer layers can be modeled by different computer programs. Often, calculated models are used, together with other programs, to calculate synthetic [[Spectrum|spectra]] for [[star]]s.  For example, in varying the assumed abundance of a chemical element, and comparing the synthetic spectra to observed ones, the abundance of that element in that particular star can be determined.
As computers have evolved, the complexity of the models has deepened, becoming more realistic in including more physical data and excluding more of the simplifying assumptions. This evolution of the models has also made them applicable to different kinds of stars.

== Common assumptions and computational methods ==

=== [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Local and global equilibrium|Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE)]] ===
This assumption (LTE) means that within any local computational volume, the state of thermodynamical equilibrium is assumed:
*	The inflow of radiation is determined by a [[Planck blackbody function|blackbody spectrum]] set by the local temperature only. This radiation then interacts with the matter inside the volume.
*	The number of atoms or molecules occupying different excited energy states is determined by the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. This distribution is determined by the atomic excitation energies, and the local temperature. 
*	The number of atoms in different ionization states is determined by the [[Saha equation]]. This distribution is determined by the atomic ionization energy, and the local temperature.

=== Plane parallel and spherical atmospheres ===
A common simplifying assumption is that the atmosphere is plane parallel, meaning that physical variables depend on one space coordinate only: the vertical depth (i.e., one assumes that we see the stellar atmosphere "head-on", ignoring the curved portions towards the limbs). In stars where the photosphere is relatively thick compared to the stellar diameter, this is not a good approximation and an assumption of a spherical atmosphere is more appropriate.

=== Expanding atmospheres ===
Many stars lose mass in the form of a stellar wind. Especially for stars which are very hot (photospheric temperatures &gt; 10,000 Kelvin) and very luminous, these winds can be so dense that major parts of the emergent spectrum are formed in an "expanding atmosphere", i.e. in layers that are moving outward with a high speed that can reach a few 1000&amp;nbsp;km/s.

=== [[Hydrostatic equilibrium]] ===
This means that the star is currently not undergoing any radical changes in structure involving large scale pulsations, flows or mass loss.

=== [[mixing length theory|Mixing length]] and [[microturbulence]] ===
This assumption means that the convective motions in the atmosphere are described by the mixing-length theory, modeled as parcels of gas rising and disintegrating. To account for some of the small-scale effects in convective motions, a parameter called microturbulence is often used. The microturbulence corresponds to the motions of atoms or molecules on scales smaller than the photon [[mean free path]].

=== Different methods of treating opacity ===
To fully model the photosphere one would need to include every absorption line of every element present. This is not feasible because it would be computationally extremely demanding, and also all spectra are not fully known. Therefore, one needs to simplify the treatment of opacity. Methods used in photospheric models include:
*	'''Opacity sampling (OS)'''
Opacity sampling means that the [[radiative transfer]] is evaluated for a number of optical wavelengths spread across the interesting parts of the spectrum.  Although the model would improve with more frequencies included, opacity sampling uses as few as practical, to still get a realistic model, thereby minimizing calculation time.
* '''Opacity distribution functions (ODF)'''
In using opacity distribution functions, the spectra are divided into subsections, within which the absorption probabilities are rearranged and simplified to one smooth function. Similar to the opacity sampling method, this is improved by adding more intervals but at the cost of prolonging the computation time.

== Different models ==
There are several different computer codes available modeling stellar photospheres. Some of them are described here and some of them are linked under "External links" below.

=== ATLAS ===
The ATLAS code was originally presented in 1970 by Robert Kurucz using the assumption of LTE and hydrostatic and plane parallel atmospheres. Since the source code is publicly available on the web, it has been amended by different persons numerous times over the years and nowadays exists in many versions. There are both plane parallel and spherical versions as well as those using opacity sampling or opacity distribution functions.

=== MARCS ===
The MARCS (Model Atmospheres in Radiative and Convective Scheme) code was originally presented in 1975 by Bengt Gustafsson, Roger Bell and others. The original code simulated stellar spectra assuming the atmosphere to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, plane parallel, with convection described by mixing-length theory. The evolution of the code has since involved better modeling of the line opacity (opacity sampling instead of opacity distribution functions), spherical modeling and including an increasing number of physical data.
Nowadays a large grid of different models is available on the web.

=== PHOENIX ===
The PHOENIX code is "risen from the ashes" of an earlier code called SNIRIS and mainly developed by Peter Hauschildt (Hamburger Sternwarte) from 1992 onwards; it is regularly updated and made available on the web. It runs in two different spatial configuration modes: the "classic" one-dimensional mode, assuming spherical symmetry, and the three-dimensional mode. It allows for calculations for many different astrophysical objects, i.e. supernovae, novae, stars and planets. It considers scattering and dust and allows for non-LTE computations over many atomic species, plus LTE over atoms and molecules.

=== PoWR ===
The PoWR (Potsdam Wolf-Rayet) code is designed for expanding stellar atmospheres, i.e. for stars with a stellar wind. It has been developed since the 1990s by Wolf-Rainer Hamann and collaborators at the Universität Potsdam (Germany) especially for simulating [[Wolf-Rayet stars]], which are hot stars with very strong mass loss. Adopting spherical symmetry and stationarity, the program computes the occupation numbers of the atomic energy states, including the ionization balance, in non-LTE, and consistently solves the radiative transfer problem in the comoving frame. The stellar wind parameters (mass-loss rate, wind speed) can be specified as free parameter, or, alternatively, calculated from the hydrodynamic equation consistently.
As the PoWR code treats consistently the static and expanding layers of the stellar atmosphere, it is applicable for any types of hot stars. The code as such is not yet public, but large sets of models for Wolf-Rayet stars are available on the web.

=== 3D [[hydrodynamic]]al models ===
There are efforts to construct models not assuming LTE, and/or computing the detailed hydrodynamic motions instead of hydrostatic assumptions. These models are physically more realistic but also require more physical data such as cross sections and probabilities for different atomic processes. Such models are computationally rather demanding, and have not yet reached a stage of broader distribution.

== Applications of Model Photospheres ==
Model Atmospheres, while interesting in their own right, are frequently used as part of input recipes and tools for studying other astrophysical problems.

=== Stellar Evolution ===
As a result of stellar evolution, changes in the internal structure of stars manifest themselves in the photosphere.

=== Synthetic Spectra ===
Spectral synthesis programs (e.g. [[Moog (code)]]) often use previously generated model photospheres to describe the physical conditions (temperature, pressure, etc...) through which photons must travel to escape the stellar atmosphere.  Together with a list of absorption lines and an elemental abundance table, spectral synthesis programs generate synthetic spectra.  By comparing these synthetic spectra to observed spectra of distant stars, astronomers can determine the properties (temperature, age, chemical composition, etc...) of these stars.

'''''Nature''''' is a British [[multidisciplinary]] [[scientific journal]], first published on 4 November 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huxley | first1 = T.

Research scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make many of the most important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated public. Towards the front of each issue are [[editorial]]s, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying ''supplementary material'' on the journal's website.

There are many fields of [[research]] in which important new advances and original research are published as either articles or letters in ''Nature.'' The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Fewer than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/get_published/index.html |title=Getting published in Nature : For authors and referees : Nature |website=nature.com |language=en |access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 ''Nature'' (together with ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'') received the [[Princess of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for Communications and Humanity.&lt;ref name=SciNat&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The enormous progress in science and mathematics during the 19th century was recorded in journals written mostly in German or French, as well as in English. Britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schroeder |first1=Robert |first2= Gretta E.|last2= Siegel | doi = 10.1353/scp.2006.0006 | year = 2006 | title = A Cooperative Publishing Model for Sustainable Scholarship| journal = Journal of Scholarly Publishing | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 86–98 (88)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English the most respected scientific journals of this time were the refereed journals of the [[Royal Society]], which had published many of the great works from [[Isaac Newton]], [[Michael Faraday]] through to early works from [[Charles Darwin]]. In addition, during this period, the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Bar3"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the editors of these popular science magazines, the publications were designed to serve as "organs of science", in essence, a means of connecting the public to the scientific world.&lt;ref name="Bar3"/&gt;

''Nature'', first created in 1869, was not the first magazine of its kind in Britain. One journal to precede ''Nature'' was ''[[Recreative Science: A Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation]]'', which, created in 1859, began as a [[natural history]] magazine and progressed to include more physical observational science and technical subjects and less natural history.&lt;ref name="Bar7"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's name changed from its original title to ''Intellectual Observer: A Review of Natural History, Microscopic Research, and Recreative Science'' and then later to the ''Student and Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art''.&lt;ref name="Bar6"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Recreative Science'' had attempted to include more physical sciences such as [[astronomy]] and [[archaeology]], the ''Intellectual Observer'' broadened itself further to include literature and art as well.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt; Similar to ''Recreative Science'' was the scientific journal ''[[Popular Science Review]]'', created in 1862,&lt;ref name="Bar13"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; which covered different fields of science by creating subsections titled "Scientific Summary" or "Quarterly Retrospect", with book reviews and commentary on the latest scientific works and publications.&lt;ref name="Bar13"/&gt; Two other journals produced in England prior to the development of ''Nature'' were the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' and ''[[Scientific Opinion]]'', established in 1864 and 1868, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt; The journal most closely related to ''Nature'' in its editorship and format was ''The Reader'', created in 1864; the publication mixed science with literature and art in an attempt to reach an audience outside of the scientific community, similar to ''Popular Science Review''.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt;

These similar journals all ultimately failed. The ''Popular Science Review'' survived longest, lasting 20 years and ending its publication in 1881; ''Recreative Science'' ceased publication as the ''Student and Intellectual Observer'' in 1871. The ''Quarterly Journal'', after undergoing a number of editorial changes, ceased publication in 1885. ''The Reader'' terminated in 1867, and finally, ''Scientific Opinion'' lasted a mere 2 years, until June 1870.&lt;ref name="Bar7"/&gt;

===Creation ===
[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First title page, 4 November 1869]]
Not long after the conclusion of ''The Reader'', a former editor, [[Norman Lockyer]], decided to create a new scientific journal titled ''Nature'',&lt;ref name="B248"&gt;[[#Browne|Browne]], ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; taking its name from a line by [[William Wordsworth]]: "To the solid ground of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww698.html Poem: "A Volant Tribe of Bards on earth are found"]. Bartleby.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; First owned and published by [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]], ''Nature'' was similar to its predecessors in its attempt to "provide cultivated readers with an accessible forum for reading about advances in scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Janet Browne has proposed that "far more than any other science journal of the period, ''Nature'' was conceived, born, and raised to serve polemic purpose."&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Many of the early editions of ''Nature'' consisted of articles written by members of a group that called itself the [[X Club]], a group of scientists known for having liberal, progressive, and somewhat controversial scientific beliefs relative to the time period.&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Initiated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the group consisted of such important scientists as [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[John Tyndall]], along with another five scientists and mathematicians; these scientists were all avid supporters of Darwin's theory of evolution as [[common descent]], a theory which, during the latter half of the 19th century, received a great deal of criticism among more conservative groups of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne]], ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps it was in part its scientific liberality that made ''Nature'' a longer-lasting success than its predecessors. [[John Maddox]], editor of ''Nature'' from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995, suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal's centennial edition that perhaps it was the journalistic qualities of Nature that drew readers in; "journalism" Maddox states, "is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other. This is what Lockyer's journal did from the start."&lt;ref name="Dinner"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1970|title=The 'Nature' Centenary Dinner|jstor=530861|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 25|issue=1|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1970.0002 |pages=9–15(13)|author1=Maddox, John  |author2=Macmillan, Harold  |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Maddox mentions that the financial backing of the journal in its first years by the Macmillan family also allowed the journal to flourish and develop more freely than scientific journals before it.&lt;ref name="Dinner"/&gt;
 
====Editors====
[[Norman Lockyer]], the founder of ''Nature'', was a professor at [[Imperial College]]. He was succeeded as editor in 1919 by [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]].&lt;ref name="NPG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml/02_history.xml&amp;style=xml/02_history.xsl |title=Nature Publishing Group: History |website=nature.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115084545/http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml%2F02_history.xml&amp;style=xml%2F02_history.xsl |archivedate=15 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory helped to establish ''Nature'' in the international scientific community. His obituary by the Royal Society stated: "Gregory was always very interested in the international contacts of science, and in the columns of ''Nature'' he always gave generous space to accounts of the activities of the International Scientific Unions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Richard Arman Gregory, 1864–1952|journal= Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume= 8|issue=22|pages=410–417 (413)|year=1953|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1953.0007 |author=Stratton, F. J. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years 1945 to 1973, editorship of ''Nature'' changed three times, first in 1945 to A. J. V. Gale and [[L. J. F. Brimble]] (who in 1958 became the sole editor), then to [[John Maddox]] in 1965, and finally to [[David 'Dai' Davies|David Davies]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt; In 1980, Maddox returned as editor and retained his position until 1995. [[Philip Campbell (scientist)|Philip Campbell]] has since become Editor-in-chief of all ''Nature'' publications.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt;

====Expansion and development====
In 1970, ''Nature'' first opened its Washington office; other branches opened in New York in 1985, Tokyo and Munich in 1987, Paris in 1989, San Francisco in 2001, Boston in 2004, and Hong Kong in 2005. In 1971, under [[John Maddox]]'s editorship, the journal split into ''Nature Physical Sciences'' (published on Mondays), ''Nature New Biology'' (published on Wednesdays) and ''Nature'' (published on Fridays). In 1974, Maddox was no longer editor, and the journals were merged into ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, the journal underwent a great deal of expansion, launching over ten new journals. These new journals comprise the Nature Publishing Group, which was created in 1999 and includes ''Nature'', Nature Publishing Group Journals, Stockton Press Specialist Journals and Macmillan Reference (renamed NPG Reference).

In 1996, ''Nature'' created its own website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/timeline2.html|title = Branching out (1970–1999)|date = |accessdate = 2014-11-13|website = nature.com|publisher = Nature Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 Nature Publishing Group began its series of ''Nature Reviews''.&lt;ref name="NPG" /&gt; Some articles and papers are available for free on the Nature website. Others require the purchase of premium access to the site. ''Nature'' claims an online readership of about 3 million unique readers per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-a-new-ipad-app-for-nature-readers-1.12002 | title=Announcement: A new iPad app for Nature readers | work=Nature | date=12 December 2012 | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2008, ''Nature'' endorsed an American presidential candidate for the first time when it supported [[Barack Obama]] during his campaign in [[United States presidential election, 2008|America's 2008 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/4551149a |title=America's choice |year=2008 |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7217 |page=1149 |bibcode=2008Natur.455Q1149. |pmid=18971969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Angliss |url=http://www.scholarsandrogues.com/2008/10/31/nature-endorses-obama/ |title=Weekly science journal ''Nature'' endorses a presidential candidate: Barack Obama (updated) |website=Scholars &amp; Rogues |date=31 October 2008 |access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, an [[Nature Arabic Edition|Arabic edition]] of the magazine was launched in partnership with [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]]. As of the time it was released, it had about 10,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name=NatureME&gt;{{cite web |last= Yahia |first= Mohammed |title= Nature Arabic Edition launches |quote= The first issue of ''Nature Arabic Edition'', an Arabic translation of ''Nature'', has been released.

On 2 December 2014, ''Nature'' announced that it would allow its subscribers and a group of selected media outlets to share links allowing free, "read-only" access to content from its journals. These articles are presented using the [[digital rights management]] system [[ReadCube]] (which is funded by the Macmillan subsidiary Digital Science), and does not allow readers to download, copy, print, or otherwise distribute the content. While it does, to an extent, provide free online access to articles, it is not a true [[open access]] scheme due to its restrictions on re-use and distribution.&lt;ref name=wired-naturefreeview&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature journal subscribers can now share article links globally|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-12/02/nature-publishing|website=Wired.co.uk|accessdate=3 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202182430/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-12/02/nature-publishing|archivedate=2 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-npgreadonly&gt;{{cite news|title=Science journal ''Nature'' to make archives available online|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/02/nature-archives-free|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2015, details of a proposed merger with Springer Science+Business Media were announced.&lt;ref&gt;Schuetze, Arno (15 January 2015). [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/15/publishing-ma-idUSF9N0TV00F20150115 "Nature magazine publisher to merge with Springer Science"]. [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 it came under the umbrella of Springer Nature, by the merger of [[Springer Science+Business Media]] and [[Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]]'s [[Nature Publishing Group]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], and [[Macmillan Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/about-springer/media/press-releases/corporate/springer-nature-created-following-merger-completion/256626 |title=Springer Nature created following merger completion |date=6 May 2015 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication in Nature==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2011}}

Being published in ''Nature'' or any ''Nature'' publication is very prestigious. In particular, empirical papers are often highly cited, which can lead to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these [[positive feedback]] effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like ''Nature'' and its closest competitor, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', can be very fierce. ''Nature''{{'}}s [[impact factor]], a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by [[Institute for Scientific Information|Thomson ISI]]), among the highest of any science journal.

As with most other professional scientific journals, papers undergo an initial screening by the editor, followed by [[peer review]] (in which other scientists, chosen by the editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review, will read and critique articles), before publication. In the case of ''Nature'', they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground-breaking in that particular field. As a consequence, the majority of submitted papers are rejected without review.

According to ''Nature''{{'}}s original [[mission statement]]:
{{quote|It is intended, FIRST, to place before the general public the grand results of Scientific Work and Scientific Discovery; and to urge the claims of Science to a more general recognition in Education and in Daily Life; and, SECONDLY, to aid Scientific men themselves, by giving early information of all advances made in any branch of Natural knowledge throughout the world, and by affording them an opportunity of discussing the various Scientific questions which arise from time to time.&lt;ref name=nature1869&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/mission.html |title=Nature's mission statement |accessdate=11 September 2008 |work= nature.com|date=11 November 1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was revised in 2000 to:
{{quote|First, to serve scientists through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of science, and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning science. Second, to ensure that the results of science are rapidly disseminated to the public throughout the world, in a fashion that conveys their significance for knowledge, culture and daily life.&lt;ref name=nature2000&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/about/index.html |title=Nature's mission statement |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Controversies===
In 2017, Nature published an editorial entitled "Removing Statues of Historical figures risks whitewashing history: Science must acknowledge mistakes as it marks its past". The article commented on the placement and maintenance of statues honouring scientists with known unethical, abusive and torturous histories. Specifically, the editorial called on examples of [[J. Marion Sims]], the 'Father of gynecology' who experimented on African American female slaves who were unable to give informed consent, and [[Thomas Parran Jr.]] who oversaw the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].  The editorial as written made the case that removing such statues, and erasing names, runs the risk of "whitewashing history", and stated “Instead of removing painful reminders, perhaps these should be supplemented”. The article caused a large outcry and was quickly modified by Nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Science must acknowledge its past mistakes and crimes |date=4 September 2017 |url=https://www.nature.com/news/science-must-acknowledge-its-past-mistakes-and-crimes-1.22557?sf111543858=1&amp;WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was largely seen as offensive, inappropriate, and by many, racist. Nature acknowledged that the article as originally written was "offensive and poorly worded" and published selected letters of response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Readers respond to Nature’s Editorial on historical monuments |date=8 September 2017 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/readers-respond-to-nature-s-editorial-on-historical-monuments-1.22584 |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial came just weeks after hundreds of white supremacists marched in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in the [[Unite the Right Rally|Unite the Right rally]] to oppose the removal of [[Robert Edward Lee Sculpture|a statue of Robert E. Lee]], setting off violence in the streets and killing a young woman. When Nature posted a link to the editorial on [[Twitter]], the thread quickly exploded with criticisms. In response, several scientists called for a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schulson |first=Michael |title=History Lessons for ‘Nature’|date=17 September 2017 |newspaper=Undark Magazine |url=https://undark.org/article/nature-journal-j-marion-sims/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2017, the editorial was updated and edited by Philip Campbell, the editor of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Campbell |first=Philip |title=Statues: An Editorial Response|date= 18 September 2017 |newspaper=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/549334c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Paul Lauterbur]] and [[Peter Mansfield]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for research initially rejected by ''Nature'' and published only after Lauterbur appealed the rejection, ''Nature'' acknowledged more of its own missteps in rejecting papers in an editorial titled, "Coping with Peer Rejection":
{{quote|[T]here are unarguable ''faux pas'' in our history. These include the rejection of [[Čherenkov radiation|Cherenkov radiation]], [[Hideki Yukawa]]'s [[meson]], work on [[photosynthesis]] by [[Johann Deisenhofer]], [[Robert Huber]] and [[Hartmut Michel]], and the initial rejection (but eventual acceptance) of [[Stephen Hawking]]'s [[Hawking radiation|black-hole radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6959/full/425645a.html |journal=Nature |date=16 October 2003 |title=Coping with peer rejection |volume=425 |page=645 |doi=10.1038/425645a |pmid=14562060 |issue=6959 |bibcode=2003Natur.425..645.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 2000 to 2001, a series of five fraudulent papers by [[Schön scandal|Jan Hendrik Schön]] was published in ''Nature''. The papers, about [[semiconductors]], were revealed to contain falsified data and other scientific fraud. In 2003, ''Nature'' retracted the papers. The Schön scandal was not limited to ''Nature''; other prominent journals, such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Physical Review]]'', also retracted papers by Schön.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v422/n6927/index.html |journal=Nature |date=6 March 2003 |title=Retractions' realities |volume=422 |issue=6927 |page=1 |doi=10.1038/422001a |pmid=12621394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1988, after nearly a year of guided scrutiny from its editors, ''Nature'' published a controversial and seemingly anomalous paper detailing Dr. [[Jacques Benveniste]] and his team's work studying human [[Basophil granulocyte|basophil]] [[degranulation]] in the presence of extremely dilute [[antibody]] serum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vet-servis.ru/downloads/nature333-30-1988.pdf |title=vet-servis.ru |publisher=Vet-servis.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, their paper concluded that less than a single molecule of antibody could trigger an immune response in human basophils, defying the physical [[law of mass action]]. The paper excited substantial media attention in Paris, chiefly because their research sought funding from [[homeopathic]] medicine companies. Public inquiry prompted ''Nature'' to mandate an extensive, stringent and scientifically questionable experimental [[replication (statistics)|replication]] in Benveniste's lab, through which his team's results were categorically refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Before publishing one of its most famous discoveries, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s 1953 [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid|paper]] on the [[structure of DNA]], ''Nature'' did not send the paper out for peer review. [[John Maddox]], ''Nature''{{'}}s editor, stated: "the Watson and Crick paper was not peer-reviewed by ''Nature'' ... the paper could not have been refereed: its correctness is self-evident. No referee working in the field ... could have kept his mouth shut once he saw the structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maddox |first1=J. |doi=10.1038/426119b |title=How genius can smooth the road to publication |journal=Nature |volume=426 |issue=6963 |page=119 |year=2003|bibcode=2003Natur.426..119M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier error occurred when [[Enrico Fermi]] submitted his breakthrough paper on the weak [[Fermi's interaction|interaction theory]] of [[beta decay]]. ''Nature'' turned down the paper because it was considered too remote from reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhodes, Richard |title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb|publisher= Touchstone|location= New York|date= 1986|isbn= 0-671-44133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi's paper was published by ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fermi |first1=E. |title=Versuch einer Theorie der β-Strahlen.

==Science fiction==
In 1999 ''Nature'' began publishing [[science fiction]] [[short stories]]. The brief "[[vignette (literature)|vignettes]]" are printed in a series called "Futures". The stories appeared in 1999 and 2000, again in 2005 and 2006, and have appeared weekly since July 2007.&lt;ref name="futures"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/arts/futures/ | title=Futures | work=Nature | accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister publication ''[[Nature Physics]]'' also printed stories in 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="FuturesPhysics"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/nphys/archive/categ_fut_012008.html |title=Futures Archive |work= [[Nature Physics]] |accessdate= 2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''Nature'' was awarded the [[European Science Fiction Society]]'s Best Publisher award for the "Futures" series.&lt;ref name="ESFSAward"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esfs.info/esfs-awards-2000.html#2005 |title= The ESFS Awards, Eurocon 2005: Glasgow – Scotland |author= [[European Science Fiction Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred of the ''Nature'' stories between 1999 and 2006 were published as the collection ''Futures from Nature'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="FuturesCollection"&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.tor-forge.com/futuresfromnature |title= Futures from Nature: 100 Speculative fictions from the pages of the leading science journal |editor= Henry Gee |publisher= [[Tor Books]] |date= 2008 |location= New York City |isbn= 0-7653-1805-9 |quote= With stories from: [[Arthur C.

''Nature'' is edited and published in the United Kingdom by a division of the international [[scientific publishing]] company [[Springer Nature]] that publishes [[academic journal]]s, [[magazine]]s, online databases, and services in science and medicine. ''Nature'' has offices in London, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., [[Boston]], Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris, [[Munich]], and [[Basingstoke]]. Nature Publishing Group also publishes other specialized journals including ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', ''[[Nature Biotechnology]],'' ''[[Nature Methods]]'', the ''[[Nature Clinical Practice]]'' series of journals, ''[[Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology]]'', ''[[Nature Chemistry]]'', and the ''Nature Reviews'' series of journals.

Since 2005, each issue of ''Nature'' has been accompanied by a ''[[Nature Podcast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/archive.html | work = Nature |title = Archive: Nature Podcast |accessdate = 2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring highlights from the issue and interviews with the articles' authors and the journalists covering the research. It is presented by Kerri Smith, and features interviews with scientists on the latest research, as well as news reports from Nature's editors and journalists. The Nature Podcast was founded – and the first 100 episodes were produced and presented – by clinician and virologist [[Chris Smith, The Naked Scientist|Chris Smith]] of Cambridge and ''[[The Naked Scientists]]''.

In 2007, Nature Publishing Group began publishing ''Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics'', the official journal of the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics and ''Molecular Therapy'', the American Society of Gene Therapy's official journal, as well as the ''International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME) Journal''. Nature Publishing Group launched ''Nature Photonics'' in 2007 and ''Nature Geoscience'' in 2008. ''Nature Chemistry'' published its first issue in April 2009.

Nature Publishing Group actively supports the self-archiving process and in 2002 was one of the first publishers to allow authors to post their contributions on their personal websites, by requesting an exclusive licence to publish, rather than requiring authors to transfer copyright. In December 2007, Nature Publishing Group introduced the Creative Commons attribution-non commercial-share alike unported licence for those articles in Nature journals that are publishing the primary sequence of an organism's genome for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1864.html |title=Interview with Timo Hannay, director of web publishing for Nature Publishing Group |work=Jon Udell's Interviews with Innovators |date=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a collection of articles from ''Nature'' was edited by John S. Partington under the title ''H. G.

The '''Newcomen Society''' is an [[International]] [[learned society]] that promotes and celebrates the history of [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. It was founded in [[London]] in 1920 and takes its name from [[Thomas Newcomen]], one of the inventors associated with the early development of the [[steam engine]] and who is widely considered the "father of the Industrial Revolution".

The motto of the Society is the [[Latin]] ''actorum memores simul affectamus agenda'', meaning "mindful of things that have taken place, at the same time we strive after things yet to be done". The choice of a [[griffin]] [[regardant]] for the logo was to symbolise vigilance and looking backward while going forward.

The Newcomen Society is based at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London. There are regional branches in England: Midlands ([[Birmingham]]), North West ([[Manchester]]), North East ([[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]), Western ([[Bristol]]) and Southern ([[Portsmouth]]), and one in Scotland ([[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]).

The Society is concerned with all branches of engineering: [[civil engineering|civil]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[Electronic engineering|electronic]], [[structural engineering|structural]], [[aeronautical engineering|aeronautical]], [[marine engineering|marine]], [[chemical engineering|chemical]] and [[manufacturing]] as well as [[biography]] and [[invention]].

It publishes the '''International Journal for the History of Engineering and Technology''' (formerly the Transactions of the Newcomen Society) and '''Newcomen Links''', a quarterly newsletter. An online archive of previous Transactions is also available to members of the Society.

An American branch was established in 1923, but the [[Newcomen Society of the United States]] was entirely separate from its UK counterpart in 2007, when the chairman and trustees announced its closure.

'''Political decay''' is a political theory, originally described by [[Samuel P. Huntington]],&lt;ref name=World_Politics&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2009286|author=Huntington, Samuel P.|title=Political Development and Political Decay|journal=World Politics|volume=17|number=3 |year=1965|pages=386–430|doi=10.2307/2009286}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes how chaos and disorder can arise from social modernization increasing more rapidly than political and institutional modernization. Huntington provides different definitions for political development and describes the forms of political decay according to the various definitions. Huntington focuses primarily on political development as modernization and institutionalization. However, he points to the different definitions of political development as being arbitrary ways to understanding the rise of political systems and the relationship between the political systems in different nations.

==Political development==
Huntington identifies two characteristics of political development. The first is that development is synonymous with [[modernization]], thus political development can be defined as political modernization. The second is that there are many criteria to measure political development because modernization and development are such broad topics, covering many areas. There are four generally agreed-upon criteria to determine political development. The first is [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], which involves the movement from [[Political particularism|particularism]] to [[universalism]], or, from a political standpoint, a focus on functional differentiation and achievement criteria. The second criterion is [[nationalism]], and national integration. This emphasizes nation-states and nation-building as a key aspect of political development. The third criterion is a focus on [[democratization]], which is in essence a focus on competition and equalization of power. The final criterion is [[mobilization]], which is a focus on political participation. The greater the development, the greater the modernization, the greater the mobilization, and therefore the greater the political participation. Ultimately, political development can be defined as an increase in national political unity and an increase in political participation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Modernization===

According to Huntington's definition of political development as modernization, political decay is the opposite of the linear idea of social progress—although, within the model of modernization, social regression is not possible. Instead, political decay takes place because "modern and modernizing states can change by losing capabilities as well as by gaining them. In addition, a gain in any one capability usually involves costs in others."&lt;ref name=World_Politics/&gt;{{rp|393}} The model of modernization was used to compare the political systems of different countries with social development reflecting the linear progression of political institutions.&lt;ref name=World_Politics/&gt;{{rp|391}} However, research into the relationship between development of political institutions and modernization has pointed to inconsistent development. In some political systems, such as certain Latin American regions, governments have been influenced by military intervention as a result of the government's inability to cope with the strains of modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Geller, Daniel S. "Economic Modernization and Political Instability: A Casual Analysis of Bureaucratic-Authoritarianism" ''The Western Political Quarterly'' 35, no. 1 (March 1982): 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional===

Under the framework of political development as institutional development, political decay occurs when institutions fail to change or adapt when they become unnecessary due to social or economic changes. Dan Halvorson challenges the idea of political decay as an institutional failure by claiming that the idea of political decay is tied to a Western ideal of political institution without taking into account widely-varying cultural institutions and the inability of post-colonial states to adapt to Western ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Halvorson, Dan. States of Disorder: ''Understanding State Failure and Intervention in the Periphery''. Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2013. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama refers to political decay as the social and economic forces that upset the equilibrium of established political order.&lt;ref name=Fukuyama&gt;Fukuyama, Francis, The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions of the Roman Empire government failed to meet the moral and economic needs of the citizens, resulting in the conditions that would facilitate political decay and the fall of the Roman state.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, James Harrington. "Permanence of the American Democracy" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 30, no. 1 (July 1924): 3&lt;/ref&gt; Under the institutional model, political decay can be observed as a decrease in competence and credibility and establishment of institutional corruption over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Crawford. "Zaire: Is There a State?" ''Canadian Journal of African Studies'' 18, no. 1 (1984): 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instability==

Different social and economic factors contribute to both the political development as well as the political decay of nations. Outside forces such as foreign governments affect the stability of established governments due to contrasting social institutions or economic interests. In order to be considered stable, government procedures and institutions must maintain autonomy and be resistant to outside agents.&lt;ref name=World_Politics/&gt;{{rp|402}} The social and economic forces that established political stability could change or disappear, leading to internal instability.&lt;ref name=Fukuyama/&gt; Economic development, such as shifts from agriculture-based economy to manufacturing-based economy, as well as economic collapse, can also lead to political instability. Social developments, such as the proliferation of literacy, lead to the rise and spread of new ideas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Political instability===

Political instability occurs when one faction in a state's government is in opposition with another faction or with another institution in government. Sri Lanka saw a period of political instability following elections in 1994 caused by the ambitions of political leaders. The elected President Kumaratunga attempted to change the constitution and dissolve the parliament in order to remain in power, leading to sudden changes in the structure of the law-making body.&lt;ref&gt;DeVotta, Niel. "Sri Lanka in 2004: Enduring Political Decay and a Failing Peace Process." ''Asian Survey'' 15, no. 1 (January/February 2005: 98-104&lt;/ref&gt; Political instability occurred during the late 18th century in France and other parts of Europe during the 19th century. Political development in France, such as the development of the bureaucracy and other institutions, led to a greater demand for meritocracy and greater political conflict among the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Gillis, John R. "Political Decay and the European Revolutions, 1789-1848." ''World Politics'' 22, no. 3 (April 1970): 344-370.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, political breakdown can occur within the framework of a state's constitution. India has provisions its constitution which grant leaders the power to breach or oppose the constitution in cases of emergency. These breaches of the state law from within the political system can lead to political decay.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Henry C. "The Indian Constitution: Political Development and Decay." ''Asian Survey'' 20, no. 4 (April 1980): 428-451&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social developments===

Huntington's model of political development and decay describes elements such as industrialization, urbanization, education and literacy as social developments that create instability. The presence of violent conflict is not always indicative of social decay. Due to the complex character of state-building and shifts in political systems, violence is not a reliable indicator of political decay or development.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Youssef, Brown, Brian R., Orgnaski, A.F.K. "The Paradoxical Nature of State Making: The Violent Creation of Order." ''The American Political Science Review'' 75, no. 4 (December 1981): 901-910&lt;/ref&gt; The socialization of law is a process by which legislation is changed in order to adapt to economic and social changes. Socialization of law is one of the forces that opposes political decay within Huntington's structure of modernization, by ensuring that the political institutions in place are resistant to social instability.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, James Harrington. "Permanence of the American Democracy." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 30, no. 1 (July 1924): 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Updated by Fukuyama==
Huntington's former student, [[Francis Fukuyama]], has developed the theory of political decay by analysing the sclerosis of democratic institutions in the United States and elsewhere. The second of Fukuyama's two volumes on political order, ''[[Political Order and Political Decay]]'' (2014), echoes the title of Huntington's seminal 1965 essay. Fukuyama focuses on the concept of political decay in the framework of a history of the rise and fall of Chinese dynasties and the causes of political and social stability during each dynasty.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Political psychology''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field dedicated to understanding [[politics]], [[politician]]s and [[political behavior]] from a [[psychology|psychological]] perspective. The relationship between politics and psychology is considered bi-directional, with psychology being used as a lens for understanding politics and politics being used as a lens for understanding psychology. As an interdisciplinary field, political psychology borrows from a wide range of other disciplines, including: [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[economics]], [[philosophy]], [[Media (communication)|media]], [[journalism]] and [[history]].

Political psychology aims to understand interdependent relationships between individuals and contexts that are influenced by beliefs, motivation, perception, cognition, information processing, learning strategies, socialization and attitude formation. Political psychological theory and approaches have been applied in many contexts such as: leadership role; domestic and foreign policy making; behavior in ethnic violence, war and genocide; group dynamics and conflict; racist behavior; voting attitudes and motivation; voting and the role of the media; nationalism; and political extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology|edition = 2nd |publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence political psychologists study the foundations, dynamics, and outcomes of political behavior using cognitive and social explanations.

==History and early influences==

===France===
Political psychology originated from Western Europe, France, where it was closely tied to the emergence of new disciplines and paradigms as well as to the precise social and political context in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., 'Outline of a cultural history of political psychology'. Chapter 1, pp. 3-22 in: Stone, W. &amp; Schaffner, P. (1988), The psychology of politics. New York: Springer (2nd ed.). More elaborate backgrounds in: Van Ginneken. J. (1992). Crowds, psychology and politics. New York: Cambridge University Press. And its sequel: Van Ginneken, J. (2007). Mass movements. Apeldoorn (Neth.): Spinhuis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The discipline political psychology was formally introduced during the Franco-Prussian war and the socialist revolution, stirred by the rise of the [[Paris Commune]] (1871).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Monroe, K.R.|year=2002 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "political psychology" was first introduced by the [[ethnologist]] Adolph Bastian in his book ''[[Man in History]]'' (1860). The philosopher [[Hippolyte Taine]] (1828–1893), a founder of the Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, applied Bastian's theories in his works ''[[The Origins of Contemporary France]]'' (1875–1893), to ideas on the founding and development of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. The head of Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, [[Emile Boutmy]] (1835–1906), was a famous explorer of social, political and geographical concepts of national interactions. He contributed various works on political psychology such as ''English People; A study of their Political Psychology'' (1901) and ''The American People; Elements of Their Political Psychology'' (1902).&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudmin |first=F. W. |title= G.B.Grundy's 1917 Proposal for Political Psychology: "A science shich has yet to be Created" |journal= ISPP News |year=2005 |volume=16 |pages=6–7 |url= http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/RudminGrundyBio6.pdf|accessdate=5 Dec 2011 |doi= |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contributor of [[Crowd psychology|crowd theory]] [[Gustave Le Bon]] (1841–1931) suggested that crowd activity subdued will and polluted rational thought which resulted in uncontrollable impulses and emotions. He suggested in his works ''Psychology of Socialism'' (1896) and ''Political Psychology and Social Defense'' (1910)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Monroe, K.R.|year=2002 |title= Political Psychology (p.70)|edition=2nd|publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in the uncontrollable state of a crowd people were more vulnerable to submission and leadership, and suggested that embracing [[nationalism]] would remedy this.

===Italy===
Meanwhile in Italy, the [[Risorgimento]] (1870) instigated various social reforms and voting rights. The large division in social class during this period led lawyer [[Gaetano Mosca]] (1858–1914) to publish his work, ''The Ruling Class: Elements of Political Science'' (1896), which theorized the presence of the ruling and the ruled classes of all societies.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The psychology of Politics|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing| page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1828–1923), inspired by Mosca's concepts, contributed ''The Rise and Fall of the Elites'' (1901) and ''The Socialist System'' (1902–1903) to the discipline of political psychology, theorizing on the role of class and social systems. His work ''[[The Mind and Society]]'' (1916) offers a sociology [[treatise]].&lt;ref name="VanGinneken-c1"&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.9)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosca and Pareto's texts on the Italian elite contributed to the theories of Robert Michels (1875–1936). Michels was a German socialist fascinated by the distinction between the largely lower class run parliament in Germany and upper class run parliament in Italy. He wrote ''Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchic Tendencies of Modern Democracy'' (1911).&lt;ref name="VanGinneken-c1" /&gt;

===Austria===
A large psychoanalytical influence was contributed to the discipline of political psychology by [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939). His texts ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913) and ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1921) linked psychoanalysis with politics. Freud and [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|Bullitt]] (1967) developed the first psychobiographical explanation to how the personality characteristics of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] affected his decision making during World War I. [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897–1957), inspired by the effects of World War II, was interested in whether personality types varied according to epoch, culture and class. He described the bidirectional effect of group, society and the environment with personality. He combined Freudian and [[Marxist]] theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' (1933). He also edited ''The Journal for Political Psychology and Sexual Economy'' (1934–1938) which was the first journal to present political psychology in the principal of western language.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.11)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany, novice political alterations and [[fascist]] control during World War II spurred research into authoritarianism from [[Frankfurt school]]. Philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] (1898–1979) opened up issues concerning freedom and authority in his book, ''[[Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory]]'' (1941), where he suggested groups compromise on individual rights. [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969) also investigated authoritarian individuals and anti-Semitism. His report ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) attempts to determine the personality type susceptible to following fascism and anti-democratic propaganda. Nazi movements during World War II also spurred controversial psychologists such as [[Walther Poppelreuter]] (1932) to lecture and write about political psychology that identified with Hitler. The psychologist [[Eric Jaensch]] (1883–1940) contributed the racist book ''The Anti-type'' (1933).

===United Kingdom===
At the turn of the century, [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]] introduced disciplinary political psychology courses such as "The Sciences of the Man", along with the foundation of the Psychological society (1901) and the Sociological society (1904).&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.15)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford historian [[G. B. Grundy]] (1861–1948) noted political psychology (1917) as a sub-discipline of history. Motivated by social and political behavior during World War I, he deemed a new branch of historical science, "The Psychology of Men Acting in Masses".&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7" /&gt; He referred to science to instrument the clarification of mistaken beliefs about intention.&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7" /&gt; The intellectual [[Graham Wallas]] (1859–1932) implicated the significance of studying psychology in politics in  ''Human Nature in Politics'' (1908). Wallace emphasized the importance of enlightening politicians and the public about the psychological processes in order to raise awareness on exploitation while developing control over one's own psychological intellect. He suggested in ''[[Great Society (book)|Great Society]]'' (1917) that recognition of such processes could help to build a more functional humanity.

===United States===
Across the Atlantic the first American to be considered a political psychologist was [[Harold Lasswell]] (1902–1978) whose research was also spurred by a sociological fascination of World War I. His work ''Propaganda Technique in the World War'' (1927) discussed the use of applying psychological theories in order to enhance propaganda technique.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.19)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasswell moved to Europe shortly after where he started to tie Freudian and Adler personality theories to politics and published ''Psychopathology and Politics'' (1930). His major theories involved the motives of the politically active and the relation between propaganda and personality.

Another contributing factor to the development of Political Psychology was the introduction of psychometrics and "The Measurement of Attitude" by [[Thurstone]] and [[Chave]] (1929). The methodological revolution in social science gave quantitative grounds and therefore more credibility to Political Psychology. Research into political preference during campaigns was spurred by [[George Gallup]] (1901–1984), who founded the "American Institute of Public Opinion". The 1940s election in America drew a lot of attention in connection with the start of World War II. Gallup, Roper and Crossley instigated research into the chances of Roosevelt being re-elected. Lazarsfeld, Berelson and Gaudet (1944) also conducted a famous panel study "The People's Choice" on the 1940s election campaign. These studies drew attention to the possibility of measuring political techniques using psychological theories.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.20)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the US into World War II spiraled vast research into fields such as war technique, propaganda, group moral, psycho-biography and culture conflict to name a few, with the U.S. army and Navy recruiting young psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.21)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the discipline quickly developed and gained international accreditation.

McGuire identifies three broad phases in the development of political psychology, these three phases are:
1.The era of [[personality studies]] in the 1940s and 1950s dominated by psychoanalysis 
2.The era of [[political attitudes]] and voting behavior studies in the 1960s and 1970s characterized by the popularity of "rational man" assumptions
3.An era since the 1980s and 1990s, which has focused on [[political beliefs]], information processing and decision making, and has dealt in particular with international politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=David Patrick Houghton|year=2013 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and politics==

The study of [[Personality psychology|personality]] in political psychology focuses on the effects of leadership personality on decision-making, and the consequences of mass personality on leadership boundaries. Key personality approaches utilized in political psychology are psychoanalytic theories, trait-based theories and motive-based theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.15)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A psychoanalytical approach===
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) made significant contributions to the study of personality in political psychology through his theories on the unconscious motives of behavior. Freud suggested that a leader's behavior and decision making skill were largely determined by the interaction in their personality of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#id|id]], [[Id, ego and super-ego#ego|ego]] and [[superego]], and their control of the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] and [[reality principle]]. The psychoanalytic approach has also been used extensively in psychobiographies of political leaders. Psychobiographies draw inferences from personal, social and political development, starting from childhood, to understand behavior patterns that can be implemented to predict decision-making motives and strategies.

===A trait-based approach===
Traits are personality characteristics that show to be stable over time and in different situations, creating predispositions to perceive and respond in particular ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press| page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] (1897-1967) realized the study of traits introducing central, secondary, cardinal and common traits. These four distinctions suggest that people demonstrate traits to varying degrees, and further that there is a difference between individual and common traits to be recognized within a society. [[Hans Eysenck]] (1916-1997) contributed three major traits, currently however [[Paul Costa Jr|Costa]] and [[Robert R. McCrae|McCrae]]'s (1992)  "Big Five" personality dimensions are the most recognized. These include; neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience and conscientiousness. Theories in political psychology induce that one's combination of these traits has implications for leadership style and capacity. For example, individuals who score highly on extroversion are demonstrated as having superior leadership skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.20)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Myers-Briggs Type indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment scale commonly used in the study of political personality and for job profiling.

===A motive-based approach===
In terms of political psychology [[motivation]] is viewed as goal-oriented behavior driven by a need for three things; [[Power (social and political)|power]], affiliation intimacy, and [[Goal#Achieving personal goals|achievement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.21)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories were grouped by Winter (1996) from Murray's (1938) twenty suggested common human goals. Need for power affects the style in which a leader performs. Winter and Stewart (1977) suggested that leaders high in power motivation and low in need of affiliation intimacy motivation make better presidents. Affiliation-motivated leaders alternatively tend to collaborate joint efforts in the absence of threat. Lastly, achievement motivation has demonstrated to not correspond with political success, especially if it is higher than power motivation (Winter, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sears, D.O., Huddy, L., Jervis, R.|year=2003 |title= Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology (p.122)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation between a leader and those whom they are ruling needs to be consistent with success. Motives have been shown to be correlated more highly with situation and time since last goal-fulfillment, rather than consistent traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sears, D.O., Huddy, L., Jervis, R.|year=2003 |title= Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology (p.132)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT) is commonly used for assessing motives. However, in the case of leadership assessment this test is more difficult to implement therefore more applicable tests are often used such as content analysis of speeches and interviews.

==Frameworks for assessing personality==

===The authoritarian personality===
The [[authoritarian personality]] is a syndrome theory that was developed by the researchers [[Adorno]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik|Frenkel-Brunswick]], [[Daniel Levinson|Levinson]] and [[Nevitt Sanford|Sanford]] (1950) at The University of California. The American Jewish Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jost, J.T., Sidanius, J.|year=2004 |title= Political Psychology: Key Readings (p.47)|edition=1st|publisher= London: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsidized research and publishing on the theory since it revolved around ideas developed from World War II events. [[Adorno]] (1950) explained the authoritarian personality type from a psychoanalytic point of view suggesting it to be a result of highly controlled and conventional parenting. Adorno (1950) explained that individuals with an authoritarian personality type had been stunted in terms of developing an ability to control the sexual and aggressive id impulses. This resulted in a fear of them and thus a development of defense mechanisms to avoid confronting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.40)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian personality types are persons described as swinging between depending on yet resenting authority. The syndrome was theorized to encompass nine characteristics; conventionalism, authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, anti-intraception (an opposition to subjective or imaginative tendencies), superstition and stereotypy, power and toughness, destructiveness and cynicism, sex obsession, and projectivity. The authoritarian personality type is suggested to be; ethnocentric, ego-defensive, mentally rigid, conforming and conventional, adverse to the out of the ordinary, and as having conservative political views. The book ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) introduces several scales based on different authoritarian personality types. These are; the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] which measures from where and to what degree fascist attitudes develop, the anti-Semitism scale, the ethnocentrism scale and the politico economic conservatism scale. The F-scale however, is the only scale that is expected to measure implicit authoritarian personality tendencies.

[[Bob Altemeyer]] (1996) deconstructed the authoritarian personality using trait analysis. He developed a [[Right-wing Authoritarianism]] (RWA) scale based on the traits; authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism. Altmeyer (1996) suggested that those who score high on the F-scale have a low ability for critical thinking and therefore are less able to contradict authority. Altmeyer's theories also incorporate the psychodynamic point of view, suggesting that authoritarian personality types were taught by their parents to believe that the world was a dangerous place and thus their impulses lead them to make impulsive, emotional and irrational decisions. The beliefs and behavior of an authoritarian are suggested to be easily manipulated by authority instead of being based on internal values.  Altmeyer also theorized that leaders with authoritarian personality types were more susceptible to the [[fundamental attribution error]]. There are many weaknesses associated with this syndrome and the F-scale. It may have been more relevant during the period in which it was produced, being shortly after World War II. The authoritarian personality is generally related to a fascist image however it is suggested to explain behavior of individuals in all political fields.

===Trait-based frameworks===
Trait-based frameworks, excluding the Freudian approach, were suggested by [[James David Barber|James Barber]] (1930–2004) in ''The Presidential Character'' (1972) who highlighted the importance of [[psychobiography]] in political personality analysis. Barber suggested that leadership personality comprised three dimensions; "character", "world view", and "style".&lt;ref name="Cottam-p28"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.28)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barber also proposed that leadership typology followed a pattern leading from an individuals first political success and that it is includes two variables; the effort that a leader puts in and the personal satisfaction that the leader gains. This typology is fairly limited in its dimensions.

[[Etheredge]] (1978) proposed the importance of the traits; "dominance", "interpersonal trust", "self-esteem" and "introversion-extroversion", in leadership views and policy shaping. Etheredge found from studies on leaders during the Soviet Union, that those who scored highly on dominance were more likely to support the use of force during debate settlement. He found that the trait introversion can lead to a lack of co-operation, and that extroversion usually leads to cooperation and negotiation. Further he suggested that interpersonal trust and self-esteem were closely related to not advocating force.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p28" /&gt;

[[Margaret Hermann]] (1976) introduced the [[Leader Trait Assessment]] (LTA) and advocated the development of the [[Profiler-Plus]]. The Profiler-Plus is a computer system used to code spontaneous interview answers for seven major characteristics; need for power, cognitive complexity, task-interpersonal emphasis, self-confidence, locus of control, distrust of others, and ethnocentrism. This method can profile large bodies of leadership related text whilst removing any subjective bias from content analysis. It is efficient and has high reliability.
Hermann and Preston (1994) suggested 5 distinct variables of leadership style; their involvement in policy making, their willingness to tolerate conflict, their level and reasons for motivation, their information managing strategies, and their conflict resolving strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.30)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach is the [[Operational-Code]] method introduced by [[Nathan Leites]] (1951) and restructured by [[Alexander George (philosopher)|Alexander George]] (1979). The code is based on five philosophical beliefs and five instrumental beliefs. A [[Verbs in Context]] (VIC) coding system employed through the Profiler-Plus computer program once again allows substantial bodies of written and spoken speech, interviews and writings to be analyzed subjectively.  The method attempts to be able to predict behavior thorough applying knowledge of various beliefs.

Although political behavior is governed and represented by a leader the consequential influence of the leader largely depends upon the context in which they are placed and in which type of political climate they are running. For this reason group behavior is also instrumental for understanding sociopolitical environments

==The political psychology of groups==

[[Group behavior]] is key in understanding the structure, stability, popularity and ability to make successful decisions of political parties. Individual behavior deviates substantially in a group setting therefore it is difficult to determine group behavior by looking solely at the individuals that comprise the group. Group form and stability is based upon several variables; size, structure, the purpose that the group serves, group development and influences upon a group.

===Group size===
Group size has various consequences. In smaller groups individuals are more committed (Patterson and Schaeffer, 1997) and there is a lower turnover rate (Widmeyer, Brawley and Carron, 1990).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.67)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large groups display greater levels of divergence (O'Dell, 1968) and less conformity (Olson and Caddell, 1994). Group performance also diminishes with size increase, due to decreased co-ordination and free-riding.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt; The size of a [[political party]] or nation can therefore have consequential effects on their ability to co-ordinate and progress.

===Group structure===
The structure of a group is altered by member diversity, which largely affects its efficiency. Individual diversity with in a group has proven to demonstrate less communication and therefore to increase conflict (Maznevski, 1994).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt; This has implications for political parties based in strongly colonial or multiracial nations.
Member diversity has consequences for; status, role allocation and role strain within a group, all of which can cause disagreement. Thus maintenance of group cohesion is key. Cohesion is affected by several factors; the amount of time members spend in the group, the amount that members like one another, the amount of reward that the group offers, the amount of external threat to the group and the level of warmth offered by leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.69)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors should be considered when attempting to form an efficient political group. President decision efficiency for example is affected by the degree to which members of the advisory group have a hierarchical status and by the roles that each member is assigned.

===Group function===
Studying the purpose for formation of a group, whether it is serving a "functional" purpose or an "interpersonal attraction" purpose (Mackie and Goethals, 1987), has implications for political popularity. Often people join groups in order to fulfill certain survival, interpersonal, informational and collective needs.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt;  A political party that provides; stability, clear information, offers power to individuals and satisfies a sense of affiliation, will gain popularity. [[William Schutz|Shutz's]] (1958) "[[Fundamental interpersonal relations orientation]]" theory suggests that groups satisfy the need for control, intimacy and inclusion. Groups also form due to natural attraction. Newcomb (1960)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.70)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that we are drawn to others close in socioeconomic status, beliefs, attitudes and physical appearance. Similarity in certain respects can thus be related to how much a person is attracted to joining one group over another.

===Group development===
[[Group development]] tends to happen in several stages; forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning (Tuckman, 1965). Group awareness of these stages is important in order for members to acknowledge that a process is taking place and that certain stages such as storming are part of progression and that they should not be discouraged or cause fear of instability. Awareness of group development also allows for models to be implemented in order to manipulate different stages. External influences upon a group will have different effects depending upon which stage the group is at in its course. This has implications for how open a group should be depending upon the stage of development it is at, and on its strength.
Consistency is also a key aspect in a group for success (Wood, 1994).

===The influence of conformity in groups===
The application of conformity is key for understanding group influence in political behaviour. Decision making within a group is largely influenced by conformity. It is theorized to occur based on two motives; [[normative social influence]] and [[informational social influence]] (Asch, 1955).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p74"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.74)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance of conformity is influenced by several factors; an increase in group size but only to a certain degree at which it plateaus, and degree of unanimity and commitment to the group. Therefore, the degree of popularity of a political group can be influenced by its existing size and the believed unanimity and commitment by the public of the already existing members. The degree by which the group conforms as a whole can also be influenced by the degree of individuation of its members.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p74" /&gt;
Also, the conformity within political groups can be related to the term, 'political coalition.' Humans represent groups as if there was a special category of an individual. For example, for cognitive simplicity, ancestral groups anthropomorphize each other because they have similar thoughts, values, and a historical background.  Even though the member of a group may have an irrational or wrong argument about a political issue, there is a high possibility for the other members to conform to it because of the mere fact that they are in the same coalition. &lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott, Michael Bang Petersen, “States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics,” International Security, Vol. 36, No. 2, Fall 2011, pp. 48-83&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of power in groups===
Power is another influential factor within a group or between separate groups. The "critical bases of power" developed by French and Raven (1959) allocates the following types of power as the most successful; reward power, coercive power, legitimate power, [[referent power]] and expert power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.76)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The way in which power is exerted upon a group can have repercussive outcomes for popularity. Referent power results in greater popularity of a political group or leader than coercive power (Shaw and Condelli, 1986).&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.77)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has implications for leaders to manipulate others to identify with them, rather than to enforce consequential punishment. However, if coercive power is enforced, success and a trusted leader (Friedland, 1976) are necessary in order for group conflict not to escalate.&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77" /&gt; Extrinsic punishment and reward are also suggested to detract from intrinsic motivation. A sense of freedom must be advocated to the group.&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77" /&gt;

===Decision-making in groups===
[[Decision-making]] is an important political process which influences the course of a country's policy. Group decision-making is largely influenced by three rules; "[[majority]]-wins rule", "[[truth]]-wins rule", and "first-shift rule". Decision-making is also coerced by [[conformity]]. [[Irrational]] decisions are generally made during emotional periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.83)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an unpopular political party may receive more votes during a period of actual or perceived economic or [[political instability]]. Controversial studies by George Marcus (2003) however imply that high levels of [[anxiety]] can actually cause an individual to analyze information more rationally and carefully, resulting in more well-informed and successful decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schildkraut |first=D. J. |title= All Politics is psychological: A Review of Political Psychology Syllabi |journal= Perspectives on Politics |date=December 2004 |volume=2 |pages=807–819 |url= http://ase.tufts.edu/polsci/faculty/schildkraut/Perspectives2004.pdf |accessdate=5 Dec 2011 |doi= 10.1017/s1537592704040575|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychology of decision-making however must be analyzed in accordance with whether it is within a leadership context or a between group context. The implementation of successful decision-making is often enhanced by group decision-making (Hill, 1982) especially if the decision is important to the group and when the group has been working together for an extended period of time (Watson, Michaelson and Sharp, 1991). However groups can also hinder decision-making if a correct answer is not clear. Janis (1972) introduced the notion of [[Groupthink]] that advocates an increased chance of groups making faulty decisions under several conditions; strong group cohesion, isolation of group decision from public review, the presence of a directive leader in the group, and high stress levels.
[[Group polarization]] (Janis, 1972) suggests that group decision-making is often more extreme whether is it more risky or cautious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.84)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Groupthink" refers to "a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=David Patrick Houghton|year=2015 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques to establish more effective decision making skills in political dimensions have been suggested. Hirt and Markman (1995) claim that implementing an individual in a group to find faults and to critique will enable the members to establish alternative view points. George (1980) suggested "multiple advocacy" which implements that a neutral person analyses the pros and cons of various advocate suggestions and thus makes an informed decision.

Applied psychology theories to improve productivity of political groups include implementing "[[team development]]" techniques, "quality circles" and autonomous work groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.81)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using psychology in the understanding of certain political behaviors==

===Evolution===

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] plays a significant role in understanding the state and people of how the current political regime came to be. It is an approach that focuses on the structure of human behavior claiming it’s dependence on the social and ecological environment. Developed through natural selection, the human brain functions to react appropriately to environmental challenges of coalitional conflict using psychological mechanisms and modifications. An example of political conflict would involve state aggression such as war. Psychological mechanisms work to digest what is taken in from internal and external information regarding the current habitat and project it in the most suited form of action such as acts of aggression, retrieval, dominance, and so forth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anthony C. Lopez |author2=Rose McDermott |author3=Michael Bang Petersen |authorlink1=States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics |title= States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics |volume=36 |issue=2 fall 2011 |pages=48-83 |publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting behavior===

In order to make inferences and predictions about behavior concerning voting decision, certain key public influences must be considered. These influences include the role of emotions, political socialization, [[political sophistication]], tolerance of diversity of political views and the media. The effect of these influences on [[voting behavior]] is best understood through theories on the formation of attitudes, beliefs, schema, knowledge structures and the practice of information processing. The degree to which voting decision is affected by internal processing systems of political information and external influences, alters the quality of making truly democratic decisions.

===Conflict===

The application of psychology for understanding conflict and extreme acts of violence can be understood in both individual and group terms. Political conflict is often a consequence of ethnic disparity and "ethnocentrism" Sumner (1906).

On an individual level participators in situations of conflict can either be perpetrators, bystanders or altruists. The behavior of perpetrators is often explained through the authoritarian personality type. Individual differences in levels of empathy have been used to explain whether an individual chooses to stand up to authority or ignore a conflict. Rotter's (1954) [[locus of control]] theory in personality psychology has also been used to determine individual differences in reaction to situations of conflict.

Group behavior during conflict often affects the actions of an individual. The [[bystander effect]] introduced by Darley and Latane (1968) demonstrates that group behavior causes individuals to monitor whether others think it is necessary to react in a situation and thus base their behavior on this judgment. They also found that individuals are more likely to diffuse responsibility in group situations. These theories can be applied to situations of conflict and genocide in which individuals remove personal responsibility and therefore justify their behavior. [[Social identity theory]] explains that during the Holocaust of World War II political leaders used the Jews as an out-group in order to increase in-group cohesion. This allowed for the perpetrators to depersonalize from the situation and to diffuse their responsibility. The out-groups were held in separate confines and dehumanized in order to aid the in-group to disengage themselves from relating.

Research by Dr. Dan Kahan has demonstrated that individuals are resistant to accepting new political views even if they are presented with evidence that challenges their views.  The research also demonstrated that if the individual was required to write a few sentences about experiences they enjoyed or spend a few moments affirming their self-worth, the individual was more likely to accept the new political position.&lt;ref&gt;Motivated Numeracy and Enlightened Self-Government. retrieved on August 25, 2014. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992&lt;/ref&gt;

Although somewhat unusual, [[evolutionary psychology]] can also explain conflicts in politics and the international society. A journal by Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott and Michael Bang Petersen uses this idea to give out hypothesis to explain political events. According to the authors, instincts and psychological characteristics developed through evolution is still existent with modern people. They suggest human being as "adaptation executers"; people designed through natural selection, and not "utility maximizers"; people who strive for utility in every moment. Though a group of people, perhaps those who are in the same political coalition, may seem as if they pursue a common utility maximization, it is difficult to generalize the theory of "utility maximizers" into a nation-view because people evolved in small groups. This approach helps scholars to explain seemingly irrational behaviors like aggressiveness in politics and international society because "irrational behavior" would be the result of a mismatch between the modern world and evolutionary psychology.

For example, according to evolutionary psychology, coalitional aggression is more commonly found with males. This is because of their [[psychological mechanism]] designed since ancestral times. During those times men had more to earn when winning wars compared to women (they had more chance of finding a mate, or even many mates). Also, the victorious men had more chance of reproduction which eventually led to the succession of aggressive, eager-to-war DNAs. As a result, the authors hypothesize that countries with more men will tend to show more aggressive politics thereby having more possibility of triggering conflicts within and especially among states.

Indeed some exceptions do exists in this theory as this is just a hypothesis. However it is viable enough to be a hypothesis to be tested to explain certain political events like war and crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott, Michael Bang Petersen. "States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics"." International Security 36.2 (2011): 48-83. 20 Sept 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism===

On an individual level terrorism has been explained as a display of psychopathological personality disorders. Terrorists have demonstrated to show narcissistic personality traits (Lasch, 1979, Pearlstein, 1991). Post (2004) argues that narcissistic and borderline personality disorders are found in terrorists and that mechanisms such as [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] and [[externalization]] are used by terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.271)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Silke (2004) and Mastors and Deffenbaugh (2007) refute this view. Crenshaw (2004) showed that certain terrorist groups are actually careful in not enlisting those demonstrating pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.272)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[authoritarian personality]] theory has also been used as an explanation for terrorist behavior in individuals.

In terms of explaining reasons for which individuals join terrorist groups, motivational theories such as need for power and need for affiliation intimacy are suggested. Festinger (1954) explained that people often join groups in order to compare their own beliefs and attitudes. Joining a terrorist group could be a method to remedy individual uncertainty. Taylor and Louis (2004) explained that individuals strive for meaningful behavior. This can also be used to explain why terrorists look for such radical beliefs and demonstrations. Studies on children in northern Ireland by Field (1979) have shown that exposure to violence can lead to terrorist behavior later on. Implicating the effect of developing acceptable norms in groups. However this view has also been criticized (Taylor, 1998). Other theories suggest that goal frustration can result in aggression (Dollard, Doob. Miller, mower, and Sears, 1939)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.273)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aggression can lead to frustration (Borum, 2004).
Group settings can cause a social identity and terrorist behavior to manifest. Methods such as dehumanization allow individuals to detach more easily from moral responsibility, and group influence increase the chance that individuals will concede to conformity and compliance. Manipulations of social control and propaganda can also instrument terrorist involvement.

In fact, a strategic model has been proposed to examine the political motivations of terrorists. The strategic model, the dominant paradigm in terrorism studies, considers terrorists are rational actors who attack civilians for political ends. According to this view, terrorists are political utility maximizers. The strategic model rests on three core assumptions which are: (1)terrorists are motivated by relatively stable and consistent political preferences; (2)terrorists evaluate the expected political payoffs of their available options; and (3)terrorism is adopted when the expected political return is superior to those of alternative options. However, it turns out that terrorists' decision-making process does not fully conform to the strategic model. According to Abrahms, Max who is the author of "What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and [[Counterterrorism]] Strategy." &lt;ref&gt;Abrahms, Max. "What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and Counterterrorism Strategy." International Security, vol. 32 no. 4, 2008, pp. 78-105. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/237009&lt;/ref&gt;there are seven common tendencies that represent important empirical puzzles for the strategic model, going against the conventional thought that terrorists are rational actors.

Historically, professional conduct was wholly undertaken by the private professional bodies, the sole legal authority for which was of a contractual nature. These bodies commonly established [[codes of conduct]] and [[ethical code]]s for the guidance of their members.

In certain areas, where the [[public interest]] is considered to be heavily engaged, [[legislation]] has been enacted, either replacing professional regulation by statutory legislation, or by a form of supervision of the professional body by a statutory body.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2011, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Union ==

The [http://www.ccbe.eu/ Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe (CCBE)] is the representative organisation of [[European lawyers]] through its member bars and law societies from 31 full member countries, and 11 further associate and observer countries. The CCBE has issued a Charter of core principles of the European legal profession and Code of Conduct for European lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccbe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/NTCdocument/EN_Code_of_conductp1_1306748215.pdf Charter of core principles of the European legal profession and Code of Conduct for European lawyers]&lt;/ref&gt; Activities include a committee on [[Deontology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccbe.eu/index.php?id=94&amp;id_comite=7&amp;L=0 Committee on Deontology]&lt;/ref&gt; and a working group on Professional Indemnity Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccbe.eu/index.php?id=94&amp;id_comite=16&amp;L=0 Working group on Professional Indemnity Insurance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.ecceengineers.eu/ European Council of Civil Engineers (ECCE)] aims to promote the highest technical and ethical standards, to provide a source of impartial advice, and promote co-operation with other pan-European organisations in the construction industry. The ECCE formulates standards for a European Code of Conduct of the Civil Engineering Profession and disciplinary procedures applicable throughout the Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecceengineers.eu/links/ethics.php?id=42 ECCE Code of Professional Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt; Other activities include the preparation of a review of the civil engineering profession in Europe, covering, e.g., demand for liability insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecceengineers.eu/papers/files/ECCE_Book_011005-komplett.pdf ECCE book: Civil Engineering Profession in Europe 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.clge.eu/home Council of European Geodetic Surveyors (CLGE)] represents the interests of the geodetic surveying profession in the private and public sector from 31 countries of Europe. As of September 2009, the CLGE adopted the CLGE Code of Conduct of the European Surveyor and initiated the ratification process amongst members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clge.eu/newsletter/read/2009/2/ CLGE Code of Conduct of the European Surveyor]&lt;/ref&gt; It 'highly recommends that European surveyors hold

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, where a professional body is a [[public body]] within the meaning of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] (such as is the case with [[medicine]], the [[legal profession]], and [[financial services]]), its professional conduct machinery must conform to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2011, annex&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eglise Saint-Ayoul Provins retable maitre-autel.jpg|thumb|On one strict definition, this French 17th-century construction is a retable rather than a reredos, as it is all one construction]] 
A '''retable''' is a structure or element placed either on or immediately behind and above the [[altar]] or [[communion table]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Retable |volume=23 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a church. At the minimum it may be a simple shelf for candles behind an altar, but it can also be a large and elaborate structure. A retable which incorporates sculptures or painting is often referred to as an [[altarpiece]].

According to the Getty ''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online'', "A 'retable' is distinct from a '[[reredos]]'; while the reredos typically rises from ground level behind the altar, the retable is smaller, standing either on the back of the altar itself or on a pedestal behind it. Many altars have both a reredos and a retable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=retable&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300076035 ''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online''] 'Retable'&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is not always upheld in common use, and the terms are often confused or used as synonyms. In several foreign languages, such as [[French language|French]] (also using 'retable'), the usage is different, usually equating the word with the English 'reredos' or 'altarpiece', and this often leads to confusion, and incorrect usage in translated texts. The [[Medieval Latin]] ''retrotabulum'' (modernized ''retabulum'') was applied to an architectural feature set up at the back of an altar, and generally taking the form of a screen framing a picture, carved or sculptured work in wood or stone, or [[mosaic]], or of a movable feature such as the  ''[[Pala d'Oro]]'' in [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]], of gold, jewels and enamels.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The non-English word "retable" therefore often refers to what should in English be called a [[reredos]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The situation is further complicated by the frequent modern addition of free-standing altars in front of the old integrated altar, to allow the celebrant to face the congregation, or be closer to it. 

[[Dossal]]' is another term that may overlap with both retable and reredos; today it usually means an altarpiece painting rising at the back of the altar to which it is attached, or a cloth usually hanging on the wall directly behind the altar.

The cognate Spanish term, ''[[retablo]]'', refers also to a reredos or retrotabulum, although in the specific context of Mexican folk art it may refer to any two-dimensional depiction (usually a framed painting) of a saint or other Christian religious figure, as contrasted with a ''[[bulto]]'', a three-dimensional statue of same.

The retable may hold the [[altar cross]], mostly in Protestant churches, as well as candles, flowers and other things.

'''9.9 School of Convergence''', also known as SoC, is a small [[Media studies|media school]] in [[New Delhi]], India. The school has Pramath Raj Sinha, the founding dean of [[Indian School of Business]], as its dean.

==History==
The School of Convergence (SoC) was set up in October 2001 by [[Kaleidoscope Entertainment]], headed by Bobby Bedi. The school started with a Two Year Post Graduate Diploma Course in Content Creation and Management (PGDCCM) combining print, radio, television, cinema and the Internet. This course offered knowledge and skills in all streams of media and management. It combines the curricula of a [[journalism]] school, a film school and a management school.
The Media School licensed its brand to 9.9 Mediaworx Pvt. Ltd. to start journalism courses as 9.9 School of Convergence and it starting its first batch in September 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/9.9-school-of-convergence-launched/495007/  9.9 School of Convergence launched]&lt;/ref&gt; with just one course, an eleven-month diploma in Applied Journalism.

'''''Science in Action''''' is a long-running weekly radio programme produced by the [[BBC World Service]] and currently hosted by British journalists Roland Pease&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://journalisted.com/roland-pease |title=Roland Pease |publisher=Media Standards Trust|website=journa''listed'' |language=en |access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marnie Chesterton, and scientist and broadcaster Professor [[Adam Hart]]. It is broadcast on Thursdays at 18.32 [[GMT]] and repeated twice the following day, at 01.32 and 08.32.

A programme with the title ''Science in Action'' is believed to have begun life in 1964, when it replaced an earlier series, dating from the 1950s, called ''Science and Industry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 1965 a short-lived series called ''Science in Action'' ran on the [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]]; it was broadcast at 19.30 on Thursdays, later 21.30. In December 1965 it was moved to 14.30 on Fridays. The present weekly World Service series, also called ''Science in Action'', began on Saturday 7 July 1979.

'''Social cognition''' is "a sub-topic of [[social psychology]] that focuses on how people process, store, and apply information about other people and social situations. It focuses on the role that [[cognitive processes]] play in social interactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Park |first=Mina |last2= Song |first2=Jae-Jin |last3=Oh |first3=Seo Jin |last4=Shin |first4=Min-Sup |last5=Lee |first5=Jun Ho |last6=Oh |first6= Seung Ha |journal= BioMed Research International |language=en |volume=2015 |pages=1–7 |doi= 10.1155/2015/313274 |pmid= 26236723 |pmc= 4506840 |issn= 2314-6133 |title=The Relation between Nonverbal IQ and Postoperative CI Outcomes in Cochlear Implant Users: Preliminary Result |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More technically, social cognition refers to how people deal with [[conspecifics]] (members of the same species) or even across species (such as pet) information, include four stages: encoding, storage, retrieval, and processing. In the area of [[social psychology]], social cognition refers to a specific approach in which these processes are studied according to the methods of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[information processing theory]]. According to this view, social cognition is a level of analysis that aims to understand social psychological phenomena by investigating the cognitive processes that underlie them.&lt;ref&gt;(International Social Cognition Network: http://www.socialcognition.info)&lt;/ref&gt; The major concerns of the approach are the processes involved in the perception, judgment, and memory of social stimuli; the effects of social and affective factors on information processing; and the behavioral and interpersonal consequences of cognitive processes. This level of analysis may be applied to any content area within social psychology, including research on intrapersonal, interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup processes.

The term ''social cognition'' has been used in multiple areas in [[psychology]] and [[Social cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscience]], most often to refer to various social abilities disrupted in [[autism]],&lt;ref name="Striano"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Cognition: Development, Neuroscience and Autism|editor=Striano, T.|editor2=Reid, V.|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-1-4051-6217-3|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[schizophrenia]]&lt;ref name="Billeke-Aboitiz-2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 =Billeke | first1 = P. | last2 = Aboitiz | first2 = F.  | title = Social cognition in schizophrenia: from social stimuli processing to social engagement| journal =Frontiers in Psychiatry  | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = eCollection 2013 |date=February 2013 | doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00004 | pmid = 23444313 | pmc=3580762}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other disorders.&lt;ref name="BlairMitchellBlair"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychopathy, emotion and the brain|last=Blair|first=J.|author2=Mitchel, D. |author3=Blair, K.  |year=2005|isbn=978-0-631-23336-7|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|pages=25–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cognitive neuroscience the biological basis of social cognition is investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cacioppo, J.T.|author2=Berntson, G.G.|author3=Sheridan, J.F.|author4=McClintock, M.K.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Multilevel integrative analyses of human behavior: social neuroscience and the complementing nature of social and biological approaches|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=126|issue=6|pages=829–43|pmid=11107878|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.6.829|url=http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbsm00.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806233305/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbsm00.pdf|archivedate=2015-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cacioppo, J.T.|year=2002|title=Social neuroscience: understanding the pieces fosters understanding the whole and vice versa|journal=American Psychologist|volume=57|issue=11|pages=819–31|pmid=12564179|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.57.11.819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adolphs|first=R.|title=Social cognition and the human brain|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|pages=469–79|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01399-6|pmid=10562726|issue=12|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.7847}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Developmental psychologist]]s study the development of social cognition abilities.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"&gt;{{cite book|title= Developmental Psychology: Childhood and Adolescence|last=Shaffer |first=D.R.|author2=Kipp, K. |isbn=978-0-495-60171-5|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|chapter=Chapter 12: Theories of social and cognitive development |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
Social cognition came to prominence with the rise of [[cognitive psychology]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is now the dominant model and approach in mainstream [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name=Husain&gt;{{cite book|title= Social Psychology|last=Husain |first=A. |isbn=9788131760000 |publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson Education India]]|chapter=Chapter 5: Social Perception and Cognition |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common to social cognition theories is the idea that information is represented in the brain as "[[mentalism (psychology)|cognitive elements]]" such as [[schema (psychology)|schemas]], [[attribution theory|attributions]], or [[stereotype]]s. A focus on how these cognitive elements are processed is often employed. Social cognition therefore applies and extends many themes, theories, and paradigms from cognitive psychology that can be identified in [[cognitive bias|reasoning]] ([[representativeness heuristic]], [[base rate fallacy]] and [[confirmation bias]]), [[attention]] ([[automaticity]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]) and [[memory]] (schemas, [[primacy effect|primacy and recency]]). It is likely that social psychology has always had a more [[cognitive]] than general psychology approach, as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as [[belief]]s and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=S.T.|author2=Taylor, S.E. |title=Social Cognition |isbn=978-0-07-100910-2|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]], Inc.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable theory of social cognition is social schema theory, although it is not the basis of all social cognition studies (for example, see [[attribution theory]]).&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; It has been suggested that other disciplines in social psychology such as [[social identity theory]] and [[social representations]] may be seeking to explain largely the same phenomena as social cognition, and that these different disciplines might be merged into a "coherent integrated whole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustinos|first=M. |author2=Walker, I. |author3=Donaghue, N.|title=Social Cognition an Integrated Introduction|isbn=978-0-7619-4218-4|publisher=[[Sage Publications]] Ltd|year=2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action, termed [[motor cognition]], which is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process.

==Social schemas==
Social schema theory builds on and uses terminology from [[schema theory]] in cognitive psychology, which describes how ideas or "[[concept]]s" are [[representation (psychology)|represented in the brain]] and how they are [[categorized]]. According to this view, when we see or think of a concept a mental representation or [[schema (psychology)|schema]] is "activated" bringing to mind other information which is linked to the original concept by association. This activation often happens unconsciously. As a result of activating such schemas, judgements are formed which go beyond the information actually available, since many of the associations the schema evokes extend outside the given information. This may influence social cognition and behaviour regardless of whether these judgements are accurate or not. For example, if an individual is introduced as a teacher, then a "teacher schema" may be activated. Subsequently, we might associate this person with wisdom or authority, or past experiences of teachers that we remember and consider important.

When a schema is more accessible it can be more quickly activated and used in a particular situation. Two cognitive processes that increase accessibility of schemas are [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]. Salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation. The higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible. For example, if there is one female in a group of seven males, female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group's thinking and [[behavior]] toward the female group member.&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; Priming refers to any experience immediately prior to a situation that causes a schema to be more accessible. For example, watching a scary movie late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas, increasing the likelihood that a person will perceive shadows and background noises as potential threats.

Social cognition researchers are interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established schemas, especially when the information contrasts with the existing schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alpay |first=L.|author2=Verhoef, J. |author3=Teeni, D. |author4=Putter, H. |author5=Toussaint, P. |author6= Zwetsloot-Schonk, J.  |year=2008 |title=Can contextualisation increase understanding during man-machine communication? A theory driven study |journal=The Open Medical Informatics Journal |volume=2 |pages=82–91|doi=10.2174/1874431100802010082|pmid=19415137|pmc=2669642}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a student may have a pre-established schema that all teachers are assertive and bossy. After encountering a teacher who is timid and shy, a social cognition researcher might be interested in how the student will integrate this new information with his/her existing teacher schema. Pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information, as people selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent. This is referred to as a [[confirmation bias]]. Sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case, leaving the original schema intact without any alterations. This is referred to as subtyping.

Social cognition researchers are also interested in the [[regulation]] of activated schemas. It is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic, meaning that it is outside individual conscious control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In many situations however, the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the [[social norms]] of the situation in which case an individual is [[motivate]]d to [[social inhibition|inhibit]] the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and [[social behavior]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} High self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts, a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Cultural differences==
Social psychologists have become increasingly interested in the influence of culture on social cognition.&lt;ref name= "Aronson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |author2=Wilson, T |author3=Akert, R.|title=Social Psychology |publisher=Pearson |chapter=Chapter 3: Social Cognition |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although people of all cultures use schemas to understand the world, the content of schemas has been found to differ for individuals based on their cultural upbringing. For example, one study interviewed a Scottish settler and a Bantu herdsman from Swaziland and compared their schemas about cattle.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite book |title= Remembering |last=Bartlett |first=F. |publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press |page=249 |year=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because cattle are essential to the lifestyle of the Bantu people, the Bantu herdsmen's schemas for cattle were far more extensive than the schemas of the Scottish settler. The Bantu herdsmen was able to distinguish his cattle from dozens of others, while the Scottish settler was not.

Cultural influences have been found to shape some of the basic ways in which people automatically perceive and think about their environment.&lt;ref name= "Aronson" /&gt; For example, a number of studies have found that people who grow up in East Asian cultures such as [[China]] and [[Japan]] tend to develop holistic thinking styles, whereas people brought up in Western cultures like Australia and the USA tend to develop analytic thinking styles.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nisbett |first=R. |author2=Peng, K. |author3=Choi, I. |author4= Norenzayan, A.  |title=Culture and Systems of thought: Holistic vs. analytic cognition |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |pages=291–310 |year=2001 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.291 |pmid=11381831 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Takahiko Masuda |last1=Masuda |first1=T. |last2=Nisbett|first2=R. |title=Culture and change blindness |journal=Cognitive Science: A Multidisciplinary Journal. |volume=30 |pages=381–389 |year=2006 |doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0000_63 |pmid=21702819 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typically Eastern holistic thinking style is a type of thinking in which people focus on the overall context and the ways in which objects relate to each other.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett" /&gt; For example, if an Easterner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling then he/she might scan everyone's face in the class, and then use this information to judge how the individual is feeling.&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masuda |first=T. |author2=Ellsworth, P. C.|authorlink2=Phoebe C. Ellsworth|authorlink3=Batja Mesquita |author3=Mesquita, B.  |title=Placing the face in context: Cultural differences in the perception of facial emotion |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=94 |pages=365–381 |year=2008 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.3.365 |pmid=18284287 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the typically Western analytic thinking style is a type of thinking style in which people focus on individual objects and neglect to consider the surrounding context.&lt;ref name= "Masuda 2006" /&gt; For example, if a Westerner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling, then he or she might focus only on the classmate's face in order to make the judgment.&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2008" /&gt;

Nisbett (2003) suggested that cultural differences in social cognition may stem from the various philosophical traditions of the East (i.e. [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) versus the Greek philosophical traditions (i.e. of Aristotle and Plato) of the West.&lt;ref name= "Aronson" /&gt; However, recent research indicates that differences in social cognition may originate from physical differences in the environments of the two cultures. One study found that scenes from Japanese cities were 'busier' than those in the USA as they contain more objects which compete for attention. In this study, the Eastern holistic thinking style (and focus on the overall context) was attributed to the busier nature of the Japanese physical environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miyamoto |first=Y. |author2=Kitayama, S.  |title=Cultural variation in correspondence bias: The critical role of attitude diagnosticity of socially constrained behaviour |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=83 |pages=1239–1248 |year=2002 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.5.1239 |pmid=12416925 |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.319.6787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Social cognitive neuroscience}}
Early interest in the relationship between brain function and social cognition includes the case of [[Phineas Gage]], whose behaviour was reported to have changed after an accident damaged one or both of his frontal lobes. More recent [[neuropsychological]] studies have shown that [[acquired brain injury|brain injuries]] disrupt social cognitive processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="981">'''Statical determinacy''' is a term used in [[structural mechanics]] to describe a structure where force and moment equilibrium conditions alone can be utilized to calculate internal member actions.

Descriptively, a statically determinate structure can be defined as a structure where, if it is possible to find internal actions in equilibrium with external loads, those internal actions are unique. The structure has no possible states of self-stress, i.e. internal forces in equilibrium
with zero external loads are not possible.

Mathematically, this requires a [[stiffness matrix]] to have full rank.

A statically indeterminate structure can only be analyzed by including further information like material properties and deflections. Numerically, this can be achieved by using methods like matrix structural analyses and finite element analyses.

In [[economics]] and business [[decision-making]], a '''sunk cost''' is a [[cost]] that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered (also known as retrospective cost).

Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with ''[[prospective costs]]'', which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken. In that regard, both retrospective and prospective costs could be either fixed costs (continuous for as long as the business is in operation and unaffected by output volume) or variable costs (dependent on volume).&lt;ref name="Sherman2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherman|first=Roger|title=Market Regulation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tbFHAAAAYAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Pearson / Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0-321-32232-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as "fixed" or "variable." For example, if a firm sinks $400 million on an enterprise software installation, that cost is "sunk" because it was a one-time expense and cannot be recovered once spent. A "fixed" cost would be monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal with the company that set up the software. The upfront irretrievable payment for the installation should ''not'' be deemed a "fixed" cost, with its cost spread out over time. Sunk costs should be kept separate. The "variable costs" for this project might include data centre power usage, for example.

In traditional [[microeconomic]] theory, only prospective (future) costs are relevant to an investment decision. The fields of traditional economics propose that economic actors should not let sunk costs influence their decisions. Doing so would not be rationally assessing a decision exclusively on its own merits. Alternatively, a decision-maker might make rational decisions according to their own incentives, outside of efficiency or profitability. This is considered to be an ''incentive problem'' and is distinct from a sunk cost problem. Evidence from [[behavioral economics]] suggests this theory may fail to predict real-world behavior. Sunk costs do, in fact, influence actors' decisions because humans are prone to [[loss aversion]] and [[framing effect (psychology)|framing effects]]. 

Sunk costs should not affect the rational decision-maker's best choice. However, until a decision-maker irreversibly commits resources, the prospective cost is an [[relevant cost|avoidable future cost]] and is properly included in any decision-making processes.

For instance, if someone is considering preordering movie tickets, but has not actually purchased them yet, the cost remains avoidable. However, if the price of the tickets rises to an amount that requires him or her to pay more than the value he or she places on them, they should figure out the change in terms of prospective cost that goes into the decision-making process and re-evaluate his or her decision hence.

==Description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2007}}
The sunk cost is distinct from economic loss. For example, when a new car is purchased, it can subsequently be resold; however, it will probably not be resold for the original purchase price. The economic loss is the difference (including [[transaction cost]]s). The sum originally paid should not affect any rational future decision-making about the car, regardless of the resale value: if the owner can derive more value from selling the car than not selling it, then it should be sold, regardless of the price paid. In this sense, the sunk cost is not a precise quantity, but an economic term for a sum paid, in the past, which is no longer relevant to decisions about the future; it may be used inconsistently in quantitative terms as the original cost or the expected economic loss. It may also be used as shorthand for an error in analysis due to the ''sunk cost [[fallacy]]'', irrational decision-making or, most simply, as irrelevant data.

[[Economist]]s argue that sunk costs are not taken into account when making [[rationality|rational]] decisions. In the case of a baseball game ticket that has already been purchased, the ticket-buyer can choose between the following two end results if he realizes that he doesn't like the game:

# Having paid the price of the ticket and having suffered watching a game that he does not want to see, or;
# Having paid the price of the ticket and having used the time to do something more fun.

In either case, the ticket-buyer has ''paid the price of the ticket'' so ''that'' part of the decision no longer affects the future. If the ticket-buyer regrets buying the ticket, the current decision should be based on whether he wants to see the game at all, regardless of the price, just as if he were to go to a free baseball game. The economist will suggest that, since the second option involves suffering in only one way (spent money), while the first involves suffering in two (spent money plus wasted time), option two is obviously preferable.

Sunk costs may cause [[cost overrun]]. In business, an example of sunk costs may be investment into a factory or research that now has a lower value or no value whatsoever. For example, $20 million has been spent on building a power plant; the value at present is zero because it is incomplete (and no sale or recovery is feasible). The plant can be completed for an additional $10 million, or abandoned and a different but equally valuable facility built for $5 million. It should be obvious that abandonment and construction of the alternative facility is the more rational decision, even though it represents a total loss of the original expenditure—the original sum invested is a sunk cost. If decision-makers are irrational or have the wrong incentives, the completion of the project may be chosen. For example, politicians or managers may have more incentive to avoid the appearance of a total loss. In practice, there is considerable ambiguity and uncertainty in such cases, and decisions may in retrospect appear irrational that were, at the time, reasonable to the economic actors involved and in the context of their own incentives.

[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
Behavioral economics recognizes that sunk costs often affect economic decisions due to loss aversion: the price paid becomes a benchmark for the value, whereas the price paid should be irrelevant. This is considered irrational behavior (as rationality is defined by [[classical economics]]). Economic experiments have shown that the sunk cost fallacy and loss aversion are common; hence economic rationality—as assumed by much of economics—is limited. This has enormous implications{{such as?|date=April 2018}} for [[finance]], economics, and securities markets in particular. [[Daniel Kahneman]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] in part for his extensive work in this area with his collaborator, [[Amos Tversky]].

==Features characterizing the sunk cost heuristic==
Two specific features characterizing the sunk cost heuristic worth mentioning are:
# An overoptimistic probability bias, whereby after an investment the evaluation of one's investment-reaping dividends is increased.
# The requisite of personal responsibility. Sunk cost appears to operate chiefly in those who feel personal responsibility for the investments that are to be viewed as sunk cost.

===Overoptimistic probability bias===
In 1968 Knox and Inkster,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0025528 | last1 = Knox | first1 =  RE| last2 = Inkster | first2 =  JA| year = 1968 | title = Postdecision dissonance at post time | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 319–323 | pmid = 5645589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in what is perhaps the classic sunk cost experiment, approached 141 horse [[Gambling|bettors]]: 72 of the people had just finished placing a $2.00 bet within the past 30 seconds, and 69 people were about to place a $2.00 bet in the next 30 seconds. Their hypothesis was that people who had just committed themselves to a course of action (betting $2.00) would reduce [[Cognitive dissonance|post-decision dissonance]] by believing more strongly than ever that they had picked a winner. Knox and Inkster asked the bettors to rate their horse's chances of winning on a 7-point scale. What they found was that people who were about to place a bet rated the chance that their horse would win at an average of 3.48 which corresponded to a "fair chance of winning" whereas people who had just finished betting gave an average rating of 4.81 which corresponded to a "good chance of winning". Their hypothesis was confirmed: after making a $2.00 commitment, people became more confident their bet would pay off. Knox and Inkster performed an ancillary test on the patrons of the horses themselves and managed (after normalization) to repeat their finding almost identically.

Additional evidence of inflated probability estimations can be found in Arkes and Blumer (1985)&lt;ref name="Arkes and Blumer"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0749-5978(85)90049-4 | last1 = Arkes | first1 = Hal | last2 = Blumer | first2 = Catherine | year = 1985 | title = The Psychology of Sunk Cost | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Process | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 124–140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arkes and Hutzel (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1099-0771(200007/09)13:3&lt;295::AID-BDM353&gt;3.0.CO;2-6 | last1 = Arkes | first1 = Hal | last2 = Hutzel | first2 = Laura | year = 2000 | title = The Role of Probability of Success Estimates in the Sunk Cost Effect | url = | journal = Journal of Behavioural Decision Making | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 295–306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requisite of personal responsibility===
In a study of 96 business students in 1976, Staw and Fox&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Staw | first1 = Barry | year = 1976 | title = Knee Deep in the Big Muddy | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Process | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 124–140 | doi=10.1016/0749-5978(85)90049-4 | last2 = Blumer | first2 = Catherine}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the subjects a choice between making an [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] investment either in an underperforming company department, or in other sections of the hypothetical company. Staw and Fox divided the participants into two groups: a low responsibility condition and a high responsibility condition. In the high responsibility condition, the participants were told that they, as manager, had made an earlier, disappointing R&amp;D investment. In the low responsibility condition, subjects were told that a former manager had made a previous R&amp;D investment in the underperforming division and were given the same profit data as the other group. In both cases subjects were then asked to make a new $20 million investment. There was a significant interaction between assumed responsibility and average investment, with the high responsibility condition averaging $12.97 million and the low condition averaging $9.43 million.

Similar results have been obtained in earlier studies by Staw (1974, 1976) and by Arkes and Blumer (1985)&lt;ref name="Arkes and Blumer"/&gt; and Whyte (1986).&lt;ref name="Whyte1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whyte|first1=Glen|title=Escalating Commitment to a Course of Action: A Reinterpretation|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=11|issue=2|year=1986|pages=311|issn=0363-7425|doi=10.2307/258462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss aversion and the ''sunk cost fallacy''==
{{further|Escalation of commitment}}
Many people have strong misgivings about "wasting" resources ([[loss aversion]]). In the above example involving a non-refundable sporting event ticket, many people, for example, would feel obliged to go to the event despite not really wanting to, because doing otherwise would be ''wasting'' the ticket worth. They usually feel they've passed the ''[[point of no return]]''. This is sometimes referred to as the ''sunk cost fallacy''. Economists would label this behavior as "irrational". It is inefficient because it misallocates resources by depending on information that is irrelevant to the decision being made.

This line of thinking, in turn, may reflect a non-standard measure of [[utility]], which is ultimately subjective and unique to the consumer. A ticket-buyer who purchases a ticket to an event they won't enjoy in advance makes a semi-public commitment to watching it. To leave early is to make this lapse of judgment manifest to strangers, an appearance they might otherwise choose to avoid. Alternatively, they may take a sense of [[pride]] in having recognized the [[opportunity cost]] of the alternative use of time.

The idea of sunk costs is often employed when analyzing business decisions. A common example of a sunk cost for a business is the [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] of a brand name. This type of [[marketing]] incurs costs that cannot normally be recovered. It is not typically possible to later "demote" one's brand names in exchange for cash. A second example is [[R&amp;D]] costs. Once spent, such costs are sunk and should have no effect on future pricing decisions. So a pharmaceutical company’s attempt to justify high prices because of the need to recoup R&amp;D expenses is fallacious. The company will charge market prices whether R&amp;D had cost one dollar or one million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Klein and Bauman (2010) The Cartoon Introduction to Economics Volume One: Microeconomics 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, R&amp;D costs, and the ability to recoup those costs, are a factor in deciding whether to spend the money on R&amp;D or not.{{Citation needed|reason=This seems mildly biased, what about raising prices in order to afford investing in future R&amp;D?|date=March 2017}} While this example is a fallacy, however, raising prices in order to finance future R&amp;D is not considered to be one. 

Some research has also noted circumstances where the ''sunk cost fallacy'' is reversed; that is, where individuals appear irrationally eager to write off earlier investments in order to take up a new endeavor&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Chip. "Escalation and de-escalation of commitment in response to sunk costs: The role of budgeting in mental accounting." ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'' 62 (1995): 38-38.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ''sunk cost fallacy'' is in [[game theory]] sometimes known as the "Concorde Fallacy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00292525 |title=Do Savannah Sparrows Commit the Concorde Fallacy? |publisher=Springer Berlin |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/q553g0w6844m5kt3 |accessdate=2009-09-15 |first1= P.J. | last1=Weatherhead |journal= Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. |volume= 5 |pages=373–381 |issue=4 | year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the fact that the British and French governments continued to fund the joint development of [[Concorde]] even after it became apparent that there was no longer an economic case for the aircraft. The project was regarded privately by the British government as a "commercial disaster" which should never have been started and was almost cancelled, but political and legal issues had ultimately made it impossible for either government to pull out.

==Bygones principle==
The ''bygones principle'' is an [[economic theory]] used in business.&lt;ref name="Gupta2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=K. P.|title=Cost Management: Measuring, Monitoring &amp; Motivating Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtQ6jBgwbvEC&amp;pg=PA248|year=2009|publisher=Global India Publications|isbn=978-93-80228-02-0|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists stress the "extra" or "marginal" costs and benefits of every decision. The theory emphasizes the importance of ignoring past costs and only taking into account the future costs and benefits when making decisions. It states that when making a decision, one should make a hard-headed calculation of the extra costs one will incur and weigh these against its extra advantages.

A '''supra-entity''' is a conceptual element derived from the [[Entity-relationship model|Entity-Relationship]] (E-R) technique for [[information system]] modeling. It is similar to an entity, but it is defined at a higher level, encompassing individual entity occurrences, their parts, groups and groups of parts or parts of groups.

The concepts '''supra-entity''', '''[[supra-relationship]]''' and '''[[supra-attribute]]''' were created and published by González &amp; Muller in their work “''Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management ''”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied for the first time in this work to conceptually model the key elements and interrelationships of “business” reality.

Supra-entities, supra-relationships and supra-attributes have the objective of covering the diversity of situations and perspectives existing in reality, through the integrated representation at a higher level of individual occurrences, its multiple parts and groups of entities and relationships according to different criteria, its structures, its properties or attributes and its association with other supra-entities at any level of partition or grouping.

== Supra-entity ==
[[File:Supra-entity.png|right|frameless|453x453px]]

A supra-entity is formed by the individual entities, its multiple structures of entity parts, its multiple structures of entity groups and its multiple structures of groups of entity parts or parts of entity groups, associated with each other in a closed squared structure, as shown in the attached diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=39–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representation on the multiple structures of parts, groups, groups of parts or parts of entity groups that form the supra-entity is done through '''strips''' connecting the different elements, instead of the usual line symbol used for a single structure in the entity-relationship models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=25–39|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, supra-entity ''Products'' in a business sector is as shown in the next diagram:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=61–64|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application to innovation ==
In addition to its application to modeling and development of databases and information systems, supra-entities and supra-relationships allow a redefinition of the concept of '''[[innovation]]''', its degrees and types, with clarity and amplitude, which facilitates generation of ideas and innovation capacity, both in general and business.

'''Innovation''' defined in a supra-entity domain or scope consists of the creation, generation or introduction of new occurrences of supra-entity elements with good results or success, and which are first invention (major innovation) or improved (minor or incremental innovation), not including those new occurrences that replicate to other similar previous ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=122–124|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Supra-entity innovation.png|frameless|718x718px]]

For example, if we apply this definition of innovation to the supra-entity ''Products'', we obtain the '''product innovations''', which consist of the creation, generation or introduction in the market of new element occurrences of the supra-entity ''Products'' with good results or success, and which are first invention (major innovation) or improved (minor or incremental innovation), not including those new occurrences that replicate to other similar previous ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=127|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Products supra-entity innovation.png|frameless|718x718px]]

Business innovation is traditionally identified with the introduction and marketing of new or improved products or processes in the market. But innovation does not necessarily require being technological. You can innovate by identifying new needs, new customer segments, new ways of getting the product to the customer, new forms of agreements or contracting, new environments, etc.

In summary, it is possible to innovate on the different supra-entities and supra-relationships that constitute the Business Entity-Relationship Model, achieving different types of innovations and increasing the innovation capacity of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=124–126|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
