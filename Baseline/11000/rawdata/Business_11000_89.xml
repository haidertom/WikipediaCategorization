'''Alejandro Romay''' (born '''Alejandro Argentino Saúl''' January 20, 1927 – June 25, 2015) was an [[Argentine]] businessman and media mogul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/192470/tv-zar-alejandro-romay-dies-at-88|title='TV Zar' Alejandro Romay dies at 88|date=June 25, 2015|publisher=[[Buenos Aires Herald]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for many years at [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Canal 9]] (known under his management as Canal 9 Libertad), and became known as the "''Czar of television''".

==Biography==
[[File:Alejandro romany flia 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Romay in the 1960s.]]
Romay started his career in 1940 as radio host at LV 7 Radio Tucumán, at the Tucumán province. He acquired LV 12 Radio Aconquija in 1945, and two years later he moved to Buenos Aires. He kept working as radio host, but started working as well as a radio, TV and theater producer. He became the largest shareholder of [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Channel 9]] in 1963, and director of it. He lost the channel when it was nationalized in 1974 and moved to Puerto Rico, where he acquired two radio stations.

Romay returned to Buenos Aires in 1983, when [[Raúl Alfonsín]] took power, and acquired back Channel 9. He created Telearte S.A. to manage its programming, and the channel became Argentina's ratings leader for the rest of the 1980s. The 1990s initially saw his media empire expand: he acquired Radio Belgrano, which had been state-owned, as well as a Buenos Aires cable system (BAC). In addition, he bought a Miami television station, [[WJAN-CD|WJAN]], which later was run by his son Omar Romay. He also owned a theater in Buenos Aires and another one in Madrid.

In 1997, Romay retired and began to sell off his media assets. The radio stations went to [[Grupo CIE]] of Mexico, while Canal 9 Libertad was sold to [[Prime Television]] of Australia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lagaceta.com.ar/vernotae.asp?id_nota=245710&amp;titulo=Alejandro Alejandro Romay: “por trabajar demasiado, he descuidado a mis afectos”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719052522/http://www.lagaceta.com.ar/vernotae.asp?id_nota=245710&amp;titulo=Alejandro |date=2011-07-19 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grupo Clarín]]'s Multicanal cable systems absorbed BAC. He was awarded an honorary [[Martín Fierro Awards|Martín Fierro Award]] in 2003.

At the time of his death in June 2015, he was writing an autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2005/2/14/estilo-144193.asp Alejandro Romay: una vida con estilo propio] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Pesce was born in [[São Paulo]], and studied at [[MIT]], where she obtained degrees in Electrical Engineering / Computer Science and Management Science.

Pesce was for a time a product manager at Ooyala in its early days and was later head of business development at Lemon.

'''Benjamin Hart''' (August 10, 1779 – February 27, 1855) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[businessman]], [[militia]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]], and [[justice of the peace]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Benjamin Hart was born in [[Montreal]] to [[Aaron Hart (businessman)|Aaron Hart]], a prominent merchant of [[Trois-Rivières]], and Dorothea Judah.

Benjamin was educated in New York and Philadelphia and by 1798 had returned to [[Trois-Rivières]] to assist with the family's extensive business.  When Aaron died in 1800, Benjamin inherited the family's main store in Trois-Rivières and their Montreal house.

In 1806, he married Harriot Judith Hart, daughter of stockbroker [[Ephraim Hart]].  They had numerous children.

He supported the cause of Jewish civil liberties, and supported his brother [[Ezekiel Hart|Ezekiel]] in his thwarted political career.  He helped push for a law, passed in 1831, that granted equality of civil liberties to Jews.  He was an active member of Montreal's Jewish congregation.

With improved civil liberties, he was able to become a [[justice of the peace]] in 1837.

He served in the [[War of 1812]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]] under Captain [[John Ogilvy (soldier)|John Ogilvy]].  He continued a career in the militia for many years after, commanding the 3rd Militia Battalion in Montreal by 1846 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

He ran the import firm Benjamin Hart and Company, with his son [[Theodore Hart|Theodore]] joining as a partner by 1844.  However, he declared bankruptcy in 1848.

He opposed the [[Rebellion Losses Bill]] of 1849, and signed the [[Montreal Annexation Manifesto|Annexation Manifesto]], advocating economic and political union with the United States.  He then moved to New York and spent his final years there.

'''Best execution''' refers to the duty of an investment services firm (such as a [[brokerage firm|stock broker]]) executing [[Order (exchange)|orders]] on behalf of customers to ensure the best execution possible for their customers' orders. Some of the factors the broker must consider when seeking best execution of their customers' orders include: the opportunity to get a better price than what Is currently quoted, and the likelihood and speed of execution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/answers/bestex.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe there has been an attempt to define "best execution" within the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which introduces the principle that all financial services firms carrying out transactions on their clients' behalf: "must take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result, taking into account price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature or any other consideration relevant to the execution of the order."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsa.gov.uk/about/media/notes/bn020.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

For most broker-dealers or execution agents, best executions are usually optimally constructed via either static or dynamic programming.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/view/jackieshen/ Jackie (Jianhong) Shen] (2013), [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2327835 A Pre-Trade Algorithmic Trading Model under Given Volume Measures and Generic Price Dynamics (GVM-GPD)],  available at [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2327835  SSRN] or [https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2327835 DOI].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/view/jackieshen/ Jackie (Jianhong) Shen] and Yingjie Yu (2014), [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2507002 Styled Algorithmic Trading and the MV-MVP Style],  available at [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2507002  SSRN].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/view/jackieshen/ Jackie (Jianhong) Shen] (2017), [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2984297 Hybrid IS-VWAP Dynamic Algorithmic Trading via LQR],  available at [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2984297  SSRN].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluating best execution==

Some of the factors a [[brokerage firm|broker]] needs to consider when executing its customers' orders for best execution are these: the opportunity to get a better price than what is currently quoted, the speed of execution, and the likelihood trade will be executed.[https://www.sec.gov/answers/bestex.htm]

Best execution is often mistaken for trading at market price without taking into consideration factors such as the size of trade or settlement period.

'''''Business Centre Europe''''' is a [[business]] news programme once aired on [[CNBC Europe]] that replaced Europe Tonight.  Airing from 18.00 UK time, ''Business Centre Europe'' was a 30-minute wrap-up of the day's top business stories in Europe and also crossed over to the US to update progress on the trading day there.  The show was initially presented by Sarah Clements and then by Emma Crosby.

The show took its name from CNBC US' flagship evening show, ''Business Center''.  However unlike its U.S. and [[Business Center (CNBC Asia)|Asian]] counterparts which used slightly different lower-thirds on screen, the show's lower-thirds were the exactly same as the ones used on CNBC Europe's other daytime programmes.

The programme was canceled in late 2001 where Emma Crosby co-anchored the show preceding its timeslot, ''European Market Wrap'' along with Nigel Roberts.

'''Business Intelligence Markup Language''' (Biml) is a domain-specific [[XML]] dialect for defining [[business intelligence]] (BI) assets.  Biml authored BI assets can currently be used by the [[BIDS Helper]] add-on for [[Microsoft SQL Server]] [[Business Intelligence Development Studio]] (BIDS) and the [[Varigence]] Mist (now called BimlStudio) [[integrated development environment]]; both tools translate Biml metadata into [[SQL Server Integration Services]] (SSIS) and [[Microsoft Analysis Services|SQL Server Analysis Services]] (SSAS) assets for the [[Microsoft SQL Server]] platform. However, emitters can be created to compile Biml for any desired BI platform.

While Biml’s declarative design is sufficient to author BI assets, BimlScript extends the language by enabling authors to embed [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[VB.NET]] code within Biml, similar to how [[ASP.NET]] includes .NET code within static [[HTML]] markup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chenn|first=Ronen|title=BIDS helper new features ( April 2011 )|url=http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/bilive/archive/2011/05/16/bids-helper-new-features-april-2011.aspx|accessdate=October 1, 2012|newspaper=Business Intelligence,Technology, Thoughts, Thinking|date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BimlScript is used to merge changes into existing Biml assets, automatically generate Biml code, and apply changes across multiple Biml files during compilation.

==History==

===Biml===

Biml is an XML dialect that specifies all aspects of a BI solution, including relational models, data transformation packages, multi-dimensional models, and tabular models.

Unlike other BI solutions, Biml has a "write once, target any platform" philosophy. This enables Biml users to switch their target platform without needing to change their code. Currently, Biml targets SQL Server versions 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012 and 2014, emitting SSIS packages and SSAS cubes.

Because Biml is XML, it can leverage the vast ecosystem of tools for XML based languages. This also makes it human readable/writeable, so it is easier to edit by hand than the SSIS/SSAS files it generates.

In late 2009, Biml was extended with BimlScript. BimlScript allows C# or VB.NET code nuggets to be embedded directly within Biml. BimlScript's goal is to automate repetitive work in reusable scripts. Additionally, it's been used to automate package generation and build reusable patterns for BI tasks. BimlScript is also used to take metadata from various sources (relational database structure, relational data, flat files, annotations, etc...) and automatically generate Biml code from it.

===Mist===
[[Mist (IDE)|Mist]] is an IDE for authoring Biml code and building BI assets. Mist leverages visual design capabilities and [[debugging]] features to simultaneously edit entire business intelligence models, including relational tables, SSIS packages, and [[OLAP cube|cubes]].&lt;ref name="Leonard2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Andy|title=SQL Server 2012 Integration Services Design Patterns|year=2012|publisher=APress|isbn=978-1430237716|pages=456|author2=Masson, Matt |author3=Mitchell, Tim |author4=Moss, Jessica |author5= Ufford, Michelle |chapter=Chapter 17: Business Intelligence Markup Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mist also incorporates modern programming IDE features, including text editors with syntax highlighting, Intelliprompt and quick-info displays, source control integration, and multi-monitor support.

===BIDS Helper===
As Biml’s popularity has grown, key portions of the Biml engine, including dynamic package generation, have been contributed to the [http://bidshelper.codeplex.com BIDS Helper] open source project hosted on CodePlex.&lt;ref name="Tok2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tok|first=Wee-Hyong|title=Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Integration Services|year=2012|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn= 978-0735665859|author2=Parida, Rakesh |author3=Masson, Matt |author4=Ding, Xiaoning |author5= Sivashanmugam, Kaarthik  |page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welch|first=John|title=Biml Package Generator|url=http://bidshelper.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Biml%20Package%20Generator|work=BIDS Helper|accessdate=September 30, 2011|date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BimlScript community===
[http://www.bimlscript.com BimlScript.com] is a community website for developing and sharing Biml solutions to BI problems, and contributing Biml content to share with others. Along with tutorials, walkthroughs, and videos, the site provides an online Biml editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to BimlScript.com|url=http://bimlscript.com/Blog|work=BimlScript.com|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code generation==
Biml files are compiled to produce BI assets for a chosen platform. Currently, it’s possible to generate assets for Microsoft’s SSIS, SSAS, and SQL Server platforms, for the 2005, 2008 (R2), 2012 and 2014 releases. Other platforms may be targeted in the future.

==Syntax==
{{See also|XML#Key_terminology|l1=XML Terminology}}
Biml has a syntax that’s common to all XML languages. Tags begin and end with &lt; and &gt;, respectively. Furthermore, tags can have attributes and nested elements.

===Biml===

====Declaration====
Biml documents begin with a common declaration
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Root types====
Biml has a well-defined set of root types, indicating the various kinds of BI assets that can be created

* Connections
* Databases
* Schemas
* Tables
* Dimensions
* Facts
* Packages
* File Formats
* Script Projects
* Cubes
* Principals

====Example====
This is an example of the AdventureWorks DimCurrency table, authored in Biml

&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
  &lt;Dimensions&gt;
    &lt;Dimension Name="DimCurrency" SchemaName="Target.dbo" AttributeAllMemberName="All Source Currencies" DimensionType="Currency" FriendlyName="Currency"&gt;
      &lt;Columns&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyKey" /&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyAlternateKey" DataType="StringFixedLength" Length="3" /&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyName" DataType="String" Length="50" /&gt;
      &lt;/Columns&gt;
      &lt;Keys&gt;
        &lt;Identity Name="IK_DimCurrency"&gt;
          &lt;Columns&gt;
            &lt;Column ColumnName="CurrencyKey" /&gt;
          &lt;/Columns&gt;
        &lt;/Identity&gt;
        &lt;UniqueKey Name="AK_DimCurrency_CurrencyAlternateKey"&gt;
          &lt;Columns&gt;
            &lt;Column ColumnName="CurrencyAlternateKey" /&gt;
          &lt;/Columns&gt;
        &lt;/UniqueKey&gt;
      &lt;/Keys&gt;
      &lt;Indexes&gt;&lt;/Indexes&gt;
      &lt;Attributes&gt;
        &lt;Attribute Name="Source Currency" EstimatedCount="101" OrderBy="Name" AttributeType="CurrencySource" GroupingBehavior="DiscourageGrouping"&gt;
          &lt;InstanceSelection&gt;DropDown&lt;/InstanceSelection&gt;
          &lt;KeyColumns&gt;
            &lt;KeyColumn ColumnName="CurrencyName" NullProcessing="Error" /&gt;
          &lt;/KeyColumns&gt;
        &lt;/Attribute&gt;
        &lt;Attribute Name="Source Currency Code" EstimatedCount="105" OrderBy="Name" AttributeType="CurrencyIsoCode" Usage="Key" GroupingBehavior="DiscourageGrouping"&gt;
          &lt;InstanceSelection&gt;DropDown&lt;/InstanceSelection&gt;
          &lt;KeyColumns&gt;
            &lt;KeyColumn ColumnName="CurrencyKey" NullProcessing="Error" /&gt;
          &lt;/KeyColumns&gt;
          &lt;NameColumn ColumnName="CurrencyAlternateKey" /&gt;
        &lt;/Attribute&gt;
      &lt;/Attributes&gt;
      &lt;Relationships&gt;
        &lt;Relationship Name="Source Currency" ParentAttributeName="Source Currency Code" ChildAttributeName="Source Currency" Type="Rigid" /&gt;
      &lt;/Relationships&gt;
    &lt;/Dimension&gt;
  &lt;/Dimensions&gt;
&lt;/Biml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===BimlScript===
All BimlScript tags begin and end with &lt;# and #&gt; delimiters, respectively. Special types of BimlScript tags use augmented versions of these delimiters, to indicate specific usages.

====Directives====
A Biml file, with BimlScript, begins with at least one directive. Directives provide instructions to the Biml engine, regarding how to process the BimlScript and generate its Biml. Directives are single tags that begin with &lt;#@. Each directive begins with a single term, followed by attributes that supply required values.

The two most common directives are template and import.

=====Template=====
This directive indicates that the file's BimlScript uses the C# programming language.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;#@ template language="C#" #&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=====Import=====
This directive specifies .NET namespaces that should be imported for the file. It is functionally equivalent to the C# using statement or VB.NET Imports statement.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Languages.Biml.Connection" #&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Delimiters====
When authoring BimlScript, additional delimiters may be used. These delimiters match the behavior of T4 template delimiters.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Delimiter !! Description
|-
| &lt;# || Defines statements, in .NET code, that provide control flow in a Biml file.
|-
| &lt;#= || Evaluates .NET code, converts it to a string, and then embeds it in the Biml file.
|-
| &lt;#+ || Defines properties, methods, and files that are excluded from the Biml file but may be accessed by other BimlScript code nuggets.
|}

====Example====
This BimlScript example imports a database's assets via a connection, declared in a separate file, named "AdventureWorksLT". Each schema and table from the imported database is then embedded directly within the Schemas and Tables collections, respectively.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt; 
&lt;#@ template language="C#" hostspecific="True" tier="2" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Languages.Biml.Connection" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.Extensions" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.Extensions.SchemaManagement" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.CoreLowerer.SchemaManagement" #&gt;

&lt;#+ public ImportResults Results
{ 
    get 
    { 
        return ((AstOleDbConnectionNode)RootNode.Connections["AdventureWorksLT"]).ImportDB();
    }
}
#&gt; 

&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;Databases&gt;
        &lt;Database Name="MyDatabase" ConnectionName="AdventureWorksLT" /&gt;
    &lt;/Databases&gt;
    &lt;Schemas&gt;
        &lt;#=Results.SchemaNodes.GetBiml()#&gt;
    &lt;/Schemas&gt;
    &lt;Tables&gt; 
        &lt;#=Results.TableNodes.GetBiml()#&gt;
    &lt;/Tables&gt;
&lt;/Biml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This example shows how developers can use Biml and BimlScript to:
# Import schemas and tables directly from a database, and use them without needing to manually copy their structure.
# Have any changes to the assets be automatically reflected the next time this code is run.
# Import the assets and convert them to Biml using only two simple lines of code.

'''Calouste Gulbenkian''' ({{IPAc-en|k|æ|ˈ|l|uː|s|t|_|ɡ|ʊ|l|ˈ|b|ɛ|ŋ|k|i|ə|n}}, [[Western Armenian|Western]] {{lang-hy|Գալուստ Կիւլպէնկեան}}; 23 March 1869 – 20 July 1955) was a businessman and philanthropist of British nationality and [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin. He played a major role in making the petroleum reserves of the Middle East available to Western development and is credited with being the first person to exploit Iraqi oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia.|date=2006|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|location=Chicago|isbn=1593394926|page=817|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ea-bAAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gulbenkian travelled extensively and lived in a number of cities including Constantinople, London, Paris, and Lisbon.

Throughout his life, Gulbenkian was involved with many philanthropic activities including the establishment of schools, hospitals, and churches. The [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], a private foundation based in Portugal, was started at his bequest in 1956 and continues to promote arts, charity, education, and science throughout the world. It is now among the largest foundations in Europe.{{sfn|Anheier|Toepler|List|2010|p=816}} By the end of his life he had become one of the world's wealthiest individuals and his art acquisitions one of the greatest private collections.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Calouste Gulbenkian Dies at 86.

==Biography==
===Family background===
Gulbenkian's family is believed to be descendants of the [[Rshtuni]]s, an Armenian noble family centered around [[Lake Van]] in the 4th century AD.{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|p=11}} In the 11th century, the Rshtunis settled in [[Kayseri]], taking the name Vart Badrik, a Byzantine noble title. With the arrival of the [[Ottoman Turks]],  the Turkish equivalent of the name, Gülbenk, was adopted. The family had established themselves in the town of [[Talas, Turkey|Talas]] and lived in the region until the mid-1800s, when they ultimately moved to Constantinople. Their property in Talas was ultimately [[Confiscated Armenian properties in Turkey|confiscated]] and is currently owned by the Turkish government.{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|p=12}}

By 1860, his father Sarkis Gulbenkian was an [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenian]] oil importer/exporter already heavily involved in the oil industry. Sarkis was an owner of several oil fields in the [[Caucasus]], mainly in [[Baku]], and was a representative of [[Alexander Mantashev]]'s oil company.{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|p=18}} Sarkis Gulbenkian also provided oil to the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Black|2004|p=102}}  During [[Hagop Kazazian Pasha|Hagop Pasha's]] Directorship, and, subsequently, Ministry of the Privy Treasury under Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdulhamid II]] in 1879, Sarkis acquired the lucrative collection of taxes for the Privy Purse of [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt;
[[File:Gulbenkian age three.jpg|thumbnail|Calouste Gulbenkian at age three]]

===Early life===
Calouste Gulbenkian was born on 23 March 1869 in Scutari ([[Üsküdar]]), in the [[Ottoman Empire]] capital [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]).{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|p=18}} He received his early education at Aramyan-Uncuyan, a local Armenian school. He then attended the [[St. Joseph High School (Istanbul)|Lycée Saint-Joseph]] French school and continued his studies at [[Robert College]]. These studies were cut short when he moved to [[Marseilles]] at the age of 15 to perfect his French at a high school there.{{sfn|Hewins|1958|p=13}}

===Oil business===
His father sent him to be educated at [[King's College London]], where he studied [[petroleum engineering]], and then to examine the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|Russian oil industry]] at [[Baku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cumming|editor1-first=Robert|title=My B.B...: The Letters of Bernard Berenson and Kenneth Clark, 1925–1959|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300216068|page=526|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEjCCQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1887 at the age of 18 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first class degree]] in engineering and applied sciences.{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|pp=20-1}} A year later, he went to Baku to further his knowledge on the oil industry.{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|pp=23-4}} Gulbenkian later wrote an article entitled ''La Transcaucasie et la péninsule d'Apchéron; souvenirs de voyage'' ("[[Transcaucasia]] and
the [[Absheron Peninsula]] – Memoirs of a Journey") which appeared in the ''[[Revue des deux Mondes]]'', a French language monthly literary and cultural affairs magazine.

[[File:Calouste Gulbenkian age 20.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Gulbenkian in 1889 at the age of 20, newly graduated from King's College]]

After Hagop Pasha's appointment as the [[List of Ottoman Ministers of Finance|Ottoman Minister of Finance]] in 1887, he had Calouste prepare an oil survey of Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt;  To develop the oil survey, Calouste merely read travel books and interviewed railroad engineers that were surveying and building the [[Baghdad Railway]].&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt;  Gulbenkian's oil survey led Hagop Pasha to believe that vast oil deposits lay in Mesopotamia (modern Syria and Iraq), to acquire tracts of land for the Sultan's oil reserves, and to establish the Ottoman oil industry in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt;

By 1895, he started his oil operation business.&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt; He had to return to the Ottoman Empire, but in 1896, Gulbenkian and his family fled the empire due to the [[Hamidian massacres]] of Armenians.{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|p=24}}{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=74}} They ended up in Egypt, where Gulbenkian met [[Alexander Mantashev]], a prominent [[Russian Armenia|Armenian]] oil magnate and philanthropist. Mantashev introduced Gulbenkian to influential contacts in Cairo.{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|pp=24-5}} These new acquaintances included [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=75}} Still in his twenties, Gulbenkian moved to London in 1897 where he arranged deals in the oil business.{{sfn|Tugendhat|Hamilton|1975|p=63}} He became a naturalised British citizen in 1902. In 1907, he helped arrange the merger of Royal Dutch Petroleum Company with "Shell" Transport and Trading Company Ltd. Gulbenkian emerged as a major shareholder of the newly formed company, [[Royal Dutch Shell]].&lt;ref name=vassiliou&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vassiliou|first1=M.S.|title=Historical dictionary of the petroleum industry|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0810862883|pages=226–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vArc08DO9ykC}}&lt;/ref&gt; His habit of retaining five percent of the shares of the oil companies he developed earned him the nickname "Mr. Five Percent".&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, J. J., &amp; Henson, B. (1987). ''Mr. Five Percent: The Story of Calouste Gulbenkian''. [S.l.]: Home Vision. {{ISBN|978-0-7800-0755-0}}, {{OCLC|31611185}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the royalist [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909]], Gulbenkian became a financial and economic adviser to the Turkish embassies in London and Paris, and later, chief financial advisory to the Turkish government.&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt;  He was a member of a British technical team to Turkey and, later, a director of the [[National Bank of Turkey]], which was established to support British designs.&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt;

In 1912 Gulbenkian was the driving force behind the creation of the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC)—a consortium of the largest European oil companies aimed at cooperatively procuring oil exploration and development rights in the Ottoman territory of Mesopotamia, while excluding other interests.  The German interests would be limited to a 25% share, with a 35% for the British, and the remaining for Gulbenkian to choose.&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt;  So, he gave Royal Dutch Shell 25% and kept 15% for himself as "the conceiver, the founder, and the artisan of the Turkish Petroleum combine."&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt;  A promise of these rights was made to the TPC, but the onset of [[World War I]] interrupted their efforts.  At first, the British Foreign Office supported the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company#The D.27Arcy Oil Concession|d'Arcy group]] to gain a share and replace Calouste's share, but Gulbenkian worked closely with French concerns, arranged for the French to receive the German's share as part of the spoils of victory,  and, in return, the French protected his interest.&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt;
[[File:Gulbenkian with his wife.jpg|thumb|Gulbenkian's wedding to Nevarte Essayan in London in 1892]]
During the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire after the war, most of [[Ottoman Syria]] came under the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]] and most of [[Ottoman Iraq]] came [[Mandatory Iraq|under British mandate]]. Heated and prolonged negotiations ensued regarding which companies could invest in the Turkish Petroleum Company. The TPC was granted exclusive oil exploration rights to Mesopotamia in 1925. The discovery of a large oil reserve at [[Baba Gurgur]] provided the impetus to conclude negotiations and in July 1928 an agreement, called the "[[Red Line Agreement]]", was signed which determined which oil companies could invest in TPC and reserved 5% of the shares for Gulbenkian.{{sfn|Conlin|2010|p=282}} The name of the company was changed to the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] in 1929. The [[Pasha]] had actually given Gulbenkian the entire Iraqi oil concession. Gulbenkian, however, saw advantage in divesting the vast majority of his concession so that corporations would be able to develop the whole. Gulbenkian grew wealthy on the remainder. He reputedly said, "Better a small piece of a big pie, than a big piece of a small one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=John|title=In the Trenches: Adventures in Journalism and Public Affairs|date=2012|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781462067831|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hsALOP-k6-gC]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, before the beginning of [[World War II]], Gulbenkian incorporated a [[Panama]]nian company to hold his assets in the oil industry.&lt;ref name=vassiliou /&gt; From this "Participations and Explorations Corporation" came the "[[Partex]] Oil and Gas (Holdings) Corporation", now a subsidiary of the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] headquartered in [[Lisbon]].

===Art collection===
Gulbenkian amassed a huge fortune and an art collection which he kept in a private museum at his Paris house. An art expert said in a 1950 issue of [[Life magazine|''Life'' magazine]] that "Never in modern history has one man owned so much."&lt;ref name=lifemag /&gt; His four-story, three-basement house on [[Avenue d'Iéna]] was said to be crammed with art, a situation ameliorated in 1936 when he lent thirty paintings to the [[National Gallery, London]] and his Egyptian sculpture to the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;

[[File:House of gulbenkian.jpg|thumb|240px|Gulbenkian's home on 51 Avenue d'Iéna in Paris, where he kept most of his art]]

Throughout his lifetime, Gulbenkian managed to collect over 6,400 pieces of art.{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|p=44}} The collection includes objects from antiquity to the 20th century. Some of the works in the collection were bought during the [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]].{{sfn|Chilvers|2005|p=320}}

While Gulbenkian's art collection may be found in many museum across the world, most of his art is exhibited at the [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. The museum was founded according to his will, in order to accommodate and display his collection, now belonging to the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]].  Of the roughly 6,000 items in the museum's collections, a selection of around 1000 is on permanent display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premises|url=https://gulbenkian.pt/museu/colecao-do-fundador/sobre-a-colecao/|publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (official website)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Throughout his life, Gulbenkian donated large sums of money to churches, scholarships, schools, and hospitals. Many of his donations were to Armenian foundations and establishments. He required that proceeds from his 5% share of profits from oil should go to Armenian families. He also demanded that 5% of his workers in his oil production for the Iraq Petroleum Company should be of Armenian descent.{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|p=49}}
[[File:Saint Sargis Armenian church in London-4.jpg|thumb|left|[[St Sarkis, Kensington|St Sarkis Armenian Church]], which Gulbenkian financed. He is buried on its grounds.]]
He established the [[St Sarkis, Kensington|St Sarkis Armenian church]] in [[Kensington]], a suburb in [[London]], [[England]]. The church was built in 1922–23 as a memorial to his parents, and the architect was [[Arthur Joseph Davis|Arthur Davis]].&lt;ref name="English Heritage"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1080556 |desc=Church of St Sarkis (Armenian Church), Iverna Gardens, W8|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The London Encyclopaedia|edition=1993|author=Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert|publisher=Macmillan|page=426|ISBN=0-333-57688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gulbenkian wanted to provide "spiritual comfort" to the Armenian community and a place of gathering for "dispersed Armenians," according to a message written by Gulbenkian to the [[Catholicos of All Armenians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accc.org.uk/st-sarkis/ |title=St. Sarkis &amp;#124; Armenian Community and Church Council of Great Britain |publisher=Accc.org.uk |date=11 January 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, he was the chief benefactor to the establishment of an extensive library at the [[Cathedral of St. James, Jerusalem|St. James Cathedral]], the principal church of the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]]. The library is called the Gulbenkian Library and contains more than 100,000 books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gulbenkian Library|url=http://www.armenian-patriarchate.com/home/gulbenkian-library.html|publisher=Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem (official website)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725113727/http://armenian-patriarchate.com/home/gulbenkian-library.html|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many of his significant donations was to the [[Surp Pırgiç Armenian Hospital]] located in Istanbul. A large property called the ''Selamet Han'' was donated to the Surp Pırgiç foundation in 1954.&lt;ref name="THE STATE AND NOT THE ECHR, RETURNS SELAMET HAN"&gt;{{cite news|title=The State and not the ECHR, Returns Selamet Han|url=http://www.sabahenglish.com/National/2011/02/17/the_state_and_not_the_echr_returns_selamet_han|newspaper=Sabah|date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property was confiscated by the state in 1974, but returned to the foundation in 2011.&lt;ref name="Turkey returns Selamet Han to Armenian foundation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey returns Selamet Han to Armenian foundation|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;newsId=235948&amp;link=235948|newspaper=Zaman|date=18 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021222409/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;newsId=235948&amp;link=235948|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped establish a nurses' home at the hospital after selling his wife's jewelry{{sfn|Conlin|2010|p=287}}

He was president of the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] (AGBU) from 1930–1932, resigning as a result of a [[smear campaign]] by ''Soviet Armenia'', an Armenian newspaper based in [[Armenia SSR]].{{sfn|Conlin|2010|p=285}} He was also a major benefactor of [[Nubarashen District|Nubarashen]] and [[Nor Kesaria]], which were newly founded settlements consisting of refugees from the [[Armenian Genocide]].{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|p=57}}

===Later life and death===
[[File:Gulbenkian enclos.jpg|thumb|Gulbenkian at ''Les Enclos'', his garden retreat in Deauville.]]
In 1937, Gulbenkian purchased a property near [[Deauville]] and called it ''Les Enclos''.{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|pp=41-2}} It was a place of repose for him. Nobel prize-winning writer and friend [[Saint-John Perse]] nicknamed him the ''Sage of Les Enclose'' and remarked in a letter to Gulbenkian that Les Enclos was "the cornerstone of your work, because it is the most alive, the most intimate and sensitive, the best guarded secret for your dreams."{{sfn|Armenian Communities Department|2010|pp=42-3}}

By the onset of the Second World War, having acquired [[diplomatic immunity]] as the economic adviser of the Persian legation in Paris, he followed the French government when it fled to [[Vichy]], where he became the minister for Iran.&lt;ref name=lifemag&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coughlan|first1=Robert|title=Mystery Billionaire|journal=Life|date=27 November 1950|volume=29|issue=22|pages=81–107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0sEAAAAMBAJ|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, he was, despite his links to the UK, temporarily declared an enemy alien by the British Government, and his UK oil assets sequestered, though returned with compensation at the end of the war.{{sfn|Kumar|2012|p=113}} He left France in late 1942 for Lisbon and lived there until his death, in a suite at the luxurious Aviz Hotel, on 20 July 1955, aged 86.{{sfn|Azeredo Perdigão|1969|p=21}} His wife Nevarte died in 1952 in Paris.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; They had two children, a son [[Nubar Gulbenkian|Nubar]] and a daughter Rita, who would become the wife of Iranian diplomat of Armenian descent Kevork Loris Essayan.

He is buried at [[St Sarkis, Kensington|St. Sarkis Armenian Church]] in London.

==Legacy and fortune==
At the time of his death, Gulbenkian's fortune was estimated at between US$280 million and US$840 million. Undisclosed sums were willed in trust to his descendants; the remainder of his fortune and art collection were willed to the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] (''Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian''), with US$400,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corley|first1=Felix|title=The Armenian Church Under the Soviet Regime|journal=Religion, State &amp; Society|date=1996|issue=1|volume=24|url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/24-1_009.pdf|publisher=[[Keston Institute]]|issn=0963-7494|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be reserved to restore the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]], Armenia's mother church, when relations with the [[Soviet Union]] permitted.&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite news|title=Gulbenkian's Will Sets Up Foundation|agency=New York Times|date=23 July 1955|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation was to act for charitable, educational, artistic, and scientific purposes, and the named trustees were his long-time friend [[Cyril Radcliffe, 1st Viscount Radcliffe|Baron Radcliffe of Werneth]], Lisbon attorney José de Azeredo Perdigão, and his son-in-law Kevork Loris Essayan. In Lisbon the foundation established its headquarters and the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Museum]] (''[[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]]'') to display his art collection.

[[William Saroyan]] wrote a short story about Gulbenkian in his 1971 book, ''[[Letters from 74 rue Taitbout]] or Don't Go But If You Must Say Hello To Everybody''.

A '''consultant pharmacist''' is a [[pharmacist]] who works as a [[consultant]] providing expert advice on the use of [[medications]] or on the provision of [[Pharmacy|pharmacy services]] to medical institutions, medical practices and individual patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is a Consultant Pharmacist?|website=[[American Society of Consultant Pharmacists]]|url=https://www.ascp.com/articles/what-consultant-pharmacist|accessdate=11 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132814/https://www.ascp.com/articles/what-consultant-pharmacist|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
In the US, a consultant pharmacist focuses on reviewing and managing the medication regimens of [[patient]]s, particularly those in institutional settings such as [[nursing home]]s. Consultant pharmacists ensure their patients’ medications are appropriate, effective, as safe as possible and used correctly; and identify, resolve, and prevent [[adverse drug reaction|medication-related problems]] that may interfere with the goals of therapy. 

== United Kingdom ==
In the UK's [[National Health Service|NHS]], the term consultant pharmacist refers to a pharmacist who has advanced roles in patient care, research and education in a specific medical speciality or expert area of practice.

The Department of Health for England produced guidance in 2005 which described the role of the Consultant Pharmacist which is distinct from other roles in England and internationally. The posts are intended to be innovative new posts that will help improve patient care by retaining clinical excellence within the NHS and strengthening professional leadership. The consultant pharmacist posts have been created to provide a dynamic link between clinical practice and service development to support new models for delivering patient care. The title consultant pharmacist should only apply to approved posts that meet the principles, set out in the guidance, around four main functions:

* Expert practice, ensuring that the highest level of pharmaceutical expertise is available to those patients who need it and making the best use of high level pharmacy skills in patient care.
* Research, evaluation and service development, playing a crucial role in addressing the need to increase research capacity and to develop a workforce that is research aware as well as contributing to audit and service evaluation.
* Education, mentoring and overview of practice, with a clear role in working with higher education institutions (HEIs), undertaking teaching in their field of practice and work to enhance links between practice, professional bodies and HEIs.
* Professional leadership. Consultant pharmacists will develop and identify best practice working with advanced practitioners, professional managers of pharmaceutical services, and other relevant healthcare professionals to achieve successful outcomes. They will be acknowledged sources of expertise, and will contribute to the development of service strategies, which will drive change across health and social care.

The guidance recommends that the title consultant pharmacist is not conferred on individuals purely in recognition of innovative or excellent practice, but for those practitioners who meet the required competencies for the post. In the NHS, the posts created within or across NHS organisations, are approved by Strategic Health Authorities (or clusters of SHA’s). The SHA's provide approval panels for ratification of consultants posts to ensure that business plans match the spirit of this guidance and that posts are sustainable, equitable and transferable across the NHS.

The competency requirements for consultant pharmacists are drawn from the Advanced and Consultant Level Competency Framework designed by the Competency Development and Evaluation Group (CoDEG, see www.codeg.org) which is divided into six capability (competency) clusters. Postholders are required to demonstrate:

* A majority of competencies in each of the expert professional practice, building working relationships and leadership clusters at the highest level (mastery)
and
* A majority of the competencies in each of the management, education, training and development and research &amp; evaluation clusters at the intermediate level (excellence).
There is work is underway to make explicit links between the Competency Framework and the NHS Knowledge and Skills Framework. The role of consultant pharmacists in the NHS is evolving and although many posts are currently based in hospital practice, the role is developing in primary care.

'''Data envelopment analysis (DEA)''' is a [[non-parametric statistics|nonparametric]] method in [[operations research]] and [[economics]] for the estimation of [[production-possibility frontier|production frontiers]]{{clarify|date=July 2011|reason=what is a production frontier}}. It is used to empirically measure [[productive efficiency]] of decision making units (or DMUs). Although DEA has a strong link to production theory in economics, the tool is also used for benchmarking in operations management, where a set of measures is selected to benchmark the performance of manufacturing and service operations. In the circumstance of benchmarking, the efficient DMUs, as defined by DEA, may not necessarily form a “production frontier”, but rather lead to a “best-practice frontier” (Cook, Tone and Zhu, 2014). DEA is referred to as "balanced benchmarking" by Sherman and Zhu (2013). Non-parametric approaches have the benefit of not assuming a particular functional form/shape for the frontier, however they do not provide a general relationship (equation) relating output and input. There are also [[parametric statistics|parametric]] approaches which are used for the estimation of production frontiers (see Lovell &amp; Schmidt 1988 for an early survey). These require that the shape of the frontier be guessed beforehand by specifying a particular function relating output to input.  One can also combine the relative strengths from each of these approaches in a hybrid method   (Tofallis, 2001) where the frontier units are first identified by DEA and then a smooth surface is fitted to these. This allows a best-practice relationship between multiple outputs and multiple inputs to be estimated.

"The framework has been adapted from multi-input, multi-output production functions and applied in many industries. DEA develops a function whose form is determined by the most efficient producers.  This method differs from the [[Ordinary Least Squares]] (OLS) statistical technique that bases comparisons relative to an average producer.  Like [[Stochastic Frontier Analysis]] (SFA), DEA identifies a "[[Pareto efficiency#Pareto frontier|frontier]]" which are characterized as an extreme point method that assumes that if a firm can produce a certain level of output utilizing specific input levels, another firm of equal scale should be capable of doing the same. The most efficient producers can form a 'composite producer', allowing the computation of an efficient solution for every level of input or output. Where there is no actual corresponding firm, 'virtual producers' are identified to make comparisons" (Berg 2010).

Attempts to synthesize DEA and SFA, improving upon their drawbacks, were also made in the literature, via proposing various versions of non-parametric SFA &lt;ref name=simar2015&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jproda/v43y2015i2p199-214.html |author=Park, B., L.

==History==
In [[microeconomic]] production theory a firm's input and output combinations are depicted using a production function. Using such a function one can show the maximum output which can be achieved with any possible combination of inputs, that is, one can construct a production technology frontier (Sieford &amp; Thrall 1990).&lt;ref name=SeifordThrall&gt;{{cite journal |author1=L.M. Seiford |author2=R.M. Thrall |year=1990 |title=Recent Developments in DEA: The Mathematical Programming Approach to Frontier Analysis |journal=[[Journal of Econometrics]] |volume=46 |pages=7–38 |doi=10.1016/0304-4076(90)90045-u}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 30 years ago DEA (and frontier techniques in general) set out to answer the question of how to use this principle in empirical applications while overcoming the problem that for actual firms (or other DMUs) one can never observe all the possible input-output combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emrouznejad|first=Ali|last2=Yang|first2=Guo-liang|date=2018|title=A survey and analysis of the first 40 years of scholarly literature in DEA: 1978–2016|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seps.2017.01.008|journal=Socio-Economic Planning Sciences|volume=61|pages=4–8|doi=10.1016/j.seps.2017.01.008|issn=0038-0121|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the ideas of Farrell (1957), the seminal work "Measuring the efficiency of decision making units" by [[Abraham Charnes|Charnes]], [[William W. Cooper|Cooper]] &amp; [[Edwardo Rhodes|Rhodes]] (1978) applies linear programming to estimate an empirical production technology frontier for the first time. In Germany, the procedure was used earlier to estimate the marginal productivity of R&amp;D and other factors of production (Brockhoff 1970). Since then, there have been a large number of books and journal articles written on DEA or applying DEA on various sets of problems. Other than comparing efficiency across DMUs within an organization, DEA has also been used to compare efficiency across firms. There are several types of DEA with the most basic being CCR based on Charnes, Cooper &amp; Rhodes, however there are also DEA which address varying returns to scale, either CRS (constant returns to scale, VRS (variable), non increasing returns to scale or the non decreasing returns to scale by Ylvinger (2000). The main developments of DEA in the 1970s and 1980s are documented by Seiford &amp; Thrall (1990).'''

==Techniques==
{{cleanup|section|date=July 2009}}
Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a [[linear programming]] methodology to measure the [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] of multiple decision-making units (DMUs) when the production process presents a structure of multiple inputs and outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yishi Zhang|author2=Anrong Yang|author3=Chan Xiong|author4=Teng Wang|author5=Zigang Zhang|title=Feature selection using data envelopment analysis|journal=Knowledge-Based Systems|date=2014|volume=64|pages=70-80|publisher=ELSEVIER|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"DEA has been used for both production and cost data. Utilizing the selected variables, such as unit cost and output, DEA software searches for the points with the lowest unit cost for any given output, connecting those points to form the efficiency frontier. Any company not on the frontier is considered inefficient. A numerical coefficient is given to each firm, defining its relative efficiency. Different variables that could be used to establish the efficiency frontier are: number of employees, service quality, environmental safety, and fuel consumption. An early survey of studies of electricity distribution companies identified more than thirty DEA analyses—indicating widespread application of this technique to that network industry. (Jamasb, T. J., Pollitt, M. G. 2001). A number of studies using this technique have been published for water utilities.  The main advantage to this method is its ability to accommodate a multiplicity of inputs and outputs. It is also useful because it takes into consideration returns to scale in calculating efficiency, allowing for the concept of increasing or decreasing efficiency based on size and output levels. A drawback of this technique is that model specification and inclusion/exclusion of variables can affect the results." (Berg 2010)

Under general DEA benchmarking, for example, "if one benchmarks the performance of computers, it is natural to consider different features (screen size and resolution, memory size, process speed, hard disk size, and others). One would then have to classify these features into “inputs” and “outputs” in order to apply a proper DEA analysis. However, these features may not actually represent inputs and outputs at all, in the standard notion of production. In fact, if one examines the benchmarking literature, other terms, such as “indicators”, “outcomes”, and “metrics”, are used. The issue now becomes one of how to classify these performance measures into inputs and outputs, for use in DEA." (Cook, Tone, and Zhu, 2014)

Some of the advantages of DEA are:
* no need to explicitly specify a mathematical form for the production function
* proven to be useful in uncovering relationships that remain hidden for other methodologies
* capable of handling multiple inputs and outputs
* capable of being used with any input-output measurement
* the sources of inefficiency can be analysed and quantified for every evaluated unit

Some of the disadvantages of DEA are:
* results are sensitive to the selection of inputs and outputs (Berg 2010).
* you cannot test for the best specification (Berg 2010). 
* the number of efficient firms on the frontier tends to increase with the number of inputs and output variables (Berg 2010).

A desire to Improve upon DEA, by reducing its disadvantages or strengthening its advantages has been a major cause for many discoveries in the recent literature. The currently most often DEA-based method to obtain unique efficiency rankings is called [[cross-efficiency]]. Originally developed by Sexton et al. in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sexton|first=Thomas R.|date=1986|title=Data envelopment analysis: Critique and extension|url=|journal=New Directions for Program Evaluation|volume=32|pages=73-105|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it found widespread application ever since Doyle and Green's 1994 publication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=John|last2=Green|first2=Rodney|date=1994-05-01|title=Efficiency and Cross-efficiency in DEA: Derivations, Meanings and Uses|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jors.1994.84|journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society|language=en|volume=45|issue=5|pages=567–578|doi=10.1057/jors.1994.84|issn=0160-5682}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Cross-efficiency is based on the original DEA results, but implents a secondary objective where each DMU peer-appraises all other DMU's with its own factor weights. The average of these peer-appraisal scores is then used to calculate a DMU's cross-efficiency score. This approach avoids DEA's disadvantages of having multiple efficient DMUs and potentially non-unique weights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyson|first=R. G.|last2=Allen|first2=R.|last3=Camanho|first3=A. S.|last4=Podinovski|first4=V. V.|last5=Sarrico|first5=C. S.|last6=Shale|first6=E.

Another approach to remedy some of DEA's drawbacks is Stochastic DEA, which makes a synthesises of DEA and SFA.&lt;ref name=simar2011/&gt;

==Sample applications==

DEA is commonly applied in the electric utilities sector. For instance a government authority can choose data envelopment analysis as their measuring tool to design an individualized regulatory rate for each firm based on their comparative efficiency. The input components would include man-hours, losses, capital (lines and transformers only), and goods and services. The output variables would include number of customers, energy delivered, length of lines, and degree of coastal exposure. (Berg 2010)

DEA is also regularly used to assess the efficiency of public and not-for-profit organizations, e.g. hospitals (Kuntz, Scholtes &amp; Vera 2007; Kuntz &amp; Vera 2007; Vera &amp; Kuntz 2007), police forces (Thanassoulis 1995; Sun 2002; Aristovnik et al. 2013, 2014), or liberal arts colleges (Eckles, 2010).

===Examples===
In the DEA methodology, formally developed by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (1978), efficiency is defined as a ratio of weighted sum of outputs to a weighted sum of inputs, where the weights structure is calculated by means of mathematical programming and  [[constant returns to scale]] (CRS) are assumed. In 1984, Banker, Charnes and Cooper developed a model with variable returns to scale (VRS).

Assume that we have the following data:

* Unit 1 produces 100 items per day, and the inputs per item are 10 dollars for materials and 2 labour-hours
* Unit 2 produces 80 items per day, and the inputs are 8 dollars for materials and 4 labour-hours
* Unit 3 produces 120 items per day, and the inputs are 12 dollars for materials and 1.5 labour-hours

To calculate the efficiency of unit 1, we define the objective function as

* maximize efficiency = (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 100) / (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 10 + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 2)

which is subject to all efficiency of other units (efficiency cannot be larger than 1):

* subject to the efficiency of unit 1: (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 100) / (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 10 + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 2) ≤ 1
* subject to the efficiency of unit 2: (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 80) / (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 8 + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 4) ≤ 1
* subject to the efficiency of unit 3: (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 120) / (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 12 + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 1.5) ≤ 1

and non-negativity:

* all ''u'' and ''v'' ≥ 0.

But since linear programming cannot handle fraction, we need to transform the formulation, such that we limit the denominator of the objective function and only allow the linear programming to maximize the numerator.

So the new formulation would be:

* maximize efficiency = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 100
* subject to the efficiency of unit 1: (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 100) − (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 10 + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 2) ≤ 0
* subject to the efficiency of unit 2: (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 80) − (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 8 + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 4) ≤ 0
* subject to the efficiency of unit 3: (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 120) − (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 12 + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 1.5) ≤ 0
* subject to ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 10 + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; 2 = 1
* all ''u'' and ''v'' ≥ 0.

==Inefficiency measuring==
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been recognized as a valuable analytical research instrument and a practical decision support tool. DEA has been credited for not requiring a complete specification for the functional form of the production frontier nor the distribution of inefficient deviations from the frontier. Rather, DEA requires general production and distribution assumptions only. However, if those assumptions are too weak, inefficiency levels may be systematically underestimated in small samples. In addition, erroneous assumptions may cause inconsistency with a bias over the frontier. Therefore, the ability to alter, test and select production assumptions is essential in conducting DEA-based research. However, the DEA models currently available offer a limited variety of alternative production assumptions only.

==Career==
Crenshaw began his career in 1998 as an independent consultant for a large consulting firm for [[small business]]es. He is also a [[Lynda Weinman|Lynda.com's]] author and presenter of over 10 business skills courses, including "Time Management Fundamentals" and "Small Business Secrets".&lt;ref name=NSA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://directory.espeakers.com/nsas/viewspeaker19779 |title=Dave Crenshaw |publisher=''[[National Speakers Association]]'' |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lynda.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lynda.com/Dave-Crenshaw/955602-1.html |title=Author &gt; Dave Crenshaw |publisher=''[[Lynda Weinman|Lynda.com]]'' |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSM2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/marriottmag/summer11/alumni/class_notes.cfm#2000 |title=Summer 2011 &gt; Class Notes &gt; 2000 |publisher=''[[Marriott School of Management#Alumni|Marriott School]] at [[Brigham Young University]]'' |magazine=''Marriott Alumni Magazine'' |year=2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709002738/https://marriottschool.byu.edu/marriottmag/summer11/alumni/class_notes.cfm#2000 |archivedate=July 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC News]] described Crenshaw as a multitasking expert, and wrote that Crenshaw says that to be productive it is best not to multi-task at all. Crenshaw is described by Mark Lewis in [[Forbes]] as a productivity consultant, and wrote that Crenshaw says that multitaskers think they are doing two or more things simultaneously, when actually they are switching rapidly back and forth between tasks.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; Joyce E.A. Russell wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Crenshaw says that multitasking should be called switchtasking because if you really examined what you are doing you would see that people are just rapidly switching from one task to another, and as we are not very good at it, it can have some consequences, actually hurting our [[productivity]] because of the time lost making even fast switches.&lt;ref name=TWP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/28/AR2011012805971.html |title=Career coach: Move beyond the multi-tasking badge |author=Joyce E.A.

'''Edward Cadbury''' (1873 &amp;ndash; 21 November 1948) was a [[British people|British]] chairman of [[Cadbury Brothers]], business theorist, and philanthropist, known for his pioneering works on management and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hGlAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gpgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1579,4864470&amp;dq=edward-cadbury&amp;hl=en | title=Mr Edward Cadbury | journal=[[Glasgow Herald]] | date=21 November 1948 | page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Fifty key figures in management | series=Routledge key guides | author=[[Morgen Witzel]] | publisher=Routledge | year=2003 | isbn=0-415-36977-0 | pages=43–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Edward Cadbury was the eldest son of [[George Cadbury]] and his first wife Mary (née Tylor). He grew up in the house which is now occupied by the [[Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre]] near Birmingham, England, and around 1890 studied in London and Germany.

Cadbury joined the family business of [[Cadbury Brothers]] in 1893, becoming a managing director in 1899 and chairman in 1937, retiring in 1943. He was chairman of the [[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News Ltd]] from 1911 to 1930. Cadbury was also one of the founders of Selly Oak Colleges, which merged into the [[University of Birmingham]], and was the first Chairman and Treasurer of Council of Selly Oak Colleges.&lt;ref name="mingana"&gt;[http://www.mingana.bham.ac.uk/cadbury.shtml Edward Cadbury (1873 - 1948)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026122301/http://www.mingana.bham.ac.uk/cadbury.shtml |date=26 October 2013 }} at ''mingana.bham.ac.uk'',&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadbury's research interest were in "economics, management and organisations... including workers' welfare and women's employment rights."&lt;ref name="mingana"/&gt;

In response to Taylor’s time studies and his concept of scientific management, Cadbury criticized Taylor for transferring employee skills and initiatives from the individual worker to management. This argument was published in Cadbury's essay "Some Principles of Industrial Organisation: The Case for and against Scientific Management" in 1914.&lt;ref name="someprinciples"&gt;Cadbury, Edward. "Some principles of Industrial Organisation: The Case for and against Scientific Management" The ''Sociological Review'' 7.2 (1914): 99-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''First, Break All the Rules''''', subtitled ''What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently'' (1999), is a book authored by [[Marcus Buckingham]] and [[Curt Coffman]], who offer solutions to better employee satisfaction with the help of examples of how the best [[managers]] handle [[employees]].

==Content outline==
Buckingham and  Coffman discuss the fallacies of standard [[management]] thinking and how good managers create and sustain [[employee satisfaction]]. The book is a result of observations based on 80,000 [[interviews]] with managers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcusbuckingham.com/books/break-rules.php Marcus Buckingham | First, Break All The Rules &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422190931/http://www.marcusbuckingham.com/books/break-rules.php |date=April 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as conducted by the [[Gallup Organization]] in the last 25 years. The core of the matter lies in how these managers have [[debunker|debunked]] old [[myths]] about management and how they created new truths on obtaining and keeping talented people in their [[organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leadership Hall Of Fame: Marcus Buckingham, Author Of "First, Break All The Rules"|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1749059/leadership-hall-fame-marcus-buckingham-author-first-break-all-rules|website = Fast Company|access-date = 2016-02-20|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key ideas of the book include what the best managers do and don’t do: they treat every employee as an individual; they don’t try to fix weaknesses, but instead focus on strengths and talent; and they find ways to measure, count, and reward outcomes.

* '''[[Budget]]''' generally refers to a list of all planned expenses and revenues.
* '''[[Budgeted cost of work performed]]''' (BCWP) measures the budgeted cost of work that has actually been performed, rather than the cost of work scheduled.
* '''[[Budgeted cost of work scheduled]]''' (BCWS)  the approved budget that has been allocated to complete a scheduled task (or Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) component) during a specific time period.
* '''[[Business case]]''' a document that examines business need and cost-benefits analysis of a project to justify the approval of the project and to set its boundaries.
* '''[[Business model]]''' is a profit-producing system that has an important degree of independence from the other systems within an enterprise.
* '''[[Business analysis]]''' is the set of tasks, knowledge, and techniques required to identify business needs and determine solutions to business problems. Solutions often include a systems development component, but may also consist of process improvement or organizational change.
* '''[[Business operations]]''' are those ongoing recurring activities involved in the running of a business for the purpose of producing value for the stakeholders. They are contrasted with project management, and consist of business processes.

The '''Greater Seattle Business Association (GSBA)''' is a [[Seattle, Washington]]-based lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender ([[LGBT]]), and allied [[chamber of commerce]].  The majority of the organization's membership are [[small business]]es located throughout the [[Puget Sound]] area. The association's mission is to combine business development, leadership, and [[social activism]] to expand economic opportunities for the [[LGBT community]] and allies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2008/01/28/focus1.html Philadelphia and other towns outdo Seattle in going after $56B gay tourism market], Puget Sound Business Journal (Seattle), Friday, January 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The GSBA was founded in 1981  for the purposes of visibility and to create a unified voice for the [[lesbian]] and [[gay]] business community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegsba.org/about/history/timeline.php GSBA timeline] - GSBA website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional activities===
In 1992, GSBA formed the Western Business Alliance in partnership with the Greater San Diego Business Association and the Camelback Business Association of Phoenix.  In 1997, the WBA brought together 21 LGBT-and-allied organizations—from [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], in the north; to [[Tijuana]], Mexico, in the south.  With the establishment of the [[National Gay &amp; Lesbian Chamber of Commerce]] in 2004 (of which GSBA was a founding member), GSBA's current executive director, Louise Chernin, was appointed National Chair on the Council on Chambers and Business Organizations (CCBO), a position she held for four years.  The following year, the WBA voted in favor of folding into the NGLCC’s CCBO structure as the Pacific Regional Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insandouts.org/2011/05/edited-inba-spokanes-lgbt-bussiness-chamber/ INBA – Spokane’s LGBT business chamber working to get to the next level] - insandouts.org, May 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gay Wedding Show ===
GSBA was the presenting sponsor of the first Gay Wedding Show in 2004.  Held at Seattle's Swedish Cultural Center, the event hosted 50 vendors and was the first of its kind in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=gaywedding26&amp;date=20040326 Booming wedding industry poised to tap into growing market for gay marriages] - Seattle Times, Friday, March 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National recognition ===
In November 2008 GSBA was awarded "Chamber of the Year" by the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC) in Washington, D.C. recognizing its leadership among more than 45 other regional LGBT and Allied chambers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/388091_insiderweb17.html The Insider: Network Strong] - Seattle Post-Intelligencer, November 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, GSBA played host affiliate chamber to NGLCC's Sixth Annual Out for Business Conference, held in Seattle.  That year GSBA received the "Community Outreach Award" for its scholarship program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nglcc.org/node/8519 NGLCC's Sixth Annual Business &amp; Leadership Conference a Great Success!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804000009/http://www.nglcc.org/node/8519 |date=2011-08-04 }} - NGLCC Press Release, June 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
[[Same-sex marriage in Washington]] State is a primary goal of the organization, however it undertakes many public policy issues through its Legislative Agenda.

=== Marriage equality ===
In 2006, when efforts were undertaken to repeal Washington's non-discrimination law through public referendum,  GSBA stood alongside other organizations in support of Washington Won't Discriminate, a group opposing the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003014817_gayrights24m.html Effort to repeal state gay-rights law gathers momentum from pulpit], Seattle Times, May 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  After passage of three separate domestic partnership bills in the Washington State Legislature access to full marriage is still denied to Washingtonians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Same-sex marriage in Washington]] Same-sex marriage in Washington - Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, enough signatures were obtained by put Referendum 71 on that year's general election ballot.  This referendum would have overturned the state's third and final expansion of domestic partnership law passed by the legislature earlier that year.  GSBA was a leading voice of 282 coalition partners of [[Washington Families Standing Together]], the organization that lead the campaign to approve Referendum 71.&lt;ref&gt;[http://approvereferendum71.org/coalition-partners Coalition partners] - Washington Families Standing Together, campaign website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Candidate Forum ===
Every September the organization holds a debate-like program, The GSBA Candidate Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews38_39/page5.cfm - GSBA &amp; ERW host 2010 candidate forum] - Seattle Gay News, September 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The event is billed as "the region's only LGBT candidate forum".  The forum has featured candidates from local races such as city/county councils to larger office including Washington State Governor and US House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews36_36/page2.cfm - Gregoire &amp; Burner at GSBA Candidate Forum - Republicans play hide-and-seek] - Seattle Gay News, September 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controversy ====
In 2009, then mayoral candidate [[Michael McGinn|Mike McGinn]] was criticized for his "rude" treatment of GSBA staff members while attending that year's event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicola.com/2009/10/08/extra-fizz-mcginn-and-the-gsba/ Extra Fizz: McGinn and the GSBA] - Publicola, October 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, he won the 2009 election.

== Scholarship program ==
In 1990, two teachers saw a need for LGBT and allied students who needed financial assistance with higher education expenses.  At the time it was the nation's first LGBT and allied scholarship fund.  Six years into the program, the organization had granted five scholarships totaling $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2328300&amp;date=19960509 $10,000 In Scholarships Awarded] - Seattle Times, Thursday, May 09, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998, Richard C. Rolfs (a Wenatchee-native and longtime gay rights activist) bequested $200,000 to the GSBA Scholarship Fund, establishing an endowment in his name.  By 2001, the program was granting more than $50,000 each year in undergraduate scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/21305_tl403.shtml Business group issues scholarships for gay students] - Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Thursday, May 3, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010, a cumulative 350 or more individual scholarships totaling in excess of $1,000,000 had been granted.

===Record breaking===
In May 2010, at the Annual Scholarship Awards Dinner, GSBA gave out its one millionth dollar ($1,000,000) in cumulative scholarship grants.  The following November the primary fundraising event for the program, The Taste of GSBA smashed all previous records, grossing $345,000 from the dinner auction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews38_47/page4.cfm GSBA gala dinner and auction raises record $345,000] - Seattle Gay News, November 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlefoundation.org/npos/Pages/GSBAScholarshipFund.aspx GSBA Scholarship Fund] - The Seattle Foundation, nonprofit organization profiles&lt;/ref&gt;  More than $130,000 of the gross was direct donations to the fund.

== Events ==
The association holds a variety of monthly and annual events—the three largest of which are formal evening functions, held annually.

=== Participation in Seattle Pride ===
The association participates each year in Seattle's [[LGBT pride|Pride]] festivities.  In 2006 graphic designer Andrea Rouleau designed a birthday cake [[parade float|float]] to celebrate GSBA's 25th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/275075_pride23.html Gay pride events multiply] - Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Friday, June 23, 2006 {{Dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guy Degrenne''' (August 3, 1925 in Tinchebray (Orne) – November 7, 2006) was a French businessman who specialised in [[cutlery]] and [[Household silver|silver]]ware. He has founded the Guy Degrenne group, since 1987 a subsidiary of holding 'Table de France'.&lt;ref&gt;From {{cite journal|title=La nouvelle stratégie de Guy Degrenne, marque symbole|journal=Entreprendre|date=8 April 2015|url=http://www.entreprendre.fr/la-nouvelle--strategie-de-guy-degrenne-marque-symbole|accessdate=14 April 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Guy Degrenne attended college St Joseph in [[Caen]], then studied at [[ESSEC Business School]], and took up his father's steel factory (at [[Sourdeval]]) in 1948.

Guy Degrenne first has war-left steel parts collected, and turns them in [[stainless steel]] dishes, with instant commercial success. By 1958, Guy Degrenne sets up a tableware business, then by 1963 ushers in the luxury tableware business, in copying the standards of Parisian goldsmiths.

In 1967, part of the production is moved to a new factory in [[Vire]] (Calvados). His business then employs about 600 workers.
In 1978, Degrenne meets national recognition with [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xa0v2k_guy-degrenne-1986_shortfilms a popular advert] reminiscent of his school years : a headmaster catches young Degrenne drawing dishes in his notebooks margin, and then warns him against ill-success (''Ce n'est pas comme cela que vous réussirez dans la vie'').

==Family==
Hubert Bonnet, son of Pierre Bonnet and Berthe Germeau, was born to an influential family in the Belgian [[steel industry]]. At the time, the [[:fr:Forges de Clabecq|Clabecq Forge]], located twenty kilometres from [[Brussels]], specialised in the production of steel, and more specifically [[railway lines]].
 
Hubert's mother, the sole heir of Eugène Germeau, the [[businessman]] at the helm of Clabecq before the [[World War II]], served as vice-president to the board of directors for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museedelaporte.be/2010/10/05/chronologie-des-forges-par-luc-delporte-madeleine-jacquemin/|title=Chronologie des Forges, par Luc Delporte, Claude Brohée &amp; Madeleine Jacquemin - Musée "de la Porte" à Tubize|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her husband, Pierre Bonnet, they played a significant part in all the major transformations, including those during times of crisis.

== Education ==
Hubert Bonnet grew up between [[Rhode-Saint-Genèse]] and [[Knokke]]. After spending his first years at the Cardinal Mercier College in Braine-L'Alleud,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wiki-braine-lalleud.be/index.php5?title=Collège_Cardinal_Mercier_-_Années_1970&lt;/ref&gt; he began his postgraduate course at the European Business School in [[Brussels]]. He has always been involved in the business world, choosing the career path of BBA - [[Bachelor in Business Administration]]. He then moved on to the University of [[Montreux]] in [[Switzerland]] before completing his training with an [[MBA]] at the University of Dallas in [[Texas]].
 
Passionate about travel and discovery since childhood, Hubert Bonnet benefitted from his studies abroad through enriching encounters and by developing new areas of interest. It was during this era that his passion for art was born, influenced by the audacity of creations by American artists.

== Professional life ==
Qualifications in hand, the 27-year old Hubert Bonnet moved to [[New York City]] and began his professional life as a trader for Cadogan Management.
 
After the death of his mother in 1996, he returned to Belgium and became a director of Cobepa until the takeover bid by [[BNP Paribas]] in 2000. Then, while continuing his activities in the [[financial sector]], he ventured into real estate and created his first company. With H Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgroup.be|title=Hgroup|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he created prestigious projects, acquiring unique properties and improving them with the savoir-faire of renowned architects. His clients were mainly private investors, concerned about the security of their investments. Today, after twenty years of operation, H Group has added its signature to a number of residences in Belgium, notably in the Prince d'Orange district of Uccle, Châtelain in Ixelles, in Zoute, the Dominican Republic, [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Ibiza]] and [[Saint-Tropez]].

In Switzerland, his country of residence, he is also involved in the development of real estate projects in the Valais canton and in [[Geneva]].
 
Since 2015, Hubert Bonnet has provided a new activity to complete his real estate offer. With Bibi Home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibihome.net|title=Bibihome Properties – Exclusives properties around the world for rent.|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he offers the rental of prestigious locations and a complete service to his customers. The concept also includes an artistic element, since outside high season he offers these prestigious residences to artists for workshops to research, reflect and create.
 
In addition to real estate, Hubert Bonnet also formed the company Meaunet (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trendstop.levif.be/fr/detail/864755790/meaunet.aspx|title=Meaunet SA - Bruxelles - Données|first=Developed by Natch for Roularta Business|last=Information|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kbopub.economie.fgov.be/kbopub/toonondernemingps.html?ondernemingsnummer=864755790|title=Ondernemingsgegevens - KBO Public Search|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; then Financière H2O (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trendstop.levif.be/fr/detail/895327717/financiere-h2o.aspx|title=Financière H2O SA - Bruxelles - Données|first=Developed by Natch for Roularta Business|last=Information|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; both operating in the financial sector. In 2005, he also became shareholder and director of Groupe Josi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kbopub.economie.fgov.be/kbopub/toonondernemingps.html?ondernemingsnummer=895327717|title=Ondernemingsgegevens - KBO Public Search|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art collector &amp; promoter ==
Having been passionate about art for many years, Hubert Bonnet is a collector who travels the world seeking out new talent, visiting art galleries, private viewings and international fairs, this aesthete is especially appreciative of minimal and conceptual [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exhibitionsinternational.org/extra/9789490693732_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levif.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artslant.com/ny/articles/show/39348|title=ArtSlant|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2012, while looking for a place to store his works, Hubert Bonnet discovered an 800m2 former coal warehouse, just a few steps from the lakes of Ixelles. This location became the CAB,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artlead.net/content/journal/inhabited-by-objects-a-dialogue-with-jean-prouves-demountable-house/|title=Inhabited by Objects - A dialogue with Jean Prouvé’s Demountable House at CAB, Brussels - artlead|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jvmagazine.be/culture/galeries/622-cab-art-contemporain-bruxelles|title=JV Magazine - Le CAB : un espace pour l’art contemporain|first=Anne|last=Dujardin|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an independent art centre dedicated to the promotion of contemporary Belgian and international art. Each year it offers two thematic exhibitions - one from September to December and one from April to June - whereby it offers artists visibility in a place that is neither an institution nor a gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cab.be/|title=CAB|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As director of the centre, Hubert Bonnet is involved in all levels of decision making, from the theme of the exhibition to the choice of artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cab.be/index.php?page=aboutus&amp;subpage=press|title=CAB|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://agenda.brussels/fr/place/251140/cab-contemporary-art-brussels.html|title=CAB - Contemporary Art Brussels|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mu-inthecity.com/2014/10/fondations-privees-versus-musee-dart-contemporain/|title=Fondations privées versus musée d’art contemporain - Mu-inthecity.com|date=22 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mandates &amp; charities ==

To reduce the dangers facing children around the world, Hubert Bonnet set up the Bibi Foundation, based in [[Switzerland]], which carries out development assistance independently (Burma, [[Burundi]]) or jointly with other similar bodies. The BIBI Foundation supports the NGO ODDY-C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oddyc.be/|title=ODDY-C|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubert Bonnet also supports [[Womanity]], an association committed to empowering women and girls in developing countries to shape their futures and accelerate progress in their communities.
 
Hubert Bonnet is also a member of the Entrepreneurs' Organization (EO Network) and the [[Alumni]] of the European Business School &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/pp/hubert-bonnet|title=Hubert Bonnet, Switzerland - moneyhouse|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fondationbibi.e-monsite.com|title=FONDATION BIBI|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''i-net Clear Reports''' (formerly known as i-net Crystal-Clear) is a Java-based cross-platform reporting application providing a [[report]] designer and a server component to create reports in numerous output formats like PDF, HTML, PS, RTF, XLS, TXT, CSV, SVG, XML, as well as being viewable in a Java applet or Swing component.&lt;ref name="Freshmeat"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://freshmeat.net/projects/crystalclear |title = i-net Clear Reports / freshmeat.net |date = May 15, 2009 |accessdate = 2009-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application programmers can integrate i-net Clear Reports using the public [[API]] which spans over 200 classes.&lt;ref name="API"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inetsoftware.de/documentation/clear-reports/online-help/programming/apispec/index.html |title = i-net Clear Reports API |date = May 17, 2011 |accessdate = 2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with release 11.0 i-net Clear Reports also supports the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] programming language and offers a public API for further integration in other products.

==History==
in Version 11.0 i-net Crystal-Clear was renamed to i-net Clear Reports. At this time it also gained .NET integration as a major feature.

i-net Crystal-Clear was primarily designed to read [[Crystal Reports]] templates. It had to be capable of reading the RPT report format and producing a reasonable output. For exporting and saving reasons a new file format had to be created later on, enabling Crystal-Clear to save the API results back and make them editable by a designer.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inetsoftware.de/products/clear-reports/developement-timeline |title = Development Timeline |date = March 17, 2011 |accessdate = 2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the first version of i-net DesignerXML, the report designer, was written using Java Swing. The editing concept is slightly different from some other designers, using a band-oriented report template format, meaning that reports are designed based on rows of data.

The development efforts has changed in more recent years to a full reporting platform approach, rather than the developer-only, framework-based one.

True to its roots, i-net Crystal-Clear still has the ability to read and execute Crystal Reports report templates up until the latest versions of Crystal Reports.

Unlike Crystal Reports, however, the i-net Crystal-Clear report file format has always been an open format. Until version 9.0 it was an XML format. Since version 9, the report file format is in a [[ZIP (file format)|zip]]-based format similar to [[OpenDocument]].

==Flexibility==

Being a Java application, i-net Clear Reports has the ability to run on a variety of platforms and environments. There is virtually no restriction concerning data sources that can be used, as long as there is a [[JDBC]] driver available for accessing the data. For non-JDBC data sources, there are how-to's to write simple mini-drivers. With the new .NET API it got even more flexible and allows integration into .NET based applications.

i-net Clear Reports comes as a standalone server as well as a [[servlet]] which can be run on any [[Java EE]] application server such as [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]], [[Jetty]], [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], or [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] (via [[PHP]]).

Features can be added using the public [[API]], or by adding custom [[JavaBeans]] which can be added to reports. User defined functions (UDF) extend the formula features of the embedded formula calculation routines.

An '''integration warehouse''' is a [[data warehouse]] specifically geared to the purpose of integrating information from various sources or systems. Integration warehouses are quite often used in the [[reinsurance]] industry instead of conventional data warehouses.

==History==

The concept of integration warehousing dates back to mid 2000. In the reinsurance industry it became quite obvious that data warehouses didn't cover all the business requirements and therefore IT started to focus more on the integration aspects. This finally led to solutions that now specifically fit the reinsurance business requirements.

==Architecture==

The integration warehouse architecture is quite similar to the data warehouse architecture. The main difference is in the integration aspect and the overall data model which is based on a holistic reinsurance business model.

==Advantages==

It is said that load performance of integration warehouses can be nearly real time, as opposed to data warehouses, which can be slower.

'''Julius Stjernvall''' (26 October 1874 – 6 May 1939) was a Finnish [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Stjernvall worked as manager in [[Finland|Finnish]] branch of [[Siemens &amp; Halske]] 1904–1914 and subsequently in [[Kone ja Silta]] until 1929; the company grew during his time through new products and [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]]. He was [[Minister of Trade and Industry (Finland)|Minister of Trade and Industry]] in the short-lived [[Ingman I Cabinet|Lauri Ingman's cabinet]] in 1918–1919&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web|url=http://valtioneuvosto.fi/tietoa/historiaa/hallitukset-ja-ministerit/raportti/-/r/v9l/6|title=Finnish Government - Ministers of Trade and Industry|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Valtioneuvosto.fi|archive-url=|archive-date=|deadurl=no|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and studies ==
Stjernvall's parents were [[colonel]] Carl Julius Stjernvall and Maria [[née]] Jakovlev. He graduated from [[Hamina Cadet School|Finnish Cadet School]] in [[Hamina]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; During his studies he served as [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in 132nd [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] [[Infantry]] Regiment. He was later promoted [[lieutenant]] in 1907 when he was already in [[Military reserve force|reserve]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Stjernvall continued his studies in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Polytechnic Institute in Helsinki]] and graduated in 1900 as [[Mechanical Engineer]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt;

== Career ==
During 1904–1914 Stjernvall led technical office of [[Siemens &amp; Halske]] in [[Helsinki]];&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; in this period the company built the first [[steam turbine]] [[power plant]] of Finland in [[Tampere]] and connected [[Sveaborg]] to [[electrical grid]] through an [[Submarine communications cable|undersea cable]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Stjernvall represented [[Finnish nobility|nobility]] and [[Chivalric order|chivalry]] in [[Diet of Finland]] in 1904–1905.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; In 1914, shortly before the [[First World War]] Stjernvall moved to [[Kone- ja Siltarakennus]] (Kone ja Silta) as Deputy Director.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Due to intense [[arms race]] between the European [[superpower]]s prior the war, the company had a good order backlog from the [[Military history of the Russian Empire|Russian military]]; Kone ja Silta produced [[munition]] and other military supplies, and repaired ships of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Stjernvall became company manager in 1917.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; In the same year [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland became independent]]. In 1918 [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]] asked him to join in [[Ingman I Cabinet|Lauri Ingman's cabinet]] as [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Finland)|Minister of Trade and Industry]]. Stjernvall agreed, but the cabinet turned out to be short-living, and already after few months, he was back.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

Kone ja Silta grew strongly during Stjernvall's time. In 1923 the company started producing [[Abloy]] locks.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Kone ja Silta took over [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works]]&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; on 22 December 1926. The articles of association were changed uniform with Kone ja Silta in December 1927, after which both companies shared the same management.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.90-104"/&gt;

In 1928–1929 the company turnover reached 90 million [[Finnish markka|marks]] and made 3 million marks' profit. At the time Kone ja Silta employed 1&amp;nbsp;300 people.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

Stjernvall was entitled [[vuorineuvos]] in 1924.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

Stjernvall handed over his managerial post of Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering works to Robert Lavonius on 1 April 1929.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.90-104"/&gt; At the end of the same year he submitted his resignation to Kone ja Silta for health reasons.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

After his resignation, Stjernvall continued in [[Position of trust|positions of trust]] in [[Helsingin Osakepankki]] (HOP).&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Between 1918 and 1939 Stjernvall was twice the [[chairman of the Board]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

== Private life and tribute ==
Stjernvall had no family. A street was named after him, Stjernvallintie in [[Kulosaari]], until it was renamed Vuorineuvoksentie in 1958.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

In 1989, the company generated revenue of about US$400 million, with about US$70 million in earnings.&lt;ref name="nyt900717"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E7D6163AF934A25754C0A966958260 National Health Laboratories Inc. reports earnings for Qtr to June 30], New York Times Archives, Published: July 17, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the company's revenues reached US$500 million, with over US$70 million in earnings.&lt;ref name="nyt900717"/&gt; That year, the company began paying a cash [[dividend]] to shareholders.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt;

In 1991, National Health Laboratories moved from the NASDAQ OTC exchange to the [[New York Stock Exchange]], where it began to trade under the new ticker symbol NH.&lt;ref name="nyt900717"/&gt; Up until that time the company had performed very well, including through the [[1990-1991 recession]]. Its earnings peaked that year at almost US$90 million, and its stock price had risen from its low within the prior few years by several-fold.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt;

However, beginning in 1991 the company became embroiled in Operation "[[Labscam]]," a nationwide crackdown on fraud in the health-care system, initiated by the U.S. Attorney's Office in [[San Diego, California]]. The charges were that the company and others routinely submitted false claims to the government health-care agencies [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] for unnecessary tests which physicians had never ordered. In 1992, National Health Laboratories became the first of the companies to be prosecuted in the government operation.&lt;ref name="labscam"&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/health/labscam.html OPERATION LABSCAM, LabCorp of America, SmithKline Beecham and Corning, Inc (now Quest Diagnostics)], compiled by Michael Wynne, August 2003 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812010348/http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/health/labscam.html |date=August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the company reported revenues of over US$720 million, however with earnings of only US$40 million. The small gain that year reflected a fourth quarter charge of US$80 million, which the company paid in a settlement agreement with state and federal governments related to the LABSCAM investigation.&lt;ref name="nyt940208"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE2DB1639F93BA35751C0A962958260 National Health Laboratories Inc. reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31], New York Times Archives, Published: February 8, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The total payments made by National Health Laboratories in the settlement came to US$111 million that year,&lt;ref name="nyt941215"&gt;

===National Health Laboratories Holdings===
On March 8, 1994 National Health Laboratories Inc. reorganized as a holding company, '''National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.'''&lt;ref name="sec940308"/&gt;

By 1994, [[MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings]] Inc. then owned the Revlon Holdings Group's former 24 percent of National Health Laboratories Holdings.&lt;ref name="National-Health-Laboratories-1994-10-K" /&gt; That company was a distributor of [[licorice]] extract and chocolate, which had previously been taken over, along with Revlon, by [[Ronald Perelman]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="nyt941215"/&gt;

On May 4, 1994, National Health Laboratories announced that it would acquire [[Allied Clinical Laboratories]], Inc. of [[Nashville, Tennessee]],&lt;ref name="nyt941215"/&gt; reducing their takeover offer to $204 million after federal officials issued new subpoenas in an investigation of Medicare billing practices at Allied Clinical Laboratories Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/business/company-news-bid-for-allied-clinical-is-cut-after-investigation-widens.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Bid for Allied Clinical Is Cut After Investigation Widens|last=Adelson|first=Andrea|date=1994-06-09|website=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Allied generated revenues of US$163 million. The former President and CEO of Allied Clinical, [[Haywood D. Cochrane, Jr.]], then became Vice Chairman of National Health Laboratories. In order to complete the cash transaction, the company discontinued paying its dividend at that time.&lt;ref name="sec940510"&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/dPct4.b1.b.htm National Health Laboratories Inc · 10-Q · For 3/31/94], SECInfo.com, Filed On 5/10/94, SEC File 1-10740, Accession Number 832427-94-14&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1994, the company had run into financial difficulty again, as it struggled through the economic [[soft landing (economics)|soft landing]] that year. Its earnings dropped by over two-thirds, to only US$30 million. The stock never traded that year at more than half of its 1993 peak, and at its 1994 low, it was down by nearly two-thirds from the all-time high.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt;

===Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings===
On April 28, 1995 National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. merged with [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. and changed its name to '''Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings'''. It began trading under its new ticker symbol LH.&lt;ref name="sec950515"&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/ds2yr.a4.htm Laboratory Corp of America Holdings · 10-Q · For 3/31/95], SECInfo.com, Filed On 5/15/95, SEC File 1-11353, Accession Number 920148-95-11&lt;/ref&gt; Shareholders of National Health Laboratories received 0.72 shares of the new company, plus $5.60 in cash, for a 50.1 percent interest in the new company. At the time, [[James R. Maher]] was President and [[Chief Executive Officer]] of National Health Laboratories. Following the merger, Maher relinquished those positions, and instead became Chairman of the new company, succeeding the financier Ronald O. Perelman in that position. Perelman received about US$100 million from the deal, which made the new company the largest blood-testing company in the United States.&lt;ref name="nyt941215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="National-Health-Laboratories-1994-10-K" /&gt;

The merged company created revenues of US$1.7 billion.&lt;ref name="National-Health-Laboratories-1994-10-K" /&gt; National Health Laboratories already held long-term debt of US$351 million.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt; Together with the Roche debt, the combined companies owed US$590 million prior to the merger. Another US$288 million was added to help finance the payout to shareholders.&lt;ref name="nyt941215"/&gt; By year-end 1995, the new company's total debt reached US$959 million.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt;

Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been created by and was a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Hoffmann-La Roche]], Inc., the American arm of the Swiss medical conglomerate, [[Roche Holding, Limited]]. Before 1982, the core of Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been [[Biomedical Reference Laboratories]], which dated from the late 1960s, and was  located in Burlington, North Carolina. That core company had become publicly traded in 1979. Hoffman-La Roche acquired it for US$163.5 million in 1982 and then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company that year as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical had become one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with US$600 million in sales.&lt;ref name="fundingroche"&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc.], FundingUniverse.com&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1993 Roche Biomedical Laboratories had revenues of US$712 million, with 17 major laboratories. Dr. [[James Powell (biologist)|James Powell]] was President of Roche Biomedical, and after the merger with National Health Laboratories he became President and CEO of the new company, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, which then relocated from La Jolla, California to the Roche Biomedical headquarters in Burlington, North Carolina. Hoffmann-La Roche also contributed US$186.7 million in cash to the deal, and retained 49.9 interest in the new merged company.&lt;ref name="National-Health-Laboratories-1994-10-K"/&gt;

By year-end 1995, the new Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings suffered a marginal loss of a few million dollars. The stock price dropped by almost half again through the year, to within 10% of its all-time low since going public a half dozen years earlier. By early the next year, it broke marginally below that level, and set a new all-time low.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt;

In July 1998, LabCorp acquired the Michigan-based laboratory division of ''Universal Standard Healthcare'' (UHCI). LabCorp also acquired an equity position in Universal Standard Healthcare and has become UHCI's clinical laboratory long-term testing provider&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/labcorp-completes-acquisition-of-universal-standard-healthcares-michigan-based-laboratory-division-76081052.html|title=Labcorp Completes Acquisition Of Universal Standard Healthcare's Michigan-Based Laboratory Division|last=|first=|date=1998-08-05|website=[[PR Newswire]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but terminated this agreement one year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/labcorpr-ends-agreement-with-universal-standard-healthcare-of-michigan-inc-75536407.html|title=LabCorp(R) Ends Agreement with Universal Standard Healthcare of Michigan, Inc.|last=|first=|date=1999-03-30|website=[[PR Newswire]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''London Metal Exchange''' ('''LME''') is the futures exchange with the world's largest market in options and  [[futures contract]]s on [[base metal|base]] and other [[metal]]s. As the LME offers contracts with daily expiry dates of up to three months from trade date, weekly contracts to six months, and monthly contracts up to 123 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Futures Contract Specifications |url=https://www.lme.com/en-gb/metals/non-ferrous/aluminium/contract-specifications/futures/ |publisher = London Metal Exchange |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also allows for cash trading. It offers [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]], worldwide reference pricing, and the option of physical delivery to settle contracts. Since 2012 it has been owned by [[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing]], after LME's shareholders voted in July 2012 to approve the sale of the exchange for a price of £1.4 billion.

==History==
The London Metal Market and Exchange Company was founded in 1877, but the market traces its origins back to 1571 and the opening of the [[Royal Exchange, London]]. Before the exchange was created, business was conducted by traders in London [[coffee house]]s using a makeshift ring drawn in chalk on the floor.&lt;ref name=Today&gt;BBC Radio 4 ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'', broadcast 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first only [[copper]] was traded. [[Lead]] and [[zinc]] were soon added but only gained official trading status in 1920. The exchange was closed during [[World War II]] and did not re-open until 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Northedge|title=130 years of the LME|year=2007|publisher=Newsdesk Communications|url=http://www.henrybath.com/assets/_files/documents/apr_11/HENRYBATH__1303997757_LME_130_Supplement.pdf|work=LME 130th Anniversary Supplement|accessdate=31 October 2014|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031150533/http://www.henrybath.com/assets/_files/documents/apr_11/HENRYBATH__1303997757_LME_130_Supplement.pdf|archive-date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of metals traded was extended to include [[aluminium]] (1978), [[nickel]] (1979), [[tin]] (1989), aluminium alloy (1992), [[steel]] (2008), and minor metals [[cobalt]] and [[molybdenum]] (2010). The exchange ceased trading [[plastics]] in 2011.  The total value of the trade is around $US 11.6 trillion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LME achieves another year of record volume |url=http://lme.com/6935.asp |date=5 January 2009 |publisher=London Metal Exchange |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401031016/http://www.lme.com/6935.asp |archivedate=1 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many deals are made for commodities to be delivered in three months' time. The custom stems from the time that copper cargoes originally took in 1877 on their voyage from the ports of [[Chile]].&lt;ref name=Today/&gt;

The LME was owned by its members until 2012, when it was sold to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing for £1.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Henry |last=Sanderson |title=London Metal Exchange debates its future |url=https://www.ft.com/video/157a944e-caaf-3f3d-90a8-e7487d1a8e7f |publisher=Financial Times|  | date=24 March 2017 |accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commodities traded==
The LME offers futures and options contracts for aluminium, aluminium alloy, NASAAC (North American Special Aluminium Alloy), cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, steel billet, steel rebar, steel scrap, tin and zinc.

==Facilities==
[[File:LME Entrance.jpg|thumb|Main entrance to the former premises of the LME, at 56 [[Leadenhall Street]] in the [[City of London]]]]
To trade contracts in copper, tin, or any other metal listed on the LME, one has to trade through an LME member. Purchasers of contracts, which are then left to reach maturity, will receive a warrant for a specific LME approved warehouse to take delivery of the metal if required.

The LME issues, each day, detailed figures on how many tonnes of each metal is in its warehouses, which helps producers and consumers make correct business decisions.

==Ring trading==
Trading Times: 11:40 — 17:00, London Time

[[Open-outcry]] is the oldest way of trading on the exchange, though nowadays the majority of trades are placed electronically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LME Select |url=https://www.lme.com/trading/venues-and-systems/systems/lmeselect/ |publisher = London Metal Exchange |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is central to the process of [[price discovery]], the way LME official prices are established.  Prices are derived from the most liquid periods of trading; the short open-outcry ring trading sessions, and are most representative of industry [[supply and demand]].  The official settlement price, on which contracts are settled, is determined by the last offer price before the bell is sounded to mark the end of the official ring.

There is constant inter-office trading. A relatively small yet important portion of trading is still done by open-outcry in the Ring. There are a morning and an afternoon trade, where each of the nine metal contracts are traded in two blocks with a five-minute session for each contract (the sessions last from 11.40 until 13.10 and from 14.55 until 16.15, each session includes a 10-minute break). The second trading block in the morning is key to setting the Daily Official Exchange rates. After the official trades of sessions one and two, there are 85 and 45 minutes of "kerb" trading respectively. Trades are in futures, options and TAPOs (traded average-price options, a form of [[Asian options]]).

Whilst the price discovery mechanism used by the exchange is post-trade transparent it is not pre-trade transparent. Pre-trade transparency is required for many securities under the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFiD) to achieve fair markets by reducing such illegal abuse as market manipulation.

The LME is the last exchange in Europe where open-outcry trading takes place.&lt;ref name=Today/&gt;

==Ring Dealing Members==
Ring Dealing Members are entitled to trade in the Ring during the ring-trading sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Category 1 – Ring Dealing |url=http://lme.com/membership_ringdealing.asp |publisher=London Metal Exchange |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322061843/http://www.lme.com/membership_ringdealing.asp |archivedate=22 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also operate a 24-hour market by trading inter-office. All Ring Dealing Members, as members of the LME Clear, are authorised under the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]], and are regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]]. 

Ring Dealing Members are [[Clearing (finance)|Clearing]] Members, who hold the exclusive right to trade in the ring;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ring Dealing Members |url=https://www.lme.com/trading/membership/category-1-ring-dealing/ |publisher = London Metal Exchange |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Societe Generale International Ltd
*[[Sucden]] Financial Ltd
*Triland Metals Ltd

In addition to the 9 companies that have exclusive rights to trade in the Ring, around 100 companies are involved in the LME in total.

==Precious metals==
Contrary to popular belief, the precious metals, [[gold]] and [[silver]], are not traded on the London Metal Exchange, but on the [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] market usually referred to as the [[London bullion market|London Bullion Market]], by the members of the [[London Bullion Market Association]]. [[Platinum]] and [[palladium]] are traded on the [[London Platinum and Palladium Market]]. Both members of the LBMA and LPPM trade the precious metals spot market on [[Electronic Broking Services|EBS]] (Electronic Broking Systems)—acquired by [[ICAP (company)|ICAP]] in June 2006. Many companies involved in minor metals are members of the [[Minor Metal Trade Association]].

The LME used,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lme.com/~/media/Files/Notices/2014/2014_09/14%20269%20A261%20Precious%20Metals%20Price%20Data%20and%20Matching%20and%20Clearing%20Services.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; however, to provide trade matching and clearing services to the London bullion market and distributes gold, silver, and gold IRS ([[interest rate swap]]s) forward rates on behalf of the LBMA.

==Electronic trading==
The LME launched an electronic platform called LME Select launched in February 2001.[5] This was developed by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] software house called [http://www.cinnober.com Cinnober]. The platform is a FIX-based trading platform, and now handles a majority of the total LME business.

==Delivery points==
As a market of “last resort”, industry can use the LME’s delivery option to sell excess stock in times of oversupply and as a source of material in times of extreme shortage.  In reality, physical delivery occurs in a very small percentage of cases on the LME as most organizations use the LME for hedging purposes. The small percentage which does result in delivery, however, plays a vital role in creating price convergence.

==Warehouses==
To support this mechanism, the LME approves and licenses a network of warehouses and storage facilities around the world. Controversy arose in 2013 because the LME took action to limit the use of its warehouses for the hoarding of aluminium. In March 2014, England's [[High Court]] found for [[Rusal]], the Russian aluminium company, striking down these rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7621">[[Image:MediaTechnologyMonitorLogo.jpg|frame|50px|alt=Logo of the Media Technology Monitor (MTM).|Logo ]]The '''Media Technology Monitor''' (MTM) is an annual telephone survey and research product designed to monitor Canadians' use and adoption of new and existing technologies.  The first MTM questionnaire was distributed in 2005 and now consists of two annual surveys conducted in the spring and fall of each year.&lt;ref&gt;CRTC Communications Monitoring Report (2011) - {{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/policymonitoring/2011/cmr2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005120457/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/PolicyMonitoring/2011/cmr2011.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey features questions that focus on current and emerging media activities and technologies such as, television across multiple platforms, radio use social media, and online audio.  The results of the Media Technology Monitor are published through a series of syndicated reports and multiple short, targeted theme reports. The Media Technology Monitor reports are distributed to government agencies, broadcasters, and other media stakeholders across Canada who subscribe to the service.

The MTM is designed, implemented and analyzed by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC/Radio-Canada).&lt;ref&gt;Broadcaster Magazine - http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/bbm-analytics-to-market-cbc-radio-canada-media-technology-monitor/1000045568/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the MTM coordinated with [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, Ontario to provide learning materials to the Communications Department.

==History==
The Media Technology Monitor has evolved from the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's]] Quality Ratings Survey (QRS) that began in 1997 to measure Canadians' use and perception of Canada's conventional and specialty television channels as well as some media technology behaviours.  In 2005, the MTM was launched with a specific focus on media technology adoption and use among Canadians. In 2010, an online MTM portal ([http://www.mtm-otm.ca www.mtm-otm.ca]) was created to provide a more interactive experience for users.  The portal allows users a quick and easy way to download MTM reports and trending data, as well as conduct custom analysis of the data with a proprietary data analysis tool.

MTM-OTM Video on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGlObksktTU&amp;feature=youtu.be

Since then the technology has become less and less used due to the rise of the internet and the easier, quicker and cheaper way to send our surveys to users which using certain methods is also further available for free. 

==Survey Methodology and Design==
The Media Technology Monitor is released in the fall and spring of each year and collects a total of 12,000 responses through telephone interviews with 6,000 Anglophones and 6,000 Francophones aged 18+.  The response rate for both surveys is 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Official MTM Website - {{cite web |url=http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329110546/http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |archivedate=2012-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fall Survey - 8,000 Respondents (4,000 Anglophones and 4,000 Francophones)&lt;ref&gt;Official MTM Website - {{cite web |url=http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329110546/http://www.mtm-otm.ca/quest.asp |archivedate=2012-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTM survey households are selected by [[Random digit dialing|Random Digit Dialing]] (RDD) and the respondent within each household is randomly selected based on the most recent birthday method. The MTM uses telephone surveys to ensure that the respondents are representative of all Canadians by eliminating bias due to geographic location and connection to the Internet.

==Current Topics==

The Media Technology Monitor is revised every year to include emerging media trends and technologies.  Recent MTM surveys have asked respondents about their behavior and consumption of:

'''Media context studies''' refers to the group of studies investigating “how and which media context variables influence the effects of the [[advertisements]] embedded in the context“.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bronner|first=A.E.|author2=Neijen, P.C.|title=Audience experiences of media context and embedded advertising: A comparison of eight media|journal=International Journal of Market Research|year=2006|volume=48|pages=81–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media researchers found that media context affects ad recall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Pelsmacker|first=P.|author2=Geuens, M. |author3=Anckaert, P. |title=Media context and advertising effectiveness: The role of context appreciation and context/ad similarity|journal=Journal of Advertising|year=2002|volume=31|issue=2|pages=49–61|doi=10.1080/00913367.2002.10673666}}&lt;/ref&gt; ad recognition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moorman|first=M.|author2=Neijens, P.

R. |title=The effects of program-induced mood states on memory for commercial information|journal=Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising|year=2001|volume=23|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1080/10641734.2001.10505110}}&lt;/ref&gt; and purchase intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yi|first=Y|title=Cognitive and affective priming effects of the context for print advertisements.|journal=Journal of Advertising|year=1990|volume=19|issue=2|pages=40–48|doi=10.1080/00913367.1990.10673186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media context would influence media users’ attitude toward ads in several ways. First, the similarity in the mood of the media context and the ads would enhance learning and evaluations of the ad and its message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coulter|first=K.S.|title=The effects of affective responses to media context on advertising evaluations.|journal=Journal of Advertising|year=1998|volume=27|issue=4|pages=41–51|doi=10.1080/00913367.1998.10673568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Pelsmacker|first=P.|author2=Geuens, M. |author3=Anckaert, P. |title=Media context and advertising effectiveness: The role of context appreciation and context/ad similarity|journal=Journal of Advertising|year=2002|volume=31|issue=2|pages=49–61|doi=10.1080/00913367.2002.10673666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lord|first=K.R.|author2=Burnkrant, R. E. |author3=Unnava, H. R. |title=The effects of program-induced mood states on memory for commercial information|journal=Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising|year=2001|volume=23|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1080/10641734.2001.10505110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg and Gorn (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=M.E.|author2=Gorn, G. J.|title=Happy and sad TV programs: How they affect reactions to commercials|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; call this the mood congruency-accessibility hypothesis: The ad context makes a certain mood or affect more accessible and relieves the processing of stimuli with similar moods or affects. Second, the prestige of the media source would rub off on the brand and influence the perceptions of the advertised brand. Fuchs (1964) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=D. A.|title=Two source effects in magazine advertising|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|year=1964|volume=1|issue=3|pages=59–62|doi=10.2307/3150058|jstor=3150058}}&lt;/ref&gt; found support for this hypothesis and he called it the congruity principle: the medium and the advertised brand converge and become more similar in consumers’ minds. Third, the media context can serve as a cognitive prime that guides the attention and determines the users’ interpretation of the ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dahlén|first=M.|title=The medium as a contextual cue: Effects of creative media choice|journal=Journal of Advertising|year=2005|volume=34|issue=3|pages=89–98|doi=10.1080/00913367.2005.10639197}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a print ad promoting a large car may be interpreted as safe when the context is an [[editorial]] article about safety, or as fuel-thirsty when the context is an editorial article about oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yi|first=Y|title=Cognitive and affective priming effects of the context for print advertisements.|journal=Journal of Advertising|year=1990|volume=19|issue=2|pages=40–48|doi=10.1080/00913367.1990.10673186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forth, the nature of the medium itself may moderate the editorial content’s influence on acceptance of the ads. For example, ads in print media can be skipped more easily compared to ads on radio and television, so the appreciation of the magazine editorial may lead to less ad processing than on radio and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first=C.E.|author2=Colman, A. M.|title=Context effects on recall and recognition of magazine advertisements|journal=Journal of Advertising|year=1992|pages=37–46|jstor=4188844|volume=21|issue=3|doi=10.1080/00913367.1992.10673374|hdl=2381/3970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the influence of media context on embedded ads undoubtedly exists and is important, it is complicated and difficult to evaluate. The related theories may be conflicting in this regard. For example, the Feelings-as-information Theory suggested that people in a positive mood tend to avoid stimuli such as ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuykendall|first=D.|author2=Keating, J. P.|title=Mood and persuasion: Evidence for the differential influence of positive and negative states.|journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing|year=1990|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1002/mar.4220070102}}&lt;/ref&gt; If people acquire a good mood as a result of processing media content, they may avoid paying attention to ads embedded in this context and process them less intensively. However, the Hedonic Contingency view stated that people in a positive mood may engage in greater processing of a stimulus because they believe that the consequences are going to be favorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=A.Y.|author2=Sternthal, B.|title=The effects of positive mood on memory|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=1999|volume=26|issue=2|pages=115–127|doi=10.1086/209554}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the complexity of the issue, a framework of media context effect on advertising response is demanded. One such endeavor is conceptualizing media engagement as an antecedent of the attitude toward the embedded advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calder|first=B. J. |author2=Malthouse,E.C. |author3=Schaedel, U.|title=An experimental study of the relationship between online engagement and advertising effectiveness|journal=Journal of Interactive Marketing|volume=23|issue=4|pages=321–331|doi=10.1016/j.intmar.2009.07.002|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dahlén|first=M|title=The medium as a contextual cue: Effects of creative media choice.|journal=Journal of Advertising|year=2005|volume=34|issue=3|pages=89–98|doi=10.1080/00913367.2005.10639197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bronner|first=A.E.|author2=Neijens, P. C.|title=Audience experiences of media context and embedded advertising: A comparison of eight media|journal=International Journal of Market Research|year=2006|volume=48|pages=81–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach attempts to connect U&amp;G perspective to studies media context effects on users’ attitude toward ads. Researchers conceptualized different attributes of individual media users as media engagement and posited that it serves as an antecedent of the attitude toward the embedded advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calder|first=B. J. |author2=Malthouse,E.C. |author3=Schaedel, U.|title=An experimental study of the relationship between online engagement and advertising effectiveness|journal=Journal of Interactive Marketing|volume=23|issue=4|pages=321–331|doi=10.1016/j.intmar.2009.07.002|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dahlén|first=M|title=The medium as a contextual cue: Effects of creative media choice.|journal=Journal of Advertising|year=2005|volume=34|issue=3|pages=89–98|doi=10.1080/00913367.2005.10639197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bronner|first=A.E.|author2=Neijens, P. C.|title=Audience experiences of media context and embedded advertising: A comparison of eight media|journal=International Journal of Market Research|year=2006|volume=48|pages=81–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, scholars used the term experience to refer to these influential factors when relating to how media use would influence advertisement acceptance. Experience was described as “an emotional, intuitive perception that people have while using the media” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calder|first=B. J.|author2=Malthouse, E. C. |author3=Schaedel, U. |title=An experimental study of the relationship between online engagement and advertising effectiveness|journal=Journal of Interactive Marketing|year=2009|volume=23|issue=4|pages=321–331|doi=10.1016/j.intmar.2009.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;84). Calder and Malthouse (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calder|first=B. J.|author2=Malthouse, E. C. |author3=Schaedel, U. |title=An experimental study of the relationship between online engagement and advertising effectiveness|journal=Journal of Interactive Marketing|year=2009|volume=23|issue=4|pages=321–331|doi=10.1016/j.intmar.2009.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  defined media experience as “the thoughts and feelings consumers have about what is happening when they are doing something” in or with media (p.&amp;nbsp;257). For example, users have a utilitarian experience when they believe a website provides information that facilitates their decision making. They have an intrinsically enjoyable experience when other content enables them to escape from the pressures of daily life. Calder and Malthouse (2009) described experience as consisting of two dimensions: the hedonic value associated with the experience and the motivational component, which is posited as engagement. Hence, the engagement is conceptualized as “the sum of the motivational experiences consumers have with the media product” (p.&amp;nbsp;259), which affects the strength of media experience. It influences people’s reaction to advertisements because the strong motivational experiences consumers have with a media vehicle would make an ad potentially part of something that consumers are trying to make happen in their life.

Scholars have tested the relationship between media engagement and advertising effectiveness and suggested that all things being equal, if consumers engaging with a media vehicle have strong motivational experiences, an ad potentially becomes more effective on this medium as well. Based on this argument Calder and Malthouse (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calder|first=B.J.|author2=Malthouse, E. C.|title=Managing media and advertising change with integrated marketing|journal=Journal of Advertising Research-New York|year=2005|volume=45|issue=4|pages=356|doi=10.1017/s0021849905050427}}&lt;/ref&gt;  proposed a media congruency hypothesis and tested it empirically with magazine ads, with positive results.  With the emergence of the Internet, Calder, Malthouse and Schaedel (2009) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calder|first=B. J.|author2=Malthouse, E. C. |author3=Schaedel, U. |title=An experimental study of the relationship between online engagement and advertising effectiveness|journal=Journal of Interactive Marketing|year=2009|volume=23|issue=4|pages=321–331|doi=10.1016/j.intmar.2009.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested it in Website context and also got supportive results. The experiment yielded a positive correlation between Web users’ engagement with Websites and reaction toward an [[Orbitz]] (an online travel agency) ad. This study showed both overall engagement and personal and social interactive engagement affected reaction to ads, while social interactive engagement was more uniquely attributed to online media having an independent effect on ad reaction.

==Political career==
In 2006, Katumbi was elected as a deputy in the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name=Manson10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson15/&gt; He was the first [[election|democratically elected]] Governor of the Katanga Province in January 2007, receiving 94 votes out of 102.&lt;ref name=Trustfull/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kayenge14/&gt;

Katumbi's governance has been credited with bringing [[Economic recovery|economic revival]] to the province through developing [[infrastructure]], encouraging [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] with [[tax break]]s and reduced government [[regulation|procedures]], and targeting [[Democratic Republic of the Congo#Corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref name="Bakumanya15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adamu15&gt;{{cite news |title=Kabila’s "Decoupage": An Aim at Moise Katumbi’s Rising Popularity |author=Peter Adamu |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201506101109.html |work=[[AllAfrica.com]] |date=10 June 2015 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BD08/&gt; Through Katumbi's efforts as governor,  local [[tax]]es increased from $80 million in 2007 to more than $3 billion in 2014.&lt;ref name=BD08/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clayton14&gt;{{cite news |title=Moïse Katumbi: New African Leadership |author=Eva M.

Shortly after he took office as governor, Katumbi implemented an export ban for raw [[mineral]]s, including [[cobalt]], forcing [[List of companies based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Mining|major mining companies]] to either build [[Oil refinery|processing plants]] in the province or pay a tax on the exported concentrate.&lt;ref name=Wilson15/&gt;&lt;ref name=BD08&gt;{{cite news |title=Province of promise: the mission of Moise Katumbi |author= |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2008/10/15/province-of-promise-the-mission-of-moise-katumbi |work=BusinessDay |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kavanaugh13&gt;{{cite news |title=Congo Raises Tax on Copper, Cobalt Concentrates by Two-Thirds |author=Michael J Kavanaugh |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-25/congo-raises-tax-on-copper-cobalt-concentrates-by-two-thirds |work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] |date=25 July 2013 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Katumbi, [[copper]] production increased from 8,000 metric tons in 2006 to more than 1 million tons in 2014.&lt;ref name=Clayton14/&gt;

Along with [[Mining industry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|mining]], Katumbi focused on expanding other areas of the province's economy including the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service industry]], [[Energy industry|energy]] and [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name=Trustfull/&gt; He offered both free [[Agricultural land|farmland]] and tax breaks for farmers to encourage food production. Reliance on imported food decreased 68% between 2006 and 2011. In 2014, the amount of food grown locally had tripled.&lt;ref name="Clayton14"/&gt;

The accomplishments of his administration included improving travel and commerce through the building or rebuilding more than 1,500 kilometers (approximately 30%) of roads and the increase in other infrastructure, including bridges, hospitals and schools. Access to clean water rose from 3% to 67% between 2007 and 2013.&lt;ref name=Trustfull/&gt;&lt;ref name=AfricanBusiness13/&gt; Additionally, within 6 years, the number of children attending school increased from 400,000 in 2007 to 3 million in 2014.&lt;ref name=Wilson15/&gt;&lt;ref name=AfricanBusiness13/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clayton14"/&gt; The number of girls enrolled in school tripled.&lt;ref name=AfricanBusiness13/&gt; Worker-focused initiatives included encouraging local mining companies to invest in growing crops for their employees and the banning of "unnecessary dismissal of employees".&lt;ref name=Wilson15/&gt;

In September 2015, Katumbi resigned as governor and from his [[political party]], the [[People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy]].&lt;ref name=Economist15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson1115&gt;{{cite news |title=Congolese Opposition Mulls Katumbi as Presidential Candidate, |author=Thomas Wilson |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-12/congo-opposition-will-consider-katumbi-as-presidential-candidate |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=12 November 2015 |accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 2016, he was convicted, in absentia, of selling a house that was not his and sentenced to 36 months in jail.

On 13 June, Katumbi was arrested at [[Zaventem Airport]] in Brussels for allegedly traveling with a fake passport while attempting to travel to Russia to attend the opening ceremony of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/international/l-opposant-moise-katumbi-denonce-un-acharnement-de-kinshasa-apres-l-incident-a-zaventem-5b23982f55326301e78b8060|title=L'opposant Moïse Katumbi dénonce "un acharnement" de Kinshasa après l'incident à Zaventem|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=2018-11-08|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later granted a temporary residence permit by the Belgian authorities.

On 5 August, Katumbi's lawyer, [[Eric Dupond-Moretti]], announced that he would attempt to reach out to the [[United Nations]] concerning Katumbi's denial of entry into the DR Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://afrique.lalibre.be/22623/katumbi-se-tourne-vers-la-justice-apres-avoir-ete-empeche-de-rentrer/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter|title=Katumbi se tourne vers la justice après avoir été empêché de rentrer — La Libre Afrique|date=2018-08-05|work=La Libre Afrique|access-date=2018-11-08|language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Ensemble's secretary general Delly Sesanga announced that they would file for Katumbi to run for president even if he was not in the country.&lt;ref&gt;https://actualite.cd/2018/08/05/rdc-presidentielle-ensemble-pour-le-changement-annonce-quil-va-deposer-la-candidature-de-katumbi/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views===
In [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|2006]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2011|2011]], Katumbi supported [[Joseph Kabila]]'s campaigns to run for President of the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = - Www.LiveCongo.Com - Tout le Congo en Live !!! -|url = http://www.livecongo.com/dossier.php?num=1634&amp;style=bleu&amp;numdos=33|website = www.livecongo.com|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Katumbi publicly distanced himself from Kabila in 2015.&lt;ref name= yahoo&gt;{{cite journal |title=Powerful governor of Congo's copper-rich Katanga province resigns|url=https://news.yahoo.com/powerful-governor-congos-copper-rich-katanga-province-resigns-064722826.html|journal=News Yahoo|date = 30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katumbi has been outspoken about his belief that President Kabila should follow the country's constitution and step down as president in 2016.&lt;ref name=Ross15/&gt; In January 2016, Katumbi joined other high-profile Congolese figures in a coalition dubbed "Front Citoyen 2016". The entity aimed to protect the constitution and attempted to ensure that the 2016 presidential elections took place.&lt;ref name=Rainfroy16&gt;{{cite news |title=DRC: Moses Katumbi officially announces his support to the citizen Front 2016 |author=Claire Rainfroy |url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/290907/politique/rdc-moise-katumbi-annonce-officiellement-ralliement-front-citoyen-2016/ |work=[[Jeune Afrique]] |date=4 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is against Katanga [[secession]] from Congo, which is supported by a section of the province's population.&lt;ref name=Manson10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kayenge14/&gt;

Katumbi has frequently said that he prefers his private career to politics.&lt;ref name=Economist15/&gt;&lt;ref name="AfricanBusiness13"/&gt;

==Public perception==
Katumbi is generally viewed positively both in Katanga Province and nationally for both his development of the Katanga region and as president of TP Mazembe.&lt;ref name=BD08/&gt; He is known for being generous, giving money directly to those who ask &lt;ref name=Braeckman09/&gt;&lt;ref name=AfricanBusiness13/&gt; and investing his own funds in social causes.&lt;ref name=Trustfull/&gt;

The media has described Katumbi's public perception as being a "[[self-made man]]"&lt;ref name=Hayes11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clayton14/&gt; and a "man of the people".&lt;ref name=Bakumanya15/&gt; In 2011, nearly one million people signed a petition asking Katumbi to remain governor after he said he planned to quit.&lt;ref name=AfricanBusiness13/&gt;

In 2012 he was named one of "The 50 most influential Africans" by ''[[The Africa Report]]''.&lt;ref name=AfricaReport12&gt;{{cite news |title=The 50 most influential Africans: Moïse Katumbi Chapwe |author= |url=http://www.theafricareport.com/Central-Africa/the-50-most-influential-africans-moise-katumbi-chapwe.html|work=[[The Africa Report]] |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'' named him "African of the Year" in 2015.&lt;ref name=JeuneAfrique15/&gt;

{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Public administration}}
'''Public administration''' is the implementation of [[public policy|government policy]] and also an academic discipline that studies this implementation and prepares [[civil servant]]s for working in the public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/public-administration |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a "field of inquiry with a diverse scope" whose fundamental goal is to "advance management and policies so that government can function".&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Public Administration''. Eds Jack Rabin, W. Bartley Hildreth, and Gerard J. Miller. 1989: Marcel Dekker, NY. p. iii&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the various definitions which have been offered for the term are: "the management of public programs";&lt;ref&gt;Robert and Janet Denhardt. ''Public Administration: An Action Orientation''. 6th Ed. 2009: Thomson Wadsworth, Belmont CA.&lt;/ref&gt; the "translation of [[politics]] into the reality that [[citizen]]s see every day";&lt;ref name="KettlDonald"&gt;Kettl, Donald and James Fessler. 2009. ''The Politics of the Administrative Process''. Washington D.C.: CQ Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the study of government decision making, the [[policy analysis|analysis of the policies]] themselves, the various inputs that have produced them, and the inputs necessary to produce alternative policies."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome B. McKinney and Lawrence C. Howard. Public Administration: Balancing Power and Accountability. 2nd Ed. 1998: Praeger Publishing, Westport, CT. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Public administration is "centrally concerned with the organization of government policies and programs as well as the behavior of officials (usually non-elected) formally responsible for their conduct".&lt;ref&gt;UN Economic and Social Council. Committee of Experts on Public Administration. Definition of basic concepts and terminologies in governance and public administration. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many unelected [[public servant]]s can be considered to be public administrators, including heads of city, county, regional, state and federal departments such as municipal budget directors, [[human resources]] (HR) administrators, [[city manager]]s, [[census]] managers, state [[mental health]] directors, and [[cabinet secretaries]].&lt;ref name="KettlDonald" /&gt; Public administrators are [[public servant]]s working in public departments and agencies, at all levels of government.

In the United States, civil servants and academics such as [[Woodrow Wilson]] promoted [[U.S. Civil Service Reform#The Pendleton Act|civil service reform]] in the 1880s, moving public administration into [[academia]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, Woodrow. June, 1887. "[[The Study of Administration]]", ''Political Science Quarterly'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "until the mid-20th century and the dissemination of the German sociologist [[Max Weber]]'s theory of bureaucracy" there was not "much interest in a theory of public administration".&lt;ref&gt;Public administration. (2010) In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved August 18, 2010, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The field is [[Multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] in character; one of the various proposals for public administration's sub-fields sets out six pillars, including [[human resources]], [[organizational theory]], [[policy analysis]], [[statistics]], [[budget]]ing, and [[ethics]].&lt;ref name="Shafritz"&gt;Shafritz, J.M., A.C.

Dunn, Deputy Comptroller for the US Navy)]]

In 1947 [[Paul H. Appleby]] defined public administration as "public leadership of public affairs directly responsible for executive action". In a democracy, it has to do with such leadership and executive action in terms that respect and contribute to the dignity, the worth, and the potentials of the citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, Paul 1947. "Toward Better Public Administration", ''[[Public Administration Review]]'' Vol. 7, No. 2 pp. 93–99.&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, Gordon Clapp, then Chairman of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] defined public administration "as a public instrument whereby democratic society may be more completely realized." This implies that it must "relate itself to concepts of justice, liberty, and fuller economic opportunity for human beings" and is thus "concerned with "people, with ideas, and with things".&lt;ref&gt;Clapp, Gordon. 1948. "Public Administration in an Advancing South", ''[[Public Administration Review]]'' Vol. 8. no. 2 pp. 169–75. Clapp attributed part of this definition to Charles Beard.&lt;/ref&gt; According to James D. Carroll &amp; Alfred M. Zuck, the publication by "Woodrow Wilson of his essay, "[[The Study of Administration]]" in 1887 is generally regarded as the beginning of public administration as a specific field of study".&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, J.D. &amp; Zuck, A.M. (1983). "The Study of Public Administration Revisited". ''A Report of the Centennial Agendas project of the American Society for Public Administration''. Washington, DC; American Society for Public Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on the democracy theme and discarding the link to the executive branch, [[Patricia M. Shields]] asserts that public administration "deals with the stewardship and implementation of the products of a living democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 1998. [https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3954 "Pragmatism as a Philosophy of Science: A Tool for Public Administration]" Research in Public Administration Vol. 4. pp. 195–225.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key term "product" refers to "those items that are constructed or produced" such as prisons, roads, laws, schools, and security. "As implementors, public managers engage these products." They participate in the doing and making of the "living" democracy. A living democracy is "an environment that is changing, organic", imperfect, inconsistent and teaming with values. "Stewardship is emphasized because public administration is concerned "with accountability and effective use of scarce resources and ultimately making the connection between the doing, the making and democratic values".&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 1998. [https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3954 "Pragmatism as a Philosophy of Science: A Tool for Public Administration"], ''Research in Public Administration'' Vol. 4. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently scholars claim that "public administration has no generally accepted definition", because the "scope of the subject is so great and so debatable that it is easier to explain than define".&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/public-administration/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328003943/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/public-administration/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 28, 2017|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public administration is a field of study (i.e., a discipline) and an occupation. There is much disagreement about whether the study of public administration can properly be called a discipline, largely because of the debate over whether public administration is a subfield of [[political science]] or a subfield of [[administration (government)|administrative science]]", the latter an outgrowth of its roots in policy analysis and evaluation research.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haveman, R. H. (1987). Policy analysis and evaluation research after twenty years. "Policy Studies Journal", 16(1): 191–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Donald Kettl is among those who view public administration "as a subfield within political science".&lt;ref name="h-net"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Future of Public Administration |first=Donald F. |last=Kettl |url=http://www.h-net.org/~pubadmin/tfreport/kettl.pdf  |format=PDF |publisher=H-net.org |accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lalor a society with a public authority that provides at least one [[public good]] can be said to have a public administration whereas the absence of either (or ''a fortiori'' both) a public authority or the provision of at least one public good implies the absence of a public administration. He argues that public administration is the public provision of public goods in which the demand function is satisfied more or less effectively by politics, whose primary tool is rhetoric, providing for public goods, and the supply function is satisfied more or less efficiently by public management, whose primary tools are speech acts, producing public goods.  The moral purpose of public administration, implicit in its acceptance of its role, is the maximization of the opportunities of the public to satisfy its wants.&lt;ref&gt;Lalor, Stephen ''A General Theory of Public Administration'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North American Industry Classification System]] definition of the Public Administration (NAICS 91) sector states that public administration "... comprises establishments primarily engaged in activities of a governmental nature, that is, the enactment and judicial interpretation of laws and their pursuant regulations, and the administration of programs based on them". This includes "Legislative activities, taxation, national defense, public order and safety, immigration services, foreign affairs and international assistance, and the administration of government programs are activities that are purely governmental in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/cis-sic/cis-sic.nsf/IDE/cis-sic91defe.html |title=Definition Public Administration (NAICS 91) |publisher=Ic.gc.ca |accessdate= October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the academic perspective, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States defines the study of public administration as "A program that prepares individuals to serve as managers in the executive arm of local, state, and federal government and that focuses on the systematic study of executive organization and management. Includes instruction in the roles, development, and principles of public administration; the management of public policy; executive-legislative relations; public budgetary processes and financial management; administrative law; public personnel management; professional ethics; and research methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&amp;cipid=88560 |title=CIP user site |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Globalize/US|date=February 2016}}

===Antiquity to the 19th century===
Dating back to Antiquity, Pharaohs, kings and emperors have required pages, treasurers, and tax collectors to administer the practical business of government. Prior to the 19th century, staffing of most public administrations was rife with nepotism, favouritism, and political patronage, which was often referred to as a "[[spoils system]]". Public administrators have long been the "eyes and ears" of rulers. In medieval times, the abilities to read and write, add and subtract were as dominated by the educated elite as public employment. Consequently, the need for expert civil servants whose ability to read and write formed the basis for developing expertise in such necessary activities as legal record-keeping, paying and feeding armies and levying [[tax]]es.  As the European Imperialist age progressed and the militarily powers extended their hold over other continents and people, the need for a sophisticated public administration grew.

The field of [[management]] may well be said to have originated in ancient China,&lt;ref name="Ewan Ferlie p.30"&gt;Ewan Ferlie, Laurence E. Lynn, Christopher Pollitt (2005) ''The Oxford Handbook of Public Management'', p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; including possibly the first highly centralized [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] state, and the earliest (by the second century BC) example of an [[meritocracy|administration based on merit]] through [[Imperial examination|testing]].&lt;ref name="APHq"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142. ''One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed' in the imperial bureaucracy of China.''

Creel]] and other scholars find the influence of Chinese administration in Europe by the 12th century, for example, in [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Fredrick II]]'s promulgations, characterized as the "birth certificate of modern bureaucracy".&lt;ref&gt;Ewan Ferlie, Laurence E. Lynn, Christopher Pollitt 2005 p.30, ''The Oxford Handbook of Public Management''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herrlee G. Creel, 1974 p.119. "Shen Pu-Hai: A Secular Philosopher of Administration", ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'' Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creel, "The Origins of Statecraft in China, I", ''The Western Chou Empire'', Chicago, pp.9-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otto B. Van der Sprenkel, "Max Weber on China", ''History and Theory'' '''3''' (1964), 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Chinese administration cannot be traced to any one individual, emphasizing a [[merit system]] figures of the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Fa-Jia]] like 4th century BC reformer [[Shen Buhai]] (400–337 BC) may have had more influence than any other, and might be considered its founder, if not valuable as a rare pre-modern example of abstract theory of administration. Creel writes that, in Shen Buhai, there are the "seeds of the [[civil service examination]]", and that, if one wishes to exaggerate, it would "no doubt be possible to translate Shen Buhai's term Shu, or technique, as 'science'", and argue that he was the first political scientist, though Creel does "not care to go this far".&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, 94

The eighteenth-century noble, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|King Frederick William I of Prussia]], created professorates in [[Kameralism|Cameralism]] in an effort to train a new class of public administrators. The universities of [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] and [[University of Halle]] were [[Prussia]]n institutions emphasizing economic and social disciplines, with the goal of societal reform. [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi]] was the most well-known professor of Cameralism. Thus, from a Western European perspective, Classic, Medieval, and Enlightenment-era scholars formed the foundation of the discipline that has come to be called public administration.

[[Lorenz von Stein]], an 1855 German professor from [[Vienna]], is considered the founder of the science of public administration in many parts of the world. In the time of Von Stein, public administration was considered a form of administrative law, but Von Stein believed this concept too restrictive. Von Stein taught that public administration relies on many prestablished disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[administrative law]] and [[public finance]]. He called public administration an integrating science, and stated that public administrators should be concerned with both theory and practice. He argued that public administration is a science because knowledge is generated and evaluated according to the scientific method.

Modern American public administration is an extension of democratic governance, justified by classic and liberal philosophers of the western world ranging from [[Aristotle]] to [[John Locke]]&lt;ref&gt;''Second Treatise on Government''&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, M., Mejia, B., and Georgiev, M.

[[File:Woodrow Wilson (Nobel 1919).jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson]]]]
In the [[United States|United States of America]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] is considered the father of public administration. He first formally recognized public administration in an 1887 article entitled "[[The Study of Administration]]". The future president wrote that "it is the object of administrative study to discover, first, what government can properly and successfully do, and, secondly, how it can do these proper things with the utmost possible efficiency and at the least possible cost either of money or of energy".&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; Wilson was more influential to the science of public administration than Von Stein, primarily due to an article Wilson wrote in 1887 in which he advocated four concepts:

* Separation of politics and administration
* Comparative analysis of political and private organizations
* Improving efficiency with business-like practices and attitudes toward daily operations
* Improving the effectiveness of public service through management and by training civil servants, [[merit pay|merit]]-based assessment

The separation of politics and administration has been the subject of lasting debate.  The different perspectives regarding this dichotomy contribute to differentiating characteristics of the suggested generations of public administration.

By the 1920s, scholars of public administration had responded to Wilson's solicitation and thus textbooks in this field were introduced. A few distinguished scholars of that period were, [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]], [[Lyndall Urwick]], [[Henri Fayol]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]], and others. Frederick Taylor (1856–1915), another prominent scholar in the field of administration and management also published a book entitled ''The Principles of Scientific Management'' (1911). He believed that scientific analysis would lead to the discovery of the "one best way" to do things or carrying out an operation. This, according to him could help save cost and time. Taylor's technique was later introduced to private industrialists, and later into the various government organizations (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref name="JeongChun"&gt;Jeong Chun Hai Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). ''Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction.'' Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|978-983-195-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor's approach is often referred to as Taylor's Principles or Taylorism. Taylor's scientific management consisted of main four principles (Frederick W. Taylor, 1911):
* Replace rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks.
* Scientifically select, train, and develop each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves.
* Provide "detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker's discrete task" (Montgomery 1997: 250).
* Divide work nearly equally between managers and workers, so that the managers apply scientific management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks.

Taylor had very precise ideas about how to introduce his system (approach):
'It is only through enforced standardization of methods, enforced adoption of the best implements and working conditions, and enforced cooperation that this faster work can be assured. And the duty of enforcing the adoption of standards and enforcing this cooperation rests with management alone.'&lt;ref&gt;Frederick W. Taylor. (1856–1915). ''Principles of Scientific Management''. New York &amp; London: Harper Brothers; Also see, Jeong Chun Hai Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). ''Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction.'' Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|978-983-195-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Society for Public Administration]] (ASPA) the leading professional group for public administration was founded in 1939. ASPA sponsors the journal [[Public Administration Review]], which was founded in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/ASPAgeneral.cfm |title=Our Web Site Has Moved! |publisher=Aspanet.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203193218/http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/ASPAgeneral.cfm |archive-date=2011-12-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US in the 1940s===
[[File:Luther Gulick (social scientist).jpg|thumb|left|[[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]] (1892–1993) was an expert on public administration.]]

The separation of politics and administration advocated by Wilson continues to play a significant role in public administration today. However, the dominance of this dichotomy was challenged by second generation scholars, beginning in the 1940s. [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]]'s fact-value dichotomy was a key contender for Wilson's proposed politics-administration dichotomy. In place of Wilson's first generation split, Gulick advocated a "seamless web of discretion and interaction".&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Brian R. 1989. Mastering Public Administration; from Max Weber to Dwight Waldo. Chatham, New Jersey: Chatham House Publishers, Inc. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther Gulick and [[Lyndall Urwick]] are two second-generation scholars. Gulick, Urwick, and the new generation of administrators built on the work of contemporary behavioural, administrative, and organizational scholars including [[Henri Fayol]], [[Fredrick Winslow Taylor]], Paul Appleby, Frank Goodnow, and Willam Willoughby. The new generation of organizational theories no longer relied upon logical assumptions and generalizations about human nature like classical and enlightened theorists.

Gulick developed a comprehensive, generic theory of organization that emphasized the scientific method, efficiency, professionalism, structural reform, and executive control. Gulick summarized the duties of administrators with an acronym; [[POSDCORB]], which stands for planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, and budgeting. Fayol developed a systematic, 14-point treatment of private management. Second-generation theorists drew upon private management practices for administrative sciences. A single, generic management theory bleeding the borders between the private and the public sector was thought to be possible. With the general theory, the administrative theory could be focused on governmental organizations. The mid-1940s theorists challenged Wilson and Gulick. The politics-administration dichotomy remained the centre of criticism.

====1950s to the 1970s====
During the 1950s, the United States experienced prolonged prosperity and solidified its place as a world leader. Public Administration experienced a kind of heyday due to the successful war effort and successful post war reconstruction in Western Europe and Japan. Government was popular as was President Eisenhower. In the 1960s and 1970s, government itself came under fire as ineffective, inefficient, and largely a wasted effort.  The costly [[Vietnam War|American intervention in Vietnam]] along with domestic scandals including the bugging of Democratic party headquarters (the 1974 [[Watergate]] scandal) are two examples of self-destructive government behaviour that alienated citizens.
[[File:B-52D(061127-F-1234S-017).jpg|thumb|right|The costly [[Vietnam War]] alienated U.S. citizens from their government (pictured is [[Operation Arc Light]], a U.S. bombing operation)]]
There was a call by citizens for efficient administration to replace ineffective, wasteful bureaucracy. Public administration would have to distance itself from politics to answer this call and remain effective. Elected officials supported these reforms.  The [[Hoover Commission]], chaired by University of Chicago professor [[Louis Brownlow]], to examine reorganization of government. Brownlow subsequently founded the Public Administration Service (PAS) at the university, an organization which has provided consulting services to all levels of government until the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Concurrently, after [[World War II]], the whole concept of public administration expanded to include policymaking and analysis, thus the study of "administrative policy making and analysis" was introduced and enhanced into the government decision-making bodies. Later on, the human factor became a predominant concern and emphasis in the study of public administration. This period witnessed the development and inclusion of other social sciences knowledge, predominantly, psychology, anthropology, and sociology, into the study of public administration (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref name="JeongChun" /&gt; Henceforth, the emergence of scholars such as, [[Fritz Morstein Marx]] with his book ''The Elements of Public Administration'' (1946), Paul H. Appleby ''Policy and Administration'' (1952), Frank Marini 'Towards a New Public Administration' (1971), and others that have contributed positively in these endeavors.

===1980s–1990s===
In the late 1980s, yet another generation of public administration theorists began to displace the last.  The new theory, which came to be called [[New Public Management]], was proposed by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler in their book ''Reinventing Government''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kamensky  | first = John M. | title = Role of the "Reinventing Government" movement in Federal management reform | journal = [[Public Administration Review]] | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–55 | doi = 10.2307/976448 | jstor = 976448  | date = May–June 1996 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new model advocated the use of private sector-style models, organizational ideas and values to improve the efficiency and service-orientation of the public sector. During the [[Clinton Administration]] (1993–2001), Vice President [[Al Gore]] adopted and reformed federal agencies using NPM approaches. In the 1990s, new public management became prevalent throughout the bureaucracies of the US, the UK and, to a lesser extent, in Canada. The original public management theories have roots attributed to policy analysis, according to [[Richard Elmore]] in his 1986 article published in the "[[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Elmore | first = Richard F. | author-link = Richard Elmore | title = Graduate education in public management: working the seams of government | journal = [[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–83 | doi = 10.1002/pam.4050060107 | date = 1986 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern authors define NPM as a combination of splitting large bureaucracies into smaller, more fragmented agencies, encouraging competition between different public agencies, and encouraging competition between public agencies and private firms and using economic incentives lines (e.g., performance pay for senior executives or user-pay models).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Margetts | first1 = Helen | last2 = Dunleavy | first2 = Patrick | last3 = Bastow | first3 = Simon | last4 = Tinkler | first4 = Jane | author-link1 = Helen Margetts | author-link2 = Patrick Dunleavy | title = New public management is dead – long live digital-era governance | journal = [[Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 467–94 | doi = 10.1093/jopart/mui057 | date = July 2006 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; NPM treats individuals as "customers" or "clients" (in the private sector sense), rather than as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Stone, (2008) "Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks", ''Journal of Policy Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics argue that the New Public Management concept of treating people as "customers" rather than "citizens" is an inappropriate borrowing from the private sector model, because businesses see customers as a means to an end (profit), rather than as the proprietors of government (the owners), opposed to merely the customers of a business (the patrons). In New Public Management, people are viewed as economic units not democratic participants which is the hazard of linking an MBA (business administration, economic and employer-based model) too closely with the public administration (governmental, [[public good]]) sector. Nevertheless, the NPM model (one of four described by Elmore in 1986, including the "generic model") is still widely accepted at multiple levels of government (e.g., municipal, state/province, and federal) and in many OECD nations.

In the late 1990s, Janet and Robert Denhardt proposed a new public services model in response to the dominance of NPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Denhardt | first1 = Robert B. | last2 = Vinzant Denhardt | first2 = Janet | title = The new public service: serving rather than steering | journal = [[Public Administration Review]] | volume = 60 | issue = 6 | pages = 549–59 | doi = 10.1111/0033-3352.00117 | jstor = 977437 | date = November–December 2000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; A successor to NPM is [[digital era governance]], focusing on themes of reintegrating government responsibilities, needs-based holism (executing duties in cursive ways), and digitalization (exploiting the transformational capabilities of modern IT and digital storage). One example of this is [[Open Forum (Australia)|openforum.com.au]], an Australian non-for-profit eDemocracy project which invites politicians, senior public servants, academics, business people and other key stakeholders to engage in high-level policy debate.

Another new public service model is what has been called New Public Governance, an approach which includes a centralization of power; an increased number, role and influence of partisan-political staff; personal-politicization of appointments to the senior public service; and, the assumption that the public service is promiscuously partisan for the government of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Aucoin, Peter (2008). "New Public Management and the Quality of Government: Coping with the New Political Governance in Canada", Conference on ''New Public Management and the Quality of Government'', SOG and the Quality of Government Institute, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, 13–15 November 2008, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, the goal of community programs in the United States was often represented by terms such as independent living, [[community integration]], inclusion, community participation, [[deinstitutionalization]], and civil rights. Thus, the same public policy (and public administration) was to apply to all citizens, inclusive of disability. However, by the 1990s, categorical state systems were strengthened in the United States (Racino, in press, 2014), and efforts were made to introduce more disability content into the public policy curricula&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Elmore | first1 = Richard F. | last2 = Watson | first2 = Sara | last3 = Pfeiffer | first3 = David | author-link1 = Richard Elmore | title = A case for including disability policy issues in public policy curricula | journal = Journal of Policy Analysis and Management (Curriculum and Case Notes) | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 167–73 | doi = 10.2307/3325146 | date = 1992 | ref = harv | jstor = 3325146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with disability public policy (and administration) distinct fields in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Zola | first = Irving K. | author-link = Irving Zola | contribution = Introduction | editor-last1 = Brown | editor-first1 = Susan T. | title = An Independent Living Approach to Disability Policy Studies | pages =  | publisher = Research and Training Center on Public Policy And Independent Living, World Institute on Disability | location = Berkeley, CA | year = 1993 | oclc = 36404707 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Racino | first = Julie A. | title = Public administration and disability community services administration in the US | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781466579828 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorists have also dominated "intervention practice" (generally not the province of public administration) in recent years, believing that they are in opposition to generic public policy (termed [[ecological systems theory]], of the late [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]).

Increasingly, [[public policy]] academics and practitioners have utilized the theoretical concepts of [[political economy]] to explain policy outcomes such as the success or failure of reform efforts or the persistence of suboptimal outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corduneanu-Huci |first1= Cristina |first2= Alexander |last2=Hamilton |first3= Issel |last3=Masses Ferrer |year=2012 |title=Understanding Policy Change: How to Apply Political Economy Concepts in Practice |publisher= The World Bank |location= Washington DC. |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Understanding_Policy_Change.html?id=oKShuAAACAAJ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core branches==
In academia, the field of public administration consists of a number of sub-fields. Scholars have proposed a number of different sets of sub-fields. One of the proposed models uses five "pillars":&lt;ref name="Shafritz"/&gt;

*[[Organization theory|Organizational theory in public administration]] is the study of the structure of governmental entities and the many particulars inculcated in them.
*[[Public sector ethics|Ethics in public administration]] serves as a normative approach to decision making.
*[[Policy analysis]] serves as an empirical approach to decision making.
*[[Public budgeting]] is the activity within a government that seeks to allocate scarce resources among unlimited demands.
*[[Human Resource Management in Public Administration|Human resource management]] is an in-house structure that ensures that public service staffing is done in an unbiased, ethical and values-based manner. The basic functions of the HR system are employee benefits, employee health care, compensation, and many more (e.g., [[human rights]], [[Americans with Disabilities Act]]). The executives managing the HR director and other key departmental personnel are also part of the public administration system.

==Decision-making models==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Given the array of duties public administrators find themselves performing, the professional administrator might refer to a theoretical framework from which he or she might work.  Indeed, many public and private administrative scholars have devised and modified decision-making models.

===Niskanen's budget-maximizing===
In 1971, Professor [[William Niskanen]] proposed a [[rational choice]] variation which he called the "[[budget-maximizing model]]". He claimed that rational bureaucrats will universally seek to increase the budgets of their units (to enhance their stature), thereby contributing to state growth and increased public expenditure. Niskanen served on President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors; his model underpinned what has been touted as curtailed public spending and increased privatization. However, budgeted expenditures and the growing deficit during the Reagan administration is evidence of a different reality.  A range of pluralist authors have critiqued Niskanen's universalist approach.  These scholars have argued that officials tend also to be motivated by considerations of the public interest.

===Dunleavy's bureau-shaping===
The [[bureau-shaping]] model, a modification of Niskanen, holds that rational bureaucrats only maximize the part of their budget that they spend on their own agency's operations or give to contractors and interest groups.  Groups that are able to organize a "flowback" of benefits to senior officials would, according to this theory, receive increased budgetary attention. For instance, rational officials will get no benefit from paying out larger welfare checks to millions of low-income citizens because this does not serve a bureaucrats' goals. Accordingly, one might instead expect a jurisdiction to seek budget increases for defense and security purposes in place programming. If we refer back to Reagan once again, Dunleavy's bureau shaping model accounts for the alleged decrease in the "size" of government while spending did not, in fact, decrease. Domestic entitlement programming was financially deemphasized for military research and personnel.

==Academic field==
{{See also|Master of Public Administration|Doctor of Public Administration}}
University programs preparing students for careers in public administration typically offer the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree, although in some universities, an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Public Administration is awarded. In the [[United States]], the academic field of public administration draws heavily on [[political science]] and [[administrative law]]. Some MPA programs include economics courses to give students a background in microeconomic issues (markets, rationing mechanisms, etc.) and macroeconomic issues (e.g., national debt). Scholars such as [[John A. Rohr]] write of a long history behind the constitutional [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] of government [[bureaucracy]]. In Europe (notably in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Germany]]), the divergence of the field from other disciplines can be traced to the 1720s [[Continental Europe|continental]] university curriculum. Formally, official academic distinctions were made in the 1910s and 1890s, respectively.

The goals of the field of public administration are related to the [[Democracy|democratic]] values of improving [[Egalitarianism|equality]], [[justice]], security, efficiency and effectiveness of public services in a non-profit venue; [[business administration]], on the other hand, is primarily concerned with expanding market share, generating revenue and earning [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. For a field built on concepts ([[accountability]], [[governance]], [[decentralization]] and [[clientele]]), these concepts are often ill-defined and typologies often ignore certain aspects of these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dubois |first1=Hans F. W. |last2=Fattore |first2=Giovanni |title= International Journal of Public Administration |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a913084156 |pages=704–27 |year=2009 |volume=32 |publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group |doi=10.1080/01900690902908760 |quote=The field of public administration knows many concepts. By focusing on one such concept, this research shows how definitions can be deceptive... | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more specific term "[[public management]]" refers to ordinary, routine or typical management that aims to achieve [[public good]]. In some definitions, "public management" refers to private sector, market-driven perspective on the operation of government. This typically involves putting senior executives on performance contracts, rather than [[tenure]]d positions, instituting pay-for-performance systems for executives, creating revenue-generating agencies and so on.  This latter view is often called "[[New Public Management|new public management]]" (NPM) by its advocates.  New Public Management represents a reform attempt that emphasizes the professional nature of public administration{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. NPM advocates aim to replace the academic, moral or disciplinary emphasis of traditional public administration with a professional focus. Some theorists advocate a "bright line" differentiation of the professional field from related academic disciplines like political science and sociology; it remains interdisciplinary in nature.

One public administration scholar, Donald Kettl, argues that "public administration sits in a disciplinary backwater", because "for the last generation, scholars have sought to save or replace it with fields of study like implementation, public management, and formal bureaucratic theory".&lt;ref name="h-net" /&gt; Kettl states that "public administration, as a subfield within [[political science]]...is struggling to define its role within the discipline".&lt;ref name="h-net" /&gt; He notes two problems with public administration: it "has seemed methodologically to lag behind" and "the field's theoretical work too often seems not to define it"-indeed, "some of the most interesting recent ideas in public administration have come from outside the field".&lt;ref name="h-net" /&gt;

[[Public administration theory]] is the domain in which discussions of the meaning and purpose of government, the role of bureaucracy in supporting democratic governments, budgets, governance, and public affairs takes place.  In recent years, public administration theory has periodically connoted a heavy orientation toward critical theory and [[postmodern]] philosophical notions of government, governance, and power.  However, many public administration scholars support a classic definition of the term emphasizing constitutionality, public service, bureaucratic forms of organization, and hierarchical government.

===Comparative public administration===
Comparative public administration or CPA is defined as the study of administrative systems in a comparative fashion or the study of public administration in other countries. There have been several issues which have hampered the development of comparative public administration, including: the major differences between Western countries and developing countries; the lack of curriculum on this sub-field in public administration programs; and the lack of success in developing theoretical models which can be scientifically tested. Even though CPA is a weakly formed field as a whole, this sub-field of public administration is an attempt at cross-cultural analysis, a "quest for patterns and regularities of administrative action and behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jreisat|first=Jamil E.|date=2005-03-01|title=Comparative Public Administration Is Back In, Prudently|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00447.x/abstract|journal=Public Administration Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=2|pages=231–42|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00447.x|issn=1540-6210}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPA is an integral part to the analysis of public administration techniques. The process of comparison allows for more widely applicable policies to be tested in a variety of situations.

Comparative public administration emerged during the post-World War II period in order to seek international developmental strategies which aided in the [[containment]] of [[communism]] during the [[Cold War]]. (Riggs 1954, Heady 1960)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;utminers.utep.edu/spena2/PAD5355/WHAT%20IS%20CPA.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; The developers of this field expanded on a general theory, a research agenda, and generalized "lessons learned". (Riggs 1954, Heady 1960) A prominent figure of Public Administration, Woodrow Wilson, commented on the study by saying, "Like principles of civil liberty are everywhere fostering like methods of government; and if comparative studies of the ways and means of government should enable us to offer suggestions which will practicably combine openness and vigor in the administration of such governments with ready docility to all serious, well-sustained public criticism, they will have approved themselves worthy to be ranked among the highest and most fruitful of the great departments of political study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/initiatives/first-principles/primary-sources/woodrow-wilson-on-administration |title=American Founders &amp;#124; The Heritage Foundation |publisher=Heritage.org |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2017-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112020613/http://www.heritage.org/initiatives/first-principles/primary-sources/woodrow-wilson-on-administration |archive-date=2017-01-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the financial state of the powering countries began to stabilize toward the decline of the Cold War, the field of CPA began to diminish.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The resulting decline caused the lack of further expansion of this study making it irrelevant.

Comparative public administration lacks curriculum, which has prevented it from becoming a major field of study. This lack of understanding of the basic concepts that build this field's foundation has ultimately led to its lack of use. For example, William Waugh, a professor at Georgia State University has stated "Comparative studies are difficult because of the necessity to provide enough information on the sociopolitical context of national administrative structures and processes for readers to understand why there are differences and similarities."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/194699522?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also asserts, "Although there is sizable literature on comparative public administration it is scattered and dated."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Waugh argues that public administration requires an understanding of different administrative structures and a comparison of different public administration models. The literature to build this base of knowledge is scattered and often hard to obtain. The lack or ill-formed use of comparative public administration has been detrimental for many countries, including the United States. Fred Riggs a political scientist, states that "comparisons to the United States also can be problematic, because of the tendency of many American scholars to presume the American organizational structures and processes are models for other nations to emulate, which was a failing of early developmental administrative studies."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this, he claims the misuse and misapplication of comparative public administration has led to it being underdeveloped.

The development and better use comparative public administration could lead to better understanding. In 2002, the National Security Strategy was used in the battle of hearts and minds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/209950790?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tried to assimilate with an Arab and Islamic audience to push American values and democracy in an attempt to stop terrorism, when in fact the lack of comparison on the public level was ineffective and backfired.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The lack of willingness to understand their culture led to more tension in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In conclusion of these events there are not enough resources directed to the study of comparative public administration. For a basic understanding of sociopolitical structure of a society or culture is a key component of comparative public administration.

Despite all of its set backs there are examples of the application of well-formed Comparative Public Administration working in the world today. One of which is the comparison on the national level David Clark an author in this field states "In spite of similarities in public management reform rhetoric, it is argued that there is increasing divergence in the philosophy &amp; practice of public service in the two nations, &amp; and these differences reflect regimes that incorporate different ideals of citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218320986?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights the benefit of proper comparison of public administration. By examining patterns that emerge in international public sectors one can identify similarities and differences in many things including ideals of citizenship on the local level. Although the United States failed use of Comparative Public Administration in the Middle East is noted, they did properly incorporate it domestically. "During the Clinton administration, the focus on residential energy consumption in the United States was elevated to a high level with the inauguration of the Million Solar Roofs initiative, in which the Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored workshops, developed a pool of existing federal lending and financing options, and worked with partners in the solar and building industries to remove market barriers to strengthen grassroots demand for solar technologies".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/224021643?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This grassroots demand may have come from the comparative knowledge that concluded "In the United States, residential and commercial buildings combined now use 71% of all electricity produced and account for 79% of all electricity expenditures. Annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission attributed to electricity consumption in these U.S. buildings constitute 43% of the country's annual total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission, which is approximately equivalent to the total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission of Japan, France, and the United Kingdom combined. These levels support the claim of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] that energy use in buildings offer more potential for reducing carbon emission than any other single sector in the United States and abroad.".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This example compares CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission in the United States to other countries and through the buildings sector; the US could cut down on CO2 emission. The field of comparative public administration is often misunderstood for the definition itself is complex and requires layers of understanding. The field will require many more years of collaborative research before it becomes a widely recognized academic study.

===Master's degrees===
[[File:School of Government.JPG|thumb|The Knapp-Sanders Building, the home of the School of Government at the [[University of North Carolina]].]]

Some public administration programs have similarities to [[business administration]] programs, in cases where the students from both the Master's in Public Administration (MPA) and Master's in Business Administration (MBA) programs take many of the same courses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In some programs, the MPA (or MAPA) is more clearly distinct from the MBA, in that the MPA often emphasizes substantially different ethical and sociological criteria that pertain to administering government programs for the public good that have not been key criteria for business managers, who typically aim to maximize [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or [[share price]].

The MPA is related to similar graduate-level government studies programs including [[Master of Arts]] (MA) programs in public affairs, [[public policy]], and [[political science]].  MPA degrees may be more likely to include program emphases on [[policy analysis]] techniques or other topical focuses such as the study of [[International relations|international affairs]] as opposed to MA degrees, which tend to focus on [[constitutional law|constitutional issues]] such as [[separation of powers]], [[administrative law]], contracting with government, problems of [[governance]] and power, and [[participatory democracy]]. Some MPA degrees may be more oriented towards training students to undertake public service work tasks, whereas some MA programs may have a more academic, theoretical focus. Some universities offer their Masters in public administration as an MA degree (e.g., [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, Canada and the University of Kerala in India).

Some universities offer mid-career Master's programs, sometimes called an MC/MPA, that can be taken part-time (often outside of business hours) by public servants and public service managers who are working full-time. Community programs may offer internships or continuing education credits. One example is the Maxwell School's mid-career Masters at [[Syracuse University]], which was launched by Robert Iversen in the 1970s.

===Doctoral degrees===
There are two types of doctoral degrees in public administration: the Doctor of Public Administration (DPA) and the [[Ph.D.]] in public administration. The DPA is an applied-research doctoral degree in the field of public administration, focusing on the practice of public administration more than on its theoretical aspects. The DPA requires coursework beyond the Masters level and a thesis, dissertation or other doctoral project. Upon successful completion of the doctoral requirements, the title of "Doctor" is awarded and the post-nominals of D.P.A. can be used. Some universities use the Ph.D. as their doctoral degree in public administration (e.g., [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, Canada, and the [[University Of Kerala]] in India). The Ph.D. is typically sought by individuals aiming to become [[professor]]s of public administration or researchers. Individuals pursuing a Ph.D. in public administration often pursue more theoretical dissertation topics than their DPA counterparts.

===Notable scholars===
{{main article|List of notable public administration scholars}}
Notable scholars of public administration have come from a range of fields. In the period before public administration existed as its own independent discipline, scholars contributing to the field came from economics, sociology, management, political science, administrative law, and, other related fields. More recently, scholars from public administration and public policy have contributed important studies and theories.

==International organizations==
There are a number of international public administration organizations. The Commonwealth Association of Public Administration and Management (CAPAM) is diverse, as it includes the 54 member states of the Commonwealth from India and the UK to Nauru. Its biennial conference brings together ministers of public service, top public officials and leading scholars. The oldest organization is the [[International Institute of Administrative Sciences]] (IIAS). Based in Brussels, Belgium, the IIAS is a worldwide platform providing a space for exchanges that promote knowledge and good practices to improve the organization and operation of public administration. The IIAS also aims to ensure that public agencies will be in a position to better respond to the current and future expectations and needs of society. The IIAS has set up four entities: the International Association of Schools and Institutes of Administration (IASIA), the European Group for Public Administration (EGPA), The Latin American Group for Public Administration (LAGPA) and the Asian Group for Public Administration (AGPA). IASIA is an association of organizations and individuals whose activities and interests focus on public administration and management. The activities of its members include education and training of administrators and managers. It is the only worldwide scholarly association in the field of public management. EGPA, LAGPA and AGPA are the regional sub-entities of the IIAS. Another body, the International Committee of the US-based [[Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration]] (NASPAA), has developed a number of relationships around the world.  They include sub regional and National forums like CLAD, INPAE and NISPAcee, APSA, ASPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.GlobalMPA.net |title=NASPAA International Web Portal |publisher=Globalmpa.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517102057/http://globalmpa.net/ |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Latin American Administration for Development (CLAD), based in [[Caracas, Venezuela]], this regional network of schools of public administration set up by the governments in Latin America is the oldest in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clad.org.ve |title=CLAD |publisher=CLAD |date=2007-08-29 |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is a founding member and played a central role in organizing the Inter-American Network of Public Administration Education (INPAE). Created in 2000, this regional network of schools is unique in that it is the only organization to be composed of institutions from North and Latin America and the Caribbean working in public administration and policy analysis. It has more than 49 members from top research schools in various countries throughout the hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebape.fgv.br/inpae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525004501/http://www.ebape.fgv.br/inpae|date=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NISPAcee is a network of experts, scholars and practitioners who work in the field of public administration in central Europe and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation and the Caucasus and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Floyd |last=Studio |first2= Ján |last2=Andruch |url=http://www.nispa.sk/_portal/homepage.php|title=Homepage - NISPAcee Information Portal|work=nispa.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US public administration and political science associations like NASPAA, American Political Science Association (APSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org |title=APSA - American Political Science Association |publisher=Apsanet.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American Society of Public Administration (ASPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspanet.org aspanet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations have helped to create the fundamental establishment of modern public administration.

[[Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration]] (EROPA) is a state-membership based organization, open to other organizations and individuals, headquartered in [[The Philippines]] with centres and membership organized around the [[Asia Pacific]] region. EROPA organizes annual conferences, and publishes a journal ''Asian Review of Public Administration'' (ARPA). It has a number of centres in the region, and assists in networking experts with its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration|url=http://www.eropa.org.ph|website=Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public management==

"Public management" is an approach to government administration and non-profit administration that resembles or draws on private-sector [[management]] and [[business]] techniques and approaches. These business approaches often aim to maximize [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] and [[effectiveness]] and provide improved [[customer service]].  A contrast is drawn with the study of public administration, which emphasizes the social and cultural drivers of government that many contend (e.g., [[Graham T. Allison]] and [[Charles Goodsell]]) makes it different from the private sector.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Studying and teaching about public management are widely practiced in [[developed nation]]s.

'''Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements no. 16 (SSAE 16)''' is an auditing standard for service organizations, superseding [[Statement on Auditing Standards no. 70]] (SAS 70). The "service auditor’s examination" of SAS&amp;nbsp;70 is replaced by a '''System and Organization Controls''' ('''SOC''') report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= System and Organization Controls (SOC): SOC Suite of Services |url=https://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/FRC/AssuranceAdvisoryServices/Pages/SORHome.aspx|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 was issued in April 2010, and became effective in June 2011. Many organizations that followed SAS&amp;nbsp;70 have now shifted to SSAE&amp;nbsp;16. Some service organizations are becoming savvy to the ability to use the SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 report status to show they are more capable, also encouraging their prospective end-users to make having an SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 standard part of new vendor selection criteria. It is widely known that public companies in the United States fall under the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act]], also known as Sarbanes–Oxley or SOX. However, there are also a number of provisions of the Act (e.g. the willful destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation) that apply to privately held companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.swipeclock.com/ssae-16-payroll-provider-competitive-advantage-workforce-software//&lt;/ref&gt;

SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 is largely an American standard, but it mirrors the [[ISAE 3402|International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 overview|url=http://ssae16.com/SSAE16_overview.html|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 has two different kinds of reports. A SOC&amp;nbsp;1 Type 1 report is an independent snapshot of the organization's control landscape on a given day. A SOC&amp;nbsp;1 Type 2 report adds a historical element, showing how controls were managed over time. The SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 standard requires a [http://www.a-lign.com/ssae-16-what-is-the-minimum-period-for-a-type-2-report/ minimum of six months of operation] of the controls for a SOC&amp;nbsp;1 Type 2 report.

SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 reporting can help service organizations comply with [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes–Oxley]]'s requirement (section 404) to show effective internal controls covering financial reporting. It can also be applied to data centers or any other service that might be used in the delivery of financial reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Data Centers Need SSAE&amp;nbsp;16|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/09/27/why-data-centers-need-ssae-16/|website=Data Center Knowledge|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For reports that are not specifically focused on internal controls over financial reporting, the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) has issued an Interpretation under AT Section 101 permitting service auditors to issue reports. These reports will now be considered SOC&amp;nbsp;2 audits and focus on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOC 2 Audit Overview|url=https://www.ssae16professionals.com/services/soc-2/|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 provides guidance on an auditing method, rather than mandating a specific control set. In this respect, it is similar to [[ISO 27001:2013]]. 

Effective May 1, 2017, SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 has been superseded by SSAE&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssae-16.com/ssae-18-an-update-to-ssae-16-coming-2017/|title=SSAE-18 - An Update to SSAE&amp;nbsp;16|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ssae-16.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Truviso''' (pronounced ''true-VEE-so'') is a [[continuous analytics]], [[Venture Capital|venture]]-backed, [[Startup company|startup]] headquartered in [[Foster City, California]] developing and supporting its solution leveraging [[PostgreSQL]], to deliver a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] analytics solutions for [[net-centric]] customers.  Truviso was acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc. on May 4, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2503633/financial-it/cisco-to-buy-real-time-network-analytics-firm-truviso.html|title=Cisco to buy real-time network analytics firm Truviso|last=Essers|first=Loek|work=Computerworld|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/254917/cisco_to_acquire_realtime_network_analytics_firm_truviso.html|title=Cisco to Acquire Real-time Network Analytics Firm Truviso|website=PCWorld|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and products==
Truviso was founded in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/05/26/moes-amalgamated_1.html Truviso: New tricks with old SQL] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123211235/http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/05/26/moes-amalgamated_1.html |date=2009-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] professor [[Michael J. Franklin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~franklin/ Michael Franklin's bio]&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student Sailesh Krishnamurthy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sailesh.googlepages.com/ Sailesh Krishnamurthy's bio]&lt;/ref&gt; advancing on the research of Berkeley's Telegraph project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telegraph.cs.berkeley.edu/ The Telegraph Project at UC Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt;

Truviso's TruCQ product leverages and extends the [[open source]] [[PostgreSQL]] database&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postgresql.org/download/products/7.html PostgreSQL Application Software Catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; to enable analysis of streaming data, including queries that combine those streams with other streaming data or with historical/staged data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/business_intelligence/analytics/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207404020 Truviso Offers Another Option For Business Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.it-director.com/blogs/Robin_Bloor/2007/6/TruViso_shaking_up_the_Streaming_market.html Truviso: shaking up the Streaming market]&lt;/ref&gt;   One public example of Truviso's customers using continuous analytics is the dynamic tag cloud visualization of blog indexer [[Technorati]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2008/05/28/truviso-shows-of-dynamic-database-with-technorati-tag-cloud Truviso shows off dynamic database with Technorati tag cloud]&lt;/ref&gt;

Truviso is one of the pioneers in the continuous analytics space which seeks to alter how [[business intelligence]] is done—rather than accumulating data first and then running queries on the data set stored in a [[relational database]] or a [[data warehouse]], Truviso has always-on queries which process streaming data as it arrives, continuously.  For many queries this approach yields results hundreds or thousands of times faster and more efficiently.

Truviso has received funding from ONSET Ventures,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061023115850/http://www.onsetventures.com/portfolio/portfolio_software.html ONSET Ventures Portfolio:  Applications and Infrastructure Software]&lt;/ref&gt; Diamondhead Ventures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhven.com/portfolio/companies.html Diamondhead Ventures Portfolio Companies]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] Strategic Enterprise Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.com/sef/portfolio.html UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund Portfolio Companies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Truviso was acquired by Cisco on May 4, 2012

== Technology ==
Truviso's analytics approach is to have always-on queries analyzing streaming data.  This strategy for handling continuously flowing data is different from traditional [[business intelligence]] approaches of first accumulating data and then running batch queries for reporting and analysis.

Truviso has developed a continuous analytics solution to solve the challenges of high-volume, always-on data analysis. Truviso's solution is based on a scalable [[PostgreSQL]] platform capable of concurrent query execution, utilizing standard [[SQL]] against live streams of data. Truviso's approach enables analysis of heterogeneous data regardless of whether the data is flowing, staged, or some combination of the two.

* Queries are continuous and always running so new results are delivered when the downstream application or use require them
* Data does not need to be stored or modified, so the system can keep up with enormous data volumes
* Thousands of concurrent queries can be run continuously and simultaneously on a single server
* Queries can be run over both real-time and historical data
* Incoming data can be optionally persisted for replay, [[backtesting]], drill-down, or benchmarking

On May 4, 2010, Truviso announced that the company developed a specific application for [[web analytics]] called Visitor Insight &amp; Analytics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/13614 Truviso Enters the High-End Web Analytics Market with Visitor Insight &amp; Analytics Software]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Union Bank of Nigeria Plc.''', commonly known as '''Union Bank of Nigeria''', is a [[commercial bank]] in [[Nigeria]].

==Overview==
Union Bank is a large commercial bank, serving individuals, small and medium-sized companies, as well as large corporations and organizations. In July 2009, it was rated the 556th largest bank in the world and the 14th largest bank in [[Africa]]. As of Mar 31, 2018, the bank's asset base was estimated at NGN1, 381 billion (US$4.1billion). The shareholders' equity at that time was estimated at NGN286 billion (US$851 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201210300247.html|title=Nigeria: Standard Chartered Group, Others Buy 65 Percent Stake in Union Bank|last=Anaro|first=Blessing|date=2012-10-30|work=Leadership (Abuja)|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The bank was founded in 1917 as '''Colonial Bank'''. In 1925, [[Barclays Bank]] acquired Colonial Bank, changing the bank's name to Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) or '''[[Barclays Bank (DCO)]]'''. In 1969, Barclays Bank DCO was incorporated in [[Nigeria]], as '''Barclays Bank of Nigeria Limited''', to comply with new banking laws enacted in 1968.

In 1971, the shares of the bank stock were listed on the [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]]. In the same year, 8.33% of the bank’s shares were offered to Nigerians. The following year, the [[Politics of Nigeria|Federal Government of Nigeria]] acquired 51.67% ownership of the bank, leaving [[Barclays|Barclays Bank Plc.]] of [[London]] with 40% ownership. In 1979, that 40% was sold to Nigerian individuals and businesses to comply with then recently enacted banking and investment laws. The bank changed its name to '''Union Bank of Nigeria Plc''''',''' '''''to reflect its new ownership structure.

In 1993, the Federal Government of Nigeria completely divested its ownership in the bank. Subsequently, Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. acquired the former ''Universal Trust Bank Plc'' and ''Broad Bank Limited''. It also absorbed its former subsidiary '' Union Merchant Bank Limited''.
