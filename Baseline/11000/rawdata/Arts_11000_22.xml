      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4909">In the [[Creative Arts |creative arts]] and [[scientific literature]], an '''acknowledgement''' (also spelled '''acknowledgment''' in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]]&lt;ref name="gram"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://grammarist.com/spelling/acknowledgment-acknowledgement/ | title=Acknowledgement vs. Acknowledgment – Correct Spelling – Grammarist}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an expression of a gratitude for  assistance in creating an original work.

Receiving [[credit (creative arts) |credit]] by way of acknowledgement rather than authorship indicates that the person or organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or encouragement to the author(s). Various schemes exist for classifying acknowledgements; Cronin et al.&lt;ref name="Cronin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cronin |first=Blaise |last2=McKenzie |first2=Gail |last3=Stiffler |first3=Michael |title=Patterns of acknowledgement |journal=[[Journal of Documentation|J. Doc.]] |year=1992 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=107–122 |doi=10.1108/eb026893}}&lt;/ref&gt; give the following six categories:
# [[moral support]]
# [[funding |financial support]]
# [[editing |editorial support]]
# [[presentation |presentational support]]
# [[technical support |instrumental/technical support]]
# conceptual support, or peer interactive communication (PIC)

Apart from [[citation]], which is not usually considered to be an acknowledgement, acknowledgement of conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for identifying intellectual debt. Some acknowledgements of financial support, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by the granting institution. Occasionally, bits of science humor can also be found in acknowledgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Spelling==
The spelling ''acknowledgement'' is used in [[British English]], [[Australian English]], and other English-speaking areas outside North America, whereas the spelling ''acknowledgment'' (without the ''e'' after the ''g'') is often used in [[American English]] and [[Canadian English]].&lt;ref name="gram" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4055">'''Arca Totok Kerot''' or '''Recå Thothokkerot''' IPA: [rətʃɔ ʈɔʈɔʔ kərɔt] is a statue (Jav. ''arcå'' or ''recå'' means "statue") located in Bulusari Village, Pagu District, [[Kediri Regency]], Indonesia; about 2 kilometers north-east of Simpang Lima Gumul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diskominfo.kedirikab.go.id/web/situs-arca-totok-kerot.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915173330/http://diskominfo.kedirikab.go.id/web/situs-arca-totok-kerot.html |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of [[andesite]] stone, depicting a giant with a terrifying face. The style is of a [[dvarapala]]. Based on the style, it is suggested that it was made in the 10th century.

==Physical features==
The face and other ornaments also suggest that it is a representation of a female ''butå''.&lt;ref&gt;ogre, demon, or giant&lt;/ref&gt; This is unusual since most dvarapala statues show male characteristics. Arca Totok Kerot is 3 meters tall.

The hair is matted, covering the upper part of the back. A kind of tiara with a glimpse of skull is seen above forehead, covering also the ears. The eyes are protruding, creating a terrifying effect, as if it were angry.

Like many other dvarapala statues, it kneels on one knee. The left knee touches the ground while the right knee is erected, on which the right hand is laid. The left hand is missing, so it is unknown if it originally held a ''gådå'' (mace) like other dvarapala statues. All hands and legs are wearing ''binggêl'' (bracelets).

The nipples are clearly shown on the breast, another indication that it is female. It wears a necklace of skulls, usually worn by worshippers of [[Durga]] or [[Shiva]]. A girdle is encircling its waist, on which some kind of skirt is hanging.

==Discovery and excavation==

The statue was discovered in 1981.

In 2013, due to an imminent plan by the local government to enlarge the road near Arca Totok Kerot, an excavation was hastily carried out searching for other archaeological remains.&lt;ref&gt;http://surabaya.tribunnews.com/2013/02/17/tak-ada-temuan-benda-purbakala-di-totok-kerot&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation was conducted by East Java Hall of Cultural Heritage Preservation (''Balai Pelestarian Cagar Budaya Jawa Timur''). The possibility was considered because [[dvarapala]] statues were usually placed to guard a temple complex or other important sites.

The excavation took place for six days. The team dug with average 1.5 meters into the surrounding ground, in some points even 4 meters. However, no other archaeological remains were found. Eventually the excavation was terminated and the cavities were filled. The road in front of the statue was then enlarged.

==Folklore related to the statue==

Tales were abound surrounding the statue. Some were already documented and many others were still transmitted orally. Some tales related the statue to the legendary character [[Calon Arang]], but such connection was refuted by Timoer (1981). Others were connected to the legendary king [[Jayabaya]] (Santosa, 2005).

'''''Artforum''''' is an international monthly magazine specializing in [[contemporary art]]. 

==Publication==
The magazine is published ten times a year, September through May, along with an annual summer issue. Distinguished by its 10½ inch square format, with each cover devoted to the work of a single artist, the magazine is widely acknowledged as a decisive voice in its field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1982 interview with Ingrid Sischy and Anthony Korner|url=https://archive.org/details/AM_1982_03_XX|publisher=KPFA|accessdate=July 16, 2012|format=Audio|date=March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine features in-depth articles and reviews of contemporary art, as well as book reviews, columns on cinema and popular culture, and numerous full-page advertisements from prominent galleries around the world.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mandarino|first=Grant|title=Taking stock of the "Griffin years" at Artforum|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/mandarino/magazine-rack-march7-23-10.asp|newspaper=artnet|date=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Artforum'' was founded in 1962 in [[San Francisco]] by John P. Irwin, Jr. The next publisher/owner [[Charles Cowles (art dealer)|Charles Cowles]] moved the magazine to [[Los Angeles]] in 1965 before finally settling it in [[New York City]] in 1967, where it maintains offices today. The move to New York also encompassed a shift in the style of work championed by the magazine, moving away from California style art to [[late modernism]], then the leading style of art in New York City. The departure of Philip Leider as editor-in-chief in 1971 and the tenure of [[John Coplans]] as the new editor-in-chief roughly coincided with a shift towards more fashionable trends and away from late modernism. A focus on [[minimal art]], [[conceptual art]], [[body art]], [[land art]] and [[performance art]] provided a platform for artists such as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Sol LeWitt]] and others. In 1980, after opening his own gallery in New York City, [[Charles Cowles (art dealer)|Charles Cowles]] divested himself of the magazine. A sister magazine, ''[[Bookforum]]'', was started in 1994.

==On ''Artforum''==
A book by Amy Newman chronicling the early history of the magazine, ''Challenging Art: Artforum 1962–1974'', was published by Soho Press in 2000.

[[Sarah Thornton]]'s documentary book ''Seven Days in the Art World'' (2008) contains a chapter titled "The Magazine" which is set in the offices of ''Artforum''. In it, Thornton says, "Artforum is to art what Vogue is to fashion and Rolling Stone was to rock and roll. It’s a trade magazine with crossover cachet and an institution with controversial clout." {{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[File:Tom Thomson at Lake Scugog.jpg|thumb|Tom Thomson photographed by T. H. Marten on [[Lake Scugog]], 1910.]]

'''Tom Thomson''' (1877–1917) was a Canadian painter from the beginning of the 20th century. Beginning from humble roots, his development as a career painter was meteoric, only pursuing it seriously in the final years of his life. He became one of the foremost figures in [[Canadian art]], leaving behind around 400 small oil sketches and around fifty larger works on canvas.

Beginning his career in 1902 as a graphic designer, he only began to paint seriously in 1912 at the age of 35. His skills developed as he ventured through [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]], sketching scenes that interested him. His creative peak came from 1914 until his [[Death and legacy of Tom Thomson|untimely death in 1917]]. His art style progressed from sombre, grey scenes into brilliantly coloured exposés, characterized by rapid and thickly applied brushstrokes. His later works presage the advances seen by the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement.

The canvas (right) has the same composition, but uses "brilliant scarlets, light ochres, xanthine yellows and rusty oranges" to make the work into a "dazzling, dancing autumn subject."{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=182}}

The artwork of Thomson is typically divided into two bodies: the first is made up of the small oil sketches on wood panels, of which there are around 400, and the second is of around fifty larger works on canvas.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}} The smaller sketches were typically done in the style of [[en plein air]] in "the North," primarily Algonquin Park, in the spring, summer and fall.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#canvases-versus-oil-sketches 59–60]}} The larger canvases were instead completed over the winter in Thomson's studio—an old utility shack with a wood-burning stove on the grounds of the Studio Building, an artist's enclave in [[Rosedale, Toronto]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=127}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=181–85}}{{sfnb|Brown|1998|pp=151, 158}} Although he sold few of the larger paintings during his lifetime, they formed the basis of posthumous exhibitions, including one at [[Wembley]] in London, that eventually brought international attention to his work,{{sfnb|Dejardin|2011}} though the more plentiful sketches have typically been thought of as the core of his work.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#canvases-versus-oil-sketches 60]}}

He considered most of his sketches to be complete works in themselves and not studies for larger works, since in the transition to a larger canvas the works lose their characteristic intimacy.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#canvases-versus-oil-sketches 60]}} Still, a dozen or so of the major canvases were directly derived from smaller sketches. Indeed, paintings like ''[[Northern River (painting)|Northern River]]'', ''[[Spring Ice]]'', ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'' were only later expanded into larger oil paintings.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}} While the sketches were produced quickly, the canvases were developed over weeks or even months. Because of this, they display an "inherent formality," with the transition from small to large requiring a reinvention or elaboration of the original details.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=181–82}} In this transition he often exaggerated hillsides or other landscape features to give the final picture greater depth.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=110}} Comparing sketches with their respective canvases allows one to see the changes Thomson made in colour, detail and background textural patterns.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=182}}{{sfnb|Murray|2006|p=92}}

===Materials===
In 1914 Thomson made himself a sketch box to hold 8½ × 10½ inch (21.6 × 26.7&amp;nbsp;cm) panels.{{sfnb|Davies|c. 1930}} The lower half of the box served as a palette, while the upper half served as a support for canvas or wood panels. Slots made room for three paintings to be carried at any given time, keeping them apart so wet paint did not smear or flatten.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=123}} Thomson utilized different materials throughout his career, providing a method for dating paintings.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=25}} For example, the wood panels he used in 1914 developed vertical cracks.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=125}}{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=25}} He had only occasionally used hard wood-pulp board in 1914, but consistently began using it in 1915.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}} In the spring and fall of 1915 he used [[Terra cotta (color)|terra cotta-coloured]] and [[Carnation (painting)|carnation]]-coloured paint as [[Paint sealant|sealers]], but by 1916 he had switched to [[ochre]] paint.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=25}} In the spring of 1917 he disassembled and cut up wood [[crate]]s to make into 5 × 7 inch (12.7 × 17.8&amp;nbsp;cm) panels for sketching,{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=25}}{{sfnb|Thomson|1917a}} smaller than those he normally painted on and requiring tighter handling.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|pp=141–42}} Fragments of brand names (e.g. Gold Medal Purity Flour, California Oranges) are stamped on the back of some,{{sfnb|Murray|1994|p=7}} such as ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Birches Spring 1917.jpg|Birches]]'' and ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Ice Covered Lake.jpg|An Ice Covered Lake]]''.{{sfnb|Murray|1998|p=85}} During the same spring he reused around one-third of his sketches, either because he was not satisfied with them or because he was short on painting materials.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=116}}

In 2000, a study was conducted to understand the materials and working method of Thomson.{{sfnb|Corbeil|Moffatt|Sirois|Legate|2000}} In 2002–03, before a travelling exhibition organized by the National Gallery of Canada and the Art Gallery of Ontario, the [[Canadian Conservation Institute]] utilized [[Infrared photography|infrared]] and X-ray photography, [[spectroscopy]] and micro-sampling of pigments to further analyze many of Thomson's paintings.{{sfnb|Webster-Cook|Ruggles|2002|p=145}} Sandra Webster-Cook and Anne Ruggles described in their research how Thomson applied differently coloured [[Primer (paint)|primers]] in various parts of his paintings to give them subtle yet important qualities.{{sfnb|Webster-Cook|Ruggles|2002|pp=145–46}}

===Photography===

Probably a view of the mill-yard of the abandoned Gilmour Lumber Company at [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]]. The man seated on the stump is thought to be Tom Wattie, an [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]] ranger.]]

Thomson occasionally used photography to capture things that gained his interest, such as fish he caught, images of his friends or the landscape. He does not seem to have used any of his photographs for producing art, with none of the extant photos corresponding to any of his paintings.{{sfnb|Reid|1971}} He instead preferred to capture images with small oil sketches, and nearly all of the works he produced are among these small sketches.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=215}} David Silcox however has speculated that ''[[Drowned Land]]'' (and perhaps other paintings) may have been painted with a photograph as a memory aid given their "uncanny precision."{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#photography 63]}}{{efn|group=note|For more regarding Thomson's photographs, refer to {{bulleted list|{{harvp|Addison|Harwood|1969}}|{{harvp|Reid|1971}}|{{harvp|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues#photography 62–63]}}|{{harvp|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=214–15}}}}}}

In 1912 while travelling up the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] in the [[Mississagi Provincial Park|Mississagi]] area with William Broadhead, Thomson lost at least a dozen rolls of film (claiming in a letter that he lost 14 dozen) along with many more sketches after their canoe experienced several spills.{{sfnb|Thomson|1912}}{{sfnb|Murray|2002a|p=297}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#gathering-momentum 15]}} He had intended to bring the images back to Grip Limited and use them in his commercial work.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=215}}

[[Tom Thomson]]'s first foray into art came in 1901 with his education at Canada Business College in [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham, Ontario]]. It was there that he developed rudimentary penmanship abilities.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}} By 1902, he had been hired in [[Seattle]] at the design firm Maring &amp; Ladd, working as a pen artist, [[Drafter|draftsman]] and [[Etching|etcher]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}} His main work there consisted in producing business cards, brochures and posters, as well as [[CMYK color model|three-colour printing]].{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}} Having previously learned [[calligraphy]], he specialized in lettering, drawing and painting.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}} Thomson may have also worked as a freelance commercial designer, but there are no extant examples of such work to confirm these suspicions.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=51}} He was greatly influenced by the black and white illustrations he saw in magazines,{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|pp=47–63}} something especially apparent in his {{circa|lk=no|1903}} sketch, ''Study of a Woman's Head'', which draws inspiration from the "[[Gibson Girl]]" of American illustrator [[Charles Dana Gibson]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#diverse-influences 68]}} Thomson's younger brother Ralph wrote about Thomson during this period:

{{quote|[I had] a wonderful opportunity to observe his progress as a commercial artist and designer. He very often worked all night long while I watched him try one idea after another. The ones that did not meet with his approval he would either throw in the waste basket, burn up or smear with cigar ashes or the ends of burned matches. Others he would keep for a day or two but they would invariably meet the same fate. At that time he worked in pen and ink, water color and black and white wash. He was continually looking over the various magazines and giving the advertisements a great deal of study, principally from the standpoint of decoration. It was a regular game with him to pick the best of them, change the entire design to suit his own ideas, and then compare their respective merits.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=51}}{{sfnb|Thomson|1946}}}}

After returning to Toronto, Thomson joined the artistic design firm [[Grip Ltd.]] in either 1908 or 1909.{{efn|group=note|Sources disagree on the approximate time of Thomson being hired. Grip supervisor Albert H. Robson wrote in 1932 that he was hired in 1907,{{sfnb|Robson|1932|p=138}} but by 1937 Robson was instead writing that he was hired in 1908.{{sfnb|Robson|1937|p=5}} Robert Stacey has suggested December 1908.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}} David Silcox has suggested the beginning of 1909.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 9]}} Art historian [[Joan Murray (art historian)|Joan Murray]] has suggested December 1908 or January 1909.{{sfnb|Murray|2002b|p=310}} In curator Charles Hill's investigation, he noted that Thomson is listed in the ''Toronto City Directory'' for 1906–09 as working with Legg Bros. Photo Engravers, in 1910 merely as an artist living at 99 Gerrard E., and in 1911 as being at Grip Ltd. Hill supposes that this means Thomson likely began at Grip in late 1909, after the information for the 1910 directory was collected.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|loc=p. 113 n. 16}}}} The firm specialized in design and lettering work.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 9]}} Grip was the leading graphic design company in the country and introduced [[Art Nouveau]], [[Steel engraving|metal engraving]] and the [[CMYK color model|four-colour process]] to Canada.{{sfnb|King|2010|p=14}} Albert Robson, then the art director at Grip, recalled that when he first hired Thomson, "his samples consisted mostly of lettering and decorative designs applied to booklet covers and some labels."{{sfnb|Robson|1932|p=138}}{{sfnb|Rossell|c. 1951|p=3}}

[[File:Tom Thomson Advertising or Calendar drawing.jpg|thumb|''Advertising or calendar drawing'', Fall-winter 1912. Location unknown]]

The techniques he learned regarding Art Nouveau became apparent in many of his later works,{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=94, 210}}{{sfnb|Reid|2002|pp=65–83}} including paintings like ''Northern River''; ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Decorative Landscape, Birches.jpg|Decorative Landscape, Birches]]''; ''Spring Ice'' and ''The West Wind''.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=59–60}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#diverse-influences 68], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#commercial-art 71]}} Of particular note are the sinuous forms typical within the art style,{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/the-west-wind 47], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#commercial-art 71]}} seen in the "S-curves" of the trees which have their origins in Thomson's work as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]].{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=60}} Fellow artist [[A. Y. Jackson]] affirmed the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]'s tendency towards using Art Nouveau styles within their work, writing that, "We (the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson) treated our subjects with the freedom of designers. We tried to emphasize colour, line and pattern."{{sfnb|McKay|2011|p=185}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#commercial-art 71]}}

The senior artist at Grip, [[J. E. H. MacDonald]], encouraged his staff to paint outside in their spare time to better hone their skills.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=58}}{{sfnb|Rossell|c. 1951|p=1}} MacDonald had perhaps the largest influence on Thomson's career as a painter; he enticed Thomson away from the commercial field and brought him towards painting through not only the encouraged weekend outdoor sketching, but through painting trips on holidays and introducing him to his fellow artists.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=117}} MacDonald himself credited William Broadhead with Thomson's emergence as a painter, writing in a letter to [[Arthur Lismer]] that "My memories in connection with Tom seem to begin with B[roadhead]."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}} In a draft of an article, [[Harold Mortimer-Lamb]] similarly credited Broadhead with Thomson's emergence.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}{{sfnb|Mortimer-Lamb|1919}} Lismer took exception to their claims, instead crediting MacDonald.{{sfnb|Lismer|1919}} A. Y. Jackson also expressed that Thomson's major development came after his ventures to Algonquin Park, rather than his time as a graphic designer.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}{{sfnb|Jackson|1924}}{{sfnb|Jackson|1933}} Lismer later wrote, {{quote|[J. E. H.] MacDonald was the most important influence on Tom Thomson at this stage. These young artists (MacDonald, [[Frank Johnston (artist)|Frank Johnston]], Tom McLean, Frederick Varley, Franklin Carmichael and Lismer) worked hard all week and sketched on Saturdays and Sundays. On Monday it was MacDonald in his corner seat who gave his opinion on sketches and offered philosophical encouragement. He was already recognized as a Canadian artist. Thomson in 1911 had not tried his hand at sketching out of doors. Perhaps it was that hitherto he did not feel he could do anything with the medium of oil painting, or... he was not ready to emerge. It was in the summer and fall 1911 that Thomson first emerged as a sketcher. His first efforts were primitive. They had a child[-like] quality, but like a child's work, with good quality and character. It was in the country around Toronto, on the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]], in the bush near [[York Mills]] and on excursions into the country around [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]] and [[Lake Scugog|L&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;ake&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Scugog]] where he and others went fishing that Thomson first painted.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=115}}{{sfnb|Lismer|c. 1942}}}}

[[File:Thomson, Drowned Land.jpg|thumb|''[[Drowned Land]]'', Fall 1912. [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], [[Toronto]]]]

It was in 1912 that Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his original style of painting became apparent.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 10]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=23}} This transition appears to have been instigated by his first visit to [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]] in May 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{plainlist|

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acquired his first sketching equipment,{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}} but spent most of his trip fishing,{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|pp=25–26}} save for "a few notes, skylines and colour effects."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}{{sfnb|Jackson|1931}} Dating sketches to this trip has sometimes proved difficult.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}} One exception is the sketch ''Smoke Lake, Algonquin Park'', easily dated because Thomson gave it to Bud Callighen around the time of their first meeting.{{sfnb|Northway|1970|p=6}}{{sfnb|Addison|1974|p=75}}{{sfnb|Davies|1935|pp=35–36}} Charles Hill has also included the "somewhat awkward" ''Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park'' as likely being made during the trip.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}} Robson identified ''Drowned Land'' as being painted on the Mississagi Forest Reserve canoe trip.{{sfnb|Robson|1937|p=6}} Also dated to this time are ''The Canoe'' and ''A Northern Lake'' (1912).{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In fall 1912 Thomson left Grip Ltd. to join another design firm, Rous &amp; Mann.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=58}}{{sfnb|Klages|2016|p=23}} Leonard Rossell went on to write, "Those who worked there were all allowed time off to pursue their studies... Tom Thomson, so far as a I know, never took definite lessons from anyone, yet he progressed quicker than any of us. But what he did was probably of more advantage to him. He took several months off in the summer and spent them in Algonquin Park."{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=57–58}}{{sfnb|Rossell|c. 1951|p=3}}

In October 1912 Thomson was first introduced to Dr. [[James MacCallum]], a frequent visitor of the [[Ontario Society of Artists]]' (OSA) exhibitions and [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}}{{sfnb|MacCallum|1918|p=375}} MacCallum convinced Thomson to leave his position at Rous and Mann and commit to a career in painting.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}} [[Lawren Harris]] later recalled Thomson's major developments around this time:

{{quote|Thomson began to develop. His work commenced to emerge into the clear Canadian daylight. His work had been tight and sombre, almost a grey monotone in colour. [[A. Y. Jackson|&lt;nowiki&gt;[A. Y.]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Jackson]]'s sparkling, vibrant, rich colour opened his eyes, as it did the eyes of the rest of us, and Tom saw the Canadian landscape as he had never seen it before. It amounted to a revelation. From then on nothing could hold him.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=212}}{{sfnb|Harris|1964}}{{Page needed|date=July 2018}}}}

MacCallum offered to cover Thomson's expenses for a year on the promise that he fully commited himself to painting,{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=21}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 11]}} an offer Thomson eventually accepted after some initial hesitance.{{sfnb|Jackson|1933}} MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their "truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places." He further wrote that Thomson's paintings were "dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects."{{sfnb|MacCallum|1918|p=376}}

[[File:Tom Thomson Birches.jpg|thumb|''Birches'', Fall 1913. [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]], [[University of Toronto]], Toronto]]

Thomson's ventures to the wilderness of Ontario were major sources of inspiration in his art, writing in a letter to MacCallum that the beauty of Algonquin Park was indescribable.{{sfnb|Thomson|1914}} His early works, such as ''Northern Lake'' (1912–13) and ''Evening'' were not outstanding technically, yet they illustrate a particular talent for composition and colour handling.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#thomsons-early-paintings 11]}} The sale of the former to the [[Government of Ontario|Ontario Government]] in March 1913 for $250 ({{Inflation|CA|250|1914|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=[[Canadian Dollar|CAD$]]}}) allowed him to spend more time in the summer and fall of 1913 sketching.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#painting-full-time 12]}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=60}} MacCallum described the painting as a "picture [of] one of the small northern lakes swept by a north west wind; a squall just passing from the far shore, the water crisp, sparkingly blue &amp; broken into short, white-caps—a picture full of light, life and vigour."{{sfnb|MacCallum|1918|p=376}} Thomson's sketches from 1913 are often grey, but display greater colour handling than that seen in the earlier sketch of ''Northern Lake''.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#thomsons-early-paintings 11]}} Most of these sketches are simple with a far off shore.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=123}} Canvases like ''Morning Cloud'' and ''Moonlight'' use broken brushwork, a technique he likely learned from MacDonald and Jackson.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=123}}

====Colour and experimentation (1914–15)====

{{See also|Northern River (painting)|Spring Ice}}

[[File:Tom Thomson The Tent.jpg|thumb|''The Tent'', November 1915. McMichael Canadian Art Collection]]

Thomson often experienced self-doubt, with A. Y. Jackson recalling that in the fall of 1914, Thomson threw his sketch box into the woods out of frustration,{{sfnb|Davies|1935|pp=74–75}}{{sfnb|Jackson|1958|p=31}} and was "so shy he could hardly be induced to show his sketches."{{sfnb|Jackson|1917}} While his work from this period still displays "a certain awkwardness," Thomson surpassed his colleagues Jackson and Lismer in his brilliance of colour.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=127}} In a letter to MacCallum, Jackson wrote,

{{quote|Tom seems quite enthusiastic and I expect is quite an inspiring man to work with. You need a man with you who tries to do the impossible. To do what you know is easily within your powers never has given rise to a great school of art or anything else.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=34}}}}

The sketches produced in 1915 display his increasing tendency towards experimentation and his sensitivity to colour,{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=133}} experimenting with texture and colour in ways that his earlier subdued and precise work had avoided.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=127}} Beyond his work as a colourist, he developed a technique of presenting contradictory ideas that were simultaneously resolved within the same image. Typically he accomplished this by using the techniques of both [[Tonalism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]], later achieving it by joining decorative patterns with bold handling.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=70}} Jackson wrote regarding this period of Thomson's work, "No longer handicapped by literal representation, he was transposing, eliminating, designing, experimenting, finding happy colour motives amid tangle and confusion and [reveling] in paint. The amount of work he did was incredible."{{sfnb|Jackson|1919}}

Over the 1915–16 winter in Toronto, Thomson produced several canvases, including ''In the Northland''; ''The Birch Grove, Autumn''; ''Autumn's Garland''; ''Opulent October'' and ''Spring Ice''. The sketches of his work display a two-dimensionality. Thomson's work from this period—like the works of Harris, Lismer and MacDonald—became more decorative. The colour is heightened, with spaces flattened and forms arranged into vertical bands. The branches and trunks of trees are more stylized in nature.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=135}}

In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the large number of snow studies he produced at this time.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=137}} He produced many sketches which varied in composition, though they all had vivid colour and were applied thickly.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#at-full-speed 16]}} Over the following winter, encouragement from Harris, MacDonald and MacCallum saw Thomson move into the most productive portion of his career,{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=20}} writing in a letter that he "got quite a lot done."{{sfnb|Thomson|1917b}} It was during this time that he produced many of what became his most famous works, including ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]''.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#at-full-speed 17]}}

In the last two years of his life especially, Thomson was particularly skilled in observing atmospheric phenomena, such as temperature, humidity, wind and light.{{sfnb|Silcox|2018|p=181}} Work from this period—such as ''The Rapids''—demonstrate his adeptness at controlling colour and are painted with a particular "crispness and freshness."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=141}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#final-spring 17]}} Other paintings—such as ''Path Behind Mowat Lodge'' and ''Tea Lake Dam''—illustrate his bold and expressive brushstrokes.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#final-spring 17–18]}} The scale of Thomson's later canvases foreshadow the Algoma canvases the members of the Group of Seven painted after the war.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=139}} [[Art history|Art historians]] David Silcox and [[Harold Town]] have described this period of Thomson's art as moving in the direction of [[abstract art|abstraction]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#final-spring 17–18], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/cranberry-marsh 44], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/after-the-storm 52], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#the-group-of-seven 57], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#the-canadian-documentary-tradition 62], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#diverse-influences 68], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#an-idiosyncratic-palette 73]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=148}}{{efn|group=note|For more regarding Thomson's later abstract tendencies, refer to: {{bulleted list|{{harvp|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/cranberry-marsh 43–44]}}|{{harvp|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=148–49}}|{{section link|Artistic development of Tom Thomson#Approaching abstraction}}}}}}

===Approaching abstraction===
{{Quote box|width=20em|align=right|quote="At the time of his death a perturbed Thomson was poised at the crevasse between [[figurative art|figurative]] and [[abstract art|non-figurative art]]. Whether he would have survived the jump is a matter of conjecture; that he would have jumped is, to me at least, a certainty."|source=—[[Harold Town]]{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/after-the-storm 51]}}}}

Thomson was prolific in the number of sketches he produced—over four hundred across his entire career—providing an opportunity to observe the trends and progression of his style. Starting as a landscape painter, he drew away from typical landscape convention and began to experiment with more excited brushstrokes, clashing paint and more vibrant colours.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/cranberry-marsh 43]}} For artist and Thomson biographer Harold Town, the brevity of Thomson's career hinted at an artistic evolution never fully realized. He cites the 1916 oil painting ''Unfinished Sketch'' as "the first completely abstract work in Canadian art," a painting that, whether or not it was intended as a purely non-objective work, presages the innovations of [[abstract expressionism]].{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=148–49}} Town describes the contents of the painting as being a sky that expresses the frustration Thompson must have experienced in adding paint to the small areas between trees, rocks and thickets.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=148}} He similarly describes ''Late Autumn'' as being another "impatient study" that led to abstract experiment. Of particular importance are the areas between the branches, which are "brusquely smacked into place," as well as a similar foreground to that of ''Unfinished Sketch''.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=148}}

[[File:Thomson Unfinished Sketch.jpg|thumb|''Unfinished Sketch'', Fall 1916. Private collection{{efn|group=note|The painting is on the reverse of ''Algonquin Hillside, Snow''.}}]]
David Silcox has pointed to ''Cranberry Marsh'' as indicating Thomson's move towards abstraction.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/cranberry-marsh 43–44], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#diverse-influences 68]}} He has also viewed ''After the Storm'', likely one of Thomson's last paintings, as an indication that Thomson was already responding to the changes happening in Western art, even if he didn't exactly know where it would lead.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/after-the-storm 51–52]}} Examining the painting more closely, the landscape itself dissolves into bare strokes and pure abstraction.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/after-the-storm 52]}}

[[Art history|Art historian]] [[Joan Murray (art historian)|Joan Murray]] has expressed reluctance to describe Thomson's sketches as "abstract," given that some of them may have likely been intended as "colour notes for use in the studio," and because some of the sketches were unfinished.{{sfnb|Murray|2015|loc="From the Studio Building to Algonquin Park and Home Again"}}

'''''By the Seashore''''' is a painting by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] completed in 1883 and now housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].

== History ==
Renoir made a trip to [[Italy]] in 1881-82 and was deeply influenced by [[Renaissance art]]. After this trip he began to explore a new manner of painting, different from [[impressionism]]. He started to emphasize contours and modeling, abandoned the principle that scenes should be painted outdoors to capture light and atmosphere.

Late in the summer of 1883, Renoir spent about a month in [[St. Peter Port]], the capital of [[Guernsey]], and admired the rocks, cliffs and stunning view of [[Moulin Huet Bay]] in [[St Martin's, Guernsey|St. Martin]]. He painted the starts of fifteen pictures during his stay, most of which were finished later in his [[Paris]] studio. Guernsey lies 48&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of mainland Normandy. Both share the same geology and Guernsey fulfills the "by the sea" criterion in the exhibition title.

However, ''By the Seashore'' is thought to have been painted in the artist's studio. The beach depicted here is probably not in the Channel Islands but near Dieppe, on the Normandy coast. The model was [[Aline Charigot]], his then girlfriend, whom he married in 1890. The arc of the sitter's dark eyebrows and saucily tilted nose in that pleasant, rosy-cheeked face are common to works by Renoir.

==Provenance==
The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan since 1929 from the bequest of Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer.

Many elements of '''Caribbean folklore''' (the orally transmitted beliefs, myths, tales, and practices of a group of people) are African in origin, given that [[Slavery|slaves]] brought from Africa's [[West Africa|West (or Gold) Coast]] made up a large majority of those brought to the region.

==Characters==

Very popular in terms of Caribbean [[story-telling]], and a direct transfer from West Africa to the Caribbean are the Anancy Stories (Nancy Stories) told throughout the region.  [[Anansi|Ananse]] is the [[Ashanti language|Ashanti]] word for spider, and the trickster Anancy (also known as Ananci, Ananse, Anansi, Ananci Krokoko, and Brer Nancy), with his quick-witted intelligence and his knack for surviving the odds, often through trickery, is the most popular of this genre of African-Caribbean [[Folklore|folk-tale]] characters, although there are other West African influences, in folk story characters, including the hare (chief character in the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] folktales) and the tortoise, which features in the stories of the [[Igbo people|Ibo]] people.

In addition to these stories, African religious figures also comprise a significant part of Caribbean folklore, many of the supernatural folklore figures possessing characteristics which are identical with those of African deities, and include:

"[[Papa Bois]]", who appears in many different forms, sometimes as a deer, or in old ragged clothes, sometimes hairy and though very old, extremely strong and muscular, with cloven hoofs and leaves growing out of his beard. As the guardian of the animals and the custodian of the trees, he is known to sound a cow's horn to warn his friends of the approach of hunters. He doesn't tolerate killing for killing's sake, and the wanton destruction of the forest.

"[[La Diablesse]]", the devil woman, is sometimes personified as an old crone, who steps forth with her cloven hoof from behind a tree on a lonely road, the sound of chains mingling with the rustle of her petticoat. Sometimes she takes the form of a beautiful woman, to lure some unsuspecting passerby to his death or perhaps to madness. Although she may appear young, she will be dressed in the ancient costume of these islands: a brilliant madras turban, chemise with half sleeves and much embroidery and lace, ''zepingue tremblant'' ("trembling pins of gold"), and all the finery of the by-gone days. Even when she appears beautiful, there is something that betrays her - she often has one hoof and a normal human foot or two hooves which she uses her long, flowing gown to hide.

"[[Mama Dlo]]" or "Mama Dglo" (known in West Africa today as [[Mami Wata|Mammy Wata]]) whose name is derived from the French "maman de l'eau" which means "mother of the water" is akin to the [[mermaid]] figure of European folklore and represents West African water spirits and there is a spirit called a cocoya who feasts on children then eats them up - they also can change into different shapes.

The "[[Soucouyant]]", whose French-derived names comes from the word "to suck", is personified by a woman, often old, who sheds her skin at night and flies through the skies, sometimes as a ball of flame, to suck blood from her victims.

The "[[Lagahoo|Ligahoo]]" or "Loup Garou" is a shape changer, a man who has power over nature and the capacity to change form to that of an animal. Or in Caribbean Myths the Loup-Garou is a man who made a deal with the devil, to have the ability to change form (to a werewolf) so that at night he could go around to kill without ever being caught.

Some contemporary Caribbean writers explore Afro-Caribbean folklore themes in their novels, including [[Nalo Hopkinson]], [[Wayne Gerard Trotman]] and [[Marie-Elena John]].

'''Carlo Pittara''' (1836, [[Turin]] - 25 October 1891, [[Rivara]]) was an Italian painter who specialized in animals, pastoral landscapes, rivers and peasants at work. He was also the leader of what came to be known as the {{ill|Scuola di Rivara|it}}. 

==Biography==
He began his studies at the [[Accademia Albertina]], where he worked with the landscape painter [[Giuseppe Camino]]. In 1856, he moved to [[Geneva]] and studied with Charles Humbert (1813–1881), who specialized in animal paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/rivaraonline/Scuola_di_Rivara/Pittara.htm Brief biography] @ Rivara Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1858 to 1860, he lived in Paris, where he became familiar with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] and [[Charles Jacque]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-pittara/ Biographical notes] @ [[Treccani]].&lt;/ref&gt; He also came under the influence of the [[Barbizon school]]. After that, he spent three years in Rome. Later, he became the leader of a group of landscape painters who met during the summers near 
Rivara, in the [[Canavese]] to paint "[[Plein aire|en plein aire]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnam.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/354/carlo-pittara Biographical notes] @ the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna.&lt;/ref&gt; This group consisted of artists who worked in both the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Realism (art)|Realistic]] styles, including [[Ernesto Bertea]], [[Alberto Issel]], [[Serafín Avendaño]], [[Ernesto Rayper]] and [[Federigo Pastoris]]: referred to as the "Scuola di Rivara". Some were also members of a group known as the "{{ill|Scuola grigia|it}}", centered in [[Liguria]].

During the last ten years of his life, he spent the winters in Paris, where his work began to take on [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] overtones. After his death, [[Telemaco Signorini]] questioned his role in establishing the Scuola di Rivara, suggesting that Rayper was actually the focus of the group's inspiration.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Pittara was, in fact, largely forgotten until 1947, when the "Galleria Fogliato" in Turin presented 88 of his canvases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">A '''chain of title''' is the sequence of historical transfers of [[title (property)|title]] to a [[property]]. It is a valuable tool to identify and document past owners of a property and serves as a property’s historical ownership timeline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envirositecorp.com/products/environmental-property-assessment-data/chain-of-title-report/ Chain of Title Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The "chain" runs from the present owner back to the original owner of the property. In situations where documentation of ownership is important, it is often necessary to reconstruct the chain of title. To facilitate this, a record of title documents may be maintained by a registry office or [[civil law notary]].

==Chain of title for real property==

[[Real estate]] is one field where the chain of title has considerable significance. Various registration systems, such as the [[Torrens title]] system, have been developed to track the ownership of individual pieces of [[real property]]. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue [[title insurance]] based upon the chain of title to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records.  In other cases, the chain of title is established by an [[abstract of title]], sometimes, although not always, certified by an [[Lawyer|attorney]].  In the United States, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish chain of title, despite the fact that clear chain of title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed.  Widespread lack of clarity in chain of title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, [[Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems]] (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments.&lt;ref&gt;"Mortgage Electronic Registration System (MERS)."  Times Topics.

Harper's Magazine, January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  US states have objected and even sued over this practice.&lt;ref&gt;"Massachusetts attorney general sues big banks over foreclosure practices." Washington Post, 10 December 2011. https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/massachusetts-attorney-general-sues-big-banks-over-foreclosure-practices/2011/12/01/gIQAgwnUIO_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chain of title for copyrights, trademarks, and rights of publicity ==

In the [[film|motion picture]] industry, the '''chain of title''' involves the series of documentation which establishes proprietary rights in a [[film]]. The chain also applies to compilations in other fields, where many people have contributed to the project, thus acquiring authorship rights, or where materials were culled from many sources. Chain of title is extremely important to film purchasers and to film distributors, as it establishes the veracity of the owner's proprietary rights (or rights under [[license]]) in the [[intellectual property]] in a film, book or encyclopedia.

Chain of title documentation can include:

* [[copyright]] clearances on [[music]] from the regional [[collecting society]], and to a less common extent, footage of other films;
* [[trademark]] clearances;
* [[artist|talent]] agreements, which should incorporate a [[legal release]] from the talent, be they [[actor]]s (including crowds), [[film director|director]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[choreographer]]s, or others, to use their works, images, likeness and other [[personality rights]] in the film;
* proof of errors and omission [[insurance]] (a special form of insurance for motion picture producers which covers omissions in obtaining adequate chain of title).

Specialist organizations engage in the production of copyright property reports for motion picture studios, which cover original or unexploited works, and include the results of [[United States Copyright Office]] screening searches, author claimant searches, registration renewal searches and assignment searches. This involves reviewing US Copyright Office records from 1870 to present and numerous trade publications and databases, and Library of Congress records.

'''The [[coat of arms]] of [[Aruba]]''' was originally designed in [[Amsterdam]] in 1955. Since then it has been in use as the national symbol of Aruba. The symbol has seven main elements:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitaruba.com/facts/general/coatofarms.html "Aruba Facts - General Knowledge - Coat of Arms"&lt;/ref&gt;  

* The [[lion (heraldry)|lion]] [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] symbolizes power and generosity.

'''''Descent Into Hell''''' is a novel written by [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], first published in 1937.

==Overview==
Williams is less well known than his fellow [[Inklings]], such as [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Like some of them, however, he wrote a series of novels which combine elements of [[fantasy fiction]] and Christian symbolism.  Forgoing the [[detective fiction]] style of most of his earlier [[supernatural fiction|supernatural novels]], most of the story's action is spiritual or psychological in nature. It fits the "theological thriller" description sometimes given to his works. For this reason ''Descent'' was initially rejected by publishers, though [[T. S. Eliot]]'s publishing house [[Faber and Faber]] would eventually pick up the novel, as Eliot admired Williams's work, and, though he did not like ''Descent Into Hell'' as well as the earlier novels, desired to see it  printed.

==Allusions==
There are several prominent literary allusions running throughout ''Descent Into Hell''.
Battle Hill's resident poet, Peter Stanhope, frequently quotes and references [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''.

[[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s work ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' is also referenced repeatedly, regarding the appearance of a [[doppelgänger]].

Less obvious Biblical allusions are present, as well as several references to mythology and legend, including [[Lilith]], [[Samael]], and [[succubus|succubi]].

==Summary==
The action takes place in Battle Hill, outside London,{{sfn|Hadfield|1987|p=141|ps=: C.W. may have had the town of [[St Albans]] in mind}} amidst the townspeople's staging of a new play by Peter Stanhope.  The hill seems to reside at the crux of time, as characters from the past appear, and perhaps at a doorway to the beyond, as characters are alternately summoned heavenwards or descend into hell.

Pauline Anstruther, the heroine of the novel, lives in fear of meeting her own [[doppelgänger]], which has appeared to her throughout her life.  But Stanhope, in an action central to the author's own theology, takes the burden of her fears upon himself—Williams called this The Doctrine of Substituted Love—and enables Pauline, at long last, to face her true self.  Williams drew this idea from the biblical verse, "Ye shall bear one another's burdens"&lt;ref&gt;[[Galatians 6#Verse 2|Galatians 6:2]], [[King James Version|Authorised Version]]&lt;/ref&gt;

And so Stanhope does take the weight, with no surreptitious motive, in the most affecting scene in the novel.  And Pauline, liberated, is able to accept truth.

On the other hand, Lawrence Wentworth, a local historian, finding his desire for Adela Hunt to be unrequited, falls in love instead with a spirit form of Adela, which seems to represent a kind of extreme self-love on his part. As he isolates himself more and more with this insubstantial figure, and dreams of descending a silver rope into a dark pit, Wentworth begins the descent into Hell.

'''El Morro del Tulcán''' (lit. Tulcán Hill) is an [[Indigenous peoples of South America|Indian]] [[pyramid]] in [[Popayán|Popayán, Colombia]]. The pyramid dates to at least 1535, as the [[Spanish Empire]] found it abandoned when they arrived in that year.&lt;ref name="mundoandino.com"&gt;[http://www.mundoandino.com/Colombia/Popayan Popayan culture and attractions. Popayan travel and tours. Popayan Hotels, youth hostels, lodging, nightlife&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the individuals buried there came from the very top of the social classes of their society.&lt;ref name="mundoandino.com"/&gt;

The pyramid was constructed in the pre-Columbian period, approximately between 1600 - 500 BC; the period which is now known as "the Delayed Cacicales Societies". On this pyramid a statue dedicated to the [[Conquistador]] [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]] exists today; he carried out the Spanish foundation of Popayán. The location of the statue of the Conquistador on an indigenous monument is controversial.

El Morro del Tulcán is the main archaeological site of Popayán.

'''Electric-Techno Neon Gods''' ({{zh|c=電音三太子|p=Diànyīn Sāntàizi|poj=Tiān-im Sam-thài-chú}}), '''sam thai tsu''' ({{zh|c=三太子|p=Sāntàizi|poj=Sam-thài-chú}}), or '''[[Techno]] Prince [[Nezha]]''' is a [[subcultural]] dance performance which combines a traditional [[Taiwan]] folk dance performance ({{zh|t=陣頭|p=zhèntóu|poj=tīn-thâu}}) with modern pop music.

There are two theories about the origin of the Electric-Techno Neon Gods. One says it is from [[Beigang]] Township, [[Yunlin]] County, Taiwan; while the other one says it started from [[Puzi]] City, [[Chiayi]] County, Taiwan. According to reliable sources,{{Who|date=January 2014}} some people dressed up as bodyguards of the gods ({{zh|c=大仙尪仔|poj=tōa-sian ang-á}}) and performed similar dances during religious parades at local temples. As many of the dancers were young people who enjoyed going [[clubbing (subculture)|clubbing]], they began combining the traditional dances with [[electronic music]]. Later on, professional dance teams specializing in Electric-Techno Neon Gods dancing were formed. The costumes worn by dancers are based on traditional outfits with trendy elements added to them, such as oversized sunglasses and LED lights. White gloves are commonly worn as in Taiwan it is popular to wear gloves while dancing.

Apart from being performed during religious rituals, Electric-Techno Neon Gods dances now often take place during many secular events in Taiwan. Such dances were performed during the opening ceremonies of the [[World Games 2009]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=EGods on Scooters|url=http://poeticborg.wordpress.com/tag/world-games/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104031036/http://poeticborg.wordpress.com/tag/world-games/|archivedate=4 January 2014|publisher=Poeticborg.wordpress.com|date=17 July 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[2009 Summer Deaflympics]], [[Expo 2010 Shanghai China]], the 2010 Taipei International Flora Exposition, and other international activities and exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{citation|title='Electric Techno Neon God' debut in Fuzhou|url=http://fuzhou.chinadaily.com.cn/e/2011-12/02/content_14201677.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102235808/http://fuzhou.chinadaily.com.cn/e/2011-12/02/content_14201677.htm|archivedate=2 January 2014|newspaper=[[China Daily]]|date=2 December 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.''- Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – pp. 9, 360, 391-393, 396-398, 400, 401, 405, 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Elena Gorokhova was born February 19, 1933 in Leningrad. In 1951 she graduated from [[Leningrad Secondary Art School|Secondary Art School]] under the Academy of Arts and joined the painting department of the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named after Ilya Repin]]. She studied with [[Vladimir Gorb]] and [[Semion Abugov]].&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' Saint Petersburg, NP-Print Edition, 2007. P.360.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Gorokhova graduated from the Leningrad Institute in [[Joseph Serebriany]]'s personal art studio. Her graduation work was a painting named ''An Alarm Bell''.&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. Saint Petersburg, Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. P.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elena Gorokhova has participated in art exhibitions since 1958. She paints genre and decorative compositions, landscapes, and still lifes. She works in the technique of oil painting, tempera painting, and watercolors. She has been a member of [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]] since 1960 (before 1992 it was the [[Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation]]) .&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of members of the Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation''. Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1987. P.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes and characters of Gorokhova's works often inspired motifs of folklore scenes of Russian folk tales and legends. Her images are filled with allegory and symbolism. She prefers decorative painting with a clear silhouette, local color, [[Symbolism (art)|symbolic composition]], while maintaining constructive role of drawing. The color is decorative and "flat", often with a predominance of cool green and blue tones that permeate and unite scenic fabric and amplifying fantastic, sometimes mystical sound of painting.

Among Elena Gorokhova's major art works are the following paintings: ''"Girlfriends"'' (1958),&lt;ref&gt;''Осенняя выставка произведений ленинградских художников 1958 года. Каталог''.

'''Gibraltar Photographic Society''' was established in January 1965 in Gibraltar. The object of the Society is to raise the standards of photography by organising meetings, lectures, excursions, competitions; encouraging beginners and advanced alike by&amp;nbsp;the exchange of ideas and to affiliate with foreign clubs and societies. All classes of&amp;nbsp;photography shall be included.

== Photography in Gibraltar before the formation of the GPS ==
In 1940 a camera club was formed by a group of Gibraltarians who held their meetings at the now defunct Calpe Institute. This club was never firmly established and more often than not it was closed due to lack of support from both local photographers and those from the Services. The problem was very likely due to the fact that no photographer in Gibraltar had the experience of organising and running successfully a club of this nature.

In 1960, after having run for some months with a very small membership, the club closed, never to re-open. Its assets, about £30, were placed in a suspended account and held by the Committee of the Calpe Institute. Any hopes of re-forming the club were dashed by the closing of the Calpe Institute itself.

During most of this time, the United Services Camera Club based at the Command Education Centre, ran successfully under various names, though with a small membership. The Club was not open to local civilians. This Club was closed in July 1964 by the Command Education Officer as a result of poor administration in the Club’s affairs, and re-opened in October 1964.

=== Formation of the Gibraltar Photographic Society ===
In October 1964, a Sergeant K Lloyd of the Middlesex Regiment and member of the United Services Camera Club, and local photographer Mr Albert Pizzarello put on an exhibition at the John Mackintosh Hall with a view of generating interest in the formation of a Service/civilian club. The venture proved successful and that same month a meeting was held at the John Mackintosh Hall with the aim of forming a camera club which would be open to everyone in Gibraltar, including servicemen and UK based civilians. The club was to be called The John Mackintosh Hall Camera Club, and would incorporate the United Services Camera Club. A caretaker Committee was formed and a provisional programme arranged.

In January 1965, the first Annual General Meeting took place and the following officers appointed :

Chairman :&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Wing Commander P A Rumbold Scott, RAF

Secretary &amp; A/Chairman&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A A Hammon, Esq

Treasurer &amp; A/Secretary&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Staff Sergeant C P Berry, RAOC

Syllabus Secretary&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A J Pizzarello, Esq

House Member&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A Perera, Esq

Committee Members &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - T Adamberry, Esq

- M M Bonilla, Esq

- Sgt K Lloyd was co-opted to the Committee.

The Chairman due to his appointment as Senior Air Staff Officer, RAF North Front, was frequently away from Gibraltar and so his duties were in the main carried out by Mr Hammon. As a result, S/Sgt Berry usually carried out the task of Secretary as well as that of Treasurer. Lectures, initial organisation and instruction were generally carried out by Messrs Berry and Pizzarello.

Later that year the Committee decided to change the name of the Club to that of The Gibraltar Photographic Society. An application for affiliation to The Photographic Alliance of Great Britain was accepted. The aims of the Society were as follows :

(a) To stimulate and promote amateur photographic activity within Gibraltar

(b) To provide a congenial club atmosphere where enthusiasts can meet others similarly inclined.

(c) To instruct, guide and assist novices in basic theoretical and practical&amp;nbsp;photographic work

(d) To cater for the intermediate and advanced amateur photographer by means of lectures, demonstrations,                               visual aids, instruction and discussion

(e) To work in close liaison with the Photographic Alliance of Great Britain, to &amp;nbsp; promote the advancement of, and                         maintain a high standard of amateur&amp;nbsp;photography in Gibraltar.

Subscriptions were set at 5 shillings (25p) a month for full members and 2 shillings and 6 pence (12½p) for those under the age of 18. Meetings were held on Wednesdays at fortnightly intervals, with a short recess during the Summer. Several local professional photographers were elected to Honorary Membership, and Lady Lathbury, the Governor’s wife, accepted to become patroness of the Society.

==== To the present ====
By February 1966, the membership of the Society stood at around 40, with the average attendance at meetings between 20 and 25. Initially, novices were placed into groups with an intermediate or advanced worker nominated as group leader whose duty was to instruct the novices. Printing was carried out in the group leader’s own darkroom or at the John Mackintosh Hall. This system worked but with great difficulty, and was eventually abandoned. Competitions for black and white prints were held about once a month, and based on set themes. Entries were limited to 4 prints per person, and the print size restricted to 9 x 7 inches. It was not till 1974 that the first slides competition was held. This was just a one-off event. It was not till 1977 that regular slides competitions were incorporated into the annual programme, whilst the first colour prints competitions were not introduced till 1979. Initially, beginners had to compete in the same group as everybody else, but in 1973 they were provided with their own set of competitions.

Since its founding, the Society has held an annual exhibition. At first this consisted of black and white prints, but in 1977 two other sections were added : a colour prints section and one for beginners. The addition of a slides section had to wait till 1986. The size and popularity of the exhibition grew to such an extent that since 1982 two exhibition rooms have been required for it. Problems with the judging of the annual exhibition resulted in the Society getting in touch with the Royal Photographic Society in 1982 with a view of their providing an adjudicator. This they did and have continued to do so up to the present, resulting in our forging very close links with this world-renowned organisation.

In 1968 the Society only had one challenge trophy in its possession : The Society Challenge Cup, which was presented to the winner of the competitions held during the year. By 1980 the total had increased to 11 as the number of competitions and the number of sections in the annual exhibition increased. In 1985, the late Alex Perera presented a trophy he had made himself for the award of the title of Photographer of the Year to the person obtaining the highest aggregate of points in competitions during the course of the year. Today the total number of challenge trophies is 20!

The logo of the Society was designed by Mr A Harper in 1977 and the proof drawing made by Mr A Ryman MBE. Also in that year the Society made its first application for funds from the Government Cultural Grants Committee and succeeded in obtaining the sum of £90. Thanks to subsequent grants from this Committee, the Society has been able to purchase much needed equipment, and more recently for the purchase of books to help establish a good reference library. Also in 1977 first contacts were made with the Malta Photographic Society. This was the first of many such contacts with other clubs and societies, especially from U.K., with the view of exchanging ideas and holding competitions. In 1986 the Society became members of the Southern Photographic Federation of Great Britain, and through them affiliated to the Photographic Alliance of&amp;nbsp; Great Britain. As members of the SPF the Society has competed every year in their league competitions. Contacts with Spanish clubs in La Linea and Algeciras were established in 1984, and a few competitions and exhibitions have been held with them since then.

In 1981 the Society held its first basic course on photography, aimed at members who were beginners, but also opened to the general public. These successful courses have been kept up to the present.

In 1976 a need was felt for updating and extending the statute of the Society. A new statute was voted in April of that year. Minor revisions were made in 1982 and in 1983&amp;nbsp; with respect to classes of membership, and again in 1984 with respect to the use of the darkroom and equipment. In 1990 further changes were made with respect to the use of the Society’s equipment and premises, and lastly in 1994 with respect of classes of membership once again.

The 150th anniversary of the invention of photography was marked in1989 by the Society holding a special exhibition. For this exhibition copy prints of early historical photographs were purchased from the RPS, and exhibited together with hundreds of old and personal photographs loaned by members of the public, depicting family photos and old views of Gibraltar. The exhibition was a great success.

First enquiries on the acquisition of premises were made in 1985, and at the end of that year, during the opening of a special exhibition marking the 20th anniversary of the Society, the then Minister for Education Mr G Mascarenhas announced that we were being offered premises at Wellington Front.&amp;nbsp; These premises were officially handed over in January 1986, and works on refurbishing them commenced in April. By March 1987 the bulk of the works were over in the main hall, and the first Annual General Meeting held there that month. Works still continued in refurbishing the rest of the premises, and in fitting out a darkroom. The darkroom at John Mackintosh Hall was demolished in December 1989, and it was not till August 1990 that the one at Wellington Front became operational. The official opening of the premises was held on 26 November 1990, and carried out by H.E. the Governor Sir Derek Reffell. This coincided with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Society. The acquisition of&amp;nbsp; the premises resulted in the Society being able to extend its activities without restrictions, and in the acquisition of the type of equipment which would have been impossible to obtain otherwise.

At present the Society is self-sufficient in terms of darkroom, audio-visual and studio facilities. The Society has also embraced the advent of digital imaging without any reservations; in all competitions digitally processed and manipulated images are accepted on a par with traditionally processed ones. With the help of awards from the Government Cultural Grants Committee, the Society has purchased three computers, two printers, two slides/negative scanner, a flat-bed scanner and a digital projector. In the programme of events for the year, a significant amount of time is dedicated to learning how to use imaging programmes, and the hardware.

=== Premises ===
The Society has premises which will shortly be refurbished in Summer 2015 at  Wellington Front, their mailing address  :

Wellington Front, PO Box 1422,  Gibraltar.

== Exhibition ==
The society hold a yearly exhibition, dates of the exhibition can be obtained from the society´s [http://www.gibps.com/ website] 

=== Competitions ===
The society holds a series of competitions throughout the year in two categories, Beginners and Advance with the photographer who has mosts points at the end of the year is presented with a trophy as "Beginner of the Year" and "Photographer of the Year"

== Becoming a member of the Society ==

On 11 October 1956 he signed as an undercover agent of the 1st Department (Intelligence) of Polish Agency for Internal Security - code name "reporter" as documented by Polish Historical Institute (or IPN), but the report in "[[Życie Warszawy]]" of 1 December 2006 is distorted and unreliable. Grynberg was pressured by the SB, denied that he informed on any one, and reportedly revealed his recruitment to the FBI.

From Henryk Grynberg:&lt;ref name="freemediaonline.org"&gt;[http://www.freemediaonline.org/communist_spy_scandals_at_voa_and_rfe_Grynberg_112266.htm "Henryk Grynberg Responds"]&lt;/ref&gt;
I did sign a cooperation agreement with Polish intelligence (not military intelligence) on October 11, 1956 and received a one-time assignment to bring to the next meeting written characteristics (in Polish opinie) of three fellow students (two of them Jewish), no more than a page each. I presented those three persons as good intelligent students loyal to the state ideology and those were the only "reports" I was asked to do or have done in writing or otherwise. My contacts with the Polish intelligence or whatever secret services lasted no more than five months during which time I did nothing else for them. A document in my files at the IPN says, "His recruitment assumed future utilization in Israel and subsequently in the USA. After finishing his studies, Grynberg showed unwilingness to further collaboration. For this reason, the 1st Dep. resigned from further contacts with him." That ultimate "unwilingness" I expressed in 1959 when an intelligence agent wanted me to take with me a letter to Israel and I refused. I revealed my recruitment – or rather attempt at recruitment – to the FBI when applying for U.S. citizenship and for a sensitive position with U.S. Information Agency (which I held for 20 years). The note "Collaboration with Communists," so prominently placed, directs undue attention to a very short and meaningless episode in my biography.&lt;ref name="freemediaonline.org"/&gt;

==The beginnings of a writer==
In 1959, Grynberg graduated from [[Warsaw University]] with a master's degree in [[journalism]].  As an actor, Grynberg had connections with the [[Jewish Theatre, Warsaw|Jewish Theatre in Warsaw]].  It was during this time when he started publishing prose and poetry.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Culture/&gt;

While the Jewish State Theater company was on tour in the United States in late 1967, he refused to return to Poland.  This [[defection]] was an act of protest against the [[communist]] regime's anti-Jewish propaganda, and against the [[censorship]] of his writings.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Culture/&gt;

In 1971, after two years of attending graduate studies at [[UCLA]], Grynberg received an M.A. in [[Russian Literature]] and moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where Grynberg worked for the [[U.S. Information Agency]] (particularly for ''Voice in America'') for a period of twenty years.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;

==Works and achievements==
Grynberg published his first story in 1959, which was later included in his debut collection, ''The Antigone Crew'' in 1963.  In his works - written both while in Poland and in the United States – Grynberg narrated the stories of “those who died during the war and of those who survived to live afterwards in Lodz, Warsaw, or New York, struggling to come to terms with their own memory and with the fact that others did not remember.”  His works were described as characteristically abundant in “biographical and autobiographical material”, where his Jewish protagonists are the narrators whose personal experiences were “supplemented by the experiences of other ‘survivors’”.&lt;ref name=Culture/&gt;

Grynberg was a recipient of all major Polish literary prizes, and of the 2002 [[Koret Jewish Book Award]]. He also contributed to the Polish press and English-language journals.  His essays and articles appeared in publications such as the ''Commentary'', the ''Midstream'', and the ''Soviet-Jewish Affairs'' in [[London]].  Grynberg’s books have been published in English translation, namely novels, ''Child of the Shadows'' (Vallentine Mitchell, London, 1969) - reedited as "The Jewish War and the Victory" (Northwestern University Press, 2001); the sequel, ''The Victory'' (Northwestern University Press, 1993); documentary prose, ''Children of Zion'' (Northwestern University Press, 1997), translated by [[Jacqueline Mitchell]], and "Drohobycz, Drohobycz and Other Stories" (Penguin Books, 2002) translated by Alicia Nitecki, edited by Theodosia Robertson.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Google&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0T137MXvFy8C&amp;dq=henryk+grynberg Grynberg, Henryk.

Grynberg's books were also translated into the French, German, Italian, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], as well as Czech, Hungarian, and Swedish languages.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;

Grynberg's books: "Drohobycz, Drohobycz," "Memorbuch," "Monolog polsko-żydowski" ("Polish-Jewish Monolog") and "Uchodźcy" ("Refugees") were nominated for Poland's [[Nike Award|Nike Literary Award]].&lt;ref name=Culture/&gt;

A '''hierarchy of genres''' is any formalization which ranks different  [[genre]]s in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.

In literature, the [[Epic poetry|epic]] was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''Life of [[John Milton]]'': "By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions."  Below that came [[lyric poetry]], and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for [[drama]]. The [[novel]] took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.

In music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the [[Baroque]] period, and [[opera]] retained a superior status for much longer.  The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.

The hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century.  These were formalized and promoted by the [[Academy|academies]] in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]], which held a central role in [[Academic art]].  The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belton|first1=Dr. Robert J.|title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook|chapter=The Elements of Art|date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[History painting]], including historically important, religious, mythological, or allegorical subjects
*[[Portrait painting]]
*[[Genre works|Genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|Landscape]] and cityscape art (landscapists were called "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" by the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]])
*[[Animal painting]]
*[[Still life]]

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to "render visible the universal essence of things" (''imitare'' in Italian) and that which merely consisted of "mechanical copying of particular appearances" (''ritrarre'').&lt;ref&gt;Bass, 36 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6TSDvkud168C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Hierarchy+of+genres+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Idealism]] was privileged over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in line with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonist]] philosophy.

The term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the [[High Renaissance]] onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art.  This had not been the case in [[Medieval art]] and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view.  The [[Raphael Cartoons]] are a clear example of the continuing status of [[tapestry]], the most expensive form of art in the 16th century.  In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century.  Until the 19th century the most extravagant [[objets d'art]] remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings.  Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.

==Renaissance art==
The hierarchy grew out of the struggle  to gain acceptance of painting as one of the [[Liberal arts]], and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]].  These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Giorgio Vasari]].  Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 28, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[De Pictura]]'' ("About Painting") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer.  He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of [[Michelangelo]], who was strongly influenced by [[neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 61, 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of [[Mannerist]] theorists such as [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]] and [[Federico Zuccari]] (both also painters) this was far less of a priority.  Both emphasized beauty as "something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 140-141 (quote, 141)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status.  Ideas of [[decorum]] also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

During the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects.  For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the [[Medici]] in his [[Medici Chapel]] sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist [[Giovanni Battista Armenini|Armenini]]&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Armenini (1533-1609) ''De vera precetti della pittura'' (1587), " On the True Precepts of the Art of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1587 that "portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [''maniera''] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 23-24 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|decrees on art of the Council of Trent]] of 1563.  Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased.  Until the challenge of [[Caravaggio]] at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

==17th and 18th century art==
The new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class.  Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by [[Karel van Mander]], [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' ( Rotterdam 1678), "Introduction to the Academy of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard de Lairesse]] and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as [[Jan Steen]], [[Karel Dujardin]] and [[Vermeer]] produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell.  The unhappy history of [[Rembrandt]]'s last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life.  Often the different elements were painted by different artists; [[Rubens]] and [[Frans Snyders]] often co-operated in this way.

The size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a ''landscape with...'', a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish [[world landscape]]s of [[Joachim Patinir]] in the early 16th century. [[Flemish Baroque painting]] was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.

An influential formulation of 1667 by [[André Félibien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled.  For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allegorical painting was raised above other types of [[history painting]]; together they were the ''grand genre'', including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjects—they embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.

After history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: [[Portrait painting|portraits]], scenes of everyday life (called ''scènes de genre'', or "[[Genre works|genre painting]]", and also ''petit genre'' to contrast it with the ''grande genre''), [[Landscape art|landscapes]], animal painting, and finally [[still life]]s. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintings—neither ideal in style, nor elevated in subject—were admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. 

The hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes.  This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental ''[[The Young Bull]]'' of the Dutch artist [[Paulus Potter]], as well as the larger of the two ''[[Butchers' Shop]]'' canvases of [[Annibale Carracci]].  But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits.  Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.

The use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later  dissenting theorists, such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], held that this focus on [[allegory]] was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the [[Horace|Horatian]] dictum [[ut pictura poesis]] ("as is painting so is poetry").

The British painter [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] in his ''Discourses'' of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.

Though Reynolds agreed with Félibien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: "Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of [[Virgil]], that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to [[Titian]]; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance."

Though European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the [[Grand Manner]], where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] invented a genre that was called [[fêtes galantes]], where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. 

[[Claude Lorrain]] practised a genre called the [[ideal landscape]], where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a  setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term ''historical landscape'' which received official recognition in the Académie française when a [[Prix de Rome]] for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.

==19th century==
[[Romanticism]] greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in [[British art]] and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the [[Style Troubadour]] in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American [[Hudson River School]] and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.

Until the middle of the 19th century, [[women artists|women]] were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic training—that of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.

Toward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the Académie française, including the status accorded to [[history painting]], which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy.  In Britain the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts.  Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects.  New artistic movements included the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.

The '''Irwell Sculpture Trail''' is the largest [[public art]] scheme in [[England]], commissioning regional, national and international artists. The Trail includes 28 art pieces and follows a well established {{convert|30|mi|km|sing=on}} footpath stretching from [[Salford Quays]] through [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] into [[Rossendale]] and up to the [[Pennines]] above [[Bacup]].

== Chapel Street to Peel Park ==

=== The Fabric of Nature ===
Viewed from above this earthwork is loosely in the shape of a bud and leaf unfurling into a double spiral mound taking the viewer up to a curved brick seating area.

A series of leaf images and patterns are set into the brick path to help people discover the park. The sculpture is an attempt to move between the formal [[Victorian era|Victorian]] design of the park seen in the remnants of the formal bedding and local buildings, and the geometric patterns of natural forms discovered on closer inspection i.e. the double helix of the centre of a daisy. The design incorporates many requests arising out of a consultation process e.g. seating, colour and improvement of derelict areas.

== Peel Park to Agecroft ==
''Arena'' (completed 2002) is a public sculpture designed by New York artist Rita McBride. It is made of white Ferro cement and stands over {{convert|15|ft|m}} high overlooking Littleton Road playing fields and the [[River Irwell]]. It is [[City of Salford|Salford]]'s first major commission for the Irwell Sculpture Trail.

== Clifton to Prestwich==
Arresting Time: Jill Randall has been a resident artist at Magnesium Elektron Limited just off Lumns Lane for over a year during which time she wasw influenced by the industrial process she has experienced. Suspended from the riverbank, the alloy sculpture reflects the mechanisms of the factory behind.

== Clifton Country Park==
:''See picture at top right of page''
The Lookout was built by Tim Norris and Craig Ormerod in 2003, into the bank of the lake (Clifton Marina) at [[Clifton Country Park]], to allow people access to the water and a quiet place to contemplate and rest. {{coord|53.53567|-2.346921|scale:1000|name=Lookout}}

== Clifton to Prestwich==
[[File:Irwell Sculpture Trail Dig.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Dig]]
The ''Dig'' was inspired by the local industrial history 'Dig' refers to the starvation boats used to ferry materials from the [[Wet Earth Colliery]] at [[Clifton, Greater Manchester|Clifton]] to [[Salford Quays]], [[City of Salford|Salford]].  The boats were called 'starvationers' because of their narrowness, needed to navigate the canals.

Remains of these boats can still be seen in the dried-up [[Fletcher's Canal]] in the park.  Industrial archaeology, burial ships, underground rivers, crop marks and [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s inform the artist's work. Dig is also used as a seating, eating and performance area. {{coord|53.532727|-2.339024|scale:1000|name=Dig}}

== Radcliffe ==
[[File:Irwell Sculpture Trail Trinity.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Trinity]]

The work called ''Trinity'' focuses on the period the railway line was constructed, the deaths of many of the '[[navies]]' involved in the digging of the Outwood cutting and the pre-railway history of the site. The flowers' names hint at the loss of these unknown workers and are a memorial to them and reflect the woodlands that surround the site.  [[Harebell]] = Grief, [[Snowdrop]] = Consolation, [[Rosemary]] = Remembrance.

The symbolic language of flowers was in common use during the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]] when the cutting was created. The column is also an ancient and symbolic representation of a tree which allows the work to 'merge' into its wooded surroundings. The artist aimed to engage with the wider cyclical events of the site transformations through nature -&gt; industry -&gt; nature over the last century.{{coord|53.54025|-2.34038|scale:1000|name=Trinity}}

Another sculpture is ''Our Seats Are Almost Touching''. The bench has been produced in a dark grey concrete composite with a smooth, flame finish. The full bench forms a circle but has been split into eight segments of lengths varying from 60&amp;nbsp;cm to 300&amp;nbsp;cm and placed as both single and group seating. Each segment enhances a vista or provides a tranquil place for contemplation. This work is part of a series of seating proposals that began in 1994. The [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] benches were the first to be realised with the second series in the Talanue, [[Waiblingen]] [[Germany]]. This project has established a cultural partnership between the two districts.

[[File:Irwell Sculpture Trail Ulrich Ruckheim rail track.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The former railway track]]

== Ulrich Rückriem ==
On the site of the former [[Outwood Colliery]], Ulrich Rückriem has created one of his largest stone settings to date. It is composed of ten large stone pieces set over a number of locations; one column marks each of the two main entrances, a group of seven tall slabs are installed of a flat [[plateau]], and the largest slab, {{convert|25|ft|m}} in height, marks the former railway track. These stones are split horizontally and/or vertically into several parts then reassembled into their original forms. {{coord|53.550778|-2.339731|scale:1000|name=Rail Track}}

== Nailing Home ==
The starting point for this commission was to incorporate the themes of children's rights and the name of the housing development into the design. Research revealed the mill owner used to keep [[Shire horse]]s which led to the name Shire Gardens. The final sculpture will mark the entrance to the new housing development. It is the first major public work by Jack Wright, a sculptor who lives in Radcliffe.

The work takes the form of enlarged frost nails, used to attach the [[Shire horse]]s' hooves in icy conditions. The stem of the nail suggests growth with the head reminiscent of a house roof, this draws a direct parallel to Irwell Valley Housing Association who have developed [[social housing]] on this site.

Inscribed on each stem is a line from the poem 'Children Learn What They Live' to remind us how children's lives can be influenced by our actions. This project is a joint commission between the Irwell Sculpture Trail and Irwell Valley Housing Association. {{coord|53.564544|-2.333628|scale:1000|name=Nailing Home}}

In the [[Typha|Bulrush]]es is another sculpture. It is made of galvanised mild steel and the sculpture is inspired by the nearby [[Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal]] having bulrush motifs, a canal barge hidden in the bottom of the bulrushes and illumination to transform the sculpture at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.axisweb.org/seCVEN.aspx?CVID=297118&amp;PID=414 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025703/http://www.axisweb.org/seCVEN.aspx?CVID=297118&amp;PID=414 |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bury ==
''As If I Were A River'' has been produced around the key motif of this exhibition - the river. The ethos of this public art commission is to use art as a tool to enable the public to interpret their landscape and have the confidence to explore their environment.

*Water Wheel: The materials are painted steel and stone. This sculpture marks the entrance to [[Burrs Country Park]], once the site of a large [[cotton mill]]. The work, half immersed in masonry, at first glance might appear to be an uncovered relic of the huge waterwheels which originally powered the industry of the [[Irwell Valley]]. The wheel symbolises the process of constant change, the changing of a river into an industrial site and its change back into countryside again.
*Stone Cycle: Working on site gave the artist an understanding of the place, the passing of time, people, industry the reinventing of the area; this is represented in the broken circular layout of the sculpture. Like the site the stones had a previous life, originally quarried and cut for use as a bridge. Under the 100 years of industrial grime the artist discovered marks made by the original masons. Carved symbols were added to these marks, clues to long forgotten stories.
*Picnic Area: This sculpture is a representation of a human scale [[rat trap]] rendered in [[stainless steel]] with the words picnic area inscribed upon its plate. Sited in the corner of two water ways, a canal and a tributary that once fed the [[cotton mill]], now all that remains of a bygone industrial age.

Fryer's sculpture is a wry comment on this hidden history and the site's current use as a country park. By using the words 'picnic area' the artists is encouraging the visitor to question whether the art work is a public amenity or [[tourist trap]].

== Ramsbottom ==
[[File:Ramsbottom Tilted Vase 010405.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Edward Allington]]'s "Tilted Vase" 1998, Market Place, Ramsbottom]]
''Seek And You Will Find'': a series of carved wooden sculptures relating to the indigenous flora found around the park. All the works are 'secretive', located amongst the flora its form is taken from [[Ramson]] herb from which the town's name originates.

*The River: a meandering {{convert|90|yd}} path ending in a platform to watch passing trains. The sculpture contains work created by local people - poems celebrating the river and the illustrated story of [[Jacob's Ladder]], a local beauty spot.
*''Tilted Vase'' (1998) by Edward Allington draws on the legacy of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the valley. Classical in shape reflecting the architecture, built in sections and bolted together to look like a machine.

== Irwell Vale ==
*''In The Picture'' (1997) by Richard Caink: The frame refers to traditional landscape painting of the 18th century, often used to display land ownership. The carvings are artefacts that relate to the industry in the valley and the loom-wreckers rebellion of 1826 at Chatterton Mill. The visitor can step into the picture as both viewer and subject matter.
*Remnant Kings: The large timber sections made from local [[fraxinus|ash]] timber are cradled in a steel cog. This structure suggests movement, throwing the timber forward and releasing the stones within its folds, like seeds bringing new growth. "Remnant Kings stands proud on the hillside watching over its kingdom waiting for its chance to scatter".

== Rawtenstall ==
*Whispering Wall: Inspired by the [[water board]]'s installations in the [[Rossendale Valley]], this sculpture brings together elements of local quarrying, redundant pipe work and the ever-present sound of running water. A 4000-litre underground tank acts as a central echo chamber for {{convert|37|yd}} of pipe radiating outwards to holes cored in the external, riven, flagstone wall. Drawn by an intense blue light, visible through the holes, the observant passer-by can hear a shifting montage of whispered voices and sound textures sourced from the local ecology.
*Gateway: The materials are steel, mosaic and cobblestone. Railway lines were shaped to form the archway of the gates and steel panels cut with images of steam train wheels to reflect the usage of the immediate area and local history. Funded by Groundwork Rossendale, and English Partnerships in association with the [[East Lancashire Railway]].
*Willow Tree sculpture is a large environmental maze that spreads over a hillside in a series of tunnels. To either side are large turf kilns: a beehive shaped one from smelting and a ziggurat one for burning charcoal. There are also two detached chimneys for which [[Rossendale]] used to be famous. The sculpture has become an open air environmental classroom.
*The [[Bocholt, Germany|Bocholt]] Tree celebrates Rossendale's award-winning links with its [[Germany|German]] [[twin-town]]. The sculpture is a symbol of unity between the people of Rossendale and Bocholt as a reminder to the people of Rossendale that they have friends in other parts of Europe. Bocholt's civic symbol is the tree. Materials: Painted Metal.

== Waterfoot ==
*Logarythms: A zig zag traveller's rest for walkers of the Way. The sculpture has a simple mathematical construction, increasing in length and height as the piece zigzags down the slope. Materials: Logs

== Bacup ==
*Weave: The starting point for this sculpture was the local industrial heritage and in particular the textile industry. The idea for Weave comes from looking at fabric under a microscope and seeing the threads moving in and out of each other in a woven pattern. Weave also refers to the local landscape with peaks and troughs like the hills and valley.
*Coming Full Circle: The sculpture is a maze enclosure built using dry stone walling with five spiralling walls and five paths with a quiet, central seat. The pattern of the wall whirlpool mirrors the movement of the wheels turned by water stored in the adjacent lodges which once powered the local felt factory. The five exits continue as paths meandering through a planted belt of hawthorn, cherry and apple whose, when in flower, mass of white blossom will give the appearance of turbulent water around a waterwheel. This sculpture, with an oak tree at its centre, acknowledges the circular motion of time that will return this land back to woodland.

== Deerplay ==
*Sentinel: This sculpture incorporates two traditional skills used in the valley, [[dry-stone]]walling and felting, in a unique way. The artist learned stonewalling from a local craftsman and in turn passed on the art of felt making to young people in the valley. Sentinel means soldier posted to keep guard over a special place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17456">[[Image:Johannes calvin.jpg|thumb|alt=A profile line drawing of Calvin|right|Portrait of [[John Calvin]], 1854.]]

[[John Calvin]] (1509–1564) was a French [[Protestant]] [[theologian]] during the [[Protestant Reformation]], and one of the most influential reformers. He was a central figure for the [[Reformed churches]], whose theological system is sometimes called [[Calvinism]].

Calvin had a positive view of Mary, but rejected the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] veneration of her.

==Marian doctrines==
[[Will Durant]] says that "[i]t is remarkable, how much of Roman Catholic tradition and theory survived in Calvin's theology." Calvin's genius was not in creating new ideas but in developing existing thought to its logical conclusion.&lt;ref name="Durant 465"&gt;Durant 465&lt;/ref&gt; He borrowed from [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Bucer]], "but most of these Protestant doctrines had come down, in milder form, in Catholic tradition."&lt;ref name="Durant 465"/&gt; Calvin gave them stronger interpretation and rejected the Catholic humanism.&lt;ref name="Durant 465"/&gt;

The criticism of Calvin on the Catholic Church in general and in regard to Mary in particular, is severe. As in the conflicts with Luther and Zwingli, equally severe Catholic counter-attacks led later theologians to the observation, that Mary was used by both sides to define theological positions and identity.

To Calvin, Mary is an idol in the Roman Church, and she diminishes the centrality and importance of Jesus. Regarding Marian [[relics]], Calvin commented ironically that since the Roman Catholics believed in the [[Assumption of Mary]], they have been deprived "of all pretext for manufacturing any relics of her remains, which otherwise might have been sufficiently abundant to fill a whole churchyard."&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6ecCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA248 A treatise on relics]'', p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perpetual virginity===
Calvin argues that in {{bibleverse||Matthew|1:25|KJV}} ("[Joseph] knew her [Mary] not till she had brought forth her firstborn son") the term "firstborn" and the conjunction "till" do not contradict the doctrine of perpetual virginity, but Matthew does not tell us what happened to Mary afterwards; he wrote: "no just and well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words of the Evangelist (Matthew), as to what took place after the birth of Christ." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Calvin |title=Harmony of Matthew, Mark, and Luke |volume=1 |chapter=Commentary on Matthew 1:25 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom31.ix.xv.html#ix.xv-p72.1 |accessdate=2009-01-07 |quote=Let us rest satisfied with this, that no just and well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words of the Evangelist, as to what took place after the birth of Christ. He is called first-born; but it is for the sole purpose of informing us that he was born of a virgin. It is said that Joseph ''knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son'': but this is limited to that very time. What took place afterwards, the historian does not inform us. Such is well known to have been the practice of the inspired writers. Certainly, no man will ever raise a question on this subject, except from curiosity; and no man will obstinately keep up the argument, except from an extreme fondness for disputation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Calvin argues that the claims that Mary took a vow of perpetual virginity in {{bibleverse||Luke|1:34|KJV}} ("How shall this be, since I know not a man?") is "unfounded and altogether absurd," and moreover he says that, had she taken such a vow, "[s]he would, in that case, have committed treachery by allowing herself to be united to a husband, and would have poured contempt on the holy covenant of marriage...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Calvin |title=Harmony of Matthew, Mark, and Luke |volume=1 |chapter=Commentary on Luke 1:34 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom31.ix.vii.html#ix.vii-p6.1 |accessdate=2009-01-07 |quote=The conjecture which some have drawn from these words ['How shall this be, since I know not a man?'], that she had formed a vow of perpetual virginity, is unfounded and altogether absurd. She would, in that case, have committed treachery by allowing herself to be united to a husband, and would have poured contempt on the holy covenant of marriage; which could not have been done without mockery of God. Although the Papists have exercised barbarous tyranny on this subject, yet they have never proceeded so far as to allow the wife to form a vow of continence at her own pleasure. Besides, it is an idle and unfounded supposition that a monastic life existed among the Jews.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Algermissen suggests that Calvin believed that Mary in this verse looked into the future and recognized, that in light of this special grace, any contact with a man would be excluded for her,&lt;ref&gt;Algermissen 641&lt;/ref&gt; this interpretation takes an objection Calvin is refuting in his commentary and makes it his own position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Calvin |title=Harmony of Matthew, Mark, and Luke |volume=1 |chapter=Commentary on Luke 1:34 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom31.ix.vii.html#ix.vii-p6.1 |accessdate=2009-01-07 |quote=We must reply, however, to another objection, that the virgin refers to the future, and so declares that she will have no intercourse with a man.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mother of God===
Calvin rejected calling Mary the "mother of God," saying, "I cannot think such language either right, or becoming, or suitable. ... To call the Virgin Mary the mother of God can only serve to confirm the ignorant in their superstitions."&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Epistle CCC to the French church in London&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, it has been argued that Mary was, in Calvin's view, properly called the mother of God. Proponents of this view of Calvin's Mariology have cited Calvin's commentary on {{bibleverse||Luke|1:43}} for support. In this verse, in which [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]] greeted Mary as "mother of my Lord," Calvin takes note of the divinity often associated with the title Lord, saying: "[Elizabeth] calls Mary ''the mother of her Lord''. This denotes a unity of person in the two natures of Christ; as if she had said, that he who was begotten a mortal man in the womb of Mary is, at the same time, the eternal God.... This name ''Lord'' strictly belongs to the Son of God 'manifested in the flesh,' (1 Timothy 3:16,) who has received from the Father all power, and has been appointed the highest ruler of heaven and earth, that by his agency God may govern all things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Calvin |title=Harmony of Matthew, Mark, and Luke |volume=1 |chapter=Commentary on Luke 1:43 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom31.ix.viii.html#ix.viii-p22 |accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view of Calvin's mariology point out that Calvin's objection to the title "mother of God" had to do with the "superstition" of the "ignorant," presumably a reference to Marian veneration. He does not state that Mary cannot in any sense be called the "mother of God."

Opponents of this view state that Calvin's comments on Mary as the mother of Elizabeth's Lord may be understood to mean that, in Calvin's view, Mary was mother of the Lord only while he was on earth. Proponents of this view have cited Calvin's commentary on {{bibleverse||John|19:26}}, from which it has been argued that Calvin considered the mother-son relationship between Mary and Jesus to have ceased at Jesus' death. In this scheme, Christ, as he was dying on the cross, appointed his disciple John to take his place as Mary's son, so that he himself might henceforth take his rightful place at the Father's right hand in heaven. Upon Christ's words to his mother concerning John, "Woman, behold thy son!" Calvin comments, "Some think that He does not call her 'mother' but only 'woman' so as not to inflict a deeper wound of sorrow on her heart. I do not reject this; but another conjecture is no less probable, that Christ wanted to show that now that He has completed the course of human life, He puts off the condition in which He has lived and enters into the heavenly kingdom where He will rule over angels and men. For we know that Christ's custom always was to recall believers from looking at the flesh. This was especially necessary at His death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Calvin |title=Commentary on John |volume=2 |chapter=John 19:26 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom35.ix.vi.html#ix.viii-p22 |accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immaculate conception===

John Calvin believed in the doctrine of original sin as well as the doctrine of [[headship]], found in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:12-21&amp;version=47 Romans 5:12-21]. Considering he believed in both of these doctrines most reformed theologians agree that John Calvin did not accept the doctrine of [[immaculate conception]], considering it conflicted with the aforementioned doctrines and with [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:23;&amp;version=47; Romans 3:23] that all have sinned.&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Works, Serm. de la proph. de Christ: op 35, 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking into account Calvin's belief in headship, this means that Mary could have original sin and not pass it on to Jesus, considering the male is the one who passes on original sin in the doctrine of headship. Since Jesus was conceived by God himself and not by a human man, original sin was not passed on. Said Calvin: "We condemn those who affirm that a man once justified cannot sin. ... As to the special privilege of the Virgin Mary, when they produce the celestial diploma we shall believe what they say."&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Antidote to the Canons of the Council of Trent, Canon 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salvation===

Calvin's [[soteriology]] was grounded in the belief that Christ alone is sufficient for salvation. He regarded any opposition to this doctrine as "pure defiance",&lt;ref&gt;Pure desfiance&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently denied any notion of Mary as a participant in the mystery of salvation. He rejected the Roman Catholic belief that Mary acts as a mediator between man and God as idolatry, since only Christ can fulfill this role.&lt;ref&gt;Quant a L'intercession de la vierge Marie et des Saincts trespasses, revenez tousiours a ce principe, que cw n'est pas point a nous faire des Advocats in Paradies, mais a dieu, lequel a ordinne Jesus Christ un seul piur tous, Ep 1438, Vol 14,21&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin forbade prayers and supplications to Mary for the same reason, further arguing that praying to the dead is not a practice supported by Scripture.&lt;ref name="Algermissen 1988 640"&gt;Algermissen 1988 640&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin held that God's salvation or damnation of an individual seals his fate eternally,&lt;ref&gt;Durant 462&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting the concept of eventual salvation through suffering in [[purgatory]]. He regarded the Catholic belief that Mary can intercede on behalf of the dead to be "nothing but blasphemy" ("exsecrabilis blasphemia"), on the basis that only God has the authority to determine the amount of grace given to each individual in his divine will. He therefore did not condone praying to Mary for the salvation of dead sinners, as their eternal fate was already sealed long before creation.&lt;ref name="Algermissen 1988 640"/&gt;

===Fullness of grace===
The fullness of grace is therefore rejected as well, since the ''plenitude de grace'' is Christ only. On this point he coincides with Roman Catholic teaching, which sees only in Christ absolute fullness of grace, while the graces of Mary are seen as a gift of God attributed to her.&lt;ref name="Algermissen 1988 641"&gt;Algermissen 1988 641&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Calvin called Mary a treasure of grace,&lt;ref&gt;thre sorie de grace&lt;/ref&gt; because, Mary preserved in her heart not only for her own use but for the use of all things entrusted to her. She preserved things in her heart, not just for herself, but for all of us. "She has preserved in her heart the teachings which open the heavenly gates and lead to Christ".&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Calvini Opera Harmonie Evangelique, Ser IX, op 46 309&lt;/ref&gt; God wanted to determine the time in which they would be revealed.&lt;ref name="Algermissen 1988 642"&gt;Algermissen 1988 642&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocate===
Calvin considered himself the real follower of Mary, because he freed her from what he saw as undeserved honour.  Calvin stated that Mary cannot be the advocate of the faithful since she needs God's grace as much as any other human being&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Calvini Opera Serm, de la proph, de Christ: op 35, 686&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration of Mary==

Calvin had genuine respect for Mary and saw her as a model for faith. "To this day we cannot enjoy the blessing brought to us in Christ without thinking at the same time of that which God gave as adornment and honour to Mary, in willing her to be the mother of his only-begotten Son". The genuine respect for Mary in Calvin's writing, and his attempt to express his Marian convictions to the faithful of his day in his explanations of the epistles is not fully known or shared by Reformed Protestants after John Calvin.&lt;ref name="Algermissen 1988 642"/&gt;

[[Image:UtrechtIconoclasm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Statues in the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]], attacked in [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] iconoclasm in the 16th century]]
===Iconoclasm===&lt;!-- The first section is, with minor modifications linked from [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]] --&gt;

Some of the Protestant reformers, [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]] encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven images of God. As a result, statues and images were damaged in spontaneous individual attacks as well as unauthorised iconoclastic riots. [[Erasmus]] described such an incident in a letter:

* ''They heaped such insults on the images of the saints, and the crucifix itself, that it is quite surprising there was no miracle. ... Not a statue was left either in the churches, or the vestibules, or the porches, or the monasteries. The frescoes were obliterated by means of a coating of lime; whatever would burn was thrown into the fire, and the rest pounded into fragments. Nothing was spared for either love or money.''&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus, Epistle MXLVIII to Bilibald&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction of Marian paintings and painting of the saints was not ordered by Calvin alone. But, virtually all Marian pictures and statues in [[Geneva]] were destroyed as a result of his 1535 order. John Calvin considered the veneration of religious pictures including Marian pictures as [[heresy]]. The [[Second Council of Nicaea]], which in the year 787 had specifically encouraged the pictorial presentation, and which was a part of the ancient Christian patristic tradition, was renounced as an illegal by Calvin in 1550.&lt;ref&gt;Bäumer, 481&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calvin's influence==

[[Image:John Calvin - best likeness.jpg|thumb|[[John Calvin]]'s view on Mary are reflected in the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] (Latin: Confessio Helvetica Posterior&lt;ref name="Chavannes 425"&gt;Chavannes 425&lt;/ref&gt;)]]

Calvin's view on Mary are reflected in the [[Second Helvetic Confession]], written by [[Heinrich Bullinger]] (1504–1575), pastor and the successor of [[Huldrych Zwingli]] in [[Zurich]]. Chapter Three quotes the angel's message to the Virgin Mary, ''“ – the Holy Spirit will come over you “ -'' as an indication of the existence of the [[Holy Spirit]] and the [[Trinity]]. The Latin text described Mary as ''diva'', indicating her rank as a person, who dedicated herself to God. In Chapter Nine, the Virgin birth of Jesus is said to be conceived by the Holy Spirit and born without the participation of any man. The Second Helvetic Confession accepted the "Ever Virgin" notion, which spread throughout much of Europe with the approbation of this document.&lt;ref name="Chavannes 426"&gt;Chavannes 426&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Confession]], the [[Scots Confession]], the [[Belgic Confession]], and the [[Heidelberg Catechism]], all include references to the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]], mentioning specifically, that ''Jesus was born without the participation of a man''.&lt;ref name="Chavannes 426"/&gt; Invocations to Mary were not tolerated however, in light of Calvin's position, that any prayer to saints in front of an altar is prohibited.

'''John Stinton (jnr)''' (1854–1956) was a British ‘[[Royal Worcester]]’ painter best known for his ‘Highland Cattle’ scenes.

John Stinton (jnr) was one of a long line of the Stinton family who painted for the [[Worcester]] firm for some 160 years. The family tradition started with Henry Stinton who was employed from 1805 at the Grainger family's factory at St.Martins Gate in [[Worcester]] and would later become part of the ‘Royal Worcester’ group. John Stinton (snr) born in 1829, was Henry Stinton's son and started his apprenticeship at the Grainger factory when eleven years old, remaining there until his retirement in 1895. John (snr) was an accomplished artist and soon became a respected member of the Grainger staff. He discovered that [[oil of cloves]] would prevent his paints from drying out too quickly. John (snr)produced five sons, three following in their father's footsteps and becoming painters at the Worcester factories.

Stinton was the eldest son, but did not take up [[china painting]] until the rather late age of thirty five. Besides Highland cattle, he depicted English cattle and produced many fine images of British castles on his plates and a large number of watercolour landscapes. He was an enthusiastic gardener, and built a heated greenhouse where he grew the tobacco for his constant pipe-smoking.

Four of John Stinton (jnr)'s children followed him into ceramic painting: '''Arthur Stinton''', eldest son and born in 1878, joined the Grainger factory shortly after its amalgamation with Royal Worcester and then went on to the Locke factory where his uncle Walter was employed as a flower painter. '''Annie Stinton''', born in 1882, also joined the Grainger factory and went on to the Royal Worcester works. '''Kate Stinton''' also born in 1882 worked at the Royal Worcester factory. '''Harry Stinton''' born in 1883 also painted Highland cattle scenes. He was a sickly child but grew to be a respected figure after joining the firm in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antique-marks.com/royal-worcester-stinton.html The Royal Worcester Stinton Artists] (antique-marks.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) – The Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis''''' is an oil painting by the English painter [[J. M. W. Turner|Joseph Mallord William Turner]] (c.1775–1851), first exhibited in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/|title=Tate|work=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Displayed during the latter years of J.M.W. Turners career, this painting depicts a [[deluge myth|deluge]] scene where the natural effects of light and weather (the atmosphere) play a crucial role on Turner's concept of vision. The deluge being referred to in the title is the representation of the great flood story told in the [[Book of Genesis]]. As suggested by its title, the painting also acknowledges [[Moses]], known as the author of the book of Genesis found in the Old Testament of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Gerald. Angel in the Sun: Turner's Vision of History. McGill-Queen's University Press. canada, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In this painting the role of man is portrayed as passive through his inability to control nature, which is beautiful to the eye yet has the power to destroy and recreate life. This piece also illustrates Turner's belief that God is the one in charge as it is He who creates the flood, allows Noah to survive, and inspired Moses to write the Book of Genesis. Genesis, in this case leads back to the creation of man, light, and the water which light is being reflected on.&lt;ref name="WebEx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/romantic-color.html|title=Turner and Delacroix|work=webexhibits.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
For most of his career Turner, whose works are predominantly subjective, was recognised for his watercolor and oil paintings that reflected landscape images and scenes of natural entities such as the weather, the ocean, the effect of light, and vision. Through the blurring of images, Turner attempts to justify the belief that the eye is always trying to form an image as it tries to recreate nature. Traditionally, colour is used as a type of ''accessory'' to form, but Turner's attraction to light and colour allows colour to take the place of form.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Gerald. Angel in the Sun: Turner's Vision of History. McGill-Queen's University Press. Canada, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The main colours used by Turner were red, yellow, and blue,&lt;ref name="WebEx"/&gt; which is discussed more in depth in relation to other works that influenced that of Turner. His work also illustrates his relationship to the [[Romanticism|Romantic Movement]] and position as the precursor of the impressionist movement.

==Influence==
As expressed in the title of the painting, J.M.W. Turner found interest in [[Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe]]'s book, ''Theory of Colours'' also known as [[Zur Farbenlehre]], published in 1810.&lt;ref name="Finley"&gt;Finley, Gerald. ''The Deluge Pictures: Reflections on Goethe, J.M.W. Turner and Early Nineteenth-Century Science.'' Deutscher Kunstrerlag GmbH Munchen Berlin. Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte, 60 Bd., H. 4 (1997), pp. 530–548&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goethe's Theory==
Turner absorbed Goethe’s theory of light and darkness and depicted their relationship in a number of his paintings, including ''Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) – the Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis''. According to this theory,the creation of colour is dependent on the distribution of dark and light reflecting through a transparent object.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; Turner uses main concepts from Goethe’s theory, which is a rejection of Newton's Seven Color Theory, and expresses the belief that every colour was an individualised combination of light and darkness. Newton's reasoning in his theory of light and colour was, in the words of Michael Duck, too ''simplistic'' for Goethe. As a result, Goethe found his own form of vision in regards to the physiological aspects of the concept of colour.&lt;ref&gt;Duck, Michael (September 1988). "Newton and Goethe on colour: Physical and physiological considerations". Annals of Science, Volume 45, Number 5, pp. 507–519.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Goethe claims that there is an infinite amount of colour variation, and through his paintings Turner attempts to reflect this theory.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; Turner also responds to the ''plus'' and ''minus'' concepts that Goethe created to address both emotions and the eye. His main focus was the after image that is left on the retina after seeing an image. Through this after image the ''plus'' addresses the colours red and yellow which is intended to evoke a buoyant feelings, while the colour blue contrasts such as it creates the emotion of melancholy and desolation.&lt;ref name="WebEx"/&gt; According to Goethe's concept, yellow undergoes a transition of light becoming darker when light reaches its peak, just as the sun shines in the sky, it develops to a white light that is colourless.  But the light deepens and evolves the yellow into an orange and then finally to a ruby red hue.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; Turner illustrates the process of yellow transitioning into phases of light by showing how, as the viewer moves away from the centre, the edges get darker.

==Symbolism==
The yellowing colouring of the painting is a reference to Goethe’s ''Theory of Colour'', which explains the colour yellow as being the first colour transmitted from light.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Backhaus, Reinhold Kliegl, John S. Werner. ''Color Vision: perspectives from different disciplines''. Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., Berlin, 1998. pp 13–26&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the painting is circular, symbolising the construction of the human eye, changing the focus of a typical linear splitting of space to a more subjective portrayal. The colour yellow is typically optimistic, but Turner captures the negativity of yellow by attaching the colour to a light that is subject to change.  The morning sun aspect of the colour is something transient.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt;

==Companion piece==
*Turner's paired piece titled ''Shade and Darkness – The Evening of the Deluge'' was also exhibited in 1843. In this piece as well as ''The Morning After the Deluge'', Turner makes no attempt to mirror the scene of the flood in its naturality.&lt;ref name="WebEx"/&gt; 
*''Fallacies of Hope'' is a poem that Turner supposedly wrote to parallel the two paintings.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt;

==1994 Frankfurt theft==
''Light and Colour'' was among three paintings [[Frankfurt art theft (1994)|stolen from a Frankfurt museum in 1994]]. ''Shade and Darkness'' was also taken. In 2002, the Tate Gallery covertly purchased ''Light and Colour'' on the black market for $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Tate found its Turners|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4414120.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=15 July 2016|date=8 November 2005|first1=Egmont R|last1=Koch|first2=Nina|last2=Svensson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spanish Romanticism ==

[[Romanticism in Spanish literature|Spanish Romanticism]] emerged in the years following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and reached its apex in the 1840s. Much of Spanish Romanticism serves as criticism of contemporary Spanish society, as seen directly in the ''Articulos de Costumbre'' (essays on customs/daily life) by Larra. Important literary works in Spanish Romanticism include Larra's essays (each article published separately until 1836),  ''Don Juan Tenorio'' by Zorrilla (1844), ''El Estudiante de Salamanca'' (1840) and ''Poesias'' (1840) by Espronceda, and ''Rimas y Leyendas'' by Becquer (1871).

'''Marion Bessie Terry''' (13 October 1853 – 21 August 1930) was an English actress.  In a career spanning half a century, she played leading roles in more than 125 plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,740213-2,00.html Obituary] ''Time Magazine'', 1 September 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Always in the shadow of her older and more famous sister [[Ellen Terry|Ellen]], Terry nevertheless achieved considerable success in the plays of [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henry James]] and others.

==Biography==
Terry was born in England, into a theatrical family.  Her birth name was '''Mary Ann Bessy Terry''', and she was nicknamed "Polly".&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Booth, Michael R. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38758, "Terry, Marion Bessie (1853–1930)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press (2004), accessed 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Benjamin (1818–1896), of Irish descent, and Sarah (née Ballard) (1819–1892), of Scottish ancestry, were comic actors in a touring company based in [[Portsmouth]]&lt;ref name=SB&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/terry/terry-e2.html Biography of Ellen Terry at the Stage Beauty website]&lt;/ref&gt; (where Sarah's father was a Wesleyan minister) and had eleven children.  At least five of these became actors: [[Kate Terry|Kate]], [[Ellen Terry|Ellen]], Marion, Florence and [[Fred Terry|Fred]].&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Michael R. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36460 "Terry, Dame Ellen Alice (1847–1928)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 4 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Two other children, George and Charles, were connected with theatre management.&lt;ref&gt;Hartnoll, pp. 815–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry's sister Kate was a very successful actress until her marriage and retirement from the stage in 1867, and her sister Ellen became the greatest Shakespearean actress of her time.  Her great nephew (Kate's grandson), Sir [[John Gielgud]], became one of the twentieth century's most respected actors.&lt;ref name=Answers&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/ellen-terry Terry Biography at Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Terry,+Dame+(Alice)+Ellen Hutchinson encyclopedia article on Terry family]&lt;/ref&gt; Terry attended a boarding-school for girls at Sunnyside, [[Kingston upon Thames]], together with her favourite sister, Florence.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Career===
Terry's first professional stage appearance was in July 1873 as Ophelia in a production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' directed by [[Tom Taylor]] in Manchester.  Her first West End appearance came in October 1873 as Isabelle in a farce by [[John Maddison Morton]], ''A Game of Romps'' at the [[Olympic Theatre]], in the company of [[Henry Gartside Neville|Henry Neville]].  This was followed by the role of Lady Valeria in Morton's ''All that Glitters Is Not Gold'' at the same theatre.  In 1874, she was Hero in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' at the Olympic.  She then played a season at the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and in 1875 appeared in ''Weak Woman'' by [[H. J. Byron]].

[[File:MarionTerry1882.JPG|left|thumb|Marion Terry, c. 1880]]
Terry next joined the company at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] and became a protege of [[W. S. Gilbert]],&lt;ref name=Stedman158&gt;Stedman, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; soon appearing in several of his plays, including ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876) as Dorothy,&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1876 revival),&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' (1877 revival) and ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), creating the role of Belinda Treherne with great success.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Also during that period, she first appeared in ''The Danischeffs'' by Lord Newry (1876), ''Fame'' by C. M. Rae (1877), ''Charles XII'' by [[James Planché]] (1877 revival),&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ne'er-do-Weel|The Vagabond]]'', by Gilbert (1878),&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; ''Two Orphans'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Crushed Tragedian'',&lt;ref name=Stedman158/&gt; and ''My Little Girl'' by [[Dion Boucicault]].  In 1879 she moved to the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] under the management of [[Squire Bancroft|the Bancrofts]] and then moved with the company to the Haymarket, performing in revivals of [[T. W. Robertson]]'s comedies, including as Blanche Haye in ''Ours'' and Bella in ''School''.  In 1879 she also appeared as Mabel in ''Duty'' by James Albert and the title role in ''[[Gretchen (play)|Gretchen]]'' by Gilbert.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Now an established actress, Terry continued to play leading roles in contemporary plays.  She was Bathsheba in the stage adaptation of ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' by [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[J. Comyns Carr]] (1882).  The same year, she starred with [[Lottie Venne]] and [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]] in G. W. Godfrey's comedy ''The Parvenu'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20050305home.html Footlight Notes No. 389] at Footlightnotes.tripod.com, accessed 18 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She substituted for her sister Ellen, who was ill, as Viola in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in 1884.  In 1885 she played in ''The Magistrate'' by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]].  In 1887, she joined the company of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] first at the [[Comedy Theatre]] and then at the Haymarket.  That year, she also appeared in ''The Ballad-Monger'', by Walter Bessant.  In February 1888, she starred in a revival of Gilbert's ''[[Broken Hearts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/broken_hearts/intro.html Introduction to ''Broken Hearts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829120846/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas//other_gilbert/broken_hearts/intro.html |date=29 August 2008 }}, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she toured the British provinces with [[Henry Irving]] in another of her sister Ellen's roles, Margaret in ''Faust''.  She played Mrs. Erroll in ''The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy'' (1889),&lt;ref&gt;Foulkes, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in ''Cyrene'' by Alfred C. Calmour (1890), and appeared in 1891 in  ''Sunlight and Shadow'' by R. C. Carton.  She continued to tour with Irving's Lyceum company in the 1890s, as Rosamund in [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s ''Becket'', as Portia in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (one of her sister's signature roles), and again as Margaret.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:GilbertinRosencrantz.jpg|thumb|right|Terry and [[W. S. Gilbert]] in ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'']]
In 1892 Terry played perhaps her most famous role, Mrs. Erlynne in ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', by [[Oscar Wilde]], at the [[St James's Theatre]].  This was followed by Hetty in ''The Cotton King'' by Sutton Vane Sr. (1893).  In 1895, she appeared in ''Alabama'' by [[Augustus Thomas]], in the title role in ''Delia Harding'' by [[J. Comyns Carr]], and as Mrs. Peverel in ''[[Guy Domville]]'' by [[Henry James]].  In 1900 she played the roles of Rosalind and Portia at the Stratford festival.  She was Nina in ''Forgiveness'' by J. Comyns Carr (1901), the title role in ''Eleanor'' by [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphrey Ward]] (1902), Susan Throssell in ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'' by [[J. M. Barrie]] (1902), and Audrie in ''Michael and His Lost Angel'' by [[Henry Arthur Jones]], among many other engagements.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1907, Terry performed in a [[Royal Command Performance]] of the 1855 [[Tom Taylor]] play, ''Still Waters Run Deep'', together with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], before [[King Edward VII]].&lt;ref name=stage&gt;Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-commnd.html A History of the Royal Command Performance], StageBeauty.net, accessed 16 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She played Hamlet's mother in a 1908 revival of Gilbert's parody of ''Hamlet'', ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]''.  She toured in America and Canada in 1908 and 1909.  Her last role was the Principessa della Cercola in ''Our Betters at the Globe'' by [[Somerset Maugham]] in 1923, fifty years after her first professional appearance.  Suffering from arthritis and other ailments, she retired from the stage.  In her last years, Terry lived in [[Paddington]], after having lived for many years at Buckingham Palace Mansions.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 22 August 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry died at her home in 1930, aged 76, of a cerebral haemorrhage and was buried at St Albans cemetery.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; She never married and, intensely private offstage, nothing is known of her romantic life.  She left an estate of more than £12,000.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

The '''Martinengo Altarpiece''' is a painting by the Italian [[High Renaissance]] painter [[Lorenzo Lotto]], finished in 1516. It is housed in the church of [[Santi Bartolomeo e Stefano (Bergamo)|Santi Bartolomeo e Stefano]] in [[Bergamo]] in northern Italy.

==History==
On 15 May 1516, Lotto was in Bergamo to sign a contract for a large altarpiece for the high altar of the church of San Bartolomeo, funded by Alessandro Martinengo Colleoni, who had chosen the church as the family's new burial place (the outstanding [[Colleoni Chapel]] is located nearby). It was finished three years later, as testified by the signature, and was paid 500 [[ducat (Italian coin)|ducats]].

The painting, the largest ever painted by Lotto, was once accompanied by a series of minor panels, which were dispersed in the following centuries and have been only partially identified - one is ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Lotto)|The Entombment of Christ]]'' (now in Bergamo).

==Description==
[[File:Lotto, pala martinengo 01.jpg|left|240px|thumb|Detail with an angel and the lion.]]
The subject of the painting is a [[Holy Conversation]], with the Virgin and the Child sitting on a throne surrounded by saints. The scene is set in a majestic architecture perhaps inspired by [[Bramante]] style. In the center, where the dome should be, is the [[tholobate]], whose pendentives decorated with Mark and John the Evangelists. Two angels are watching from a balaustrade, perhaps inspired by [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s [[Camera degli Sposi]]. Two other angels fly over Mary holding her crown.

The interpretation of the numerous symbols of the picture is disputed. Some of the objects could be taken from Francesco Colonna's ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', alluding to the rule of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] in Bergamo, of which Martinengo was a supporter. The inscription in the upper part, saying ''Divina Suave'', would be a reference to Venice.

In the lower part, the Virgin sits on a throne having a zoomorphic base, whose lion paws are a reference to [[St. Mark's Lion]], symbol of Venice. The lion is also peeping from behind the throne, on the left. There is a total of ten saints, including St. Alexander, eponymous of the donor, portrayed with a scintillating armor and, perhaps, with the face of Martinengo himself. His wife Barbara is also portrayed next to him, as the saint with the same name.

The two child angels in the low foreground are a typical element in Lotto's works.

The work is signed and dated "Laurentius / Lotus / M.D.XVI".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11985">{{Translation sidebar}}
'''Multimedia translation''', also sometimes referred to as Audiovisual translation, is a specialized branch of translation which deals with the transfer of [[Multimodality|multimodal]] and [[multimedia]]l texts into another language and/or culture.&lt;ref&gt;González, Luis Pérez. "Audiovisual Translation", in [[Mona Baker|Baker, Mona]] and Gabriela Saldanha (eds.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies'', London, 2009, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and which implies the use of a multimedia electronic system in the translation or in the transmission process.

==Application==
Multimedia translation can be applied to  various fields, including cinema, television, theatre, advertisement, audiovisual and mobile device communication.

Audiovisual text can be labeled as multimodal when produced and interpreted by applying a variety of [[Social semiotics|semiotic]] resources or ‘modes’.&lt;ref&gt;Baldry, Anthony and Paul J. Thibault. ''Multimodal Transcription and Text Analysis'', London &amp; Oakville: Equinox, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  When various modes, such as [[language]], [[image]], [[music]], [[colour]] and [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] are combined together in different forms of media, with the major role attributed to the screen, audiovisual text can be described as multimedial.&lt;ref&gt;Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Multimedia'' [Interview]. Hightech (August 1991): 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this, called multimodal transcription, is used in cinema.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Christopher J.|year=2003|title=Multimodal Transcription in the Analysis, Translation and Subtitling of Italian Films|journal=The Translator|volume=9|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1080/13556509.2003.10799153}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film is broken down into frames, shots or phases.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Every frame, shot or phase is analyzed, looking for all the semiotic modalities operating within each one.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Academic study of multimedia translation==
The translation of multimedia creative works is a subject of academic research, a subtopic of [[translation studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Cintas, Jorge. ''New Trends in Audiovisual Translation''. Bristol/Buffalo/Toronto: Multilingual Matters. 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-84769-154-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This interdisciplinary field draws from a wide range of theories, such as globalisation and post-globalisation theories, reception studies, relevance theory, social science and cultural studies, social psychology and deaf studies'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlović|first=Nataša|year=2004|title=Addressing Power and Solidarity in TV Subtitling|journal=Across Languages and Cultures|volume=5|issue=2|pages=211–232|doi=10.1556/Acr.5.2004.2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Modes of translation==
This kind of translation is strongly influenced, both in the form and in the substance of its creative process, by the process and type of device employed. Specific limits are imposed by digital graphics, and by timing and mode of use.

=== Dubbing ===
[[Dubbing (filmmaking)|Dubbing]], sometimes known as "lip-synchrony", involves both the translation and its [[Synchronization|synchronisation]] as well as dubbing the actors' and actresses' performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isabel|first=Ana|last2=Bartolomé|first2=Hernández|last3=Cabrera|first3=Gustavo Mendiluce|year=2005|title=New Trends in Audiovisual Translation: The Latest Challenging Modes|url=http://www.miscelaneajournal.net/images/stories/articulos/vol31/bartolome31.pdf.|journal=Miscelánea|volume=31|pages=89–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once considered the most comprehensive form of translation, dubbing follows the "timing, phrasing and lip movement of the original dialogue" as closely as possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Audiovisual Translation Theories, Methods And Issues|last=Pérez-Gonzalez|first=Luis|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this mode is usually interlingual, there are some cases of intralingual dubbing, but it is not very common.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Subtitling ===
The most extensively studied mode of multimedia translation, [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] is the linguistic practice showing written text on a screen that conveys "a target language version of the source speech."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consisting of many sub-types, the one most commonly used is interlinguistic subtitling, which is usually displayed in open [[Closed captioning|captions]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In places where several languages are spoken, bilingual subtitles are used to show two different language versions of the source text at the same time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Voice over ===
[[Voice-over|Voice over]] involves the original [[soundtrack]] and the translation being broadcast simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the beginning, only the original can be heard, but the volume is lowered while the translated version becomes more noticeable until the end.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation gives a realistic effect, so it is usually used in documentaries or interviews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voice over is considered a "cheap alternative to dubbing" so it is the first choice for translating films in former [[Communist state]]s and some countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Interpreting ===
[[Language interpretation|Interpreting]] is "the oral translation of an audiovisual product by only one speaker."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Interpreting consists of many different types, such as simultaneous, live, consecutive or prerecorded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode is usually used in live [[interview]]s and news broadcasts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Surtitling ===
[[Surtitles|Surtitling]] is similar to subtitling, however it consists of one continuous line displayed with no interruption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Becoming more frequent in [[Theater (structure)|theatres]] and [[Opera house|operahouses]], the translation is displayed either above the stage or on the backs of seats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite being shown in real time, the translations are prepared in advance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Free commentary ===
Free commentary is the variation of an audiovisual source to an entirely new audience and the cultural factors or new goals involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is delivered with a spontaneous tone, so the end product is completely different from the original.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is generally no attempt to stay faithful to it, resulting in a translation that usually provides either more details or omissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation is generally used when literacy is not the main goal, such as in [[Children's television series|children's television shows]], [[Documentary film|documentaries]], humorous videos, [[Parody|film parodies]] and [[corporate video]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Partial dubbing ===
Also known as "half-dubbing" or "concise synchronisation", consists of adding a prerecorded spoken text to the original [[soundtrack]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While not being a full translation, it provides the necessary information in the target language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Narration ===
[[Narration]] consists of preparing, translating and condensing a text in advance which is then read by dubbing actors and actresses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal is to provide a faithful, scripted summary of the original speech.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It can be pre-recorded or performed live.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The difference between narration and dubbing is that the text is being read, not performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Narration is also similar to voice over, but is different in that the final product is more condensed and is not always completely faithful to the original's style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Simultaneous translation ===
Also known as "sight translation", simultaneous translation is done on the spot from a prepared script in the target language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is different from interpretation in that "it takes this second foreign language as a pivot language".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is used when more elaborate methods of audiovisual translation are not an option, due to time or funding constraints.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, it is only used in film festivals and film archives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Live subtitling ===
Also known as "real-time subtitling", it differs from regular subtitling in that the [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] are not prerecorded and are instead inserted on the spot.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia of translation is used for live broadcasts for those who are hard of hearing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A "respeaker" takes the original sound and dialogue of a live program or event and "respeaks" it into a speech recognition software.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This new version includes punctuation marks and specific features for this audience, which is then turned into subtitles with as little delay as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Subtitling for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (SDH) ===
[[Subtitle (captioning)#SDH|SDH]] is meant for those who have difficulty hearing the dialogue on a film or television show by helping them to "see" the sound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although similar to subtitling, SDH adds additional information to complement the verbal dimension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Originally, these subtitles were only available for films and pre-recorded broadcasts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the "growing number of legislative and regulatory provisions has set minimum quota requirements" for [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling companies.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Audio description (AD) ===
[[Audio description|AD]] is meant for those who are blind, visually-impaired or partially-sighted and assists by providing a narration concerning the visual aspects of a film or television show, for example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The AD track does not interfere with the original dialogue since it is inserted during silent parts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reader, known as an "audio describer", makes sure to balance what is necessary to the plot while not overwhelming the audience with excessive information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These particular descriptions would be recorded, but they can also be done live, (though still prepared in advance) such as in [[Theater (structure)|theatres]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation has become important in "ensuring the accessibility of audiovisual products to the visually impaired."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Animation ===
Animation involves translation as well as script writing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The translator takes silent images, such as cartoons, and creates a script from scratch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although similar to free commentary, it is different in that there is no previous script written in animation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Double version ===
Double versions are products that involve two or more languages in which each actor and actress plays their role in their own language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The final product is then dubbed and synchronised so that there is only one language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Remake ===
Remakes contextualise a film so that they are in accordance with the target audience and its culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These translations focus on values and ideology, so the linguistic aspect of the product is less of a priority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation is mostly used for European films remade for American audiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Teaching==
Since the late 1990s, multimedia translation has found a role in education. B.A and M.A. classes on this subject have been established at several universities across Europe and the United States (Boston, Dallas, Forlì, Genova, Leeds, Londra, Pisa, Pittsburgh, Torino, Udine, Barcelona, Vigo, [[Zurich University of Applied Sciences|Winterthur]]).

'''New York Feminist Art Institute''' (NYFAI) was founded in 1979 (to 1990) by women artists, educators and professionals. NYFAI offered workshops and classes, held performances and exhibitions and special events that contributed to the political and cultural import of the women's movement at the time. The women's art school focused on self-development and discovery as well as art. [[Nancy Azara]] introduced "visual diaries" to artists to draw and paint images that arose from consciousness-raising classes and their personal lives. In the first half of the 1980s the school was named the Women's Center for Learning and it expanded its artistic and academic programs. Ceres Gallery was opened in 1985 after the school moved to [[TriBeCa]] and, like the school, it catered to women artists. NYFAI participated in protests to increase women's art shown at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[The Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums. It held exhibitions and workshops and provided rental and studio space for women artists. Unable to secure sufficient funding to continue its operations, NYFAI closed in 1990. [http://www.ceresgallery.org Ceres Gallery] moved to [[SoHo, New York|SoHo]] and then to Chelsea and remained a gallery for women's art. However, a group continues to meet called [http://www.nyfai.org/currentactivities.html (RE)PRESENT], a series of intergenerational dialogues at a NYC gallery to encourage discussion across generations about contemporary issues for women in the arts. It is open to all.

==History==
New York Feminist Art Institute opened in June 1979 at 325 Spring Street in the Port Authority Building. The founding members and the initial board of directors were [[Nancy Azara]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], Selena Whitefeather, Lucille Lessane, [[Irene Peslikis]] and Carol Stronghilos.&lt;ref name=Rutgers&gt;Fernanda Perrone, Amy Dawson, and Caroline T. Caviness. [http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/ead/manuscripts/nyfaif.html Inventory to the Records of the New York Feminist Art Institute, 1976-1990.] Administrative History. Rutgers. July 2009. Retrieved January 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A board of advisers was established of accomplished artists, educators and professional women.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt; For instance, feminist writer and arts editor at ''Ms. Magazine'' Harriet Lyons was an adviser from its start.&lt;ref name="Love2006"&gt;Barbara J. Love. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;pg=PA24 Feminists who Changed America, 1963-1975]''. University of Illinois Press; 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-252-03189-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the actions of the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|Feminist art movement]], the founders sought to create a community that would inspire women artists and help them assess how their art was created in the "social and psychological context of our identity as women."&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt;

NYFAI Mission (1979): "Our vision of the New York Feminist Art Institute obliges us to act now to create an environment for the training of women in the arts. The challenge is to discover a teaching method which encourages women to use personal experience to create a radiant art of our own. The curriculum of the school involves the development of self-awareness in a social and political context, and the development of a sense of group identity. Work is both collective and individual. Consciousness raising and feminist philosophy are the primary components from which the curriculum organically develops."{{fact|date=October 2017}}

The Joint Foundation provided a grant that allowed the organization to operate initially. The [[American Stock Exchange]], The Eastman Fund, America the Beautiful Fund, [[RCA]], the Ford Foundation and the NEA also provided grants to the organization. It held biannual open houses and annual benefits to raise funds. One of the earliest was very successful and had [[Louise Nevelson]] as a guest of honor.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt; Open house honorees were Alice Neel, Elaine DeKooning, Vivian Browne, Louise Bourgeois, Lenore Tawney, Faith Ringgold, Nancy Spero, Elizabeth Murray and The Guerilla Girls among others.

In April 1981 the organization held a weekend conference "Political Consciousness/ Political Action: Dialogues and Strategies for the 80s" to help women gain a greater sense of personal power and discover ways to engage in the political process.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt; NYFAI also moved to a new location in 1984 in [[TriBeCa]] on Franklin Street, which had gallery space for the cooperative Ceres Gallery, additional space for its school and had rental studio and storage space for artists.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt;

In 1984 they co-sponsored a [[Museum of Modern Art]] protest, "Let MoMA Know: Women Artists Visibility Event (WAVE)," with the Women's Interart Center, [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|the Heresies Collective]], and the [[Women's Caucus for Art]]'s New York chapter. They protested the few numbers of women in MoMA's grand-reopening and "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture" exhibition; Of 165 exhibitors, only 14 of them were women. Buttons with the statement, "The Museum of Modern Art Opens but Not to Women," were worn by 400 protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Arlene Raven, [https://www.questia.com/read/93799051 "The Archaic Smile,"] in New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action, ed. Joanna Frueh, Cassandra L. Langer, and Arlene Raven (New York: Icon Editions, 1994), 12, accessed via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute, which had struggled with ensuring it had sufficient funding for some time, shut down its operations by 1991. [[Rutgers University]] Libraries received its library and archives. The non-profit Ceres Gallery moved in 1992 to SoHo and then Chelsea at 547 West 27th Street.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt;

==Women's Center for Learning/ New York Feminist Art Institute==
The Art Institute focused on self-discovery and art education. First years students participated in consciousness-raising classes developed by Nancy Azara where students created "visual diaries" by recording their feelings and thoughts by writing, painting or writing words into art journals. It taught the history of anthropology and art and feminist theory. Art studies included drawing, sculpture, and painting. It was a program that required inspiration and self-motivation, students did not have grades. Performance was measured by teachers assessments and student self-assessments. Students were offered the opportunity to work as apprentices with professional artists. Part-time students attended weekend workshops and evening courses.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt;

The school added the title the "Women's Center for Learning" in the early 1980s. Focused on personal development, it added writing and psychology classes. Its art program was expanded to include basketry, puppetry, printmaking, papermaking, poetry, filmmaking and much more.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt;

==Ceres Gallery==
'''[http://www.ceresgallery.org/ Ceres Gallery]''' is a feminist, not-for-profit, alternative gallery in New York City, dedicated to the promotion of contemporary women in the arts. Ceres provides an exhibition space that enhances public awareness and helps remediate women’s limited access to commercial galleries. It also serves as a supportive base for a diversity of artistic and political views. Over the years Ceres has encouraged not only artists but writers, musicians, dancers, poets and storytellers to perform in the gallery and take risks with their work that might not be possible in a commercial setting. The members of Ceres Gallery believe the arts provide an important social service - that art has the power to educate, enhance and enrich the quality and depth of people’s lives.
 
Ceres provides a showcase for women artists regardless of age, artistic style or commercial viability to exhibit their work in New York City, many for the first time. All work meets professional standards of excellence but is not restricted in style, medium or theme. Through its progressive programing, the Gallery has become a gathering place for educational and community activities and in addition to providing the general public with a place to expand their knowledge of contemporary art is also a place for women artists to gather for support and friendship. Many artistic and political events are presented throughout the year with participation by gallery artists, artists not affiliated with the gallery and others from the larger arts community. The gallery operates as a cooperative which means members vote on all decisions including the review of possible new members and they participate in monthly meetings to plan the overall direction of the gallery. In addition, Ceres has a professional Director to facilitate the smooth running of all programs and exhibitions. Currently, Ceres has a roster of showing artists from the New York metropolitan area and from across the country with a small number from countries outside the U.S.

'''Ceres Gallery''' was founded in 1984 by Rhonda Schaller, Polly Lai and Darla Bjork, in conversation with NYFAI director, artist Nancy Azara as a program of the New York Feminist Art Institute (NYFAI, 1979-1990). Early members included: Carol Goebel, Phyllis Rosser, Joan Arbeiter, Sandra Branch and Vivien Tsao. The gallery was first located at 91 Franklin Street in Tribeca on the ground floor of the building which housed the New York Feminist Art Institute (NYFAI). Large salon style shows, joint exhibitions and others were held yearly such as: “Reflections: Women in Their Own Image” and “Heroic Female: Images of Power.” In 1993 it moved to 584 Broadway in SoHo where it remained until 2003. Today, Ceres Gallery has 2000+ square feet in one of Chelsea’s premier art destination buildings, The Landmark Arts Building, 547 West 27th Street. Members still at Ceres include Carol Goebel, Phyllis Rosser and Vivian Tsao.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6718">'''Old Comedy''' (''archaia'') is the first period of the [[ancient Greek comedy]], according to the canonical division by the [[Alexandrian grammarians]].&lt;ref name="Mastromarco94"&gt;Mastromarco (1994) p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The most important Old Comic playwright is [[Aristophanes]] – whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. 

==Origins and history==
The origins of the Old Comedy were traced by [[Aristotle]] to the [[komos]] or celebratory festival processions of ancient Greece, and the phallic songs that accompanied them.&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell, ''Aristophanes: Birds and other plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. xvii and p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Although the earliest Athenian comedy, from the 480s to 440s BC, is almost entirely lost, it is clear that comedy had already crystallised into a highly structured form, with the chorus playing a central role.&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell, ''Aristophanes: Birds and other plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. xxx-i&lt;/ref&gt;  The most important poets of the period were [[Magnes (comic poet)|Magnes]], whose work survives only in a few fragments of dubious authenticity, and [[Cratinus]], who took the prize at the [[City Dionysia]] probably sometime around 450 BC. Although no complete plays by Cratinus are preserved, they are known through hundreds of fragments: he was noted in antiquity both for a mastery of plot and for the obscene vehemence of his attacks on [[Pericles]].&lt;ref&gt;J Boardman ed., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (Oxford 1986) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristophanes and his contemporaries==

Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of [[Socrates]] in ''[[The Clouds]]'', and in his racy anti-war farce ''[[Lysistrata]]''. Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were [[Hermippus]] and [[Eupolis]]. Classical literary criticism placed Aristophanes somewhere between the harshness of Cratinus and the smoothness of Eupolis.&lt;ref&gt;H Nettleship, ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (London 1894) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

All the Old Comedy writers worked within a highly structured format – [[parados]], [[agon]], and [[parabasis]] – which paradoxically offered maximum scope for improvisatory flights of fancy.&lt;ref&gt;I Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Song, dance, costume, and chorus all played important roles, as did the [[parody]] of the ‘senior’ drama, [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;S H Butcher, ''Harvard Lectures on Greek Subjects'' (London 1904) p. 175 and p. 181-4&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly due to the influence of tragedy was the important role of a heroic figure in Aristophanic comedy: as [[Northrop Frye]] put it, “In Aristophanes there is usually a central figure who constructs his (or her) own society in the teeth of strong opposition”.&lt;ref&gt;N Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The diminished role of the protagonist (and chorus) in his latest works marks a point of transition to the [[Middle comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell, ''Aristophanes: Birds and other plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later influence/parallels==

'''The Orange Tree Theatre''' is a 180-seat theatre at 1 Clarence Street, [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] in south-west London,  which was built specifically as a [[theatre in the round]].&lt;ref name="Visit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.visitrichmond.co.uk/thedms.asp?dms=13&amp;venue=3500585 | title=Orange Tree Theatre | publisher=[[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]] | work=VisitRichmond | accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed within a disused 1867 primary school, built in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Gothic style]].

The theatre was founded in 1971 by its previous [[artistic director]], [[Sam Walters]], and his actress wife [[Auriol Smith]] in a small room above the Orange Tree pub opposite the present building, which opened in 1991.&lt;ref name="Richmond's Theatres"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.richmond.gov.uk/local_history_richmond_theatres.pdf | title=Richmond's Theatres | publisher=[[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]] | work=Local History Notes | accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Miller (theatre director)|Paul Miller]], previously associate director at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], is the artistic director. He succeeded  Walters, the UK's longest-serving theatre director, who retired from the Orange Tree Theatre in June 2014.&lt;ref name="Appointed"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25049609 | title=Orange Tree appoints Paul Miller as artistic director | work=[[BBC News]] | date=22 November 2013 | accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orange Tree Theatre specialises in staging new plays and rediscovering classics. It has an education and participation programme that reaches over 10,000 people every year.

Since 2014 the theatre has won ten Offies (Off West End Awards), five UK Theatre Awards and the Alfred Fagon Audience Award. It won the Empty Space Peter Brook Award in 2006 and 2015.

==The first Orange Tree Theatre==
As a company the Orange Tree Theatre, then known as the Richmond Fringe, was founded on 31 December 1971 by Sam Walters and Auriol Smith in a small room above [http://www.orangetreerichmond.co.uk The Orange Tree pub],&lt;ref name="Richmond's Theatres" /&gt; close to [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond railway station]].

Six former [[pew|church pews]], arranged around the performing area, were used to seat an audience of up to 80 in number.

Initially productions were staged in daylight and at lunchtimes. But when theatre lighting and window-blinds were installed, matinee and evening performances of full-length plays also became possible. The London critics regularly reviewed its productions and the venue gained a reputation for quality and innovation, with theatregoers queuing on the stairs, waiting to purchase tickets.

==The new Orange Tree Theatre==
[[File:Orange Tree Theatre, Kew Road, Richmond. - geograph.org.uk - 46374.jpg|thumb|The new theatre and the 2003 extension]]
As audience numbers increased there was pressure to find a more accommodating space, both front and backstage. On 14 February 1991, the company opened its first production across the road in the current premises, the new Orange Tree Theatre. The theatre is housed within a converted primary school, St John's, which had been built in 1867 and had become derelict; the school was in [[Victorian Gothic]] style and the architect is likely to have been [[Arthur Blomfield]].&lt;ref name="Cherry and Pevsner"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The Buildings of England]]&amp;nbsp;– London 2: South | publisher=[[Penguin Books]] | author=[[Bridget Cherry]] and [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] | year=1983 | location=London | page=528 | isbn=0-14-0710-47-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the original theatre, renamed The Room (above the pub), continued to function as a second stage for shorter runs and works in translation until 1997.

===Design and conversion===

The school conversion and construction design were undertaken by Iain Mackintosh as head of the Theatre Projects Consultants team. The design intent was to retain the same sense of intimacy as the old theatre, thus calling for an unusually small acting area.&lt;ref name="Mulryne &amp; Shewring"&gt;{{cite book | title=Making Space for Theatre | publisher=Mulryne &amp; Shewring Ltd | author=Ronnie Mulryne and Margaret Shewring | year=1995 | location=[[Stratford on Avon]] | isbn= 978-1900065009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution was to create, at stage level, no more than three rows of shallow raked seating on any side of the acting area, plus an irregular, timber-clad gallery above of only one row (which helps to "paper the wall with people") under which actors could circulate on two sides to reach the stage entrances at all four corners of the playing space. Foyers and dressing rooms were sited in the rebuilt house of the former headmaster, while the theatre space itself is built where once were the assembly hall and school playground.

Any fears that the special atmosphere of the old theatre would be lost proved unfounded, and close links were formed with the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]] in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], also founded as an in-the-round theatre by Sir [[Alan Ayckbourn]].

£750,000 was raised by an appeal, launched in 1988 by Richmond residents [[Richard Attenborough|Sir Richard]] and [[Sheila Sim|Lady Attenborough]].

===2003 extension===
In 2003 the former [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] building next door to the new theatre was modified and re-opened as a dedicated space for rehearsals, set-building and costume storage, significantly expanding and improving its operation.&lt;ref name="Dowden"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/2702/ | title=Sam Walters | work=Exeunt Magazine | date=21 September 2011 | accessdate=5 September 2014 | author=Neil Dowden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts Council funding===

In July 2014, [[Arts Council England]] removed the theatre from its list of National Portfolio Organisations for 2015–2018 which means the theatre has to bridge the funding gap with that from external sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Miller reacts to loss of Arts Council NPO funding for the Orange Tree|publisher= Orange Tree Theatre|url=http://www.orangetreetheatre.co.uk/news/01-07-14/paul-miller-reacts-to-loss-arts-council-npo-funding-for-the-orange-tree|author= Ben Clare|date= 1 July 2014|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Arts Council England announced that it would be awarding £75,000 to the Orange Tree Theatre over the next three years as part of the Catalyst: Evolve fund which matches fundraised income.&lt;ref name="£75,000"&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.orangetreetheatre.co.uk/about/news/orange-tree-theatre-awarded-75000-in-arts-council-england-funding-over-3-years | title=Orange Tree Theatre awarded £75,000 in Arts Council England funding over 3 years | publisher=Orange Tree Theatre | date=27 July 2016 | accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repertory==
As well as producing the first six plays by [[Martin Crimp]], plays by [[Susan Glaspell]] and developing a reputation for theatrical rediscoveries, the Orange Tree repertory has also included many special seasons for the work of [[James Saunders (playwright)|James Saunders]], [[Michel Vinaver]], [[Rodney Ackland]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Harley Granville Barker]] and [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] and his contemporaries, including [[John Galsworthy]]. In Paul Miller's first season he presented revivals of plays by [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[DH Lawrence]] and [[Doris Lessing]] as well as premiering plays by [[Alistair McDowall]], [[Deborah Bruce]] and [[Alice Birch]]. The theatre's 2014 production of [[Alistair McDowall]]'s ''[[Pomona (stage play)|Pomona]]'' was well received by the critics&lt;ref name="Hitchings"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/pomona-orange-tree--theatre-review-this-dark-new-play-from-alistair-mcdowall-has-the-power-to-suck-us-in-9864812.html | title=Pomona, Orange Tree&amp;nbsp;– theatre review: 'this dark new play from Alistair McDowall has the power to suck us in' | work=[[London Evening Standard]] | date=17 November 2014 | accessdate=14 March 2015 | author=Henry Hitchings}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clapp"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/23/pomona-review-orange-tree-richmond-ned-bennett-alistair-mcdowall-rebecca-humphries | title=Pomona review&amp;nbsp;– fierce dystopian drama with terrific comic edge | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=23 November 2014 | accessdate=14 March 2015 | author=Susannah Clapp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/pomona-orange-tree-theatre-review-brilliantly-creepy-and-compelling-9868724.html | title=Pomona, Orange Tree Theatre, review: Brilliantly creepy and compelling | work=[[The Independent]] | date=18 November 2014 | accessdate=14 March 2015 | author=Paul Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it transferred to the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] and [[Royal Exchange Theatre]] in autumn 2015.&lt;ref name="Wiegand"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/10/alistair-mcdowall-pomona-transfers-to-national-theatre-and-royal-exchange | title=Alistair McDowall's Pomona transfers to National Theatre and Royal Exchange | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=10 March 2015 | accessdate=14 March 2015 | author=Chris Wiegand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ambrose&amp;nbsp;— Pomona"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/11871826.National_Theatre_success_for_Orange_Tree_Theatre_s_Pomona/?ref=rss | title=National Theatre success for Orange Tree Theatre's Pomona | work=[[Richmond and Twickenham Times]] | date=22 March 2015 | accessdate=22 March 2015 | author=Tom Ambrose}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terence Rattigan]]'s ''[[French Without Tears]]'' played two sell-out runs at the theatre then went on a UK tour with English Touring Theatre. Other rediscoveries include work by [[Robert Holman]], [[Sharman Macdonald]], [[Clare McIntyre]] and [[Caryl Churchill]]. New plays have included the world premieres of ''[[Jess and Joe Forever]]'' by [[Zoe Cooper]] and ''[[The Brink (TV series)|The Brink]]'' by [[Brad Birch]], the UK premiere of ''[[Winter Solstice]]'' by [[Roland Schimmelpfennig]] and the European premiere of ''[[An Octoroon]]'' by [[Branden Jacobs-Jenkins]].

==Training directors==
From 1986 to 2014 the theatre ran a trainee director scheme, each year appointing two young assistant directors. Graduates of this scheme included [[Rachel Kavanaugh]], [[Timothy Sheader]], [[Sean Holmes]], [[Dominic Hill]], and [[Anthony Clark (director)|Anthony Clark]]. This was replaced by a Resident Director position in 2014/15. The Orange Tree currently runs an MA in Theatre Directing with [[St Mary's University, Twickenham]] which started in 2016-17.

==Awards==
Since 2014 the theatre has won ten Offies (Off West End Awards), five UK Theatre Awards and the Alfred Fagon Audience Award. The Orange Tree Theatre won the [[The Empty Space|Empty Space Peter Brook Award]] in 2006 and 2015.&lt;ref name="Bowie-Sell"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/orange-tree-wins-the-peter-brook-empty-space-award_39068.html | title=Orange Tree Theatre wins the Empty Space Peter Brook Award | work=What's On Stage | date=3 November 2015 | accessdate=12 November 2015 | author=Daisy Bowie-Sell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 it was the Lonodon regional winner for UK’s Most Welcoming Theatre Award 2017.&lt;ref name="Masso"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2017/regional-winners-uks-welcoming-theatre-2017-announced/ |title=Regional winners of UK’s most welcoming theatre 2017 announced |author=Giverny Masso |date=26 September 2017 |work=[[The Stage]] |access-date=26 September 2017 |publication-date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plateresque''', meaning "in the manner of a silversmith" (''plata'' being [[silver]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), was an [[art]]istic movement, especially [[Architecture|architectural]], developed in [[Spanish Empire|Spain and its territories]], which appeared between the late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and early [[Renaissance]] in the late 15th century, and spread over the next two centuries. It is a modification of Gothic spatial concepts and an eclectic blend of [[Mudéjar]], [[Flamboyant]] Gothic and [[Lombard architecture|Lombard]] decorative components, as well as Renaissance elements of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] origin.&lt;ref name="bozal"&gt;Bozal, Valeriano; ''Art history in Spain: From the origins to the Enlightenment'', pp. 157, 165. Ed Akal (1978). {{ISBN|978-84-7090-025-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Examples of this [[syncretism]] are the inclusion of shields and pinnacles on facades, columns built in the Renaissance neoclassical manner, and facades divided into three parts (in Renaissance architecture they are divided into two). It reached its peak during the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref name="arellano"&gt;Arellano, Fernando; ''The Hispanic American Art'', pp. 13–14. Ed. Universidad Católica Andrés (1988). {{ISBN|978-980-244-017-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Salamanca]], but also flourished in other such cities of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as [[León, León|León]] and [[Burgos]] and in the territory of [[New Spain]], which is now [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="bozal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt; 

Plateresque has been considered down to current times a Renaissance style by many scholars. To others, it is its own style, and sometimes receives the designation of ''Protorenaissance''.&lt;ref name="arias" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marias"&gt;Marías, Fernando; ''The 16th century: Gothic and Renaissance'', p. 24. Ed. Silex Ediciones (2002). {{ISBN|978-84-7737-037-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some even call it ''First Renaissance'' in a refusal to consider it as a style in itself, but to distinguish it from non-Spanish Renaissance works.&lt;ref name="alonso" /&gt;

The style is characterized by ornate decorative facades covered with floral designs, chandeliers, [[festoon]]s, fantastic creatures and all sorts of configurations.&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt; The spatial arrangement, however, is more clearly Gothic-inspired. This fixation on specific parts and their spacing, without structural changes of the Gothic pattern, causes it to be often classified as simply a variation of Renaissance style.&lt;ref name="Bendala2003"&gt;Bendala Galán, Manuel; ''Manual of the Spanish art'', p. 416. Ed. Silex Ediciones (2003). {{ISBN|978-84-7737-099-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In New Spain the Plateresque acquired its own configuration, clinging tightly to its Mudéjar heritage and blending with Native American influences.&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt;

In Spain its development is most remarkable in the city of Salamanca although examples are found in most regions of the country.

In the 19th century with the rise of [[Historicism (art)|historicism]], the Plateresque architectural style was revived under the name of [[Monterrey Style]].&lt;ref&gt;Bendala 2003, p. 739&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name Plateresque came from the silversmith trade. [[Diego Ortiz de Zúñiga]] used it for the first time, applying it to the Royal Chapel of the [[Cathedral of Seville]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="bozal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt;

== Problems of geographical area and consideration as Style ==
[[File:Cañas-Monsteriuo de Santa Maria del Salvador.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Altar plateresque of the [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercian monastery]] of Santa María del Salvador, in Cañas ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]])]]
[[File:Burgos - Convento Sta Dorotea 03.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Tomb of the Saint Juan de Ortega in the church of the convent of Santa Dorotea, [[Burgos]]]]

Traditionally Plateresque has been considered a style exclusively "Spanish", a term also applied to architecture in the Spanish territories held by the [[Crown of Spain|Spanish Crown]] between the 15th and 17th centuries. But by the mid-20th century this geographical connotation was questioned under the arguments of several authors, especially [[Camón Aznar]] (1945) and Rosenthal (1958), who defined Plateresque generically as a unitary amalgam of elements&amp;nbsp;– Gothic, Muslim, and Renaissance. Aznar does not regard it as a style properly denoted as Renaissance, and Rosenthal emphasizes its association with certain buildings in other European countries, mainly France and Portugal, but also Germany and others.&lt;ref name="arias"&gt;Arias de Cossío, Ana María; ''The Art of the Spanish Renaissance'', pp. 90–91. Ed. Encuentro (2009). {{ISBN|978-84-7490-909-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alonso"&gt;Alonso Ruiz, Begoña; ''Late Gothic architecture in Castile: los Rasines'', p. 23. Ed. University of Cantabria (2003). {{ISBN|978-84-8102-304-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nieto Alcaide, Víctor Manuel; Morales, Alfredo José; Checa Cremades, Fernando; ''Renaissance architecture in Spain, 1488–1599'', p. 60. Ed. Cátedra (1989). {{ISBN|978-84-376-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem highlights the imprecision of the name Plateresque and the difficulties inherent in using it to describe productions from a period of confusion and transition between styles, especially since they are characterized by decorative profusion suggesting an attempt to disguise the failure of Spanish architects to develop new structural and spatial ideas. It has even been suggested that this problem could be solved by identifying what is called Plateresque as the replacement of Gothic decoration with  grotesques inspired by the works of the Italian [[Sebastiano Serlio]].&lt;ref name="bassegoda"&gt;Bassegoda Nonell, Juan; ''History of the architecture'', p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Any persuasive argument, however, must admit that the Plateresque or Protorenaissance was an artistic movement that responded to the demands of the ruling classes of imperial Spain, which had just completed the [[Reconquista]] and begun the colonization of the Americas. The Spanish were developing a consciousness of their growing power and wealth, and in their exuberance launched a period of construction of grand monuments to symbolize these with what are now considered national treasures.

== Features ==
=== Spanish Plateresque ===

Typical Plateresque facades, like those of [[altarpiece]]s, were made as carefully as if they were the works of [[goldsmith]]s, and decorated as profusely. The decoration, although of various inspirations, was mainly of plant motifs, but also had a profusion of medallions, heraldic devices and animal figures, among others. Plateresque utilized a wealth of materials: gold plates on [[Battlement|crests]] and roofs, vases, etc. There is evidence of more [[polychrome]] works at the conclusion of the first third of the 16th century, when there appeared heraldic crests of historical provenance and long balustrades, to mention one kind of less busy decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Quesada Marco, Sebastián; ''Dictionary of Spanish culture and civilization'', p. 64. Ed. Akal (1997). {{ISBN|978-84-7090-305-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of decoration for all architectural surfaces led to the creation of new surfaces and subspaces, which were in turn decorated profusely, such as [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] and [[aedicula]]s.&lt;ref name="avila"&gt;Ávila, Ana; ''Images and symbols in the Spanish painted architecture (1470–1560)'', pp 80–83. Ed. Anthropos (1993). {{ISBN|978-84-7658-417-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian elements were also being developed progressively as decoration: [[Rustication (architecture)|rustications]], classical [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], Roman [[arch]]es and especially grotesques.&lt;ref&gt;Amorós, Andrés, y Camarero, Manuel; ''Annotated Anthology of the Spanish literature: history and texts: 16th century'', p. 183. Ed. Castalia (2006). {{ISBN|978-84-9740-125-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoration had specific meanings and can not be read as merely decorative; thus laurels, military shields and horns-of-plenty were placed in the houses of military personnel. In a similar vein, Greek and Roman myths were depicted elsewhere to represent abstract humanist ideals, so that the decorative became a means to express and disseminate Renaissance ideals.&lt;ref name="avila" /&gt;

Plataresque implemented and preferred new spatial aspects, so ''caustrales'', or stairs of open boxes, made their appearance.&lt;ref name="Marías, Fernando p. 163"&gt;Marías, Fernando; ''El siglo XVU: Gothic and Renaissance'', p. 163. Ed. Silex Ediciones (1992). {{ISBN|978-84-7737-037-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were few spatial changes with respect to the Gothic tradition.

=== American Plateresque ===

In America, especially in today's Mexico, various indigenous cultures were in certain stages of development that can be considered Baroque when the Spanish brought with them the Plateresque style. This European phenomenon mixed symbiotically with local traditions, so that pure Gothic architecture was not built in America itself, but the Plateresque mixed with Native American influences, soon evolving into what came to be called American Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alejo Carpentier|Carpentier, Alejo]]; Márquez Rodríguez, Alexis; y García Carranza, Araceli; ''Recovered steps: Essays  of Theory and Literary Criticism'', p. 37. Ed. Fundación Biblioteca Ayacucho (2003). {{ISBN|978-980-276-354-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Plateresque style follows the line of [[Isabelline Gothic|Isabelline]], where decorative elements of Italianate origin combine with Iberian traditional elements to form ornamental complexes that overlay the Gothic structures. We can speak of Plateresque that retains Gothic forms as a basis until 1530. After that date, although it continued to be used and Plateresque ornaments were still evolving, it became part of an architecture that was beginning to incorporate Renaissance ideas. In 1563, with the start of construction of the [[El Escorial|monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial]], the Renaissance architecture was purified through the interventions of [[Juan de Herrera]], which ended the splendor and spread of the Plateresque in the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="arias" /&gt; But in Mexico it was not forgotten, leading to a [[Neo-Plateresque]] style in the 18th century.

In any case the Plateresque, considered or not as a style, and whether exclusively Spanish or more broadly European, represents the transition between Gothic and Renaissance styles.

=== Isabelline Style (15th century) ===
{{Main|Isabelline style|Manueline}}

In the 15th century a tendency to decorate with flamboyance began to develop in the [[Crown of Castile]] from [[Flanders|Flemish]], Islamic and Castilian architecture, which received the name of [[Isabelline Gothic]] because most of the construction was done at the command of [[Isabella I of Castile]]. These ornaments, which were of progressive complexity, did not influence the internal structure of the buildings.

Something similar happened in the same period in Portugal, resulting in what became known as the [[Manueline]] style.

=== Plateresque Gothic (late 15th century–1530) ===

A movement began in late 15th century Spain to disguise Gothic buildings with florid decoration, especially grotesques, but the superficial application of this principle did not change the spatial qualities or architectural structure of those buildings. This process began when the Renaissance arrived in [[Spain]] and architects began copying Renaissance architectural features without understanding the new ideas behind them, that is, without letting go of medieval forms and ideas.

Many of the Plateresque buildings were already built, to which were added only layers of Renaissance ornamentation, especially around openings (windows and doors), and in general, all non-architectural elements, with some exceptions.&lt;ref name="avila"/&gt;

Although the appellation 'Plateresque' is usually applied to the act of superimposing new Renaissance elements on forms governed by medieval guidelines in architecture, this trend is also seen in the Spanish [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] of the time.&lt;ref name="Marías, Fernando p. 163"/&gt;

=== Plateresque Renaissance (1530–1560) ===

This is the period in which the Renaissance had taken hold on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], although it had not yet reached its peak there. That event occurred with the amendments by [[Juan de Herrera]] and [[Philip II of Spain]] to the design of the [[El Escorial|monastery of El Escorial]], whose construction began in 1563.

By that time the decoration, though still profuse, is completely within Italianate parameters and applied to buildings designed according to the logic of Renaissance ideas.

=== Monterrey Style (19th century and first third of 20th century) ===
[[File:Palacio de Monterrey de la Duquesa de Alba.JPG|thumb|270px|Palace of Monterrey]]
[[File:Ayto2.JPG|thumb|270px|Facade of the City Hall of [[Seville]] in the Plaza de San Francisco work by Diego de Riaño]]
{{Main|Monterrey style}}

The Monterrey style arose in the 19th century. It was named after the [[Palace of Monterrey]] in [[Salamanca]], which was built in a Neo-Plateresque style, an [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] of the Plateresque.

The style survived until the early 20th century, featured in national and regional 'revivals'. It spread widely, and though not accepted in the critical circles of academia, some examples can be found on the [[Gran Vía (Madrid)|Gran Vía]] of [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Navascués Palacio, Pedro, y Alonso Pereira, José Ramón; ''La Gran Vía de Madrid''. Ed. Encuentro (2002). {{ISBN|978-84-7490-667-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Of San Antonio Gómez, Carlos; ''The Madrid of the, 98:

In Mexico there was also a new iteration of Plateresque which spread to the Southwestern United States, beginning in the first half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Zuno Hernández, José Guadalupe; ''History of the arts in the Mexican Revolution'', vol. 2, p. 41. Ed. National Institute of Historical Studies of the Mexican Revolution (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; This Neo-plateresque is not to be confused with that of Spain at the end of 19th and early 20th centuries, the so-called Monterrey style.

== Plateresque Revival ==
In the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture]] style centuries later, it was differentiated from the earlier and plainer [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival style]] with the additional refinement of Plateresque and [[Churrigueresque]] detailing. [[Bertram Goodhue]] and [[Carleton Winslow]] Sr. studied [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial structures]] in Mexico before  designing the [[Panama–California Exposition|1915 Panama-California Exposition]] in [[San Diego, California]], that introduced this style to the United States and subsequent widespread popularity. In Mexico there are other examples, such as the [[Palacio de Correos de Mexico]].

'''Political poetry''' brings together [[politics]] and [[poetry]]. According to "The Politics of Poetry"by [[David Orr (journalist)|David Orr]], poetry and politics connect through expression and feeling, although both of them are matters of persuasion.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orr|first=David|date=2008|title=The Politics of Poetry|journal=Poetry|volume=192|issue=4|pages=409–418|jstor=20608250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Political poetry connects to people's feelings, and politics connects to current events. Poetry can also make political references and have real effects on the perception of politics.

Political poetry can impact readers because both politics and poetry express views, with political poetry often defined as being: "a specific political situation; rooted in an identifiable political philosophy; addressing a particular political actor; written in language that can be understood and appreciated by its intended audience; and finally, offered in a public forum where it can have maximum persuasive effect".&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  

Political poetry has existed from the earliest times, including the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Horace]] ( 65 BC – 8 BC).

== Can poetry be political? ==
Some critics argue that political poetry can not exist, stating that politics do not belong with and can not be incorporated with traditional definitions of poetry. One of the most vivid examples of this comes from a 1968 essay, "Studies in English Literature: Restoration and Eighteenth Century", written by A.L. French.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=French|first=A.L.|date=Summer 1968|title=Restoration and Eighteenth Century|journal=Studies in English Literature|publisher=Rice University|volume=8|pages=397–413|jstor=449609}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, French provides criticism of the influential 17th century poet [[John Dryden|John Dryden's]] work, claiming that the majority of praise Dryden receives is due to his political messages rather than the quality of his poetry, which French believes is mediocre. For example, French believes Dryden relies too heavily on excessive allusion to get his messages and themes across; French describes Dryden's work and "his treatment of the body politic in the epic simile".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; French's argument reveals the inherent difficulty of political poetry: the attempt to incorporate the literal (politics), can destroys the fanciful and imaginary qualities that make poetry what it is.

== Britain== 
During the eighteenth century the [[Augustan poetry|Augustan poets]], such as [[Dryden]] and [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] wrote political poetry.

===Working Class Political Poetry ===
Working class women poetry describes the works of the voices behind the machinery and factories of the [[Victorian era]]. Critic Megan Timney&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timney|first=Meagan|date=Spring 2011|title=Mary Hutton and the Development of a Working-Class Women's Political Poetics|url=|journal=Victorian Poetry|volume=49.1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that working-class women poets engaged with nineteenth century class politics and their simple use of diction and themes resonated with. This poetry calls for equality in the workplace, fair compensation and the improvement of working conditions. Meagan Timney examines how working-class women of the Victorian era in Britain were deemed unimportant or unrecognized in comparison to working-class males. As a result of this injustice, many female poets from this time period did not receive the proper recognition they deserved. Many women authors did not receive credit for their works since it was hard to trace an author to her work during this time. Only recently has their history been discovered. Timney&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; argues that working-class women poets engaged with nineteenth century class politics and their simple use of diction and themes resonated with [[Chartism|Chartist]] poetry. In works written by&amp;nbsp;[[Mary Hutton (poet)|Mary Hutton]], she incorporated issues of the day during the 1830s and 1840s by politicizing both gender and class while carefully walking a line of legislative changes and political revolution. Other than&amp;nbsp;Mary Hutton, there are other examples of poetry by other working-class women during the late 1800s through the early 1900s. Besides Hutton, there were also others who had their own stance on the treatment of the working-class. These women poets were helpful because of their influencing ideas for revolutionary change and the commitment to justice. Hutton, a Chartist Poet, focused on political subjects and observed the workings of justice and how women of the working class were treated. Working-class women often were denied access to the reforms of the Chartist movement thus denied the right to fight for their worker's rights. Current research of Mary Hutton has opened doors for further research on female working poets like Hutton to be credited as equal to other working class writers. The importance of this poetry highlights the specifics of the working class during this time period, and how work matters to society.

== Irish political poetry ==
In the 1840s political poetry was widely distributed in a newspaper called ''[[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]]''. This was intended to spread nationalism across Ireland. In 1843 some of the major contributors of the newspaper were&amp;nbsp; [[Thomas Davis (Young Irelander)|Thomas Davis]],&amp;nbsp; [[Charles Gavan Duffy]], and&amp;nbsp; [[John Blake Dillon]]. They produced an anthology of poetry titled ''The Spirit of the Nation'', which consisted of politicised poetry with heavy nationalistic tones and motives, much like the newspaper.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The contemporary Irish critic and poet [[Eavan Boland]]''&amp;nbsp;''argues that the act of a woman writing poetry in Ireland is a political act in itself due to the traditional exclusion from the art.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boland|first=Eavan|date=1995|title="Writing the Political Poem in Ireland"|url=|journal=The Southern Review|volume=31.3|pages=484–492}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prolific Irish poet&amp;nbsp;''[[Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill]]&amp;nbsp;''asserted, "the image of women in the national tradition is a very real dragon that every Irish woman poet has to fight every time she opens her door". The political poem's roots in Ireland are very male centric, both in who was writing it and also the subject matter. Women often had no voice or were objectified, and put into the traditional housewife role in Ireland's poetic history. Political Poetry was widespread across Ireland in the mid 19th century: "The national and the feminine [was] frequently mixed in the rhetoric of the newspaper" (Boland). This association repressed the female voice in the poetry of Ireland. Since then there have been many successful female political poets from Ireland.&amp;nbsp;

== Mexican women's poetry ==
Critic Christopher Conway argues that in the disarray of the [[Mexican–American War|U.S.-Mexican War of 1846-1848]], many Mexican writers recognized that the losses their country was facing were due to the disconnection among their people. Writers responded to this in a number of ways, but most notably through a new dimension of women's poetry. [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|Centralists]] and [[Second Federal Republic of Mexico|Federalists]] did not stand together which ultimately mounted to the countries losses, and writers saw that the country needed national unity.

[[:Category:Mexican women poets|Mexican female poets]] utilized poetry as a way to speak out about the war without being criticized or ignored because of their gender. Women during the U.S.-Mexican War were marginalized and could not hold high political positions. In order to be heard, they created poems and literature. Women poets would go on and form a "sisterhood" of poets that stood up and collectively spoke out against Mexico's government and its failures.

Writing poetry brought empowerment to Mexican women during the US- Mexican war 1. These poets utilized poetry as an approach to voice their feelings in a way where they could feel comfortable without the direct judgement from public figures as well as the men in their lives. Conway explains that "... women began to represent and share their experiences through poetry, thereby carving out space for their voice to be heard by the educated women who constituted the primary readership of literary print material in Mexico..." 1 During the war, Mexican women took on many important roles like republican spies, smugglers, nurses, and conspirators. But as the war went on, the European notion that women belonged at home started to take over and the term of "angel de hogar" (angel of the hearth) became a strong belief. Women were denied education: &amp;nbsp;"... we find a staged dialog between various men and women at a [[tertulia]] over the merits of the prospectus of the magazine, which calls for the education of women 'Some argue against women's education, seeing it as a threat to men, whereas others disagree, arguing that that women need to be educated to strengthen marriage and motherhood' (Gondra 1841,15)" 1. Although women had many important roles during the US-Mexican war, men and some women alike feared that women with education would become a threat to the "masculine sphere of politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=Christopher|date=2012-09-07|title=Sisters at War: Mexican Women's Poetry and the U.S.-Mexican War|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/485043|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=47|issue=1|pages=3–15|doi=10.1353/lar.2012.0031|issn=1542-4278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== American ==
=== History ===
American political poetry arguably dates back to the turn of the century.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Assaf Meydania and Nadir Tsurb|first=|date=2014|title=Poetry and poets in the public sphere|url=|journal=Israel Affairs|volume= 20| issue =  2|pages=141–160|doi=10.1080/13537121.2014.889889}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first political poems was written in 1930 by [[Uri Zvi Grinberg]], a poem titled "I Hate the Peace of Those who Surrender". "The East of the Jordan", by [[Zeev Jabotinsky]], is another poem; a more modern poetry book is ''Democracy in Contemporary U.S. Women's Poetry'' written by Nicky Marsh;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democracy in Contemporary U.S. Women's Poetry|last=Marsh|first=Nicky|publisher=Palgrave|year=2007|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; political poetry originates from all around the world, however, it is viewed with distinctive variations. Through the reader's point of view, political poetry conveys and expresses political aspects which then shapes how it is read, "Poetry might be perceived as political by its audience even if the writer did not mean to convey a political message or ideas, values, praise, or criticism."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Poetry uses emotion to convey messages that poets to get across, incorporating the use of culture and politics. Politics, however, has always been heavily involved with complex issues that cannot be solved with emotion alone. [[John F Kennedy]], the 35th president, linked poetry to politics when he said: "If more politicians knew poetry, and more poets knew politics, I am convinced the world would be a better place in which to live." The effectiveness of poetry draws from reader experience and emotion; politics, however, is mostly used to convince their audience. Political poetry incorporates these two ideas together, creating something that both influences the audience and convinces them as to the main idea of the poem. [[William Butler Yeats]], an Irish senator in 1922, believed that "rhetoric stems from our confrontations with others while poetry stems from our confrontations with ourselves".

=== American Indian political poetry ===
In "Surviving the War by Singing the Blues: The Contemporary Ethos of American Indian Poetry", author and critic [[Rebecca Tsosie]] argues that the creation of American Indian political poetry in the 1890s was strongly inspired by the struggles and oppression American Indians faced. American Indian Political Poetry consists of poetry and music written by politically-motivated American Indians in order to raise awareness and call for change. Many poets, such as [[John Trudell]] and [[Wendy Rose]], represent the hardships that American Indians face in their poetry to "ignite and create a unified, spiritual flame".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Surviving the War by Singing the Blues: The Contemporary Ethos of American Indian Poetry|last=Tsosie|first=Rebecca|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid to late 1980s, influential poets and musicians, such as John Trudell and [[Jesse Ed Davis]], created musical poems about American Indian hardships. Although American Indian political poetry originated in the 1890s, "numerous Indian poets such as Wendy Rose, [[Paula Gunn Allen]], [[Leslie Marmon Silko|Leslie Silko]], [[Philip Minthorn]], and [[Maurice Kelly indian poet|Maurice Kelly]]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; continue to write political poetry in the present day. The messages each artist sends are relayed through the use of poetry and traditional music. The poetry and music written by many Indian poets expose the tragic events American Indians experienced, such as the fight to obtain clean water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-06-16/some-native-americans-lack-access-to-safe-clean-water|title=Left Behind|last=Risen|first=Tom|date=June 16, 2016|website=US News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (issues that are not often talked about). Tsosie asserts "contemporary Indian poets... utilize the strength of their traditional past to address the critical issues of present and future".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the struggles faced by American Indians, such as being generalized as being one group rather than being acknowledged as distinct groups, are caused by Western stereotypes. American Indian poets present ideas to deal and cope with the unjust ways they were treated. Tsosie argues "Ward Churchill... notes a central continuity between the 19th century Ghost Dance vision and the contemporary politically motivated poetry of many American Indians".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The purpose of the [[Ghost Dance]] was for American Indians to be able to challenge the injustices and repression that occurred during this time.

Poetry has been used to criticize events in America, calling the government into question or being used to show the viewpoint of citizens. One example of this is the government's handling of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Hurricane Katrina was a natural disaster which devastated the Gulf Coast region and many people lost their homes and families to both the storm and subsequent man-made disaster. In, "Hip Hop as Disaster Recovery in the Katrina Diaspora", Zenia Kish&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kish|first=Zenia|date=September 2009|title="My FEMA People": Hip-Hop as Disaster Recovery in the Katrina Diaspora|url=|journal=American Quarterly|volume=61|pages=671–692}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates the political role that [[Political hip hop|hip hop]] played in an effort to portray a positive view of the residents that were criticized and labeled as "refugees" during hurricane Katrina. The music created after Hurricane Katrina demonstrated how influential it can be by "... giving a voice to 'those who are losing their own.'" The music that was created in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was a way to express the injustices of treatment and media representation. Many African-Americans who had just lost their homes and loved ones were being labeled as refugees instead of disenfranchised victims who lost their housing. This hip hop music movement is similar to the birth of the [[blues]] music genre. These types of music were created in response to a natural disaster and to represent how African-American and other minority cultures had been affected. This also gave hip hop artists motivation to criticize the mainstream media as well as the U.S. government and [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] for the lack of support for the victims. &amp;nbsp;By using musical and lyrical forms of poetry, artists brought awareness to survivors that were mislabeled as refugees. Local artists Mia X and 5th Ward Weebie both used the platform of hip hop to express the difficulties their community was experiencing in the aftermath of Katrina. More popular and mainstream artists such as [[Jay-Z]] and [[Kanye West]] used this platform to speak out against the prejudice against those affected by hurricane Katrina. A notable example of criticism comes from an off-the-script speech during [[A Concert for Hurricane Relief#Kanye West controversy|A Concert for Hurricane Relief]] where Kanye West candidly exposed double standards in the media when it came to the ethnicity of looters. This was similar to [[Richard McWilliam|Richard Macwilliam's]] political poem, "A Time of Change", where he pinpoints poverty and alienation as possible causes of the September 11 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://richardmacwilliam.com/a-time-of-change/|title=A Time of Change|last=Macwilliam|first=Richard|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chicano political poetry ===
[[Chicano]] political poetry thematizes [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] empowerment and addresses inequality. According to critic Adolfo Ortega: "Chicano poetry [was] an aesthetic medium of considerable impact on the [Chicano] Movement...[it] helped give vision to the Movement; its power loomed early."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;In mid-century America, many Mexican-Americans were disenfranchised and didn't have the same rights as white Americans. In 1965, [[Corky Gonzalez]] (a Chicano poet) assembled a Chicano youth conference attended by many social activists and poets.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortega|first=Adolfo|date=Spring 1977|title=Of Social Politics and Poetry: A Chicano Perspective|journal=Latin American Literary Review,|volume=5|issue= 10|pages=32–41|jstor=20119059}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gathering led many young and creative artists to organize to advocate for increased social, political, and economic rights. The [[Chicano Movement|Chicano movement]] used poetry to address these issues to Americans inside and outside the mainstream socio-political establishment. Adolfo Ortega, a famous Mexican-American political poet, in 1965 addressed the Chicano Movement, saying: "The Chicano Movement gave birth to a cultural consciousness that resulted in an explosion of artistic talent, poets, novelists, painters, sculptors, and musicians set out to recapture the Chicano world-vision."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; One example of Chicano political poetry is the poet Alurista, who wrote in bilingual verse to call for equality:

&lt;poem&gt;raza ain 't you tired
raza ain't you tired
of the nagging
tell the man
"the cosa es mia [the thing is mine]
and i ain't taking a number this time
i won't wait in line
this time i come in bailando [dancing]
a recoger mi cosa [to pick up my thing]
the man, he nagging?&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Asian American political poetry ===
Asian American writers must often confront racial bias that seeks to diminish their work. Dorothy Wang&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asian American Poetry and the Politics of Form|last=Wang|first=Dorothy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Srikanth|editor-first= Rajini|editor2=Song, Min|location=Cambridge|pages=437–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that there is a bias against [[Asian Americans|Asian-American]] writers because of their race. Wang states that the: "marginalization of Asian American poetry is, arguably, a synecdochic reflection of the larger state of poetry in a capitalist society – poets tend not to write best sellers and poetry has no use-value – yet the erasure of poetry within literary purviews bespeaks a more profound and troubling fundamental misapprehension within American literary (and racial) ideologies: the (mis)reading, even if mostly unconscious, of the category of 'Asian American poetry'  as oxymoronic, a contradiction in terms, one that pits the sociopolitical (read: racial) against the aesthetic (the formal, the "purely" literary) in a false binary."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The lack of attention to race in poetry can cause Asian American's contribution to the poetic world to become almost nonexistent. Asian American literature has been taught in English departments across the country only for the past few decades and much of it has third-class status. Many American minority poets were not recognized for their poetry. For example, the 2008 PMLA "The New Lyric Studies" and in the"Poetry and Society" were two awards where minority poets were not acknowledged for their poems.

The multicultural [[Asian American movement]] in the 1960s and 1979s strived to include Asian American poets and artists into the mainstream media. Asian American poets wrote embracing the concept of"yellow power" similar to the"[[Black Power|black power]]" movement, that would help them rise to be a larger part of the American poetic scene.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They searched to express themselves on a larger media base in order to erase any [[racial profiling]] that comes along with their appearance. They wanted to be seen as normal American writers, not ethnic writers.

[[Mei-mei Berssenbrugge]] (b. 1947) is a Asian American political poet who came to the United States of America from Beijing at the age of one. Berssenbrugge identifies herself as a racially minoritized biracial poet in the language of her poetry. She wants to be seen as an American poet, where her racial profile is overlooked so that when people read her work, she is seen as an American writer and not an Asian one, a political choice.

In "Fog", Berssenbrugge relatives are crossing a long bridge because of how long it will take for them to finally be accepted into society as normal Americans. The following two lines are from "Fog": "It has no shape or color that is stable, as if I had fallen asleep and a long bridge / appeared, where my relatives are like companions crossing a bridge." Her critique of racial identity tends to be indirect; however, as Berssenbrugge mentioned in a 2006 interview, "I try to expand a field by dissolving polarities or dissolving the borders from one thing and another." Therefore, her presentation of race and racial identity are "not marginal to her poetry but central to her project of desiring to dematerialize whatever...keeps states of being and of nature separate." She uses her understanding of the world to combine two, unlike entities into a much larger picture.

Another example of politics being shown in Asian American poetry is in "Chinaman, Laundryman" (1928) written by H. T. Tsiang (1899–1971):

&lt;poem&gt;My skin is yellow,
Does my yellow skin color the clothes?
Why do you pay me less
For the same work&lt;/poem&gt;

Tsiang recognizes the inequalities faced by Asian Americans as they try to root themselves in America. Unlike Berssenbrugge, Tsiang directly mentions his skin color in his poem, and he works for race equality improvements for people of color.

While some Asian American poets tried to hide their race, others did not. Wang concludes that "those who were later to be called 'Asian American' were, from the very beginning, both political (in the broadest sense) and formal, aesthetically self-conscious – never delinked from the social and historical contexts of their making and of the poets' formations".

=== South Asian American political hip hop lyrics ===
African Americans and South Asian Americans share a social connection in the United States: they both have diasporic roots.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip hop Desis : South Asian Americans, Blackness, and a global race consciousness|last=Sharma|first=Nitasha Tamar|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Durham, NC|pages=283–299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharma argues that South Asians in the United States utilize hip hop lyrics to display solidarity with African Americans, sharing the status of racialized minorities in the United States. South Asian hip hop artists also advance a social justice agenda that everyone could benefit from. These South Asian hip hop artists are also known as [[Desi]] artists (plural, Desis). Desi artists recognize the political potency and relevance of hip hop to promote social change: "Hip hop is a powerful lens through which to examine Asian/Black relations not only because of its enormous popularity as a global form but also because hip hop culture is explicit about race, difference, inequality, and power". In the 1980s and 1990s Desi artists were influenced by the messages in black rap music and began to write lyrics that challenged problems South Asian faced as they were adjusting to their new cities and being first and second generation South Asians in the United States. Desis artists hip hop lyrics serve to: "Blu[r] the line between art and politics... cro[ss] racial, class, and national boundaries and is an extension of the racialized political identities that they forge through hip hop".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; [[D'Lo]] is one of the more popular South Asian American hip hop artists and is at the forefront of social change within his community. In his performance piece "Eyes Closed In America", on resistance to discrimination:

&lt;poem&gt;... Behind eyes closed we CAN'T be blinded no more
Envisioning a new world for us all
Where poor ain't a word no more
Where
All the colors of races would be revered as gold
Where class only means the school you go
Where
The only wars would be against discrimination
Where there's free education...&lt;/poem&gt;

Thus, Desi artists approach hip hop as an extension of their social activists work of being political while helping to build the community they live in.

=== American political slam poetry ===
Critic [[Susan Somers-Willett]] asserts that slam poetry began between November 1984 and July 1986, in the Green Mill Jazz Club in Chicago. Slam poetry is a type of "political complaint" and protest that uses identity and other forms to protest oppression.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Politics of Slam Poetry|last=Somers-Willet|first=Susan B.A|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slam poets and audiences see slam poetry not only as literary or performative, but also as a political event.  Somers-Willett argues that: "poems that make an empowered declaration of marginalized identity and individuality are a staple of one's slam repertoire."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Race, gender and sexuality are all factors that affect poets and the message of their work. Slam poets work is an embodiment of their identity and it breaks the homogeneity of traditional poetry structure. But, a poet is not bound to a certain identity based on their culture, sexuality, or race, although many do use identity. Slam poetry's main goals is to express authenticity of identity to its audience. By this, poets will create a genuine and intimate connection with the audience through their identity based experience. Slam poetry revolutionizes of traditional forms of poetry. Slam poetry ranges from comical poems to extremely serious work about racism, sexual identity, violence, and personal struggles with life; slam poetry is the outlet a lot of writers use to express themselves. Many poets write from a "I" stand point where in their poems they describe events that has happened to them personally whether it be a positive or negative experience. "Inhabiting the space where the "I" of the page translates quite seamlessly to the "I" of the stage, the author comes to embody declarations about personal experience in performance." An example of authors using "I" would be Ragan Fox, who wrote To be Straight: "I want to be straight because sometimes being gay is just too difficult." Authors try to reach out to their audience by relating what they say in their poems to how the audience might have felt but never had the courage to say. There are also different ways to perform poetry. Patricia Smith, an African American poet, performed a poem in the voice of a white male skinhead. This shows the opposing party explaining to the audience the hatred and what is going through their minds. Slam poetry can come in various forms, but is a tool that can get a poetic argument across to those who listen.

"The Cultural Politics of Slam Poetry" by Susan B.A. Somers-Willett analyzes different poets and their work. Using poems such as "Thick" by Sonya Renee, "Tongue Tactics" by Mayda Del Valle, and "To Be Straight" by Regan Fox, Somers breaks down how each poet's work is an embodiment of themselves and their individual emotions and struggles. Somers also claims that, "poems that make an empowered declaration of marginalized identity and individuality are a staple of one's slam repertoire".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A poet's work most often aims for authenticity and that in the work itself, the "I" is a reference to the poet. Slam poetry as a literary form and performance originates from Chicago at the Green Mill Jazz Club in 1986 but was first performed less popularly in 1984 around southern U.S. Regardless of its origins in the U.S. slam poetry can be found in many different parts of the world, Somers reinforces the idea that slam poetry differs for each culture, sexuality, and race; each offering a different perspective and worldview.

=== Tupac Shakur's political lyrical content ===
Karin L. Stanford argues that [[Tupac Shakur]] wrote political lyrics: "Tupac's lyrics underscore his refusal to accept economic inequality and inadequate employment opportunities. He also continues his attack on patriotic symbolism...Tupac's life and political advocacy prove that hip hop music and activism are not mutually exclusive....Tupac's political work reveals his aspiration for social change."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanford|first=Karin|date=2011|title=Keepin' It Real in Hip Hop Politics: A Political Perspective of Tupac Shakur|url=|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=42|pages=3–22|doi=10.1177/0021934709355122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tupac's music also focused on civil rights and oppression to minorities. For example, in his lyrics he criticizes Americans who "pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us Honor a man that who refuses to respect us Emancipation, Proclamation, Please! Ni*ga just said that to save the nation These are lies and we all accepted..." This refers back to the revolutionary war when colonists promised African slaves that they would abolish slavery if they aided them in the war. This also shows the struggles that African Americans had to endure throughout history to get to where they are today.

According to Stanford:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; "Although Tupac's discourse was not framed in traditional revolutionary nationalist rhetoric, his political associations, use of language, public statements, and lyrical content suggest that he identified with Revolutionary Nationalism." In the poem "How Can We Be Free", &amp;nbsp;Shakur's lyrics give readers a sense of racism and makes a call for change.

&lt;poem&gt;Sometimes I wonder about this race
Because we must be blind as hell
2 think we live in equality
While Nelson Mandela rots in a jail cell
Where the shores of Howard Beach
Are full of Afrikan corpses
And those that do live 2 be 18
Bumrush 2 join the Armed Forces
This so called "Home of the Brave"
Why isn't anybody Backing us up!
When they c these crooked a? Redneck cops
Constantly Jacking us up
Now I bet some punk will say I'm racist
I can tell by the way you smile at me
Then I remember George Jackson, Huey Newton
And Geronimo 2 hell with Lady Liberty &lt;/poem&gt;

== Salvadoran women political poetry ==
In El Salvador "since 1979, 75,000 Salvadorans have died in politically related violence...over two million live in extreme poverty".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeShazer|first=Mary|date=Summer 1992|title="From Outrage to Reconciliation": Political Poetry by Salvadoran Women|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=4|issue= 2|pages=170–186|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|jstor=4316195}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war women experienced a disproportionate impact. Many of these women have been subjected to rape and other forms of sexual torture by military men. Salvadoran women used poetry to write about this violence. "Salvadoran women's political poetry moves not from language to idea to action...but rather from action and ideas to language."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; DeShazer claims that "poetry is no luxury but instead provides essential, rigorous witness:  to a consistently underreported war against the salvadoran people by the US and Salvadoran governments". Mary DeShazer claims that "Exiled poet Liliam Jimenez's bitter address to Salvadoran soldiers offers a searing indictment of fifty years of military atrocities and employs apocalyptic revenge motifs, fantasies of retributive violence." Women in El Salvador began to collectively stand together to describe their suffering.

According to author Zoe Anglesey: "Our poetry will express our total range of feelings: from Outrage to Reconciliation.  "The voices of less famous women also had a crucial place in the resistance movement and the building of a female literary tradition. Zoe Anglesey writes about how to move on from war: "Young women and men of the future / for you it's waiting / the final moment of transition / for you / the day of infinite purple is reserved / the triumph coppery from our blood / for you will be / the bread and soil of our dreams / the all-night worry of our struggles/ the honey and water of our wounds."

== Alevi political poetry ==
[[Alevism|Alevi]] poetry is a type of political poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dressler|first=Markus|date=2003|title=Turkish Alevi Poetry in the Twentieth Century: The Fusion of Political and Religious Identities|url=|journal=Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics|volume=|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most (proto) Alevi Poetry deals with discrimination and injustice in society. Alevi poetry has a long tradition of dealing with political injustice and discrimination, going back to the 16th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a very strong division between Turkey [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] ideologies.&amp;nbsp;In contrast, the Alevis sided themselves with the left because they were able to have more religious freedom.

Alevi poetry is best exemplified in [[Pir Sultan Abdal]]'s poems. Some poems mix religious and political subjects such as poems themed around the [[Turkish War of Independence]] or the social unrest of the 1960–70s. One example of this is the poem "The Epos of the Liberation" about the War of Independence written by [[Adil Ali Atalay]]:&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;It is grievous to be a prisoner in my own country, &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;My mother cried out, did you hear it, sister? &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;The Mahdi appeared and put the crown on his head, &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;All together they were hurrying as if a revolution had &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;broken out. &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;We were invincible, we became one and complete, &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;We were undividable, we were together with Ata[türk], &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;Not as captives, if we had died we would have been free, &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;The brave men said [this is] the time and place, and [they] &lt;br/&gt;
became heroes

This excerpt shows some structure of a typical Alevi poetry. Alevi culture is an oral culture by which their songs, stories, and poems are orally transmitted, remembered and interpreted. Poems are categorized as Alevi when the author see themselves as Alevi and when Alevi symbols and topics are referred to. The reciter of these poems are called [[Aşıkşenlik|asiks]] (also known as ozan). The term asik literally means "the one in love [with God]" in Turkish and is part of the heritage of popular Turkish culture. This term has been used since the fifteenth century and derives from [[Islamic Mystical Traditions|Islamic mystical traditions]]. Asiks usually play a [[Bağlama|saz]] (a long-necked lute) as they sing the poems. Askis interprets poems of other asiks as well as their own. According to Dressler, their work includes "epic tales, songs of love and devotion, religious hymns, as well as social and political critiques". Epic tales are combined with knowledge of [[Sufism|popular Sufism]]. One of the primary functions of the asik is to spread the Alevis' mystical knowledge and epic traditions by "chanting poems". If there had been no asik institution, Alevi traditions could have disappeared in (proto) [[Alevism]]. An asik is can spread poems and also write new ones, which can give him the "creative power to reinterpret the tradition". Traditionally, this is made by the asik being initiated. That can be done by a recognized asik, by a departed asik in a dream, by a saint (Alevi saint) or by God.

Religious themes of asik poetry are made up of devotion for twelve [[Imam]]s also admired by the [[Twelver|Twelver-Shia]]. Asik tradition is mostly practiced on the countryside and commonly the audience is peasants. Scenes for performances were private homes or coffeehouses. Today, some publishes poems as well.

One reason this political poetry is written is because it's a response to the following event:

On June 2, 1993, in the city of Sivas about thirty-five Alevi people were killed in a hotel fire by the Sunnis. This caused Alevism to go through a process of religious reorientation. Alevi had a constant chain on suffering, due to the Sivas event. The leftists ended up losing their importance and ended up becoming marginalized.

== Nicaraguan political poetry ==
Nicaraguans facing political oppression used political poetry to oppose the Somoza [[Somoza family|regime]] dictatorship in 1978. There were several significance poets who wrote political poetry and spoke out against the grime by using their influence within the community to unite everyone and make a call for action.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman and Banberger|first=Marc and Ellen|date=1984|title=Poetry &amp; Politics In Nicaragua: The Uprising of 1978|url=|journal=Minnesota Review|volume=Number 22|pages=63–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political poetry served as a way for the people of Nicaragua to oppose and advocate for their political rights, to be treated fairly and to have freedom to express themselves without fearing that the regime would retaliate. Marc Zimmerman and Ellen Banberger in their article: "Poetry &amp; Politics in Nicaragua", claim that: "Against U.S. intervention and the Somoza dictatorship, poetry and poeticized political discourse have served as dominant vehicle for ''ideological expression'' and development."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Zimmerman and Banberger list poets who spoke against Somoza including Ernesto Castillo, a young poet determined to share the truth. His poems helped inspire young university students and women to oppose the government that mistreated them and tore their country apart. In his poem "In this Country", Castillo talks about his generation's struggles:

&lt;poem&gt;''"But we were born in Nicaragua''

''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In this country,''

''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We write each other''

''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Letters and poetry,"''

''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not about love,''
 
''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But about struggle..."'' &lt;/poem&gt;

== Kimondo-Kenyan form ==
[[Kimondo (poetry)|Kimondo]] is a form of Kenyan political poetry that often uses satirical elements. Politicians hire poets to write poems that praise them directly while also alluding to the corruptness of the opposer. Athman Lali Omar of Lamu—a poet critic—declares, "Kimondo is lightning and it is an attack".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Njogu|first=Kimani|date=2001|title=Kimondo, Satire, and Political Dialogue: Electioneering through Versification|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/pages.php?pID=91&amp;CDpath=4|journal=Research in African Literatures|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimondo is a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word which means meteor or "satan's firebrand". This style of poetry is used as direct an attack on politicians. The poet's knowledge of particular politicians helps promote their favorable leader, while simultaneously criticizing the opponent.

While kimondo is an older tradition, the modern style of kimondo poetry was established in the late nineteenth century by the [[Waswahili]] of the [[Lamu]] East Constituency of [[Kenya]] on the island of [[Lamu]], located on the northern coast of Kenya, [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amidu|first=Assibi Apatewon|date=|title=Lessons From Kimondo: an Aspect of Kiswahili Culture|url=http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/|journal=Nordic Journal of African Studies|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishing of European institutions is the primary cause for the contemporary kimondo style. Europeans left a legacy of political elections, thus starting a style of campaigning that utilizes poetry for campaign electioneering.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Political election campaigning will at times be conducted through kimondo in order to provide critique of an opponent's competing points of view. This form of political poetry has been written out of satire by popular Kenyan poets in the past who are then hired by parliamentary to present a poem intended for attack and rebuttal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;198. Alipokipata kiti   ----                       When he was elected M.P.,

akipita kwa matiti,       ----                      he used to walk with a strut,

na kuwambia umati    ----                      and used to tell the electorate

Yeo kwenu nimekuja.           ----            "Today, I have got round to you!"

199. Akenda kwa Mdhihiri,   ----         He then went up to Mdhihiri,

kamtukana vizuri         ----                     and insulted him roundly!

huku akiyifahiri,      ----                          And then went on vaunting, saying,

Basi bado nakwambia.     ----               "And this is just the beginning!"

200. Na siku alosimama      ----         And there is the day he stood up

mbele ya wengi kauma          ----          before a large crowd

kwa bayana akasema         ----             and said distinctly

Kiti ni changu sikia.      ----                   "This seat is mine you understand?"

201. Na hapo akatukana         ----     And here too he was abusive.

yaso maana tanena            ----             I shall tell you of his unspeakable words,

watu wafahamu sana      ----                so that people may understand very well

yote alotangazia.          ----                   all that he blurted around the place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;/poem&gt;

The purpose of this poem was to display that Bwana Mzamil (the opposer of &amp;nbsp;Bwana Madhubuti) believed he was indispensable, persuading listeners that he was a bad politician.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kimondo poetry will go back and forth, with the speakers representing their respective sides of the political parties. In these kimondo poems, Madhubuti's poet criticizes Mzamil, and vice versa.

== In the Post-Mao era of China ==
Political poetry in the&amp;nbsp;[[Post-Mao reforms|Post-Mao]]&amp;nbsp;period (1976–1989) was initially used to revere political figures but evolved into a means for protest against communism throughout China. After the death of China's communist leader [[Mao Zedong]], poets chose to write poetry that "[eulogized] the heroes that fought against the gang of four" (Shiao 1983).&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/25205/Yu.Shiao-ling%20Voices%20of%20Protest.pdf?sequence=1|title=Voice of Protests: Political Poetry in the Post-Mao Era|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poets also chose to use martyrs who had died protesting against China's government, as their subjects for poetry. A notable martyr of the time was&amp;nbsp;[[Zhang Zhixin]]&amp;nbsp;who, like many other martyrs, died for her anti-government views.

The historical events that lead to the Post-Mao era was the death of China's leader,&amp;nbsp;[[Mao Zedong]]. China's government was experiencing a power struggle that ended once Deng&amp;nbsp;[[Deng Xiaoping|Xiaoping]]&amp;nbsp;came into power. His reign resulted in social conflicts and lead to the&amp;nbsp;[[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tienanmen Square Protests]].

The influence that poetry had in China lead to its evolution into a tool that freely "exposes the maladies in the political system" (Shiao 1983). Many critics pose the following questions "should literature serve politics?" (Shiao 1983)&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;and "can the writer write about the dark side of society?" (Shiao 1983).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The question of political content and poetic form is at the center of literature versus propaganda.

[[File:Physician Yutog Yontan Gonpo - Google Art Project.jpg|260px|thumbnail|right|The Physician Yutog Yontan Gonpo]]
'''The Portrait of Yutog Yontan Gonpo''' is a 17th-century [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[thangka]] of the [[lama]] and the [[physician]] [[Yutog Yontan Gonpo]] (traditionally 708 - 833&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itmonline.org/arts/tibherbs.htm Institute for Traditional Medicine: Tibetan Herbal Medicine] by Subhuti Dharmananda&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[Tibet]], now in the [[Rubin Museum of Art]] in New York. This style of Tibetan thangka painting is called 'tsal thang' with [[gold]] on a [[vermilion]] ground.

The figure of Yutog Yontan Gonpo is often portrayed surrounded by the five buddhas above, the eight Medicine Goddesses at the sides, his special [[yidam]] Black [[Hayagriva]] accompanied by four goddesses below. The protector [[Mahakala]] Shanglon Dorje Dradul typically placed at the bottom center is accompanied by eight fearsome wrathful protector deities with one face and two or four hands, each riding a [[vahana]]. Four of the retinue figures ride atop wild animal or zombie mounts and each of those has nine heads.

The portrait depicts a clean shaven Gonpo as he stretches the right arm forward across the knee in the [[mudra]] of generosity while holding the stem of a pink lotus flower blossoming over the shoulder supporting the [[wisdom book (attribute)|wisdom book]] and [[sword (attribute)|sword]]. The left placed at the heart holds the stem of another lotus, blossoming over the left shoulder, supporting a [[gold]] [[vajra]] and medicinal nectar vase topped with precious [[cintamani|jewels]]. With a headdress of red flower blossoms, he wears a long flowing garment typical of a layman, trimmed with blue and tied with a red sash. He is surrounded by a blue-orange [[halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] and dark green [[aureola]]. In front, an ornate table supports a large bowl of [[myrobalan]] fruit and precious jewels.

At the top center is the buddha [[Akshobhya]] with one face and two hands holding to the heart with the right a vajra sceptre and with the left a skullcup in the lap. Seated in vajra posture he embraces the consort. At the left is the [[Ratnasambhava]] holding a jewel to the heart and embracing the consort. Below is buddha [[Vairochana]] holding a wheel to the heart. At the right is buddha Amitabha holding a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] flower. Below the buddha [[Amoghasiddhi]] is holding a visva-vajra to the heart surrounded by radiant light.

At the middle right and left are four standing goddesses holding a [[flute]], [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[lute]] and a [[mirror]]. Beautiful in appearance with flowing garments they stand on lotus seats surrounded by light.

At the bottom center is the Medicine Buddha in the form of a wrathful tutelary deity, Black Hayagriva, with one face, and three eyes with a head crowned with a single green [[horse]] head. The right hand holds aloft a curved knife ''([[kartika (knife)|kartika]])'' and in the left a skullcup ''([[kapala]])'' to the heart. On the rear of [[Hayagriva]] two large black wings are unfurled. At the right and left stand four goddesses each with one face and two hands holding aloft in the right a curved knife and a skullcup to the heart with the left, carrying a katvanga staff in the bend of the elbow. Adorned with a tiara of five skulls and various bone ornaments, they each stand on the left leg in a dancing posture surrounded again by radiant light.

'''Preppy''' (also spelled '''preppie''') or '''prep''' (all abbreviations of the word ''preparatory'') refers to a  [[subculture]] in the [[United States]] associated with old [[private education|private]] [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] [[university-preparatory school]]s. The terms are used to denote a person seen as characteristic of a student or [[alumnus]] of these schools. Characteristics of preps in the past include a particular [[Subculture|subcultural]] speech, vocabulary, dress, mannerisms, [[etiquette]], reflective of an [[American upper class|upper-class]] upbringing.&lt;ref name="colman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Colman |first=David |title=The All-American Back From Japan |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/fashion/18codes.html |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The term ''preppy'' derives from the private, university-preparatory or ''prep'' schools that some [[American upper class]] and [[American upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] children attend.&lt;ref name=FashionEncyclopedia&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-1946-1960/Preppy-Look.html |title= Preppy Look| work= Fashion Encyclopedia | access-date= December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''preppy'' is commonly associated with the [[Ivy League]] and [[Colonial Colleges|oldest universities in the Northeast]] and the prep schools which fed students to them,&lt;ref name= Hogan&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mensflair.com/style-advice/the-roots-of-american-preppy.php| first= Chris| last= Hogan| title=  The Roots of American Preppy| website= MensFlair.com| publisher= Men's Flair | date= | access-date= December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; since traditionally a primary goal in attending a prep school was admittance into one of these institutions.&lt;ref name= FashionEncyclopedia /&gt; Preppy fashion derives from the fashions of these old Northeastern colleges in the early to mid-twentieth century. Lisa Birnbach's 1980 book ''[[Official Preppy Handbook]]'', which was written to poke fun at the rich lives of privileged Ivy League and socially elite liberal arts college students but ended up glamorizing the culture, portrays the preppy social group as well-educated, well-connected, and although exclusive, courteous to other social groups without fostering serious relationships with them. Being well-educated and well-connected is associated with an upper-class [[socioeconomic status]] that emphasizes [[higher education]] and high-income professional success.&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt;

For men, preppy fashion has its roots in the [[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League style of dress]], which started around 1912 and [[1945-1960 in fashion#Ivy League|became more established in the late 1950s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Elements of Fashion and Apparel Design | publisher = New Age Publishers | isbn = 81-224-1371-4 |page=25 |quote=Ivy League: A popular look for men in the fifties that originated on such campuses as Harvard, Priceton {{sic}} and Yale; a forerunner to the preppie look; a style characterized by button down collar shirts and pants with a small buckle in the back.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Press]] represented the quintessential Ivy League style, stemming from the collegiate traditions of [[Ivy League]] schools. In the mid-twentieth century [[J. Press]] and [[Brooks Brothers]] both had stores on [[Ivy League]] school campuses, including [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Yale]]. Preppy fashion emerged in the late 1970s with cues from the original Ivy League style. Some typical preppy styles also reflect traditional upper-class leisure activities, once associated with the wealthy English who once had a strong political and social position in the Northeast and New England, such as [[polo]], [[sailing]], [[hunting]], [[fencing]], [[rowing (sport)|crew rowing]], [[lacrosse]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[squash (sport)|squash]]&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt; and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]]. This association with old English inspired outdoor activities can be seen in preppy fashion, through stripes and colors, equestrian clothing, plaid shirts, field jackets, and nautical-themed accessories. By the 1980s, mass marketing of brands such as [[Lacoste]], [[Daniel Cremieux]], [[Izod]],&lt;ref name="Peterson Kellogg 285"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Peterson, Amy T. |author2=Ann T.

For women, preppy-influenced fashions emerged in the 1960s, a trend led by designers such as [[Perry Ellis]] and [[Lilly Pulitzer]], influenced by designers such as [[Oleg Cassini]], and popularized by female students at the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters Colleges]], sister institutions to the [[Ivy League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of New York State |year=2005 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |isbn=978-0-8156-0808-0 |page=550 |editor1-first= Peter R.| editor1-last= Eisenstadt |editor2-first= Laura-Eve| editor2-last= Moss }}&lt;/ref&gt; These classic ensembles of the 1960s and 1970s include tailored skirt suits, low heels, wrap dresses, shift dresses, silk or cotton blouses, and jewelry with a refined style. Such clothing often includes elements drawn from typical preppy style, such as nautical stripes, pastel colours, or equestrian details.

Though traditional interest in preppy style fell in the 1990s,{{according to whom|date=October 2015}} some of the newer outfitters such as [[Polo Ralph Lauren|Ralph Lauren]], [[J. Crew]], [[Vineyard Vines]], [[Gant (retailer)|Gant]], and Elizabeth McKay are perceived as having preppy styles, with designers such as [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Luella Bartley]] adding the preppy style into their clothes in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Camille |date= December 2, 2010| title= The Preppy Look: A Brief History |url= http://www.camillereads.com/2010/12/preppy-look-brief-history.html| website= CamilleReads.com |accessdate= December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of preppy attire include [[Argyle (pattern)|argyle]] [[sweater]]s, crewneck sweaters, [[grosgrain]] or woven leather belts, [[chinos]],&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt; [[madras (cloth)|madras]],&lt;ref name= colman /&gt; [[Nantucket Reds]],&lt;ref name= colman /&gt; [[button down]]&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt; [[Oxford (cloth)|Oxford cloth]] shirts,&lt;ref name="Peterson Kellogg 285" /&gt;  pearl necklaces and earrings, gold bangle or large chain bracelets, [[penny loafers]], polo shirts (often with a popped collar), and [[boat shoes]].&lt;ref name= colman /&gt;

[[File:Edouard Manet 078.jpg|right|thumb|''Rochefort's Escape'']]
'''''Rochefort's Escape''''' ({{lang-fr|L'évasion de Rochefort|link=no}}) is a painting by [[Édouard Manet]] painted in around 1881, currently in the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]]. It depicts the 1874 escape of [[Victor Henri Rochefort, Marquis de Rochefort-Luçay]] from captivity in [[New Caledonia]] to which he had been sentenced for his role in the [[Paris Commune]]. The genre of [[history painting]] traditionally dealt with historic and mythological topics, and ''Rochefort's Escape'' is considered highly significant for its depiction of an event still fresh in public memory. A second smaller version of the painting is in the [[Musée d'Orsay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/levasion-de-rochefort-315.html?no_cache=1|title=Musée d'Orsay: Edouard Manet Rochefort's Escape|publisher=Musée d'Orsay|accessdate=21 August 2016|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Polypodium vulgare Moore1.png|thumb|Plate 1 of the title&lt;br&gt;''[[Polypodium vulgare]]'']] 
'''''The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland''''' was a book published in 1855 that featured 51 plates of [[nature printing]] by [[Henry Bradbury]].

==Description==
The text was a scientific description of all the varieties of [[Fern]]s found in the [[British Isles]]. The author of this work was the botanist [[Thomas Moore (botanist)|Thomas Moore]], the editor was [[John Lindley]].

The book was released at a time of so-called "[[pteridomania]]" in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal   | first = Peter D. A.    | last = Boyd   | authorlink =    | title = Pteridomania - the Victorian passion for ferns   | version = Revised: web version   | publisher = Antique Collecting 28, 6, 9-12.   | date = 2002-01-02   | url = http://www.peterboyd.com/pteridomania.htm   | id =    | accessdate =  2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with William Grosart Johnstone and Alexander Croall's ''Nature-Printed British Sea-Weeds'' (London, 1859-1860), the book featured Bradbury's innovative nature printing process. The publisher of the work was Bradbury and Evans.  Bradbury patented the process after seeing the invention of [[Alois Auer]] - though the identity of its inventor grew to be a subject of debate.

The technique was briefly in vogue, but did not persist in printing.  Bradbury, along with Auer, believed the technique to be an enormous advance in printing. However, the plants and other subjects that could be successfully printed in this way were few.  Ferns were one of the few plants with a form that could be replicated, the shape of the fronds being largely two-dimensional.

In this work the ferns, a plant highly suited to the process, were impressed upon soft lead plates. These were electroplated to become the printing plate, the details of the fronds and stem were hand-coloured at this stage. The resulting image was in two colours and provided a highly detailed and realistic depiction of the species.

[[File:The Four and Twenty Elders (William Blake).jpg|thumb|''The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne'', c. 1803–5. [[William Blake]], [[Tate]]. 354 x 293 mm.]]

'''''The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne''''' is a pencil drawing and [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] on paper by the English [[English poetry|poet]], [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaker]] [[William Blake]]. Created circa 1803–1805, the drawing has been held in London's [[Tate]] gallery since 1949. It is likely a visionary and hallucinatory summary of scenes from Chapters 4 and 5&lt;ref&gt;Although some imagery from Chapter 6 is also described in this work,&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Book of Revelation]] when the throne of God was presented to the prophet [[John of Patmos|Saint John the Divine]].&lt;ref name="Fuseli"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/gothicnightmares/rooms/room7.htm Fuseli, Blake and the Romantic Imagination]. [[Tate]], 2006. Retrieved on November 05, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint John described the scene,
:before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal... round about... were four beasts full of eyes... The four and twenty elders fall down before him... and worship him that liveth for ever and ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=1149&amp;tabview=work The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne: Description]. [[Tate]]. Retrieved on November 05, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's depiction was created as part of a commission of biblical watercolours for his friend and patron&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, Allan. "Patterns of Madness in the Eighteenth Century". Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1998. 216. {{ISBN|0-85323-992-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Butts. The artist began to work on Butts's series around 1800. For stylistic reasons—including the use of pencil instead of pen and ink—it is generally believed by scholars that Blake began work on the piece sometime in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;'It is listed in Blake's account with Thomas Butts of 3 March 1806, apparently as having been delivered on 12 May 1805'. From the Tate catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings and drawings from the series are typically characterised by intense displays of colour and ''The [[Four and Twenty Elders]]'' is generally held as one of the most vivid examples of Blake's output from the period.&lt;ref name="MY109"&gt;Myrone, 109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sketch for The Four and Twenty Elders (Blake).jpg|150px|left|thumb|Blake's ''Sketch for The Four and Twenty Elders'' (pencil on paper, 488 x 389 mm), although loosely drawn, anticipates the symmetrical architecture of the finished piece.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=1067&amp;searchid=9041&amp;tabview=work Sketch for 'The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne']". Tate. Retrieved on November 05, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In this watercolour, Blake arranges the various elements and characters from the biblical text in a highly symmetrical and organised manner. God is pictured sitting on his throne at the center of the panel and portrayed as an ancient figure with a long and broad white beard, dressed in red clothing. The Deity holds a book or scroll in his right hand, according to scripture, "written within and on the backside, sealed with [[seven seals]]',&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 5.1&lt;/ref&gt; while his left hand is raised in a gesture of [[benediction]] and blessing.&lt;ref name="R68"&gt;Robertson, 68&lt;/ref&gt; His throne is enclosed by a rainbow which radiates from below a pointed [[Gothic architecture|Gothic arch]] formed from the wings of angels.&lt;ref name="MY109" /&gt; Before the throne is a slain lamb, "having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the [[seven Spirits of God]] sent forth into all the earth".&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 5.6&lt;/ref&gt; The lamb's seven horns are represented by seven spikes fanned above his corpse, while the seven [[cherub]]ic heads beneath him allude to the "seven Spirits of God". Each cherub is crowned by a tongued flame, a reference to the "seven lamps of fire" described in Revelation 4.5.&lt;ref name="R68" /&gt;

In Revelation, Saint John wrote,
:And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment: and they had on their heads crowns of gold.&lt;ref name="R68" /&gt;

A row of twelve white-clad bearded figures float on either side of the Deity, although only four figures from each row are visible to the viewer of the panel. Each figure bends towards God, in adoration, to lay a golden crown at his feet.&lt;ref name="R68" /&gt; Above the head of God are the Four Beasts, "full of eyes before and behind".&lt;ref name="Fuseli" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 4.6&lt;/ref&gt; Above and to the left of God perches the Eagle, opposite of whom is the Lion. Both are portrayed with the pallor of death and both are situated beneath the distorted heads of monstrous birds and animals. The Ox and Angel are positioned behind the throne and peer outwards, according to the Blake collector W. Graham Robertson, "dimly [and] half hidden in the pale crimson and violet rays which emanate from the central figure, and shoot up to meet and be absorbed in the {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} rainbow."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 69&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many uses of numerical symbolism in ''The Four and Twenty Elders'', and according to the Blake scholar [[Martin Myrone]], "the way, as with [Blake's] ''[[Ezekiel's Wheels]]'', that multiples and unities meld into one another, underpinned Blakes own poetic conceptions."&lt;ref name="MY109" /&gt;

The painting was first passed to Butts and upon his death was bequeathed to his son. In 1906, it passed to W. Graham Robertson for £6,720. Following Robertson's passing, the panel was sold at auction at [[Christie's]] to the Tate in 1949, with financial assistance from the [[The Art Fund|National Art Collections Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=-1&amp;workid=1149&amp;searchid=false&amp;roomid=false&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=8 The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne: Catalogue].

[[File:The Giant Turnip e-citizen.jpg|thumb|250px| The Giant Turnip's performance]]
'''"The Gigantic Turnip"''' or '''"The Enormous Turnip"''' ({{lang-ru|Репка}}) is a [[Russian folktale]]. 

The tale was collected by  [[Aleksandr Afanas'ev]] is his 1850s ''[[Narodnye russkie skazki]]'' (tale number 89).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story has been rewritten and adapted numerous times, and translated into other languages.

==Plot==
It is a [[progressive story]], in which a grandfather plants a turnip, which grows so large that he cannot pull it up himself. He asks the grandmother for help, and they together still cannot pull it up. Successively more people are recruited to help, until they finally pull the turnip up together. The specific ordering and set of people and sometimes animals varies. However, in the original Russian version the order is quite fixed, it is the grandfather (''dedka''), the grandmother (''babka''), the granddaughter (''vnuchca''), the female-dog (''zhuchka''), the female-cat (''koshka'') and finally the female-mouse (''myshka''). The humour in the story is that only with the help of the weakest and smallest creature (the mouse) can the giant turnip or radish (''repka'') be pulled up.  The moral of this story is that of collaboration, and that if we all work together, we can do anything.

The story is very popular in Russia as the names of the participants rhyme:
''repka'' (turnip) – ''dedka'' (grandfather) – ''babka'' (grandmother);
''vnuchka'' (granddaughter) – ''zhuchka'' (she-dog);
''koshka'' (she-cat) – ''myshka'' (she-mouse).

==Derivative works==

Several version for children have been penned, including by : [[Konstantin Ushinsky]] (1864), [[Vladimir Dal]] (1870), and [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy]] (1940).

The fairy tale has had multiple treatments in English. One of the unfinished projects of award-winning illustrator [[Ezra Jack Keats]] was a version of "The Giant Turnip"; artwork for the book was published in the 2002 collection ''[[Keats's Neighborhood|Keats's Neighborhood: An Ezra Jack Keats Treasury]]''.&lt;ref name="kn"&gt;{{Cite book

"'''The Heresy of Paraphrase'''" is the title of a chapter in ''[[The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry|The Well-Wrought Urn]]'', a seminal work of the [[New Criticism]] by [[Cleanth Brooks]].  Brooks argued that meaning in poetry is irreducible, because "a true poem is a simulacrum of reality...an experience rather than any mere statement about experience or any mere abstraction from experience."  Brooks emphasized structure, tension, balance, and irony over meaning, statement, and subject matter.  He relied on comparisons with non-verbal arts in order to shift discussion away from summarizable content:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The essential structure of a poem (as distinguished from the rational or logical structure of the 'statement' which we abstract from it) resembles that of architecture or painting: it is a pattern of resolved stresses.  Or, to move closer still to poetry by considering the temporal arts, the structure of a poem resembles that of a ballet or musical composition. It is a pattern of resolutions and balances and harmonizations, developed through a temporal scheme.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Helene Paris David.jpg|thumb|right|"Pretty enough to start a war" will not do for [[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus#Quotations|Marlowe's mighty line]].  (Helen and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1788)]]
Proper criticism responds with suppleness and delicacy to such patterns, rather than paraphrasing their propositional content.

Central to "The Heresy of Paraphrase" was a vigorous critique of conventional distinctions between form and content:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The structure meant is certainly not 'form' in the conventional sense in which we think of form as a kind of envelope which 'contains' the 'content.' The structure obviously is everywhere conditioned by the nature of the material which goes into the poem.  The nature of the material sets the problem to be solved, and the solution is the ordering of the material...The relationship between the intellectual and the non-intellectual elements in a poem is actually far more intimate than the conventional accounts would represent it to be: the relationship is not that of an idea 'wrapped in emotion' or a 'prose-sense decorated by sensuous imagery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though Brooks applied this theory to his reading of poetry from many periods, subsequent literary scholars have suggested that the doctrine was shaped by the [[aesthetics]] of [[modernist literature]].  They point out that the New Criticism emerged at the peak of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s influence as both poet and critic.  [[Archibald Macleish]]'s "[[Ars Poetica (MacLeish)|Ars Poetica]]" (written eleven years before ''[[The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry|The Well Wrought Urn]]'') is often cited as prefiguring Brooks' doctrine:&lt;blockquote&gt;
A poem should be palpable and mute&lt;br /&gt;
As a globed fruit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Dumb&lt;br /&gt;
As old medallions to the thumb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Silent as the sleeve-worn stone&lt;br /&gt;
Of casement ledges where the moss has grown –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A poem should be wordless&lt;br /&gt;
As the flight of birds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A poem should be motionless in time&lt;br /&gt;
As the moon climbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Leaving, as the moon releases&lt;br /&gt;
Twig by twig the night-entangled trees,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,&lt;br /&gt;
Memory by memory the mind –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A poem should be motionless in time&lt;br /&gt;
As the moon climbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A poem should be equal to:&lt;br /&gt;
Not true&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

For all the history of grief&lt;br /&gt;
An empty doorway and a maple leaf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

For love&lt;br /&gt;
The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A poem should not mean&lt;br /&gt;
But be.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Though many of the aesthetic assumptions of the New Criticism are now challenged or dismissed, the "heresy of paraphrase" is still commonly used to refer to reductive or utilitarian approaches to poetry.

'''''The Lace-Maker''''' (c. 1660s) is an [[oil on canvas]] painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Gabriël Metsu]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].

The woman is looking at the viewer and on her lap is a [[lace pillow]] for [[bobbin lace]]. It is one of the Metsu paintings with the longest provenance in any collection today, first recorded in 1722.

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1914, who wrote; "79. THE LACE-MAKER. Sm. 112. In a room with an oil-painting on the grey wall, a lady is seated at work with a lace pillow on her lap. She wears a grey satin dress and a blue jacket trimmed with white fur. At her feet to the left is a cat. 
Signed in full in the centre at the top ; panel, 14 inches by 10 inches. 
In the Saxon inventory of 1722, A531. 
Now in the Picture Gallery, Dresden, 1902 catalogue, No. 1736."&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AHofstede_de_Groot_catalogue_raisonn%C3%A9%2C_Volume_1%2C_1908.djvu&amp;page=300 79. The Lace-Maker] in Hofstede de Groot, 1908 {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 this painting was featured on a stamp in the [[East Germany|DDR]]:

'''''The Little Match Seller''''' is a [[1902 in film|1902]] [[UK|British]] [[Short subject|short]] [[silent film|silent]] [[drama film]], directed by [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]], retelling the classic [[Hans Christian Andersen]] fable of the sad life and tragic death of [[The Little Match Girl|a little match seller]]. This major fiction film of the period was, according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, "a serious attempt at depicting a person's inner emotional life on film through purely visual means (there is no onscreen text of any kind), using trick effects not to provoke laughter but for serious dramatic reasons."&lt;ref name="BFIso01"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Little Match Seller |first=Michael |last=Brooke |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/520683/index.html |work=BFI Screenonline Database |date= |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BF01"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Little Match Seller |first=David |last=Fisher |coauthors= |url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_little_match_seller.htm |work=Brightonfilm.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review==
BFI Screenonline reviewer Michael Brooke states that the film, "shows a similar interest in the plight of the downtrodden," but is, in most other respects, "a very different type of film" than the director's ''A Reservist, Before the War and After the War'' and ''The Soldier's Return'' (both 1902), which "were inspired by the experience of soldiers returning from the only recently concluded Boer War."  This film "is a very faithful adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's 1846 fable (which is brief enough to suggest that the original could have been read aloud during screenings) and, instead of the other films' scrupulously ''realistic'' presentation, Williamson here resorts to numerous special effects, mostly in the form of superimpositions." "However, these are entirely true to the spirit of the original story, whose dramatic and emotional centerpiece is the series of ''visions'' seen by the little match seller when striking matches to keep warm," and the film, "is as ambitious and innovative as ''A Reservist''." The director, he concludes, "would continue to explore this new ground in later films such as ''The Old Chorister'' (1904)."&lt;ref name="BFIso01" /&gt;

'''The Sorcerer''' is one name for an enigmatic [[cave painting]] found in the cavern known as 'The Sanctuary' at the [[Cave of the Trois-Frères]], [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]], [[France]], made around 13,000 BC. The figure's significance is unknown, but it is usually interpreted as some kind of great spirit or [[master of animals]]. The unusual nature of The Sanctuary's decoration may also reflect the practice of magical ceremonies in the chamber.&lt;ref name = Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/606267/Trois-Freres#ref=ref893311|title=Trois Frères - cave, Ariège, France|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his sketches of the cave art, [[Henri Breuil]] drew a horned humanoid torso and the publication of this drawing in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;Henri Breuil, ''Quatre cent siècles d'art paiétal'' (Montignac, 1954, p. 166 (Mary E. Boyle, tr., as ''Four Hundred centuries of Cave Art'', London: Zwemmer, 1952); Breuil, ''Les Cavernes du Volp'', 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; influenced many subsequent theories about the figure.&lt;ref&gt;As S. G. F. Brandon expressed it in 1959, "it seems to be generally agreed that this picture of the 'Dancing Sorcerer' was a [[cult object]] of great significance to the community which used the cave." (S. G. F. Brandon, "The Ritual Perpetuation of the Past" ''Numen'' '''6'''.2 (April 1959:112-129) p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Breuil's sketch has also come under criticism in recent years.&lt;ref name="hutton"&gt;Hutton, Ronald ''Witches, Druids, Arthur''. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; A single prominent human figure is unusual in the cave paintings of the [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Upper Paleolithic]], where the great majority of representations are of animals.

== Breuil's drawing ==
[[Henri Breuil]] asserted that the cave painting represented a shaman or magician — an interpretation which gives the image its name — and described the image he drew in these terms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[Margaret Murray]] having seen the published drawing called Breuil's image 'the first depiction of a deity on earth', an idea which Breuil and others later adopted.

His views held sway in the field for much of the 20th century, but they have since been largely superseded.&lt;ref name = Britannica/&gt;

Breuil's image has been commonly interpreted as a [[shaman]] performing a ritual to ensure good hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Clottes and David Lewis-Williams ''The Shamans of Prehistory: Trance and Magic in the Painted Caves''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Certain modern scholars question the validity of Breuil's sketch, claiming that modern photographs do not show the famous antlers. [[Ronald Hutton]] theorized that Breuil was fitting the evidence to support his hunting-magic theory of cave-art, citing that "the figure drawn by Breuil is not the same as the one actually painted on the cave wall." Hutton's theory led him to conclude that reliance on Breuil's initial sketch resulted in many later scholars erroneously claiming that "The Sorcerer" was evidence that the concept of a [[Horned God]] dated back to Paleolithic times.&lt;ref name="hutton"/&gt; Likewise, [[Peter Ucko]] concluded that inaccuracies in the drawing were caused by Breuil's working in dim gas-light, in awkward circumstances, and that he had mistaken cracks in the rock surface for man-made marks.&lt;ref&gt;Ucko, P, (1992). Subjectivity and the recording of Palaeolithic Cave Art, in T Shay &amp; J Clottes (eds), The Limitations of Archaeological Knowledge, 141-180. Liege: University of Liege Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views have also been questioned, noting that "The Sorcerer" is composed of both charcoal drawings and etching within the stone itself. Details, such as etching, are often difficult to view from photographs due to their size and the quality of the light source. Particularly celebrated prehistorian [[Jean Clottes]] asserts that Breuil's sketch is accurate ('I have seen it myself perhaps 20 times over the years').&lt;ref name="Cave Art Cobblers?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehistory.net/2011/07/06/cave-art-cobblers/|title=Cave Art Cobblers? - Beachcombing's Bizarre History Blog|date=6 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing influence==
The general assessment has placed the figure as central to an understanding of cave art: as S.G.F. Brandon expressed it in 1959, "it seems to be generally agreed that this picture of the 'Dancing Sorcerer' was a [[cult object]] of great significance to the community which used the cave."&lt;ref&gt;S.G.F. Brandon, "The Ritual Perpetuation of the Past" ''Numen'' '''6'''.2 (April 1959:112-129) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Breuil's interpretation of the drawing as a shaman strongly influenced writer [[Pat Mills]] in the creation of the Lord Weird Slough Feg, a sorcerer, god, and early antagonist of the ongoing comic book title [[Sláine (comics)|Slaine]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins" (two-page text article), ''2000 AD'' #352, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[The Story of B]]'' by [[Daniel Quinn]] includes an interpretation of the painting as an expression of late Paleolithic animism, a symbol for the human sense of identity with other animal life.

'''''The Tale of the Four Dervishes''''' ({{lang-fa|قصه چهار درویش}} '''''Qissa-ye Chahār Darvēsh'''''; known in [[Urdu]] as '''''Bāgh-o Bahār''''' ({{Nastaliq|باغ و بہار}}, "Garden and Spring")) is a collection of allegorical stories by [[Amir Khusro]] written in [[Persian language|Persian]] in the early 13th century.

While legend says that Amir Khusro was the author, the tales were written long after his death.  Legend has it that [[Amir Khusro]]'s master and [[Sufi]] saint [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] had fallen ill.  To cheer him up, [[Amir Khusro]] started telling him a series of stories in the style of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.  By the end of the stories, [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] had recovered, and prayed that anyone who listened to these stories would also be cured.

==Style==
The book is in some ways similar to the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'' in its method of framing and linking unfinished stories within each other. The central character is a king, Azad Bakht, who falls into depression after thinking about his own mortality, and so sets out from his palace seeking wise men. He comes upon four [[dervish]]es in a cemetery, and listens to their fantastical stories. Each Dervish narrates his own story, which is basically on love and fidelity in their own past lives. When the fourth dervish finishes his tale, the king Azadbakht suddenly learns that one of his wives has just born the son to him. Overwhelmed with joy, the king orders to arrange a great feast. With the help of the great king of jinns, Malik Syahpal, Azadbakht marries all the separated lovers to one another: the merchant’s son from Yemen to the princess of Damsyik, the prince of Fars to the princess of Basra, the prince of Ajam to the princess of Farang, the prince of Nimroz to the princess of jinns, and the prince of China to the daughter of the courtier, who was kidnapped by Malik Sadik. Everyone happily achieves the fulfilment of his or her desire

==Translations==
These stories were originally written in [[Persian Language|Persian]] by [[Amir Khusro]] as ''Qissa-ye Chahār Darvēsh'' (''The Tale of the Four Dervishes'').  It was initially translated by [[Mir Husain Ata Tehseen]] into [[Urdu language|Urdu]] as [[Nau Tarz-e-Murassa]] but the language was a highly literate one and was not understood by general public to enjoy.  In 1801, [[College of Fort William]] in Calcutta started a project translating Indian literature.  Mr. [[John Borthwick Gilchrist]], a famous scholar of literature, asked [[Mir Amman]], an employee of the college, to translate it into the [[Urdu]] language.  Mir Amman translated it from [[Persian Language|Persian]] into everyday [[Urdu]], under the title ''Bāgh o Bahār'' (''The Garden and the Spring Season'').  Later, in 1857, [[Duncan Forbes (linguist)|Duncan Forbes]] retranslated it into English.  The translation of Mir Amman is still enjoyed as a classical work of [[Urdu Literature]] for the common daily language of its time.

"'''Why Don't We Do It in the Road?'''" is a song by [[the Beatles]] released on their 1968 album ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'', commonly referred to as "the White Album". It was written{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=498–499}}{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=189}} and sung by [[Paul McCartney]],{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=200}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=325}} but credited to [[Lennon–McCartney]]. "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?" is short and simple; 1:42 of [[twelve-bar blues]] that begins with three different percussion elements (a hand banging on the back of an acoustic guitar, handclaps, and drums) and features McCartney's increasingly raucous vocal{{sfn|Pollack|2010}} repeating a simple lyric with only two different lines.{{sfn|Aldridge|1990|p=69}}

==Background==

McCartney wrote the song after seeing two monkeys copulating in the street [[The Beatles at Rishikesh|while on retreat]] in [[Rishikesh]], [[India]], with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. He marvelled in the simplicity of this natural scenario when compared to the emotional turmoil of human relationships. He later said:
{{quote|A male [monkey] just hopped on the back of this female and gave her one, as they say in the [[vernacular]]. Within two or three seconds he hopped off again and looked around as if to say "It wasn't me!" and she looked around as if there'd been some mild disturbance ... And I thought ... that's how simple the act of procreation is ... We have horrendous problems with it, and yet animals don't.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=498–499}}}}

==Recording==
On 9 October 1968, while [[John Lennon]] and [[George Harrison]] were working on two other songs for the album, McCartney recorded five [[take]]s of the song in Studio One at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Unlike its heavy blues result,{{sfn|Pollack|2010}} the song began as an acoustic guitar number with McCartney alternating by verse between gentle and strident vocal styles.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1996|pp=69}} On this first night, McCartney played all the instruments himself.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=160–161}} This version of the song can be found on the Beatles' ''[[Anthology 3]]''.

On 10 October, McCartney and [[Ringo Starr]] finished the song, Starr adding drums and handclaps, McCartney adding more vocals, bass guitar, and lead guitar.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=160–161}} Lennon and Harrison were again occupied, supervising string overdubs for "[[Piggies]]" and "[[Glass Onion]]".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=160–161}}

==Lennon's reaction==
Upon learning about the recording, Lennon was unhappy that McCartney recorded the song without him. In his 1980 interview with ''Playboy'', he was asked about it:
:'''Playboy''': "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?"
:'''Lennon''': That's Paul. He even recorded it by himself in another room. That's how it was getting in those days. We came in and he'd made the whole record. Him drumming. Him playing the piano. Him singing. But he couldn't—he couldn't—maybe he couldn't make the break from the Beatles. I don't know what it was, you know. I enjoyed the track. Still, I can't speak for George, but I was always hurt when Paul would knock something off without involving us. But that's just the way it was then.
:'''Playboy''': You never just knocked off a track by yourself?
:'''Lennon''': No.
:'''Playboy''': "[[Julia (Beatles song)|Julia]]"?
:'''Lennon''': That was mine.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=189}}

"Julia" was recorded four days after the first session for "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?," and is a solo performance by Lennon (double-tracked lead vocals and acoustic guitar),{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=326}} though McCartney was present for the recording, as he can be heard talking to Lennon from the control room after a take on the Beatles' ''[[Anthology 3]]''.

In a 1981 conversation with [[Hunter Davies]], who had written a biography of the Beatles in 1968, McCartney responded to a [[Yoko Ono]] interview where she said McCartney had hurt Lennon more than anyone else, by saying, "No one ever goes on about the times John hurt ''me'' ... Could I have hurt him more than the person who ran down [[Julia Lennon|his mother]] in his car?" He then brought up Lennon's comments about "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?": "There's only one incident I can think of that John has mentioned publicly. It was when I went off with Ringo and did 'Why Don't We Do It in the Road'. It wasn't a deliberate thing. John and George were tied up finishing something and me and Ringo were free, just hanging around, so I said to Ringo, 'Let's go and do this.'"{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp=398–399}}

McCartney also expressed some lingering resentment about a similar incident with "[[Revolution 9]]", recorded in June 1968, a few months before "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?": "Anyway, he did the same with 'Revolution 9'. He went off and made that without me. No one ever says that. John is the nice guy and I'm the bastard. It gets repeated all the time."{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=401}}
