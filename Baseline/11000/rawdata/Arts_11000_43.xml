'''18th-century French art''' was dominated by the [[Baroque]], [[Rocaille]] and [[Neoclassicism in France|neoclassical]] movements.

==History&lt;!--'French neoclassicism' and 'French Neoclassicism' redirct here--&gt;==
In France, the death of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in September 1715 led to a period of licentious freedom commonly called the [[Régence]].  The heir to Louis XIV, his great grandson [[Louis XV of France]], was only 5 years old; for the next seven years France was ruled by the regent [[Philippe II of Orléans]].  Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722.  Painting turned toward "fêtes galantes", theater settings and the female nude.  Painters from this period include [[Antoine Watteau]], [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[François Boucher]]. One of the best places in the UK to see examples of French visual and decorative arts of the Rococo and neoclassical periods is in [[Wallace Collection|the Wallace Collection]], a free national gallery in London.

The [[Louis XV style]] of decoration (although already apparent at the end of the last reign) was lighter: pastels and wood panels, smaller rooms, less gilding and fewer brocades; shells and garlands and occasional Chinese subjects predominated.  Rooms were more intimate.   After the return to Versailles, many of the baroque rooms of Louis XIV were redesigned.  The official etiquette was also simplified and the notion of privacy was expanded: the king himself retreated from the official bed at night and conversed in private with his mistress.

The latter half of the 18th century continued to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the [[French language]] was the lingua franca of the European courts.  The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, like [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork.  Although the hierarchy of genres continued to be respected officially, [[Genre works|genre painting]], [[Landscape art|landscape]], [[portrait]] and [[still life]] were extremely fashionable.

The writer [[Denis Diderot]] wrote a number of times on the annual [[Paris Salon|Salons]] of the Académie of painting and sculpture and his comments and criticisms are a vital document on the arts of this period.

One of Diderot's favorite painters was [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]].  Although often considered [[kitsch]] by today's standards, his paintings of domestic scenes reveal the importance of [[Sentimentality|Sentimentalism]] in the European arts of the period (as also seen in the works of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Samuel Richardson]].)

One also finds in this period a kind of ''[[Pre-romanticism]]''.  [[Hubert Robert]]'s images of ruins, inspired by Italian cappricio paintings, are typical in this respect.  So too the change from the rational and geometrical ''French garden'' (of [[André Le Nôtre]]) to the ''English garden'', which emphasized (artificially) wild and irrational nature.  One also finds in some of these gardens curious ruins of temples called [[Folly|follies]].

The middle of the 18th century saw a turn to [[Neoclassicism]] in France, that is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and iconography.  In painting, the greatest representative of this style is [[Jacques-Louis David]] who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile; his subject matter often involved classical history (the death of Socrates, Brutus).  The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by [[Nicolas Poussin]] in the 17th century.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jacob4Chairs.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A suite of Louis XVI giltwood chairs made circa 1775 by [[Georges Jacob]].]] --&gt;

The [[Louis XVI style]] of furniture (once again already present in the previous reign) tended toward circles and ovals in chair backs; chair legs were grooved; Greek inspired iconography was used as decoration.

'''French neoclassicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; would greatly contribute to the monumentalism of the [[French revolution]], as typified in the structures [[Eglise de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]] church (begun in 1763 and finished in 1840) which is in the form of a [[Greek temple]] and the mammoth [[Panthéon]] (1764–1812) which today houses the tombs of great Frenchmen.  The rationalism and simplicity of classical architecture was seen &amp;mdash; in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] &amp;mdash; as the antithesis of the backward-looking [[Gothic art|Gothic]].

The Greek and Roman subject matters were also often chosen to promote the values of republicanism.  One also finds paintings glorifying the heroes and martyrs of the French revolution, such as David's painting of the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]].

[[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], a student of David's who was also influenced by [[Raphael]] and [[John Flaxman]], would maintain the precision of David's style, while also exploring other mythological (Oedipus and the sphinx, Jupiter and Thetis) and oriental (the Odalesques) subjects in the spirit of [[Romanticism]].

{{redirect|Miles Gloriosus|the Plautus play|Miles Gloriosus (play)}}
'''''Alazṓn''''' ({{lang-grc|ἀλαζών}}) is one of three [[stock characters]] in [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] of the [[theatre of ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; He is the opponent of the ''[[Eiron|eirôn]]''. The ''alazṓn'' is an [[impostor]] that sees himself as greater than he actually is. The '''''senex iratus''''' (the angry father) and the '''''miles gloriosus''''' (the glorious soldier) are two types of ''alazṓn''.&lt;ref name=Frye&gt;Frye, Northrop. 1957. ''Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays''. London: Penguin, 1990. {{ISBN|0-14-012480-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Miles Gloriosus''==
{{wiktionary|miles gloriosus}}
''Miles Gloriosus'' (literally, "braggart-soldier", in [[Latin language|Latin]]) is a [[stock character]] of a boastful soldier from the [[Comedy (drama)|comic]] [[theatre of ancient Rome]], and variations on this character have appeared in [[drama]] and [[fiction]] ever since.&lt;ref name=Frye /&gt; The character derives from the ''alazṓn'' or "braggart" of the [[Ancient Greek comedy#Old Comedy|Greek Old Comedy]] (e.g. [[Aristophanes]]).  The term "Miles Gloriosus" is occasionally applied in a contemporary context to refer to a posturing and self-deceiving boaster or bully.

=== Literary instances ===
In the play ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]'' by [[Plautus]], the term applies to the main character Pyrgopolynices. This foolish ''Miles Gloriosus'' brags openly and often about his supposed greatness, while the rest of the characters feign their admiration and secretly plot against him. Heavily borrowing from Plautus, the [[Stephen Sondheim]]-[[Burt Shevelove]]-[[Larry Gelbart]] musical ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' features a warrior named Miles Gloriosus.

Shakespeare uses the type most notably with the bombastic and self-glorifying ensign [[Ancient Pistol]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor L. Cahn, Shakespeare the Playwright: A Companion to the Complete Tragedies, Histories, Comedies, and Romances, Praeger, Westport, 1996. p.468.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are  "fashion's own knight", the Spaniard Armardo, in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', the worthless Captain Parolles in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'', and [[Falstaff]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]'', and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''.

[[Baron Munchausen]] is a braggart soldier.

In [[Commedia dell'arte]], the figure of [[Il Capitano]] is a ''miles gloriosus''.&lt;ref&gt;John Rudlin, ''Commedia dell'Arte: An Actor's Handbook'', p. 120, {{ISBN|0-415-04770-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, the title role of ''[[Háry János]]'' by [[Kodály]] is an example of the character.

In PC game ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'', there is a non-playable character named Miles Gloriosus, willing to brag about his accomplishments as soldier.

==''Senex iratus''==
The ''senex iratus'' or heavy father figure is a comic [[archetype]] character who belongs to the alazon or impostor group in [[theater]], manifesting himself through his rages and threats, his obsessions and his gullibility.

His usual function is to impede the love of the [[lovers (character)|hero and heroine]], and his power to do so stems from his greater social position and his increased control of cash.  In the [[New Comedy]], he was often the father of the hero and so his rival.  More frequently since, he has been the father of the heroine who insists on her union with the bad fiancé; as such, he appears in both ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', where he fails and so the play is a comedy, and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', where his acts are successful enough to render the play a tragedy.

[[Pantalone]] in [[Commedia dell'arte]] acts as a ''senex iratus''.

In his ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', [[Northrop Frye]] considered all blocking humors in comedy to be variations on the basic function of the ''senex iratus''.

'''Bag &amp; Baggage Productions''' is a professional theatre company based in [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]]. Founded in 2005, the non-profit group presents about four productions per year. Their home theater is the [[Venetian Theatre]], a 370-seat venue in downtown Hillsboro on East Main Street.

==History==
The company was co-founded in 2005 by several actors, including Scott Palmer, who graduated from [[Hillsboro High School (Oregon)|Hillsboro High School]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Reindeer"&gt;{{cite news|title=Metro West Neighbors: 'Reindeer' may deliver sellout crowds|last=Apalategui|first=Eric|date=December 11, 2008|work=The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="play"&gt;{{cite news|title=Metro West Neighbors: The play's the thing|last=Suh|first=Elizabeth|date=May 15, 2008|work=The Oregonian|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years Bag &amp; Baggage was a traveling theater group, making stops in communities around Oregon.&lt;ref name="Reindeer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="play"/&gt;&lt;ref name="role"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2010/03/scott_palmer_of_bag_baggage_productions_plays_a_role_in_revival_of_downtown_hillsboro.html|title=Scott Palmer of Bag &amp; Baggage Productions plays a role in downtown Hillsboro revival|last=Goetze|first=Janet|date=March 29, 2010|work=The Oregonian|accessdate=March 30, 2010| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20100402235303/http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2010/03/scott_palmer_of_bag_baggage_productions_plays_a_role_in_revival_of_downtown_hillsboro.html| archivedate= April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performances in Hillsboro were held at the [[Cornelius Pass Roadhouse]] and the [[Glenn &amp; Viola Walters Cultural Arts Center]].&lt;ref name="play"/&gt; Other venues included the Hotel Oregon in [[McMinnville, Oregon|McMinnville]] and the Withycombe Theatre in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], among others.&lt;ref name="gt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gazettetimes.com/entertainment/article_e1fca05e-a948-11de-9724-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Marion Rossi to star as Willy Loman in 'Death of a Salesman'|last=Raskauskas|first=Nancy|date=September 24, 2009|work=[[Corvallis Gazette Times]]|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through May 2008 the company had put on nine productions.&lt;ref name="play"/&gt; In September 2008, Bag &amp; Baggage became the resident theater company at the Venetian Theatre in Downtown Hillsboro.&lt;ref name="steel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arts &amp; Entertainment: Five Live – Performance|agency=The Oregonian|date=September 5, 2008|work=The Oregonian|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; They opened their new season with ''[[Steel Magnolias]]''.&lt;ref name="steel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steel mag FG"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thetribonline.net/news/story.php?story_id=122102818419412000|title='Steel Magnolias' flowers in Hillsboro|date=September 10, 2008|work=[[News-Times (Forest Grove)|The Forest Grove News-Times]]|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Venetian had opened in June of that year in the space that had been a movie theater, but had sat vacant since 1996.&lt;ref name="play"/&gt;

Season ticket sales stood at 220 for the 2007 to 2008 season, and grew to 450 for the 2008 to 2009 season.&lt;ref name="Elizabethan"/&gt; At the end of 2008 Bag &amp; Baggage was only the second professional group for live theater in Washington County, the other being the [[Broadway Rose Theatre Company]] of [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]].&lt;ref name="Reindeer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="play"/&gt; For Christmas in 2008, the theater company produced ''The Eight: Reindeer Monologues'' with four shows held at the Venetian.&lt;ref name="Reindeer"/&gt;

In July 2009, the company put on the first outdoor Shakespeare production by professionals ever held in the city.&lt;ref name="Elizabethan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/washingtoncounty/index.ssf/2009/07/cover_story.html|title=Metro West Neighbors: An Elizabethan flair in Hillsboro|last=Navas|first=Melissa|date=July 16, 2009|work=[[The Oregonian]]|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held at the plaza in front of the [[Hillsboro Civic Center]], the play was ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', with the production paid for in part by the city.&lt;ref name="Elizabethan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r and j"&gt;{{cite news|title=Weekend Reviews; Theater; "Romeo and Juliet"|last=Johnson|first=Holly|date=July 20, 2009 |work=The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, they produced an adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thetribonline.net/news/print_story.php?story_id=126106954151302600|title=It's beginning to look a lot like ... entertainment|last=Townsley|first=Nancy|date=December 17, 2009|work=The Forest Grove News-Times|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bag &amp; Baggage produced [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s retort to that play, ''[[The Woman's Prize]]'', in a combined play in February 2010.&lt;ref name="tamed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2010/02/theater_review_bag_baggages_th.html|title=Theater review: Bag &amp; Baggage's 'The Taming of the Shrew' and 'The Tamer Tamed' combo a good idea in theory, but ...|last=Hicks|first=Bob|date=February 14, 2010|work=The Oregonian|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theater critic Bob Hicks, writing about the performances for ''[[The Oregonian]]'', said "...

'''''Black Angels''''' (Edition Peters, New York, no. 66304, copyright 1971), subtitled "Thirteen Images from the Dark Land", is a work for "electric [[string quartet]]" by the American [[avant-garde]] composer [[George Crumb]]. It was composed over the course of a year and is dated "Friday the Thirteenth, March 1970 (in tempore belli)" as written on the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://kronosquartet.org/projects/detail/black_angels|title = Kronos Quartet|website = kronosquartet.org|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crumb is very interested in [[numerology]] and numerically structured the piece around 13 and 7. The piece is notable for its unconventional instrumentation, which calls for electric string instruments, crystal glasses, and two suspended tam-tam gongs. The work references the second movement, Andante con moto from Schubert’s ‘Death and the Maiden’ String Quartet.

== Structure ==
The thirteen individual movements of ''Black Angels'' are divided into three large groups.

'''I. Departure'''

Threnody I: Night of the Electric Insects (tutti)

Sounds of Bones and Flutes (trio)

Lost Bells (duo)

Devil-music (solo)

Danse Macabre (duo)

'''II. Absence'''

Pavana Lachrymae (trio)

Threnody II: Black Angels! (tutti)

Sarabanda de la Muerte Oscura (trio)

Lost Bells (Echo) (duo)

'''III. Return'''

God-music (solo)

Ancient Voices (duo)

Ancient Voices (Echo) (trio)

Threnody III: Night of the Electric Insects (tutti)

The structure of the work displays the numerological elements important to Crumb, that is, thirteen movements, of which the seventh is the centerpiece. Further, the organization of movements displays symmetry and palindrome: the instrumentation of each movement follows a palindromic structure: 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4; the first, central and thirteenth movements are titled Threnody; God-music and Devil-music stand symmetrically opposite each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.12.18.2/mto.12.18.2.johnston.html|title = MTO 18.2: Johnston, George Crumb’s Black Angels|website = www.mtosmt.org|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
''Black Angels'' is primarily written for (in Crumb's words) "electric string quartet."  Though generally played by amplified acoustic instruments, the work is occasionally performed on specially constructed electronic string instruments.  The music uses the extremes of the instruments' registers as well as [[extended techniques]] such as bowing on the [[fingerboard]] above the fingers and tapping the strings with thimbles.  At certain points in the music, the players are even required to make sounds with their mouths and to speak.

Each of the string players is also assigned a set of instruments to play throughout the piece.  Some of the equipment requires specific preparation, such as the crystal glasses, which are tuned with different amounts of water.

'''Violin 1'''
* [[maraca]]
* 7 crystal glasses
* 6" glass rod
* 2 metal [[thimble]]s
* metal pick (paper clip)

'''Violin 2'''
* 15" suspended [[tam-tam]] and mallet
* [[double bass|contrabass]] bow (for use on tam-tam)
* 7 crystal glasses
* 6" glass rod
* 2 metal thimbles
* metal pick (paper clip)

'''Viola'''
* 6 crystal glasses
* 6" glass rod
* 2 metal thimbles
* metal pick

'''Cello'''
* maraca
* 24" suspended tam-tam, soft and hard mallets
* contrabass bow

==Stage positioning==
Crumb's score includes a diagram that places the four musicians in a box-like formation.  Electric Violin II and Electric Cello are located near upstage right and upstage left, respectively, with their tam-tams between them.  Electric Violin I and Electric Viola are near downstage right and downstage left, respectively, but are slightly farther apart than the other two musicians in order to allow full sight of the quartet.  Violin I, Violin II and Viola have a set of crystal glasses downstage of them, while Violin I and Cello have maracas upstage of them.  Each of the four musicians has a speaker next to him or her.

== Cultural influences==
The [[Kronos Quartet]], which specializes in new music, was originally formed when violinist David Harrington heard "Black Angels" over the radio.&lt;ref name="PBSNewsHour_03Dec1998_Kronos_BlackAngels"&gt;

|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He thought Crumb's piece was "something wild, something scary" and "absolutely the right music to play."&lt;ref name="Kronos_25thAnniversary_BlackAngels"&gt;{{cite web

It was the first composition Kronos performed.&lt;ref name="Kronos_25thAnniversary_BlackAngels"/&gt; The Kronos Quartet recorded the work on their album ''[[Black Angels (album)|Black Angels]]''.

"Threnody I: Night of the Electric Insects" is featured on the [[soundtrack]] of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.&lt;ref name="IMBD_GeorgeCrumb_BlackAngels_ExorcistSoundtrack"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1278986/|title=George Crumb|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"III. Return - God-music" is heard in the television series [[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]] on the third episode of the series titled "The Harmony of the Worlds".&lt;ref name="GeorgeCrumb_BlackAngels_Cosmossoundtrack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groove.nl/cd/1/10943.html|title=Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|publisher=[[groove.nl]]|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recording by the New York String Quartet ([[Composers Recordings, Inc.|CRI]]) is mentioned by [[David Bowie]] among his 25 favorite records&lt;ref name="Vanity_Fair_Confession_of_a_vinyl_junkie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scallemang.ca/bowie25albums/|title=Confessions of a Vinyl Junkie|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Elizabeth Hand]] drew many of the chapter titles for her [[dark fantasy]] novel [[Waking the Moon]] from the composition,  and credits it in the "Coda" of the book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4640">The term '''Context art''' ({{lang-de|Kontext Kunst}}) was introduced through the seminal exhibition and an accompanying publication ''Kontext Kunst. The Art of the 90s''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuegalerie-archiv.at/93/kunst/cover.html Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; curated by [[Peter Weibel]] at the Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Graz (Austria) in 1993 (02.10.–07.11.1993).

== Exhibition and publication ==

Both exhibition and publication aimed to establish grounds for recognizing a new form of artistic practice emerging in the early 1990s. The presentation displayed different approaches though all shared an interest in the use of methods of contextualization to reveal connections between the art works and their conditions of production, whether these were formal, social, or ideologically defined. Institutional critique, feminist positions, later also critiques of precarious economic conditions and issues of globalization, all closely related to social and political changes, became relevant subjects of artistic production.

“It is no longer purely about critiquing the art system, but about critiquing reality and analyzing and creating social processes. In the ’90s, non-art contexts are being increasingly drawn into the art discourse. Artists are becoming autonomous agents of social processes, partisans of the real. The interaction between artists and social situations, between art and non-art contexts has led to a new art form, where both are folded together: Context art. The aim of this social construction of art is to take part in the social construction of reality.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shiftyparadigms.org/false_economies.htm Peter Weibel, Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre (Köln: DuMont Verlag, 1994), p. 57, translated by Barnaby Drabble / resource: Rebecca Gordon Nesbitt, ''False Economies: Time to Take Stock'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

It might be due to the fact that the term was introduced under the German translation ''[[KontextKunst]]'' instead of ''Context Art'' or its likewise politically tended orientation (see Maria Lind’s reference&lt;ref&gt;[http://eipcp.net/transversal/1204/lind/en/#_ftn16 Actualisation of Space: The Case of Oda Projesi]''Kontextkunst'' is, if you wish a German parallel to the so-called 'relational aesthetics' but more programmatically political and academic. Both imply a more dynamic notion of art, which actively takes the context into consideration and which often goes beyond the exhibition space. Some of the artists used as 'good' examples by Christian Kravagna have been associated with Kontextkunst. See Peter Weibel: ''Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre'', Cologne, DuMont Verlag 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;), but it never spread far beyond Europe’s language based barriers. Instead vaguely similar strategies were labeled as ''Models of Participatory Practice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://republicart.net/disc/aap/kravagna01_en.htm Working on the Community Models of Participatory Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998 by Christian Kravagna’s attempt to define the field or the later appearing and quite moderate [[Relational Art]] based on the 2002 book ''[[Relational Aesthetics]]'' by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]].  

The accompanying catalog is described to document ”a wide-ranging exhibition designed to illustrate the emergence over the past decade of a new international art movement, .. “ featuring “… an anthology of 22 substantial essays (some reprinted) discussing from diverse perspectives the artistic issues and social and political themes that distinguish ''Context Art'' from related forms of conceptual and installation art…. “.

'''David Franklin''' is an art historian with expertise in Italian Renaissance art, a [[curator]], and a former art museum director.

==Thomson Collection==
David Franklin is employed by the Thomson Collection in Toronto, Ontario. On April 8, 2015, he gave his first public lecture under this affiliation at the National Gallery of Canada's Wednesday Morning Lecture Series, focusing his remarks on Piero de Cosimo's painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beaux-arts.ca/documents/content/Wednesday_Lectures_2014-15.pdf; see his related essay, "Piero di Cosimo and the Painting of his Time," in ''Piero di Cosimo: the Poetry of Painting in Renaissance Florence'', Washington, National Gallery, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin helped plan the Canadian Photography Institute, which has promised gifts from David Thomson and major funding from Bank of Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/national-gallery-creates-new-photography-institute-with-aid-from-scotiabank-david-thomson/article27506410/|title=Thomson, Scotiabank team up for new photo institute at National Gallery|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery.ca/cpi/|title=Canadian Photography Institute|author=|date=|website=www.Gallery.ca|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an editor of ''The Canadians'' (2016), a selection of photographs from ''The Globe and Mail'' archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/photography-book-the-canadians-a-kind-of-reimagining-of-the-americans/article31468672/|title=Photography book The Canadians a kind of reimagining of The Americans|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2017}}

==Cleveland Museum of Art==
Franklin was named director of the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] in 2010. While Franklin was Director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, a donation of $1,000,000 was made by Leigh Carter in 2013 to the museum's endowment to fund a permanent fellowship to help the museum's director conduct research on special art historical projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2013/09/former_bf_goodrich_president_l.html|title=Former B.F. Goodrich president Leigh Carter donates $1 million to the Cleveland Museum of Art for research|author=|date=September 2013|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a three-year tenure, Franklin abruptly resigned on October 21, 2013, citing personal reasons and a need "to do more research and writing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2013/10/cleveland_museum_of_art_direct_1.html|title=Cleveland Museum of Art Director David Franklin resigns for personal reasons, effective immediately|author=|date=October 2013|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, the Cleveland Scene revealed that Franklin (married with two children) had been in a romantic relationship with an employee of the museum. The board of directors at the museum had been made aware of the affair when the employee was found to have apparently committed suicide in her Cleveland Heights apartment, shortly after she and Franklin were supposed to have travelled to Spain together, and one week before they were supposed to travel to Italy. According to police reports, David Franklin called the 911 himself and was the only person present at the scene. When police came to investigate the suspicious death, Franklin lied to the officers, pretending having received a text message from the woman, which, according to the Police, never happened. He claimed to have run to the apartment after receiving this text message and to have discovered the body by entering the apartment through an open door. In the course of the investigation, it became apparent that the employee's digital camera and cell phone were missing. Police have also discovered that a major transfer of data had been done from the woman's phone shortly after she was found dead. As the family could not believe many details of the reported story, a detective was assigned to further investigate the death and Franklin's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2013/10/31/david-franklin-lied-to-cleveland-heights-police-the-night-he-found-christina-gastons-body|title=David Franklin Lied to Cleveland Heights Police the Night He Found Christina Gaston's Body|first=Sam|last=Allard|date=October 31, 2013|website=CleveScene.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this revelation came to the attention of the board, Franklin was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2013/10/cleveland_museum_of_art_confir.html|title=Cleveland Museum of Art confirms that an extramarital affair led to David Franklin's resignation as director|author=|date=October 2013|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2013/10/23/former-cleveland-museum-of-art-director-david-franklin-resigns-after-affair-suicide-cell-phone-of-victim-missing|title=Former Cleveland Museum of Art Director David Franklin Resigns After Affair, Suicide; Cell Phone of Victim Missing|first=Vince|last=Grzegorek|date=October 23, 2013|website=CleveScene.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Gallery of Canada==
Previously, Franklin served as deputy director of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].&lt;ref name=Litt&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/08/david_franklin_of_the_national.html "David Franklin of the National Gallery of Canada named director of the Cleveland Museum of Art"], Steven Litt, August 27, 2010, ''Plain Dealer''.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked at the National Gallery of Canada for twelve years, beginning as the curator of prints and eventually rising to the post of deputy director and chief curator. In 2009, the National Gallery of Canada Foundation received a donation from the philanthropists Donald and Beth Sobey for The Donald and Beth Sobey Chief Curator’s Research Endowment. While at the National Gallery, Franklin became involved in a controversy involving the firing of a subordinate. His action of completely removing emails, by deleting emails from his system's trash, was seen as a move to remove evidence of wrongful termination. Franklin denied this. He was removed from his post, and after suing the institution, was restored to his position, before being fired a second time, a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/arts/design/29gall.html|title=Controversy and Court Filings at the National Gallery of Canada|first=Ian|last=Austen|date=December 28, 2008|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2017|via=www.NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/08/david_franklin_of_the_national.html|title=David Franklin of the National Gallery of Canada named director of the Cleveland Museum of Art|author=|date=August 2010|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eight Bells''''' is an 1886 oil painting by the American artist [[Winslow Homer]]. It depicts two sailors determining their ship's position. It is one of Homer's best-known paintings&lt;ref name="C"&gt;Cikovsky, 236&lt;/ref&gt; and the last of his major paintings of the 1880s that dramatically chronicle man's relationship to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andover.edu/Museums/Addison/Collection/CollectionSpotlight/Pages/default.aspx |website=Addison Gallery of American Art|title=Spotlight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History and description==
''Eight Bells'' was the outgrowth of a series of oil paintings that Homer made using three wooden panels he found in the cabin of his brother's [[sloop]] at [[Prouts Neck, Maine]]. On two of the panels Homer painted scenes of mackerel fleets at [[Prouts Neck]], one at dawn and the other at sunset; on the third he painted a [[grisaille]] study of the work that inspired ''Eight Bells'', which depicted a ship's officer standing alone, taking an observation with an [[Octant_(instrument)|octant]].&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; Several years earlier, Homer had painted a [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] on his voyage to England that also showed a sailor performing this activity.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt;

The painting's title is a reference to the [[watch system]], computed as one [[Ship's_bell|bell]] every 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; Although "eight bells" can be either 8 o'clock, 12 o'clock, or 4 o'clock, the painting refers to taking the "noon sight" at local apparent noon, a standard during the days of [[celestial navigation]]. Most other sights are made at dawn or twilight.&lt;ref name="M"&gt;Mixter, 297&lt;/ref&gt; 

More monumental than the three panels that preceded it, the two figures dominate the foreground of ''Eight Bells'', and the details of the ship are minimally rendered.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; Homer has taken some artistic license, showing the figure at left using an octant to take a reading of the sun, the other apparently reading the altitude of a completed sight on his octant. In reality, both observers would have had their octants to their eyes, rocking them back and forth to determine the highest elevation reached by the sun, thereby establishing local apparent noon.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; The moment is prosaic, yet it is presented as a heroic image.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 237&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887 Homer produced an etching based on the painting, in which he further minimized the ship's rigging and diminished the area of sky, thereby focusing more on the figures.&lt;ref name="C2" /&gt;

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Eight Bells - Winslow Homer - overall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Winslow Homer]]. ''Eight Bells'' (1887). Etching in black ink on light beige, medium-thick, smooth-textured wove paper. 60.6 × 74.6 cm. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]

''Eight Bells'' was painted the same year as another of Homer's major paintings, ''Undertow'', both at a time when sales of the artist's work were slow, and he complained of "standing on one leg, one day, and another leg, some other day, and looking in vain for profits."&lt;ref name="CO"&gt;Cooper, 157&lt;/ref&gt; The painting sold the following year, for the reportedly low price of $400 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400|1880|r=-3}}}} today), and was the first oil painting Homer had sold in over three years.&lt;ref name="C2" /&gt; Nonetheless, Homer's disappointment in his inability to find buyers prompted him to stop painting in oils until 1890.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 190&lt;/ref&gt;
==Reception==
When ''Eight Bells'' was exhibited in 1888, it was praised by critics who observed that it was more complex than a purely naturalistic rendering: "For he has caught the color and motion of the greenish waves, white-capped and rolling, the strength of the dark clouds broken with a rift of sunlight, and the sturdy, manly character of the sailors at the rail. In short, he has seen and told in a strong painter's manner what there was of beauty and interest in the scene."&lt;ref name="C2" /&gt; A later biographer wrote of the painting that the men "performing their required tasks, immediately engage our confidence in their competence to deal effectively with any situation the treachery or violence of the sea may produce."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, 214&lt;/ref&gt;

The American artist [[N.C. Wyeth]] named his [[Port Clyde, Maine]], home "Eight Bells" in honor of Homer's painting.  He installed a reproduction of the work in his living room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farnsworthmuseum.org/exhibition/nc-wyeth-painter-and-illustrator |title=N. C.

The '''flag of [[Dominica]]''' was adopted on 3 November 1978, with some small changes having been made in 1981, 1988, and 1990. The original flag was designed by playwright Alwin Bully in early 1978 as the country prepared for independence.&lt;ref name=dominicanews&gt;{{cite news|first=|last= |title=Today is Flag Day in Dominica |url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/culture/today-is-flag-day-in-dominica/ |work=[[Dominica News Online]] |date=19 October 2011|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and design==
The flag, adopted in 1978, features the national bird emblem, the [[Imperial amazon|sisserou parrot]], which also appears on the [[Coat of arms of Dominica|coat of arms]] granted on 21 July 1961. This parrot, endemic to Dominica, is an endangered species with a population of only 250–350 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22686411/0 "Amazona imperialis"], The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Retrieved 12 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The green field represents the lush vegetation of the island. The cross represents the [[Trinity]] and [[Christianity]], with its three colours symbolising the natives, the fertile soil, and the pure water. The 10 green five-pointed stars stand for the country's 10 [[parish]]es: ([[Saint Andrew Parish, Dominica|St Andrew]], [[Saint David Parish, Dominica|St David]], [[Saint George Parish, Dominica|St George]], [[Saint John Parish, Dominica|St John]], [[Saint Joseph Parish, Dominica|St Joseph]], [[Saint Luke Parish, Dominica|St Luke]], [[Saint Mark Parish, Dominica|St Mark]], [[Saint Patrick Parish, Dominica|St Patrick]], [[Saint Paul Parish, Dominica|St Paul]], and [[Saint Peter Parish, Dominica|St Peter]]), while the red disc stands for justice.

The sisserou parrot is sometimes coloured either blue or purple (the parrot's actual colour). The use of [[purple]] makes the flag of Dominica one of only two flags of sovereign states (alongside the [[flag of Nicaragua]]) to contain the colour.

The flag of Dominica, along with other national symbols, was the focus of a government-sponsored "Emblems Week" in 2016. An initiative of the independence committee, Emblems Week is aimed at reflecting on the meaning of the national emblems, and promoting their use among members of the general public and particularly among the country's schools. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.dm/index.php/news/4075-dominica-observes-first-ever-emblems-week|title=Dominica Observes First Ever ‘Emblems Week’|first=GIS|last=Dominica|website=www.news.gov.dm|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows a college student who is murdered on her birthday and begins [[Time loop|reliving the day over and over again]], at which point she sets out to find the killer and stop her death.

Originally announced in 2007 under the title ''Half to Death'', the film was released on October 13, 2017, by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3433393/get-scared-half-to-death-october/ |title=Get Scared 'Half to Death' This October |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |first=Brad |last=Miska |date=April 20, 2017 |accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grossed $122 million worldwide on a $4.8 million budget and received generally positive reviews, with critics deeming the film entertaining while acknowledging the familiar premise,&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/happy-death-day-is-familiar-but-fun/ |title=Happy Death Day Is Familiar but Fun |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=October 12, 2017 |accessdate=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describing it as "''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' meets ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]''".&lt;ref name=opening /&gt; A sequel, ''[[Happy Death Day 2U]]'', is scheduled to be released in February 2019.

== Plot ==
Theresa "Tree" Gelbman wakes up on her birthday in the dorm room of her classmate Carter Davis after drunken partying the previous evening. Tree ignores phone calls from her widowed father David. She dismisses Carter while leaving his room, and throws away a birthday cupcake given to her by her roommate Lori Spengler. Tree also meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask of the campus mascot.

Tree wakes up the next morning in Carter's bed. She is unnerved to find the previous day's events repeating themselves. Baffled, she nonetheless relives the day and uses this second chance to avoid the tunnel and reach the party. However, the masked killer follows her to the party and murders her again. Tree awakens in Carter's bed, realizes that she is in a [[time loop]] and barricades herself in her room to avoid death. The killer, however, is already hiding there and slays her a third time.

Upon waking up, Tree relays her story to Carter. He suggests taking advantage of the loop to identify her killer. She spends the next several iterations trailing suspected classmates and getting killed each time. After a loop where she is bludgeoned, Tree faints and awakens in the campus hospital. Her body shows evidence of recovery from multiple traumatic injuries, indicating that she has retained physical damage from her previous deaths. Shortly after escaping from the hospital, Tree is pursued and killed again.

Waking up in Carter's bed again, Tree convinces Carter of her predicament by demonstrating her knowledge of the day's events. Tree admits to having a tremendous case of self-loathing, particularly for pushing away her father after the death of her mother years ago. Later, Tree sees a local news report on John Tombs, a serial killer being held at the campus hospital. Concluding that Tombs is her killer, Tree rushes to the hospital to warn of his escape. Tombs breaks free and nearly kills Tree, but Carter follows and rescues her. Tombs kills Carter before chasing Tree to a nearby bell tower, where she subdues him with a crowbar. Realizing that Carter will remain dead if she ends the loop, Tree hangs herself.

Believing she has solved her murder, Tree is happier and more relaxed during the next loop. Tree ends her affair with Professor Butler. She meets her father for lunch, and the two patch things up between themselves. That night she goes to the hospital, where she traps and kills Tombs. Relieved to finally be free, she celebrates her birthday in Carter's room and eats the cupcake given to her by Lori.

Tree wakes up still in the loop; confused and angered by her predicament, she returns to her room, where Lori offers her the cupcake again. Tree realizes this was the only time she had ever eaten the cupcake, dying in her sleep. Tree deduces that Lori, not Tombs, is her killer; Lori had poisoned the cupcake, which Tree declined to eat. So Lori utilized her job as a nurse at the hospital to drug and frame Tombs for Tree's murder. Tree invites Lori to eat the cupcake herself; when Lori will not, Tree proposes taking the cupcake to the police. Lori locks the door to prevent Tree from leaving, and admits to having an affair with Professor Butler herself. The jealous Lori attacks Tree, who stuffs the poisoned cupcake in Lori's mouth. She then kicks Lori through a window to her death.

Tree and Carter muse over the day's events in a restaurant. He offers her his room for the night, and Tree wakes up the next day believing herself to still be in the loop. Carter reveals it to be the next day at last; he was playing a prank on her. Tree is too relieved to be angry at him and the two kiss.

The film was first announced in July 2007, with [[Megan Fox]] attached to star. The film was originally titled ''Half to Death'', produced by [[Michael Bay]] and [[Rogue Pictures]], and directed by [[Antti Jokinen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/megan-fox-joins-half-to-death/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Megan Fox Joins Half to Death |work=Beyond Hollywood |date=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 27, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928060314/http://www.beyondhollywood.com/megan-fox-joins-half-to-death/ |archivedate=September 28, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Landon (filmmaker)|Christopher Landon]] was hired to rewrite the [[Scott Lobdell]] screenplay, and while he liked the reworked script the studio decided to not move on with it. The project was only revived years later, as original producer Angela Mancuso had lunch with Landon and remembered about ''Half to Death''. Landon decided to send the script to [[Jason Blum]] of [[Blumhouse Productions]], with whom he had worked in the ''[[Paranormal Activity (film series)|Paranormal Activity]]'' sequels, and he approved it, leading to a [[green-light]] by [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref name=bi/&gt;  Blumhouse announced the project on October 11, 2016, with Landon directing and [[Jessica Rothe]] cast in the lead role of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/jessica-rothe-horror-movie-half-to-death-1201885408/ |title=Jessica Rothe Starring in Horror Movie 'Half to Death' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Dave |last=McNary |date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 2016, it was announced that [[Ruby Modine]], Charles Aitken and Rachel Matthews had joined the cast, alongside Rothe and [[Israel Broussard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/ruby-modine-blumhouse-horro-movie-half-to-death-1201912627/ |title=Ruby Modine Joins Horror Movie 'Half to Death' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Dave |last=McNary |date=November 8, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film got eventually retitled ''Happy Death Day'' in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadline.com/2017/06/half-to-death-retitled-happy-death-day-release-date-1202111656/ Universal, Blumhouse Retitle Film 'Half To Death' To 'Happy Death Day']&lt;/ref&gt;

The mask was constructed by Tony Gardner, the same man who built the "[[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]]" mask from every ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' film, and  its design was personal. Landon explains, "During preproduction ... I was expecting my first son. I don't know if I just had babies on the brain, or if I was subconsciously scared to become a father, but that baby image was floating around in my head. Tony made us a pig mask, too, but when I wore the baby mask in the office, I scared a co-worker, and we thought ... yeah, this is it. This is the one."&lt;ref name=nw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/happy-death-day-baby-mask-tree-683717?amp=1 |title=THE STORY BEHIND 'HAPPY DEATH DAY''S CREEPY BABY MASK AND TREE'S BEST LINES |date=October 12, 2017|access-date=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scream'' itself was listed among the influences Christopher Landon took for the film, along with ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[Groundhog Day]]'' and comedies of the 1980s such as ''[[Sixteen Candles (film)|Sixteen Candles]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/happy-death-day-influences/ |title=Happy Death Day Influences: 10 Movies That Inspired the Director}}&lt;/ref&gt; given he aimed to make a "fun, silly horror movie". He also aimed to emulate the protagonist's personal growth in ''Groundhog Day'' to comment on "this age of social media and all the crappy things that kids do to each other."&lt;ref name=thrillist/&gt;

=== Writing ===
Comic book writer Scott Lobdell said he wanted to play with the tropes of the slasher genre, as according to him "every slasher film opens up with the mean girl getting killed and the good girl living till the end. And I thought, 'How can I make the mean girl and the good girl the same person?'" &lt;ref name=thrillist&gt;Fitz-Gerald, Sean.

Landon says, "They were a psycho couple murdering Tree together. That ultimately didn't work for me. I thought Gregory was a great opportunity to be a suspect. To make him a killer, it didn't help me. That was a change I really wanted to make."&lt;ref name="HRS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/happy-death-day-ending-director-shares-sequel-plans-part-2-1048802 |title='Happy Death Day' Ending: Director Shares Sequel Plans for Part 2 |date=October 15, 2017 |website=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the original draft there was no birthday,&lt;ref name="HRS" /&gt; and no romance, which Landon added to humanize Tree.&lt;ref name=bi/&gt; Landon decided to shorten the protagonist's name Teresa into Tree, which also conveyed her character arc as "trees need to grow and you see this character go from one person to another".&lt;ref name=ti&gt;[http://www.thisisinsider.com/happy-death-day-unanswered-questions-2017-10  The director of 'Happy Death Day' answers all the questions you have after watching the movie], Insider&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming ===
Filming took place at and around [[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola University]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=20625 Production Notes for ''Happy Death Day'']&lt;/ref&gt; and it lasted 5 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/happy-death-day-jessica-rothe-scream-queen-2017 |title=Happy Death Day's Jessica Rothe On What It Means To Be A Scream Queen in 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes where Tree awakens in Carter's bed after her death were filmed back to back in a span of two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gq.com/story/happy-death-day-jessica-rothe |title=Happy Death Day Star Jessica Rothe Explains What It's Like to Die a Dozen Times in the Same Movie |first=Tom |last=Philip |date=October 18, 2017 |accessdate=October 19, 2017 |work=[[GQ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene after Lori dies was supposed to be at the sorority house, but the filming permit was over before production was able to shoot there, forcing the location to be changed into a Los Angeles diner also featured in another Blumhouse production, ''[[Split (2016 American film)|Split]]''.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;

=== Alternate ending ===
In the original ending of the film, Tree is taken to the hospital after her encounter with Lori. The doctor instructs her to stay away from pain medication for at least a day due to the extent of her injuries. After he leaves, a nurse comes in and tells Tree she is giving Tree something for the pain and Tree informs the nurse of the doctor's orders. The nurse reveals herself to be Dr. Butler's wife Stephanie, who says it is for her pain and then murders Tree in revenge for the affair between her and Dr. Butler.

This version was shown in the test screenings for the film, and was received negatively by the audience, forcing the writers to come up with the theatrical ending. Director Christopher Landon also revealed Lori and Dr. Butler were the killers in the rough drafts, which later inspired the idea of the poisoned cupcake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1714429/happy-death-day-shot-an-original-ending-that-made-test-audiences-furious |title=Happy Death Day Shot An Original Ending That Made Test Audiences Furious |work=Cinema Blend |date=2017-10-16 |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bear McCreary composed the score of ''Happy Death Day''. Reflecting the film's blend of horror and comedy, McCreary stated that he wanted "a schizophrenic, dual personality, with light-hearted comedic scoring on one end, and genuinely terrifying soundscapes on the other." This approach is highlighted by the two main [[leitmotif]]s, an energetic theme for Tree evoking contemporary pop music, and one for the killer that consists of distorted vocals provided by McCreary's young daughter Sonatin. The percussion in the score are mostly sampled from  college [[marching band]] drum lines to evoke the collegiate setting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bearmccreary.com/#blog/blog/films/happy-death-day/ Bear Blog: Happy Death Day], Bear McCreary&lt;/ref&gt; While the film's trailer featured [[50 Cent]]'s "[[In Da Club]]" as Tree's ringtone, Landon said the film could not afford to use the track, but still preferred the eventual song music supervisor Andrea von Foerster improvised, the comedic "Busy Day Birthday".&lt;ref name=nw/&gt;

The '''Academy of Music and Drama''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Högskolan för scen och musik'', abbreviated HSM) at the [[University of Gothenburg]] is a school for music, composition, opera singing, music staging, teaching of music and creative subjects in [[Gothenburg]]. It belongs to the Faculty of Fine, Applied and Performing Arts. 

It was started in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsm.gu.se/english/about-us/academy-history/?languageId=100001&amp;disableRedirect=true&amp;returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hsm.gu.se%2Fom-institutionen%2Fhistorik%2F&lt;/ref&gt; as a merger of the former departments of music, theater and opera at the university. 

The main campus building is Artisten in Gothenburg.

The school also acts as a training center for orchestral music. The programme is called the Swedish National Orchestra Academy (SNOA) and was started by the then head Ingemar Henningsson after preparatory work with the [[Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra]] (Göteborgs Symfoniker). The two-year program organizes about 8 or 9 orchestral projects per academic year.

==In popular culture==
A follower of Indian nationalist [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], Ramchandra Moreshwar Karkare, of [[Gwalior|Gwalher]] (Gwalior) Madhya Bharat, wrote a patriotic drama ''Jai Hind'' in March 1947 and published a book in [[Hindi]], with the same title. Later, Karkare became Congress president of Central India Province.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The [[Jai Hind postmark]] was the first commemorative [[postmark]] of Independent India, and was issued on the day of independence, 15 August 1947.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} "जय हिन्द" is also stated on the first, [[List_of_postage_stamps_of_India#1947|Independence series of Indian stamps]].

'''''Leda Atomica''''' is a painting by [[Salvador Dalí]], made in 1949. The picture depicts [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], the mythological queen of [[Sparta]], with the [[swan]]. Leda is a frontal portrait of Dalí's wife, [[Gala Dalí|Gala]], who is seated on a pedestal with a swan suspended behind and to her left. Different objects such as a book, a set square, two stepping stools and an egg float around the main figure. In the background on both sides, the rocks of [[Cap Norfeu]] (on the [[Costa Brava]] in [[Catalonia]], between [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] and [[Cadaqués]]) define the location of the image.

The painting is exhibited in the [[Dalí Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]].

==Mythological background==

Leda was admired by [[Zeus]], who seduced her in the guise of a swan on her wedding night when she slept with her husband [[Tyndareus]]. This double consummation of her marriage resulted in two eggs, each of them hatching twins: from the first egg [[Castor and Pollux]], and from the second [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].

==Structure of the painting==
''Leda Atomica'' is organized according to a rigid mathematical framework, following the "[[golden ratio|divine proportion]]". Leda and the swan are set in a pentagon inside which has been inserted a five-point star of which Dalí made several sketches. The five points of the star symbolize the seeds of perfection: love, order, light (truth) willpower and word (action).
 
The harmony of the framework was calculated by the artist following the recommendations of Romanian mathematician [[Matila Ghyka]]. Unlike his contemporaries who took the view that mathematics distracted from or interrupted artistic inspiration, Dalí considered that any work of art, to be such, had to be based on composition and calculation.&lt;ref name="Maurell"&gt;{{cite web |first=Rosa M. |last=Maurell |title= Mythological References in the work of Salvador Dalí: the myth of Leda |work=Centre for Dalinian Studies |location= Hora Nova |date= May 30, 2000 |url=http://www.salvador-dali.org/serveis/ced/articles/en_article2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghyka's influence is clear in the mathematical formula of the [[golden ratio]] in the lower right of the image

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

which Ghyka specifically cites to calculate the side of a regular pentagon.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;Elliott H. King  - Dalí Atomicus, or the Prodigious Adventure of the Lacemaker and the Rhinoceros - Society for Literature and Science Annual Meeting  October 10–13, 2002, Pasadena, California [http://sls-2002.caltech.edu/king_paper.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism of the painting==

After the atomic bomb was dropped on [[Hiroshima]], Dalí took his work in a new direction based on the principle that the modern age had to be assimilated into art if art was to be truly contemporary. Dalí acknowledged the discontinuity of matter, incorporating a mysterious sense of levitation into his ''Leda Atomica''. Just as one finds that at the atomic level particles do not physically touch, so here Dalí suspends even the water above the shore—an element that would figure into many other later works.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; Every object in the painting is carefully painted to be motionless in space, even though nothing in the painting is connected. Leda looks as if she is trying to touch the back of the swan’s head, but doesn’t do it.

Dalí himself described the painting in the following way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Dalí shows us the hierarchized libidinous emotion, suspended and as though hanging in midair, in accordance with the modern 'nothing touches' theory of intra-atomic physics. Leda does not touch the swan; Leda does not touch the pedestal; the pedestal does not touch the base; the base does not touch the sea; the sea does not touch the shore. . . .''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934162,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |title=And Now to Make Masterpieces - Time. December 8, 1947 |publisher=Time.com |date=1947-12-08 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In reference to the classical myth Dalí identified himself with the immortal [[Castor and Pollux|Pollux]] while his deceased older brother (also called Salvador) would represent [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], the mortal of the twins. Another equivalence could be made regarding the other twins of the myth, Dalí’s sister Ana María being the mortal Clytemnestra, while Gala would represent divine Helen.&lt;ref name="Maurell"/&gt;  Salvador Dalí himself wrote: "I started to paint Leda Atómica which exalts Gala, the metaphysical goddess and succeeded to create the ‘suspended space’".

Dalí’s Catholicism enables also other interpretations of the painting. The painting can be conceived as Dalí's way of interpreting the [[Annunciation]]. The swan seems to whisper her future in her ear, possibly a reference to the legend that the conception of [[Jesus]] was achieved by the introduction of the breath of the [[Holy Ghost]] into the Virgin Mary’s ear. Leda looks straight into the bird's eyes with an understanding expression of what is happening to her and what will happen in the future to her and to her unsure reality. Dalí's transformation of Mary is the result of love as if he created his love to Gala, like God to Mary.&lt;ref name="Leda"&gt;[http://www.planetpapers.com/Assets/1368.php Leda Atomica] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207071754/http://www.planetpapers.com/Assets/1368.php |date=February 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lily Delissa Joseph''' née '''Solomon''', (24 June 1863-27 July 1940) was a British artist and social campaigner active in the English [[Suffragette]] movement.

==Biography==
Joseph was born in [[Bermondsey]] in London into a wealthy, cultured Jewish family.&lt;ref name=JWeiner&gt;{{cite web |author=Julia Weiner|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/artists-in-britain-1700-1940 |title=Artists in Britain: 1700-1940|year=1996|accessdate=24 September 2018|work=Jewish Women's Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BritPort"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Brian Stewart &amp; Mervyn Cutten|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1997|title=The Dictionary of Portrait Painters in Britain up to 1920|ISBN=1 85149 173 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her elder brother was the artist [[Solomon J Solomon]] and [[Flora Lion]] would be a cousin.&lt;ref name=JWeiner/&gt; Joseph attended the Ridley School of Art and the [[Royal College of Art]] in London.&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frances Spalding]]|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1990|title=20th Century Painters and Sculptors |ISBN=1 85149 106 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She painted portraits, interiors and urban landscapes in a style clearly influenced by [[Impressionism]] but often with a limited palette.&lt;ref name=JWeiner/&gt;

Joseph was also an activist in both the women's sufferage movement and in support of Jewish charities. She was among the founders of the Ladies' Guild at the Hammersmith Synagogue in west London and also ran reading rooms in the [[Whitechapel]] area.&lt;ref name="AFoster"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alicia Foster|publisher=Tate Publishing|year=2004|title=Tate Women Artists|ISBN=1-85437-311-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting [[Isaac Rosenberg]] in 1911, she helped pay for his studies at the [[Slade School of Art]].&lt;ref name="AFoster"/&gt; Joseph was arrested, at least, once during the women's [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffrage campagn]]. When her 1912 exhibition at the Baille Gallery, ''Some London and Country Interiors'', was reviewed in the [[Jewish Chronicle]] a notice appeared on the same page apologising for her absence from the show's Private View reception on the grounds that "she was detained at [[Holloway Prison|Holloway Goal]] in connection with the Women's Sufferage Movement".&lt;ref name="AFoster"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JWeiner/&gt;

In 1924, Joseph and her architect husband held a joint exhibition of drawings and paintings at the Suffolk Street Galleries.&lt;ref name="AFoster"/&gt; Throughout her life Joseph was a regular exhibitor at the [[Royal Academy]], showing some twenty-five paintings between 1904 and 1938.&lt;ref name="BritPort"/&gt; She also exhibited with the [[Society of Women Artists]], the [[New English Art Club]] and the [[Royal Society of British Artists]].&lt;ref name="Spalding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFoster"/&gt; Joseph exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] receiving an ''Honourable Mention'' on one occasion and in 1929 winning a selver medal.&lt;ref name="GMWaters"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant M.

[[Image:ArmoryShow poster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Armory Show poster. 1913.]]
The 1913 [[Armory Show]] contained approximately 1300 works by 300 artists. Many of the original works have been lost and some of the artists have been forgotten. The '''list of artists in the Armory Show''', while not complete, includes nearly all the artists from the United States and Europe who were exhibited in the [[Armory Show]] of 1913. The list is largely drawn from the catalog of the 1963 exhibition, ''1913 Armory Show 50th Anniversary Exhibition'', organized by the [[Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute]]. Many exhibitions have been held in the vast spaces of U.S. [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] [[Armory (military)|armories]], but ''the'' Armory Show refers to the International Exhibition of [[Modern Art]] that was organized by the Association of American Painters and Sculptors and opened in [[New York City]]'s [[69th Regiment Armory]], on Lexington Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets, on February 17, 1913, and ran to March 15. It became a legendary watershed event in the history of [[visual arts of the United States|American art]], introducing astonished New Yorkers, accustomed to [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] art, to [[modern art]]. The show served as a catalyst for American artists, who became more independent and created their own artistic language.

The '''Lochar Moss Torc''' is an [[Iron Age]] brass [[torc]] or neck-ring found in Lochar Moss, near [[Dumfries]] in Scotland. It was found by chance in the early nineteenth century and was later donated to the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/b/brass_torc.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
Lochar Moss, located on the [[Solway Firth]] in southwest Scotland, was one of the largest raised [[peat]] lands in Europe until much of it was destroyed and reclaimed for agricultural and urban uses in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It was in the 1840s that two Iron Age objects, a bowl and torc, were accidentally unearthed during peat-cutting. Most scholars suggest that the two items were deliberately deposited in the bog as a [[votive offering|votive or religious offering]]. They later came in to the possession of a local collector called Thomas Gray, who presented them both to the British Museum in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=lochar+moss British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The Lochar Moss Torc was found inside a small bronze bowl, which helped to preserve it relatively intact. The collar is made of [[brass]] and is cast in two pieces: a solid crescent-shaped bar with engraved [[La Tène]] patterns and a series of hollow beads, one of which is missing. Although it was without doubt a prestigious item of jewellery that was cherished by the local community, it remains unclear who it originally belonged to and how the collar would have been worn by the wearer. The design of this type of neck-ring is unique to northern [[Great Britain|Britain]] during the early stages of the Roman colonisation of the province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]].

'''''Madonna of the Fish''''', known also as '''''Madonna with the Fish''''' is a painting by the [[High Renaissance]] master [[Raphael]]. 

[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] sits enthroned with the [[Jesus]] on her knee. On one side is [[St. Jerome]] kneeling by the Lion; he is holding a book. On the other side the archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] is presenting at the foot of the throne the young [[Tobias]], whom he formerly guided to the [[River Tigris]], and who bears the miraculous fish whose heart, liver and gall were to restore his father's sight, and drive the demons from his bride. Tobias with his fish was an early type of baptism. Raphael leading Tobias always expresses protection, and especially protection to the young. The picture is believed to have been painted around 1512-14 to commemorate the introduction of [[Book of Tobit]] to the canonical books of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. St. Jerome translated the Book of Tobit into [[Latin]], which explains his presence on the right of Mary.&lt;ref&gt;1912 review of ''Madonna and the Fish'' on {{cite web |url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles34/italian-pictures-5.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910003010/http://www.oldandsold.com/articles34/italian-pictures-5.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mausoleum of [[Galla Placidia]]''' is a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] building in [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]]. It was listed with seven other structures in Ravenna in the [[World Heritage List]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=UNESCO |title=Early Christian Monuments of Ravenna |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/788 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] experts describe it as "the earliest and best preserved of all [[mosaic]] monuments, and at the same time one of the most artistically perfect".

== History ==
[[Image:Ravenna 1978 079.jpg|thumb|Interior view, showing the southern lunette.]]
[[File:Mausoleum of Galla Placidia mosaics.jpg|thumb|Ceiling]]
The building was formerly the oratory of the Church of the Holy Cross and now contains three [[sarcophagi]]. The largest sarcophagus was thought to contain the remains of [[Galla Placidia]] (died 450), daughter of the Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]].  Her embalmed body was reportedly deposited there in a sitting position, clothed with the imperial mantle. In 1577, however, the contents of the sarcophagus were accidentally burned. The sarcophagus to the right is attributed to Galla's son, Emperor [[Valentinian III]], or to her brother, Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]. The one on the left is attributed to her husband, Emperor [[Constantius III]].

The building is not currently used as a mausoleum.  Its original purpose is unknown. The most common story is that the structure was built by Galla Placidia, who was a well-known patron of the arts, to be used as a mausoleum for her and her family. There seems to be no evidence to prove or disprove Galla's connection to the building. The mausoleum was once connected to the [[narthex]] of Santa Croce, the church for the imperial palace, built in 417 but now in ruins. Santa Croce was one of the first buildings commissioned by Galla. The floor has been raised by five feet since the fifth century in order to remain above the rising water along the upper Adriatic coast.

== Architecture and interior art==
[[Image:Mausoleum of Galla Placidia ceiling mosaics.jpg|thumb|Ceiling mosaic [[Garden of Eden]].]]
Mosaics cover the walls of the [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], the [[lunette]]s and the [[cupola]]. The iconographic themes developed in the decorations represent the victory of eternal life over death. The mausoleum is laid out in a cruciform floor plan, with a central dome on [[pendentives]] and barrel vaults over the four transepts. The exterior of the dome is enclosed in a square tower that rises above the gabled lateral wings. The brick surface is set with narrow mortar joints and decorated with blind arcades.

The interior of the mausoleum is covered with rich Byzantine mosaics, and light enters through alabaster window panels. The inside contains two famous mosaic lunettes, and the rest of the interior is filled with mosaics of Christian and Apocalyptic symbols. The central bay's upper walls are decorated with four pairs of apostles, including St. Peter and St. Paul, acclaiming a giant gold cross in the center of the dome against a blue sky of stars. Symbols of the four evangelists float among the clouds. The other four apostles appear in the barrel vaults of the transepts.

The lunette over the north entrance shows a mosaic of Christ as the Good Shepherd tending his flocks. He holds an imperial staff joined to the Christian cross, symbolizing the combined earthly and heavenly domains. The lunette over the south wall is thought to depict St. Lawrence standing next to a flaming gridiron. On the opposite side of the gridiron a bookcase is shown with four books, each inscribed with the name of an evangelist.

The art historian Gillian Mackie argues that this panel represents the Spanish St. Vincent of Saragossa rather than the Italian St. Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Mackie, "New Light on the So-called Saint Lawrence Panel at the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, Ravenna," [[Gesta (journal)|Gesta]], vol. 29 (1990), 54ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Mackie cites Galla's connection to Spain; in addition, St. Vincent was martyred by drowning at sea, and Galla and her children had been delivered from shipwreck. The panel seems to be an illustration of the poem about St. Vincent in Prudentius's fifth century ''Passio Sancti Vincent Martyris''. In the poem St. Vincent is ordered to disclose his sacred books to be burned. This explains the cupboard containing the Gospels, which has no satisfactory explanation in the story of St. Lawrence.

===Good Shepherd Mosaic===
[[Image:"The good Shepherd" mosaic - Mausoleum of Galla Placidia.jpg|thumb|[[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|The Good Shepherd]].]]
The Lunette of Christ as Good Shepherd over the north entrance is representative of Christian art at this time period in late antiquity. Christ is being depicted as more regal than prior depictions of him as good shepherd. Rather than carrying a lamb over his shoulder, Jesus sits amongst his flock, [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]ed and robed in gold and purple. The mosaic represents a transition period between the naturalistic depictions of the [[Classical antiquity|classical]] period in art history and the stylized representations of the medieval period. The forms still have three-dimensional bulk, but the shading such as in the folds of the robes is less refined than in the past, and figures are not very grounded. Elements of realism have been sacrificed for a focus on the spiritual elements.

'''Monographic series''' (alternatively, '''monographs in series''') are scholarly and scientific books released in successive volumes, each of which is structured like a separate book or [[monograph|scholarly monograph]].
[[File:Loeb Classical Library.jpg|thumb|A volume in the [[Loeb Classical Library]]. Each installment in this monographic series is devoted to a Greek or Latin author, and is accompanied by extensive commentary and notes from the editors.]]

==Semantics==
In general books that are released serially (in successive parts) once a year, or less often, are called [[Book series|series]]. Publications that are released more often than once a year are known as [[periodical]]s. If the volumes can each stand on their own as a separate book, they are called monographs in series, if not they are called '''book sets'''.

==Associations==
The connection among books belonging to such a series can be by discipline, focus, approach, type of work, or geographic location. Examples of such series include "Antwerp Working Papers in Linguistics";&lt;ref&gt;"Antwerp working papers in linguistics" {{OCLC|66592270}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile" (Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger, Copenhagen);&lt;ref&gt;Early English manuscripts in facsimile" {{ISSN|0070-7856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garland reference library; "Canterbury Tales Project" &lt;ref&gt;Garland reference library; "Canterbury Tales Project" {{ISSN|1351-3435}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''); [[Early English Text Society]].

The ''[[Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology]]'' (a series of 19th-century editions of theological works by [[Church of England]] writers, devoted to significant [[Anglo-Catholic]] figures,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Middleton, ''Fathers and Anglicans'' (2004), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[John Henry Parker]]) is an example of a common usage in naming monographic series; another example is the [[John Harvard Library (series)|John Harvard Library]] which consists of notable works relating to the United States. The [[Loeb Classical Library]] is a series of editions of Greek and Latin texts in which the original texts are accompanied by translations into English; the series was begun by James Loeb and is published by [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Lee Simmons, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222542/https://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=12377 Little Big Books: the red and green guides to the wisdom of the Ancient World]" in ''The Weekly Standard'' no. 40 (3 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Series intended for general readers may also have "library" in their titles, e.g. [[Everyman's Library]].

==Categorization==
Libraries and indexing services handle them in various ways. The [[Library of Congress]] catalogs each part of them as an individual book with an individual call number and [[ISBN]] and a series note (technically a series added entry for the overall series, which has its [[ISSN]], and usually a call number. As the Library of Congress receives two copies of most scholarly books as [[copyright]] deposits, it normally keeps one by individual call number and one by series call number. Most other libraries do not have that luxury and have to choose. The Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2nd edition allows either of these options to be used.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association, et al. ''Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules''; 2nd ed., edited by Michael Gorman and Paul W. Winkler. London: Library Association, 1976; ch. 2, sect. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medical library|Medical libraries]] almost always keep them together as a series. The biomedical indexing service [[PubMed]] from the [[National Library of Medicine]] treat the individual volumes in such a series as if they were volumes in a journal.

* ''[[Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology]]'' {{ISSN|0065-2598}}

==Themed volumes==
In many cases each volume in such a series itself contains individual chapters or articles written by different authors, usually on the same general theme. The Library of Congress does not list each such article separately, but PubMed does.

A frequent occasion for such a themed volume is a celebration in honor of a person's scholarly work. If done at retirement or on an anniversary (e.g. 60th birthday), it is usually called a [[Festschrift]] or celebration volume. If after death, it is usually called a [[memorial]].

The publisher Variorum Reprints began publishing its Collected Studies series in 1970. Each of these volumes contains "a selection of articles by a leading authority on a particular subject ... reprinted from a vast range of learned journals, [[Festschrifts]], conference proceedings ...". These volumes are published by [[Ashgate Publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=1449|title=Variorum Collected Studies|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9492">'''Naïve physics''' or '''folk physics''' is the untrained human [[perception]] of basic physical [[phenomena]]. In the field of [[artificial intelligence]] the study of naïve [[physics]] is a part of the effort to formalize the [[common knowledge]] of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last=Hayes|first=Pat|title= The naive physics manifesto|journal=Expert systems in the micro-electronic age|editor=Michie, Donald|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-85224-381-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ideas of folk physics are simplifications, misunderstandings, or misperceptions of well-understood phenomena, incapable of giving useful predictions of detailed experiments, or simply are contradicted by more thorough observations. They may sometimes be true, be true in certain limited cases, be true as a good first approximation to a more complex effect, or predict the same effect but misunderstand the underlying mechanism.

Naïve physics can also be defined as an intuitive understanding all humans have about objects in the physical world.&lt;ref name="goswami"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goswami |first=U. |year=2008 |title=Cognitive Development: the learning brain |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Psychology Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychologists are delving deeper into these phenomena with promising results.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Psychological studies indicate that certain notions of the physical world are innate in all of us.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Examples==
Some examples of naïve physics include commonly understood, intuitive, or everyday-observed rules of nature:

* What goes up must come down
* A dropped object falls straight down
* A solid object cannot pass through another solid object
* A [[vacuum]] sucks things towards it
* An object is either at rest or moving, in an absolute sense
* Two events are either simultaneous or they are not

Many of these and similar ideas formed the basis for the first works in formulating and systematizing physics by [[Aristotle]] and the medieval [[scholasticism|scholastics]] in [[Western civilization]]. In the modern science of physics, they were gradually contradicted by the work of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and others. The idea of [[absolute simultaneity]] survived until 1905, when the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] and its supporting experiments discredited it.

==Psychological research==
The increasing sophistication of technology make possible more research on knowledge acquisition.  Researchers measure physiological responses (like [[heart rate]] or [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]) to quantify reaction to a particular stimulus.  Concrete physiological data is helpful when observing infant behavior, because infants cannot use words to explain things (such as their reactions) the way most adults or older children can.

Research in naïve physics relies on technology to measure eye gaze and reaction time in particular. Through observation, researchers know that infants get [[bored]] looking at the same stimulus after a certain amount of time.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt; That boredom is called [[habituation]]. When an infant is sufficiently habituated to a stimulus, he or she will typically look away, alerting the experimenter to his or her boredom. At this point, the experimenter will introduce another stimulus. The infant will then dishabituate by attending to the new stimulus. In each case, the experimenter measures the time it takes for the infant to habituate to each stimulus.

Researchers infer that the longer the infant takes to habituate to a new stimulus, the more it violates his or her expectations of physical phenomena.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt; When an adult observes an optical illusion that seems physically impossible, he or she will attend to it until it makes sense. Until recently,{{When|date=August 2013}} psychologists believed that our understanding of physical laws emerges strictly from experience. But research shows that infants, who do not yet have such expansive knowledge of the world, have the same extended reaction to events that defy what is physically possible. Such studies conclude that all people are born with an innate ability to understand the physical world.

Smith and Cassati (1994) have reviewed the early history of naïve physics, and especially the role of the Italian psychologist [[Paolo Bozzi]].&lt;ref name="smith&amp;casati"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith//articles/naivephysics.html |last1=Smith |first1=B. | author1link = Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|last2=Casati |first2=R. |year=1994 |title=Naive Physics: An Essay in Ontology |journal=[[Philosophical Psychology]] |volume=7 |number=2 |pages=225–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of experiments===
The basic experimental procedure of a study on naïve physics involves three steps: prediction of the infant's expectation, violation of that expectation, and measurement of the results. As mentioned above, the physically impossible event holds the infant's attention longer, indicating surprise when expectations are violated.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt;

====Solidity====
An experiment that tests an infant's knowledge of solidity involves the impossible event of one solid object passing through another. First, the infant is shown a flat, solid square moving from 0˚ to 180˚ in an arch formation. Next, a solid block is placed in the path of the screen, preventing it from completing its full range of motion. The infant habituates to this event, as it is what anyone would expect. Then, the experimenter creates the impossible event, and the solid screen passes through the solid block. The infant is confused by the event and attends longer than in probable event trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baillargeon | first1 = R. | authorlink = Renee Baillargeon | year = 1994 | title = How Do Infants Learn About the Physical World? | url = | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 133–140 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occlusion====
An occlusion event tests the knowledge that an object exists even if it is not immediately visible. [[Jean Piaget]] originally called this concept [[object permanence]]. When Piaget formed [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|his developmental theory]] in the 1950s, he claimed that object permanence is learned, not innate. The children's game [[Peekaboo|peek-a-boo]] is a classic example of this phenomenon, and one which obscures the true grasp infants have on permanence. To disprove this notion, an experimenter designs an impossible occlusion event. The infant is shown a block and a transparent screen. The infant habituates, then a solid panel is placed in front of the objects to block them from view. When the panel is removed, the block is gone, but the screen remains. The infant is confused because the block has disappeared indicating that he/she understands that objects maintain location in space and do not simply disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baillargeon | first1 = R | year = 2004 | title = Infants' Physical World | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 89–94 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00281.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Containment====
A containment event tests the infant's recognition that an object that is bigger than a container cannot fit completely into that container. [[Elizabeth Spelke]], one of the psychologists who founded the naïve physics movement, identified the continuity principle, which conveys an understanding that objects exist continuously in time and space.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt; Both occlusion and containment experiments hinge on the continuity principle. In the experiment, the infant is shown a tall cylinder and a tall cylindrical container. The experimenter demonstrates that the tall cylinder fits into the tall container, and the infant is bored by the expected physical outcome. The experimenter then places the tall cylinder completely into a much shorter cylindrical container, and the impossible event confuses the infant. Extended attention demonstrates the infant's understanding that containers cannot hold objects that exceed them in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baillargeon | first1 = R. | last2 = Hespos | first2 = S.J. | year = 2001 | title = Infant's Knowledge About Occlusion and Containment Events: A Surprising Discrepancy | url = | journal = [[Psychological Science]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 141–147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baillargeon's research===
The published findings of [[Renee Baillargeon]] brought innate knowledge to the forefront in psychological research. Her research method centered on the visual preference technique. Baillargeon and her followers studied how infants show preference to one stimulus over another. Experimenters judge preference by the length of time an infant will stare at a stimulus before habituating. Researchers believe that preference indicates the infant's ability to discriminate between the two events.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt;

'''New media art''' refers to artworks created with [[new media]] [[technology|technologies]], including [[digital art]], [[computer graphics]], [[computer animation]], [[virtual art]], [[Internet art]], [[interactive art]], [[video games]], [[computer]] [[robotics]], [[3D printing]], [[cyborg art]] and art as [[biotechnology]]. The term differentiates itself by its resulting cultural objects and social events, which can be seen in opposition to those deriving from old visual arts (i.e. traditional [[painting]], sculpture, etc.). This concern with medium is a key feature of much [[contemporary art]] and indeed many art schools and major universities now offer majors in "New Genres" or "New Media"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academyart.edu/computer-arts-school/outline.html|title=Web Design &amp; New Media|work=academyart.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a growing number of graduate programs have emerged internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artexetra.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/shanken_art_industry_academy.pdf|format=PDF|last=Shanken|first=Edward A. |title=Artists in Industry and the Academy: Collaborative Research, Interdisciplinary Scholarship, and the Creation and Interpretation of Hybrid Forms|work= Leonardo 38:5 (2005)|pages= 415–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media art often involves interaction between artist and observer or between observers and the artwork, which responds to them. Yet, as several theorists and curators have noted, such forms of interaction, social exchange, participation, and transformation do not distinguish new media art but rather serve as a common ground that has parallels in other strands of contemporary art practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hybridge.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/writings-media/|title=Contemporary Art and New Media: Toward a Hybrid Discourse?|work=Contemporary Art and New Media: Toward a Hybrid Discourse?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such insights emphasize the forms of cultural practice that arise concurrently with emerging technological platforms, and question the focus on technological media, per se.

New Media concerns are often derived from the [[telecommunications]], [[mass media]] and [[Digital electronics|digital electronic]] modes of delivering the artworks involve, with practices ranging from [[conceptual art|conceptual]] to [[Internet Art|virtual art]], [[performance]] to [[Installation art|installation]].

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}
The origins of new media art can be traced to the moving photographic inventions of the late 19th century such as the [[zoetrope]] (1834), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877) and [[Eadweard Muybridge|Eadweard Muybridge's]] [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879). From the 1920s through the 1950s, various forms of kinetic and light art, from [[Thomas Wilfred]]'s 'Lumia' (1919) and 'Clavilux' light organs to [[Jean Tinguely]]'s self-destructing sculpture 'Homage to New York' (1960) can be seen as progenitors of new media art.

In 1958 [[Wolf Vostell]] becomes the first artist who incorporates a [[television]] set into one of his works. The ''Black Room Cycle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/deutscher-ausblick/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: German View from the Black Room Cycle|work=medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Installation art|installation]] is part of the collection of the [[Berlinische Galerie]].

During the 1960s the development of then new technologies of video produced the new media art experiments of [[Nam June Paik]], and [[Wolf Vostell]] with the [[Installation art|installation]] ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'' in 1963 at the [[Smolin Gallery]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: Television Décollage|work=medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. Michael Noll]], and [[multimedia]] [[performance]]s of [[E.A.T.]], [[Fluxus]] and [[Happening]]. 
In 1983, [[Roy Ascott]] introduced the concept of "distributed authorship" in his worldwide telematic project La Plissure du Texte&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timeline.1904.cc/tiki-index.php?page=La+Plissure+du+Texte|title=La Plissure du Texte|work=1904.cc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402201801/http://timeline.1904.cc/tiki-index.php?page=La+Plissure+du+Texte|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Frank Popper]]'s "Electra" at the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]. The development of computer graphics at the end of the 1980s and real time technologies then in the 1990s combined with the spreading of the Web and the Internet favored the emergence of new and various forms of interactive art by [[Ken Feingold]],  [[Lynn Hershman Leeson]], [[David Rokeby]], [[Ken Rinaldo]], [[Perry Hoberman]], [[Tamas Waliczky]]; [[telematic art]] by [[Roy Ascott]], [[Paul Sermon]], [[Michael Bielický]]; Internet art by [[Vuk Ćosić]], [[Jodi (art collective)|Jodi]]; virtual and immersive art by [[Jeffrey Shaw]], [[Maurice Benayoun]], [[Monika Fleischmann]], [[Wolfgang Strauss]] and large scale urban installation by [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]]. In Geneva, the [[Centre pour l'Image Contemporaine]] or CIC coproduced with [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] from Paris and the [[Museum Ludwig]] in Cologne the first internet video archive of new media art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmedia-art.org/index_en.htm|title=Nouveaux Media - New Media - Neue Medien|website=www.newmedia-art.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously advances in biotechnology have also allowed artists like [[Eduardo Kac]] to begin exploring DNA and genetics as a new art medium.

Influences on new media art have been the theories developed around interaction, [[hypertext]], databases, and [[computer network|networks]]. Important thinkers in this regard have been [[Vannevar Bush]] and [[Theodor Nelson]], whereas comparable ideas can be found in the literary works of [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Italo Calvino]], and [[Julio Cortázar]].

==Themes==
In the book ''New Media Art'', [[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana named several themes that contemporary new media art addresses, including [[computer art]], [[collaboration]], [[Personal identity|identity]], [[appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[Open source|open sourcing]], [[telepresence]], surveillance, corporate parody, as well as intervention and [[hacktivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurizio Bolognini]] suggested that new media artists have one common denominator, which is a self-referential relationship with the new technologies, the result of finding oneself inside an epoch-making transformation determined by technological development. Nevertheless, new media art does not appear as a set of homogeneous practices, but as a complex field converging around three main elements: 1) the art system, 2) scientific and industrial research, and 3) political-cultural media activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Catricalà|first1=Valentino|title=Media Art. Toward a new Definition of Arts in the Age of Technology|date=2015|publisher=Gli Ori|isbn=978- 88-7336-564-8|url=https://www.academia.edu/11185472/Media_Art._Towards_a_New_Definition_of_Arts_in_the_Age_of_Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant differences between scientist-artists, activist-artists and technological artists closer to the art system, who not only have different training and technocultures, but have different artistic production.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Maurizio Bolognini]], [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], ''Artmedia X Proceedings''. Paris, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This should be taken into account in examining the several themes addressed by new media art.

Non-linearity can be seen as an important topic to new media art by artists developing interactive, generative, collaborative, immersive artworks like [[Jeffrey Shaw]] or [[Maurice Benayoun]] who explored the term as an approach to looking at varying forms of digital projects where the content relays on the user's experience. This is a key concept since people acquired the notion that they were conditioned to view everything in a linear and clear-cut fashion.  Now, art is stepping out of that form and allowing for people to build their own experiences with the piece. Non-linearity describes a project that escape from the conventional linear narrative coming from novels, theater plays and movies. Non-linear art usually requires audience participation or at least, the fact that the "visitor" is taken into consideration by the representation, altering the displayed content. The participatory aspect of new media art, which for some artists has become integral, emerged from [[Allan Kaprow]]'s ''Happenings'' and became with Internet, a significant component of contemporary art. 

The inter-connectivity and interactivity of the [[internet]], as well as the fight between corporate interests, governmental interests, and public interests that gave birth to the web today, fascinate and inspire a lot of current new media art.

Many new media art projects also work with themes like politics and social consciousness, allowing for [[social activism]] through the interactive nature of the media. New media art includes "explorations of code and user interface; interrogations of archives, databases, and networks; production via automated scraping, filtering, cloning, and recombinatory techniques; applications of user-generated content (UGC) layers; crowdsourcing ideas on social- media platforms; narrowcasting digital selves on "free" websites that claim copyright; and provocative performances that implicate audiences as participants".&lt;ref&gt;Dale Hudson and Patricia R. Zimmermann. (2015). ''[http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/thinking-through-digital-media-dale-hudson/?K=9781137433626 Thinking Through Digital Media Transnational Environments and Locative Places]''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. P. 1. {{ISBN|978-1137433626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key themes in new media art is to create visual views of databases. Pioneers in this area include [[Lisa Strausfeld]], [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Bulajic|first1=Viktorija Vesna| title=Database aesthetics: art in the age of information overflow|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2007|url=|isbn=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Alberto Frigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moulon |first=Dominique |date=2013 |title=Contemporary new media art  |url= |location= |publisher=Nouvelles éditions Scala |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Database aesthetics holds at least two attractions to new media artists: formally, as a new variation on non-linear narratives; and politically as a means to subvert what is fast becoming a form of control and authority.

The emergence of 3D printing has introduced a new bridge to new media art, joining the virtual and the physical worlds.  The rise of this technology has allowed artists to blend the computational base of new media art with the traditional physical form of sculpture.  A pioneer in this field was artist [[Jonty Hurwitz]] who created the first known anamorphosis sculpture using this technique.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Longevity ==
As the technologies used to deliver works of new media art such as [[photographic film|film]], [[cassette tape|tapes]], [[web browser]]s, [[software]] and [[operating system]]s become obsolete, New Media art faces serious issues around the challenge to [[Art conservation and restoration|preserve artwork]] beyond the time of its contemporary production. Currently, research projects into [[New media art preservation]] are underway to improve the preservation and documentation of the fragile media arts heritage (see [[Docam|DOCAM - Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage]]).

Methods of preservation exist, including the translation of a work from an obsolete medium into a related new medium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ercim.org/publication/ws-proceedings/DELOS6/rosetta.pdf|format=PDF|title=Digital Rosetta Stone|website=ercim.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the digital archiving of media (see the [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome ArtBase]], which holds over 2000 works, and the [[Internet Archive]]), and the use of [[emulators]] to preserve work dependent on obsolete software or operating system environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm |title=Preserving the Rhizome ArtBase (report) |first=Richard |last=Rinehart |website=rhizome.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116094312/http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm |archivedate=2005-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/arts/design/the-mission-to-save-vanishing-internet-art.html|title=The Mission to Save Vanishing Internet Art|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=2016-10-21|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Around the mid-90s, the issue of storing works in digital form became a concern. Digital art such as moving images, multimedia, interactive programs, and computer-generated art has different properties than physical artwork such as oil paintings and sculptures. Unlike analog technologies, a digital file can be recopied onto a new medium without any deterioration of content. One of the problems with preserving digital art is that the formats continuously change over time. Former examples of transitions include that from 8-inch floppy disks to 5.25-inch floppies, 3-inch diskettes to CD-ROMs, and DVDs to flash drives. On the horizon is the obsolescence of flash drives and portable hard drives, as data is increasingly held in online [[cloud storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://besser.tsoa.nyu.edu/howard/Papers/elect-art-longevity.html|title=Longevity of Electronic Art|website=besser.tsoa.nyu.edu|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums and galleries thrive off of being able to accommodate the presentation and preservation of physical artwork. New media art challenges the original methods of the art world when it comes to documentation, its approach to collection and preservation. Technology continues to advance, and the nature and structure of art organizations and institutions will remain in jeopardy. The traditional roles of curators and artist are continually changing, and a shift to new collaborative models of production and presentation is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/225871513|title=New media in the white cube and beyond : curatorial models for digital art|date=2008|publisher=University of California Press|others=Paul, Christiane.|isbn=9780520255975|location=Berkeley|oclc=225871513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
In New Media programs, students are able to get acquainted with the newest forms of creation and communication. New Media students learn to identify what is or isn't "new" about certain technologies.&lt;ref name="illinois.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art.illinois.edu/content/undergraduate/programs/new-media/|title=The School of Art and Design - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|work=illinois.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science and the market will always present new tools and platforms for artists and designers. Students learn how to sort through new emerging technological platforms and place them in a larger context of sensation, communication, production, and consumption.

When obtaining a bachelor's degree in New Media, students will primarily work through practice of building experiences that utilize new and old technologies and narrative. Through the construction of projects in various media, they acquire technical skills, practice vocabularies of critique and analysis, and gain familiarity with historical and contemporary precedents.&lt;ref name="illinois.edu" /&gt; 

In the United States, many Bachelor's and Master's level programs exist with concentrations on Media Art, New Media, Media Design, Digital Media and Interactive Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~j21099/nmschools.html|title=New Media Programs in the United States — Dr. Edgar Huang|website=www.iupui.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Nicholas Wolterstorff lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan with his wife Claire. He has 4 grown children and 1 that died at age 25 while mountain climbing in Austria. He has seven grandchildren.

==Thought==
While an undergraduate at Calvin College, Wolterstorff was greatly influenced by professors [[William Harry Jellema]], [[Henry Stob]] and [[Henry Zylstra]], who introduced him to schools of thought that have dominated his mature thinking: Reformed theology and [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|common sense]] philosophy (these have also influenced the thinking of Wolterstorff's friend and colleague [[Alvin Plantinga]], another alumnus of Calvin College).

Wolterstorff  builds upon the ideas of the Scottish common sense philosopher [[Thomas Reid]], who approached knowledge "from the bottom-up". Instead of reasoning about [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] conditions of knowledge, Wolterstorff suggests that knowledge and our knowing faculties are not the subject of our research but have to be seen as its starting point. Wolterstorff rejects classical [[foundationalism]] and instead sees knowledge as based upon insights in reality which are direct and indubitable.

'''''Noureddin, Son of Iran''''' ({{lang-fa|نورالدین پسر ایران}}) is the memoirs of [[Sayyid]] Noureddin Afi from the 80 months of his participation in the [[Iran–Iraq war]]. ''Noureddin, Son of Iran'' led to Afi's reputation in Iran after it was published by Sureye Mehr Publication in 2011. In 1994, Mousa Ghayour recorded the memoirs of Noureddin Afi in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and it was presented as a written book by Masoume Sepehri years later. َThis book consisted of 18 chapters along with photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibna.ir/vdcauwn6y49nia1.tgk4.html Iran Book News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator mentions a dream as the reason of producing this war memoir.&lt;ref name="Mashregh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mashreghnews.ir/fa/news/117519/%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%BE%D8%B3%D8%B1-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D9%83%D9%87-%D9%81%D9%83%D8%B1-%D9%85%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D9%86%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA |title= "Noureddin, Son of Iran" The memoir of a man who believed he had done nothing|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= Mashreghnews.com |publisher= |accessdate= 4 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Noureddin, Son of Iran'' received an honorable menion in the "Memoir" category of the [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad Literary Awards]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/103523-no-winner-selected-for-irans-most-lucrative-literary-awards-this-year |title=No winner selected for Iran’s most lucrative literary awards this year |work=[[Tehran Times]] |date=25 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210083837/http://www.tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/103523-no-winner-selected-for-irans-most-lucrative-literary-awards-this-year |archivedate=10 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
[[Sayyid]] Noureddin wants to participate the Iran–Iraq war, but he is not allowed at first because he is still young. He tries repeatedly and finally they let him go to war. He attends a military training course in the fall of 1980, and heads toward the western zones of Iran to serve in the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Sepah]] of the [[Mehabad]]. He moves to the southern war zones along with his brother, Sadegh. Nourreddin loses his brother in an Iraqi [[airstrike]]. With shrapnel in his body they make him go under surgery in the hospitals of [[Mashhad]] and [[Kermanshah]] many times. But he does not recover well because he is severely damaged in the face, eyes and stomach. Due to the severe injuries on his face, his countenance changes when he is only 18. In 1984, he marries a 16-year-old girl named Masoume and their child is born 4 years later. The war finishes but he is still suffering the injuries and he misses his lovely friends, especially Amir Maralbash who was killed in the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manvaketab.ir/145079-نورالدین-پسر-ایران/bz=fs Book introduction, Nourreddin, Son of Iran (Persian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why it was written==
In the last page of his memoir, Afi expresses his motivation for recounting his war memories as such:
{{quote|I never thought that, telling the memories is important nowadays. However, war memories and interviews were not discussed and I was involved with the side effects my injuries. In 1994, I dreamed that Mr [[Khamenei]] was reading some papers and crying. I was there, Some one said that these papers were the memories of a %70 [[veteran]] who had participated in war for 80 months and still said he had nothing for the war...My mind was busy with this dream and I felt my duty would finish by telling these memories. So, I  recounted the eight years of living in the war context to make those unique times survive for ever. (P632)&lt;ref name="Mashregh"/&gt;}}

==Animated movie==

''Noureddin, Son of Iran'' is a [[Computer animation|computer animated]] movie directed by Meisam Hosseini. The movie consists of 30 parts of 15 minutes each.

The '''Old Crypt''' is a building at 11&amp;nbsp;Watergate Street and 15/15A&amp;nbsp;Watergate Row, Chester, Cheshire, England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]] and incorporates part of [[Chester Rows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376424|desc= Numbers 15 And 15a Row The Old Crypt, Chester|accessdate= 31 August 2013|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Crypt is built in [[sandstone]] and brick with a grey [[slate]] roof.  It has five storeys; the lowest two are [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] [[undercroft]]s dating from about 1180, and the storey above it includes part of Chester Rows.  The top two storeys are in [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style and date from about 1744.  Externally at street level is a 19th-century shop front with two [[chamfer]]ed [[Pier (architecture)|piers]].  Behind this, the undercroft has two naves, each with four bays which are divided by octagonal columns.  At the Row level overlooking the street is a wooden rail on a [[baluster|balustrade]] divided by two [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] columns.  Behind this is the walkway and a 20th-century shop front.  The two top storeys each have three Georgian style 12-pane [[sash window]]s.  Between the storeys is a stone [[string course]] and at the sides of the building are [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] [[Quoin (architecture)|quoin]]s.  At its top is an irregular stepped [[parapet]].

'''Persian art''' or '''Iranian art''' has one of the richest [[art]] heritages in world history and has been strong in many media including [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[weaving]], [[pottery]], [[calligraphy]], [[metalworking]] and [[sculpture]]. At different times, influences from the art of neighbouring civilizations have been very important, and latterly Persian art gave and received major influences as part of the wider styles of [[Islamic art]]. This article covers the art of Persia up to 1925, and the end of the [[Qajar dynasty]]; for later art see [[Iranian modern and contemporary art]], and for traditional crafts see [[arts of Iran]]. [[Rock art in Iran]] is its most ancient surviving art. [[Iranian architecture]] is covered at that article.

From the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of 550 BC–330 BC for most of the time a large Iranian-speaking state has ruled over areas similar to the modern boundaries of [[Iran]], and often much wider areas, sometimes called [[Greater Iran]], where a process of cultural [[Persianization]] left enduring results even when rulership separated. The courts of successive dynasties have generally led the style of Persian art, and court-sponsored art has left many of the most impressive survivals.

In ancient times the surviving monuments of Persian art are notable for a tradition concentrating on the human figure (mostly male, and often royal) and animals. Persian art continued to place larger emphasis on figures than Islamic art from other areas, though for religious reasons now generally avoiding large examples, especially in sculpture.  The general Islamic style of dense decoration, geometrically laid out, developed in Persia into a supremely elegant and harmonious style combining motifs derived from plants with Chinese motifs such as the cloud-band, and often animals that are represented at a much smaller scale than the plant elements surrounding them.  Under the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the 16th century this style was used across a wide variety of media, and diffused from the court artists of the shah, most being mainly painters.

==Early pottery==
[[File:Sialk pot (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Pottery Vessel, 4th millennium BC]]
{{main|Susa}}
Evidence of a painted-pottery civilization around [[Susa]] has been dated to c&amp;nbsp;5000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;{{cite book|title=An Encyclopedia of World History| editor-last = Langer | editor-first = William L. |edition = 5th | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston| year = 1972 | isbn = 0-395-13592-3|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Susa was firmly within the [[Sumer]]ian [[Uruk]] cultural sphere during the [[Uruk period]]. An imitation of the entire state apparatus of Uruk, [[proto-writing]], [[cylinder seal]]s with Sumerian motifs, and monumental architecture, is found at Susa. Susa may have been a colony of Uruk. As such, the [[periodization]] of Susa corresponds to Uruk; Early, Middle and Late Susa II periods (3800–3100&amp;nbsp;BCE) correspond to Early, Middle, and Late Uruk periods.

Shortly after Susa was first settled 6000&amp;nbsp;years ago, its inhabitants erected a temple on a monumental platform that rose over the flat surrounding landscape. The exceptional nature of the site is still recognizable today in the artistry of the ceramic vessels that were placed as offerings in a thousand or more graves near the base of the temple platform. Nearly two thousand pots were recovered from the cemetery most of them now in the [[Louvre]]. The vessels found are eloquent testimony to the artistic and technical achievements of their makers, and they hold clues about the organization of the society that commissioned them.&lt;ref name="Aruz 1992 26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painted ceramic vessels from Susa in the earliest first style are a late, regional version of the Mesopotamian [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] ceramic tradition that spread across the Near East during the fifth millennium B.C.&lt;ref name="Aruz 1992 26"/&gt;

Susa I style was very much a product of the past and of influences from contemporary ceramic industries in the mountains of western Iran. The recurrence in close association of vessels of three types—a drinking goblet or beaker, a serving dish, and a small jar—implies the consumption of three types of food, apparently thought to be as necessary for life in the afterworld as it is in this one. Ceramics of these shapes, which were painted, constitute a large proportion of the vessels from the cemetery. Others are course cooking-type jars and bowls with simple bands painted on them and were probably the grave goods of the sites of humbler citizens as well as adolescents and, perhaps, children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery is carefully made by hand. Although a slow wheel may have been employed, the asymmetry of the vessels and the irregularity of the drawing of encircling lines and bands indicate that most of the work was done freehand.

==Elam==
[[Elam]]ite art, from the south and west of modern Iran shared many characteristics with the neighbouring [[art of Mesopotamia]], though it was often less sophisticated. [[Cylinder seal]]s, small figures of worshippers, gods and animals, shallow reliefs, and some large statues of rulers are all found.  There are a small number of very fine gold vessels with relief figures.&lt;ref name="Porada"&gt;Porada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luristan bronzes==
[[File:Horse Bit Cheekpiece, about 700 BC, Luristan, Iran, bronze - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08162.JPG|thumb|Horse bit cheekpiece with "[[Master of Animals]]" motif, about 700 BC]]
{{Main|Luristan bronze}}
Luristan bronzes (rarely "Lorestān", "Lorestāni" etc. in sources in English) are small [[casting|cast]] objects decorated with [[bronze sculpture]]s from the [[Early Iron Age]] which have been found in large numbers in [[Lorestān Province]] and [[Kermanshah]] in west-central [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;"Luristan" remains the usual spelling in art history for the bronzes, as for example in EI, Muscarella, Frankfort, and current museum practice&lt;/ref&gt; They include a great number of ornaments, tools, weapons, horse-fittings and a smaller number of vessels including [[Situla (vessel)|situla]]e,&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; and those found in recorded excavations are generally found in burials.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 115–116; EI I&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnicity of the people who created them remains unclear,&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 116–117; EI I&lt;/ref&gt; though they may well have been [[Persian people|Persian]], possibly related to the modern [[Lur people]] who have given their name to the area. They probably date to between about 1000 and 650 BC.&lt;ref&gt;EI, I&lt;/ref&gt;

The bronzes tend to be flat and use [[openwork]], like the related metalwork of [[Scythian art]].  They represent the art of a nomadic or [[transhumant]] people, for whom all possessions needed to be light and portable, and necessary objects such as weapons, finials (perhaps for tent-poles), horse-harness fittings, pins, cups and  small fittings are highly decorated over their small surface area.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 343-48; Muscarella, 117 is less confident that they were not settled.&lt;/ref&gt; Representations of animals are common, especially goats or sheep with large horns, and the forms and styles are distinctive and inventive. The "[[Master of Animals]]" motif, showing a human positioned between and grasping two [[confronted animals]] is common&lt;ref&gt;EI I&lt;/ref&gt; but typically highly stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 344-45&lt;/ref&gt; Some female "mistress of animals" are seen.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ziwiye hoard]] of about 700 BC is a collection of objects, mostly in metal, perhaps not all in fact found together, of about the same date, probably showing the art of the Persian cities of the period.  Delicate metalwork from [[Iron Age]] II times has been found at [[Hasanlu]] and still earlier at [[Marlik]].&lt;ref name="Porada"/&gt;

==Achaemenids==
[[File:Colossal Bull Head, Iran, Persepolis, Hundred-Column Hall, Achaemenid Period, reigns of Xerxes and Artaxerxes I, 486-425 BC, restored limestone - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC07935.JPG|thumb|Restored colossal [[Limestone (mineral)|limestone]] bull head [[Persian column]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] from [[Persepolis]], [[Achaemenid architecture|Achaemenid]], 486-425 BC]]
Achaemenid art includes [[frieze]] reliefs, metalwork, decoration of palaces, glazed brick masonry, fine craftsmanship (masonry, carpentry, etc.), and gardening. Most survivals of court art are monumental sculpture, above all the [[relief]]s, double animal-headed [[Persian column]] capitals and other sculptures of [[Persepolis]] (see below for the few but impressive Achaemenid rock reliefs).&lt;ref name="Cotterell, 161–162"&gt;Cotterell, 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Persians took artists, with their styles and techniques, from all corners of their empire, they produced not simply a combination of styles, but a synthesis of a new unique Persian style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Lipiński, Karel van Lerberghe, Antoon Schoors|author2=Karel Van Lerberghe|author3=Antoon Schoors| title = Immigration and emigration within the ancient Near East| url = https://books.google.com/?id=thIxCmwfNoMC| year = 1995| publisher = Peeters Publishers| isbn = 978-90-6831-727-5| page = 119 }}; Cotterell, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus the Great in fact had an extensive ancient Iranian heritage behind him; the rich Achaemenid gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a specialty of the Medes, was for instance in the tradition of earlier sites.

The [[rhyton]] drinking vessel, horn-shaped and usually ending in an animal shape, is the most common type of large metalwork to survive, as in a [[Achaemenid Persian Lion Rhyton|fine example in New York]].  There are a number of very fine smaller pieces of jewellery or inlay in precious metal, also mostly featuring animals, and the  [[Oxus Treasure]] has a wide selection of types.  Small pieces, typically in gold, were sewn to clothing by the elite, and a number of gold [[torc]]s have survived.&lt;ref name="Cotterell, 161–162"/&gt;

==Rock reliefs==

[[File:IR04-08-23a.jpg|thumb|[[Taq Bostan]]; the "knight" is probably [[Khosrau II of Persia|Khosrow Parviz]] mounted on [[Shabdiz]]]]
The large carved [[rock relief]], typically placed high beside a road, and near a source of water, is a common medium in Persian art, mostly used to glorify the king and proclaim Persian control over territory.&lt;ref&gt;Canepa, 53 and throughout. Canepa, 63–64, 76–78 on siting&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins with [[Lullubi]] and [[Elam]]ite rock reliefs, such as those at [[Kul-e Farah]] and [[Eshkaft-e Salman]] in southwest Iran, and continues under the Assyrians.  The [[Behistun Inscription|Behistun relief and inscription]], made around 500 BC for [[Darius the Great]], is on a far grander scale, reflecting and proclaiming the power of the [[Achaemenid empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Luschey; Canepa, 55–57&lt;/ref&gt; Persian rulers commonly boasted of their power and achievements, until the Muslim conquest removed imagery from such monuments; much later there was a small revival under the [[Qajar dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Herrmann and Curtis"&gt;Herrmann and Curtis&lt;/ref&gt;

Behistun is unusual in having a large and important inscription, which like the Egyptian [[Rosetta Stone]] repeats its text in three different languages, here all using [[cuneiform script]]: Old Persian, [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] (a later form of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]).&lt;ref&gt;Luschey&lt;/ref&gt; This was important in the modern understanding of these languages. Other Persian reliefs generally lack inscriptions, and the kings involved often can only be tentatively identified.  The problem is helped in the case of the Sasanians by their custom of showing a different style of crown for each king, which can be identified from their coins.&lt;ref name="Herrmann and Curtis"/&gt;

[[Naqsh-e Rustam]] is the [[necropolis]] of the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] (500–330 BC), with four large tombs cut high into the cliff face. These have mainly architectural decoration, but the facades include large panels over the doorways, each very similar in content, with figures of the king being invested by a god, above a zone with rows of smaller figures bearing tribute, with soldiers and officials. The three classes of figures are sharply differentiated in size. The entrance to each tomb is at the centre of each cross, which opens onto a small chamber, where the king lay in a [[sarcophagus]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cotterell, 162; Canepa, 57–59, 65–68&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal beam of each of the tomb's facades is believed to be a replica of the entrance of the palace at [[Persepolis]].

Only one has inscriptions and the matching of the other kings to tombs is somewhat speculative; the relief figures are not intended as individualized portraits.  The third from the left, identified by an inscription, is the tomb of [[Darius I|Darius I the Great]] (''c.'' 522–486&amp;nbsp;BC). The other three are believed to be those of [[Xerxes I]] (''c.'' 486–465&amp;nbsp;BC), [[Artaxerxes I]] (''c.'' 465–424&amp;nbsp;BC), and [[Darius II]] (''c.'' 423–404&amp;nbsp;BC) respectively. A fifth unfinished one might be that of Artaxerxes III, who reigned at the longest two years, but is more likely that of [[Darius III]] (''c.'' 336–330&amp;nbsp;BC), last of the Achaemenid dynasts.  The tombs were looted following the conquest of the Achaemenid Empire by [[Alexander the Great]].
&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Well below the Achaemenid tombs, near ground level, are rock reliefs with large figures of [[Sassanian]] kings, some meeting gods, others in combat.  The most famous shows the Sassanian king [[Shapur I]] on horseback, with the Roman Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] bowing to him in submission, and [[Philip the Arab]] (an earlier emperor who paid Shapur tribute) holding Shapur's horse, while the dead Emperor [[Gordian III]], killed in battle, lies beneath it (other identifications have been suggested).  This commemorates the [[Battle of Edessa]] in 260 AD, when Valerian became the only Roman Emperor who was captured as a prisoner of war, a lasting humiliation for the Romans.  The placing of these reliefs clearly suggests the Sasanian intention to link themselves with the glories of the earlier [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann and Curtis; Canepa, 62, 65–68&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three further Achaemenid royal tombs with similar reliefs at [[Persepolis]], one unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/va-vh/vandenberghe/vandenberghe_list.html Vanden Berghe #27–29]&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven Sassanian reliefs, whose approximate dates range from 225 to 310 AD, show subjects including investiture scenes and battles.  The earliest relief at the site is [[Elam]]ite, from about 1000 BC. About a kilometre away is [[Naqsh-e Rajab]], with a further four Sasanian rock reliefs, three celebrating kings and one a high priest.  Another important Sasanian site is [[Taq Bostan]] with several reliefs including two royal investitures and a famous figure of a [[cataphract]] or Persian heavy cavalryman, about twice life size, probably representing the king [[Khosrau II of Persia|Khosrow Parviz]] mounted on his favourite horse [[Shabdiz]]; the pair continued to be celebrated in later Persian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann and Curtis; Canepa, 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Firuzabad, Fars]] and [[Bishapur]] have groups of Sassanian reliefs, the former including the oldest, a large battle scene, now badly worn.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann and Curtis; Keall for the six at Bishapur&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Barm-e Delak]] a king offers a flower to his queen.

Sassanian reliefs are concentrated in the first 80 years of the dynasty, though one important set are 6th-century, and at relatively few sites, mostly in the Sasanian heartland.  The later ones in particular suggest that they draw on a now-lost tradition of similar reliefs in palaces in [[stucco]].  The rock reliefs were probably coated in plaster and painted.&lt;ref name="Herrmann and Curtis"/&gt;

The rock reliefs of the preceding Persian [[Selucid]]s and [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] are generally smaller and more crude, and not all direct royal commissions as the Sasanian ones clearly were.&lt;ref&gt;Canepa, 59–61, 68–73&lt;/ref&gt; At Behistun an earlier relief including a lion was adapted into a reclining [[Herakles]] in a fully [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] style; he reclines on a lion skin. This was only uncovered below rubble relatively recently; an inscription dates it to 148 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Downey; Canepa, 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; Other reliefs in Iran include the [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] king in shallow relief at [[Shikaft-e Gulgul]]; not all sites with Persian reliefs are in modern Iran.&lt;ref name="Herrmann and Curtis"/&gt;  Like other Sassanian styles, the form enjoyed a small revival under the Qajar, whose reliefs include a large and lively panel showing hunting at the royal hunting-ground of [[Tangeh Savashi]], and a panel, still largely with its colouring intact, at Taq Bostan showing the shah seated with attendants.

The standard catalogue of pre-Islamic Persian reliefs lists the known examples (as at 1984) as follows: [[Lullubi]] #1–4; [[Elam]] #5–19; Assyrian #20–21; Achaemenid #22–30; Late/Post-Achaemenid and Seleucid #31–35; Parthian #36–49; Sasanian #50–84; others #85–88.&lt;ref&gt;Vanden Berghe, Louis, ''Reliefs rupestres de l' Iran ancien'', 1983, Brussels, per [http://www.livius.org/va-vh/vandenberghe/vandenberghe_list.html online summary of his list here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parthians==
[[File:Arm less man edit 3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Statue, National Museum of Iran 2401|Bronze statue of a Parthian nobleman]] from the sanctuary at Shami in [[Elymais]]]]
{{main|Parthian art}}
The art of the Parthians was a mix of Iranian and [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] styles. The [[Parthian Empire]] existed from 247 BC to 224 AD in what is now Greater Iran and several territories outside it. Parthian places are often overlooked in excavations, and Parthian layers difficult to disguish from those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 45&lt;/ref&gt; The research situation and the state of knowledge on Parthian art is therefore still very patchy; dating is difficult and the most important remains come from the fringes of the empire, as at [[Hatra]] in modern [[Iraq]], which has produced the largest quantity of Parthian sculpture yet excavated.&lt;ref&gt;Downey&lt;/ref&gt;  Even after the period of the Parthian dynasty, art in its style continued in surrounding areas for some time.  Even in narrative representations, figures look frontally out to the viewer rather than at each other, a feature that anticipates the art of [[Late Antiquity]], [[medieval Europe]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]].  Great attention is paid to the details of clothing, which in full-length figures is shown decorated with elaborate designs, probably embroidered, including large figures.&lt;ref&gt;Downey; Cotterell, 173–175; Rawson, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The excavations at [[Dura-Europos]] in the 20th century provided many new discoveries. The classical archaeologist and director of the excavations, [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], realized that the art of the first centuries AD, [[Palmyra]], [[Dura Europos]], but also in Iran up to the Buddhist India followed the same principles. He called this artwork ''Parthian art''.&lt;ref&gt;Rostovtzeff: ''Dura and the Problem of Parthian Art''; Downey&lt;/ref&gt;

The most characteristic feature of the "Parthian" art is frontality which is not a special feature of Iranic or Parthian art and first appeared in the art of [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=muQ3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7|title=Iconography of Religions|author=H. T. Bakker|page= 7|year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are doubts whether this art can be called a "Parthian" art or that it should be associated with any particular regional area; there is no evidence that this art was created outside the middle-Euphrates region then brought to Palmyra for example.&lt;ref name="labo"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IA-YlZqHv90C&amp;pg=PA329|title=The Roman Near East, 31 B.C.-A.D. 337|author= Fergus Millar|page= 329|year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This art is better thought of as a local development common to the middle Euphrates region.&lt;ref name="labo" /&gt;  Parthian rock reliefs are covered above.

In architecture, patterns in plaster were very popular, almost all now lost.

==Sasanians==
[[File:The Colossal Statue of Shapur I.jpg|thumb|320px|left|The [[Colossal Statue of Shapur I]], r. AD 240–272]]

[[Sasanian art]], or Sasanian art, was produced under the [[Sasanian Empire]] which ruled from the 3rd to 7th centuries AD, before the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] was completed around 651.  In 224 AD, the last [[Parthia]]n king was defeated by [[Ardashir I]]. The resulting Sasanian dynasty would last for four hundred years, ruling modern Iran, Iraq, and much territory to the east and north of modern Iran. At times the Levant, much of Anatolia and parts of Egypt and Arabia were under its control. It began a new era in Iran and [[Mesopotamia]], which in many ways was built on [[Achaemenid]] traditions, including the art of the period. Nevertheless, there were also other influences on art of the period that came from as far as China and the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Harper; Cotterell, 177–178;&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving art of the Sasanians is best seen in its architecture, reliefs and metalwork, and there are some surviving paintings from what was evidently a widespread production.  Stone reliefs were probably greatly outnumbered by interior ones in plaster, of which only fragments have survived.  Free standing sculptures faded out of popularity in this time as compared to the period under the Parthians, but the [[Colossal Statue of Shapur I]] (r. AD 240–272) is a major exception, carved from a [[stalagmite]] grown in a cave;&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;Harper&lt;/ref&gt; there are literary mentions of other colossal statues of kings, now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Keall&lt;/ref&gt;  The important Sasanian rock reliefs are covered above, and the Parthian tradition of moulded stucco decoration to buildings continued, also including large figurative scenes.&lt;ref name="Harper"/&gt;

[[File:Iran sasanide, coppa ovale in argento con sogg. vegetali e geometrici, VII sec.JPG|thumb|Sasanian decoration on the underside of a silver vessel, 7th century]]

Surviving Sasanian art depicts courtly and chivalric scenes, with considerable grandeur of style, reflecting the lavish life and display of the Sasanian court as recorded by Byzantine ambassadors.  Images of rulers dominate many of the surviving works, though none are as large as the [[Colossal Statue of Shapur I]]. Hunting and battle scenes enjoyed a special popularity, and lightly-clothed dancing girls and entertainers.  Representations are often arranged like a coat of arms, which in turn may have had a strong influence on the production of art in Europe and East Asia. Although Parthian art preferred the front view, the narrative representations of the Sassanian art often features figures shown in the profile or a three-quarter view. Frontal views occur less frequently.&lt;ref name="Harper"/&gt;

One of the few sites where wall-paintings survived in quantity is [[Panjakent]] in modern [[Tajikistan]], and ancient [[Sogdia]], which was barely, if at all, under the control of the central Sasanian power.  The old city was abandoned in the decades after the Muslims eventually took the city in 722 and has been extensively excavated in modern times.  Large areas of wall paintings survived from the palace and private houses, which are mostly now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] or [[Tashkent]].  They covered whole rooms and were accompanied by large quantities of reliefs in wood.  The subjects are similar to other Sasanian art, with enthroned kings, feasts, battles, and beautiful women, and there are illustrations of both Persian and Indian epics, as well as a complex mixture of deities.  They mostly date from the 7th and 8th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Marshak, Boris I, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/panjikant "Panjicant"], 2002, ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]''; Canby (1993), 9; Harper; many photos at [http://warfare.ml/Persia/Sogdian_murals_from_Panjakent-6-8C.htm warfare.ml]&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Bishapur]] floor [[mosaic]]s in a broadly Greco-Roman style have survived, and these were probably widespread in other elite settings, perhaps made by craftsmen from the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;Keall for Bishapur; see Harper for other sites&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Sasanid silver vessels have survived, especially rather large plates or bowls used to serve food.  These have high-quality engraved or embossed decoration from a courtly repertoire of mounted kings or heroes, and scenes of hunting, combat and feasting, often partially [[gilding|gilded]].  Ewers, presumably for wine, may feature dancing girls in relief. These were exported to China, and also westwards.&lt;ref&gt;Harper; Cotterell, 189–190&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sasanian glass]] continued and developed Roman glass technology. In simpler forms it seems to have been available to a wide range of the population, and was a popular luxury export to [[Byzantium]] and China, even appearing in elite burials from the period in Japan.  Technically, it is a silica-soda-lime glass production characterized by thick glass-blown vessels relatively sober in decoration, avoiding plain colours in favour of transparency and with vessels worked in one piece without over- elaborate amendments. Thus the decoration usually consists of solid and visual motifs from the mould (reliefs), with ribbed and deeply cut facets, although other techniques like trailing and applied motifs were practised.&lt;ref name="Harper"/&gt; Sasanian pottery does not seem to have been used by the elites, and is mostly utilitarian.

Carpets evidently could reach a high level of sophistication, as the praise lavished on the lost royal [[Baharestan Carpet]] by the Muslim conquerors shows. But the only surviving fragments that might originate from Sasanid Persia are humbler productions, probably made by nomad tribes.  Sasanid textiles were famous, and fragments have survived, mostly with designs based on animals in compartments, in a long-lasting style.&lt;ref name="Harper"/&gt;

===Before the Mongol conquest===
Persia managed to retain its cultural identity after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], which was complete by 654, and the Arab conquerors soon gave up attempts to impose the [[Arabic language]] on the population, although it became the language used by scholars. Turkic peoples became increasingly important in Greater Iran, especially the eastern parts, leading to a cultural [[Turko-Persian tradition]]. The political structure was complex, with effective power often exercised by local rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen et al, 105, 133–135; Soucek&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nishapur]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], especially the 9th and 10th centuries, was one of the great centres of [[pottery]] and related arts.&lt;ref&gt;Nishapur: Pottery of the Early Islamic Period,Wilkinson, Charles K. (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ceramic artefacts discovered in Nishapur are preserved in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, and museums in [[Tehran]] and [[Mashhad]]. Ceramics produced at Nishapur showed links with [[Sasanian art]] and [[Central Asian]] art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/415980/Nishapur-pottery&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometric Islamic architectural decoration in stucco, tiling, brick and carved wood and stone became elaborate and refined, and along with textiles worn by the rich was probably the main type of art that could be seen by the whole population, with other types essentially restricted to the private spheres of the rich.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen et al, 105–116, 159–163, 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;  Carpets are recorded in several accounts of life at the time, but none remain; they were perhaps mainly a rural [[folk art]] at this period.  Very highly decorated metalwork in copper alloys ([[brass]] or [[bronze]]) was produced, apparently for a sophisticated urban market. Gold and silver equivalents apparently existed but have been mostly recycled for their precious materials; the few survivals were mostly traded north for furs and then buried as [[grave goods]] in [[Siberia]]. Sasanid [[iconography]] of mounted heroes, hunting scenes, and seated rulers with attendants remained popular in pottery and metalwork, now often surrounded by elaborate geometrical and calligraphic decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen et al, 166–171; Soucek; Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 78–84, 64–73&lt;/ref&gt;  The rich silk textiles that were an important export from Persia also continued to use the animal, and sometimes human, figures of their Sasanid predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen et al, 125-127&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Samanid Empire|Samanid period]] saw the creation of epigraphic pottery. These pieces were typically [[earthenware]] vessels with black [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] lettering in [[Kufic|Kufi]] script painted on a base of white slip. These vessels would typically be inscribed with blessings or proverbs, and used to serve food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McWilliams|first1=Mary|title=Bowl Inscribed with a Saying of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/art/165532|website=Harvard Art Museums|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samarqand]] and Nishapur were both centres of production for this kind of pottery.&lt;ref name="Volov 1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volov|first1=Lis|title=Plaited Kufic on Samanid Epigraphic Pottery|journal=Ars Orientalis|date=1966|volume=6|issue=1966|pages=107–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]], nomads of Turkic origin from present-day Mongolia, appeared on the stage of Islamic history toward the end of the 10th century. They seized Baghdad in 1048, before dying out in 1194 in Iran, although the production of "Seljuq" works continued through the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century under the auspices of smaller, independent sovereigns and patrons. During their time, the center of culture, politics and art production shifted from [[Damascus]] and [[Baghdad]] to [[Merv]], [[Nishapur]], [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], and [[Isfahan]], all in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.89; Soucek&lt;/ref&gt; Seljuq palace centres often featured [[Seljuk stucco figures]].

Popular patronage expanded because of a growing economy and new urban wealth.   Inscriptions in architecture tended to focus more on the patrons of the piece.  For example, sultans, viziers or lower ranking officials would receive often mention in inscriptions on mosques.  Meanwhile, growth in mass market production and sale of art made it more commonplace and accessible to merchants and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.91; Soucek&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of increased production, many relics have survived from the Seljuk era and can be easily dated.  In contrast, the dating of earlier works is more ambiguous.  It is, therefore, easy to mistake Seljuk art as new developments rather than inheritance from classical Iranian and Turkic sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware, enamelled with figures on a white background, and use [[fritware]], a [[silicon]]-based paste, rather than clay.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 64–73&lt;/ref&gt;  Metalworkers highlighted their intricate hammered designs with precious metal inlays.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 78–93&lt;/ref&gt;  Across the Seljuk era, from Iran to Iraq, a unification of book painting can be seen.  These paintings have animalistic figures that convey strong symbolic meaning of fidelity, treachery, and courage.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persians gradually adopted [[Arabic script]]s after the conquest, and [[Persian calligraphy]] became an important artistic medium, often used as part of the decoration of other works in most media.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen et al, 128–129, 162, 167; Soucek; Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 50–62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ilkhanids===
During the 13th century, the [[Mongols]] under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]] swept through the Islamic world. After his death, his empire was divided among his sons, forming many dynasties: the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] in China, the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]] in Iran and the [[Golden Horde]] in northern Iran and southern Russia, the latter two converting to Islam within a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

A rich civilization developed under these "little khans," who were originally subservient to the Yuan emperor, but rapidly became independent. Architectural activity intensified as the Mongols became sedentary, and retained traces of their nomadic origins, such as the north-south orientation of the buildings. At the same time a process of "iranisation" took place, and construction according to previously established types, such as the "Iranian plan" mosques, was resumed. The art of the Persian book was also born under this dynasty, and was encouraged by aristocratic patronage of large manuscripts such as the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' compiled by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], and the Demotte or [[Great Mongol Shahnameh]], probably commissioned by his son. New techniques in ceramics appeared, such as the ''lajvardina'' (a variation on [[lusterware]]), and Chinese influence is perceptible in all arts.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossabi2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris Rossabi|title=From Yuan to Modern China and Mongolia: The Writings of Morris Rossabi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXejBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA661&amp;lpg=PA661#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=28 November 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28529-3|pages=661, 670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timurids===
{{See also|Timurid art}}
During the reign of the [[Timurids]], the golden age of Persian painting began, and Chinese influence continued, as Timurid artists refined the Persian art of the book, which combines paper, calligraphy, illumination, illustration and binding in a brilliant and colourful whole.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; From the start paper was used, rather than [[parchment]] as in Europe. It was the Mongol ethnicity of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chaghatayid]] and Timurid [[Khan (title)|Khans]] that is the source of the stylistic depiction of the human figure in Persian art during the Middle Ages. These same Mongols intermarried with the [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] of Central Asia, even adopting their religion and languages. Yet their simple control of the world at that time, particularly in the 13–15th centuries, reflected itself in the idealised appearance of Persians as Mongols. Though the ethnic make-up gradually blended into the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and [[Mesopotamia]]n local populations, the Mongol stylism continued well after, and crossed into [[Asia Minor]] and even North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carpets==
[[File:Hamburg MKG Safavid animal carpet.jpg|thumb|400px|Detail of a Persian Animal carpet, Safavid period, 16th century]]
{{main|Persian carpet}}
Carpet weaving is an essential part of [[Persian culture]] and [[Iranian art|art]]. Within the group of [[Oriental rug]]s produced by the countries of the so-called "rug belt", the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and elaborateness of its designs.&lt;ref name="Savory"&gt;Savory&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian carpets and rugs of various types were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes, in village and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent different, simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the [[history of Iran]] and its various peoples. The carpets woven in the Safavid court manufactories of [[Isfahan]] during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistical design, and are treasured in museums and private collections all over the world today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran. Exceptional individual Safavid carpets include the [[Ardabil Carpet]] (now in London and Los Angeles) and the [[Coronation Carpet]] (now in [[Copenhagen]]). Much earlier, the [[Baharestan Carpet]] is a lost Sasanian carpet for the royal palace at [[Ctesiphon]], and the oldest significant carpet, the [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk Carpet]] was possibly made in Persia.&lt;ref name="Savory"/&gt;

Carpets woven in towns and regional centres like [[Tabriz rug|Tabriz]], [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]], [[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]], [[Kashan rug|Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Nain rug|Nain]] and [[Qom rug|Qom]] are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of [[Tabriz]] have played an important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline. Rugs woven by the villages and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool, bright and elaborate colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small village weavers often produce rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most authentic and traditional rugs of Persia, as opposed to the artistic, pre-planned designs of the larger workplaces. [[Gabbeh]] rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition.&lt;ref name="Savory"/&gt;
[[File:Ghyas el Din Jami - Tabriz (?) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|The Hunting carpet made by Ghyath ud-Din Jami. Wool, cotton and silk, 1542-3]]

The art and craft of carpet weaving has gone through periods of decline during times of political unrest, or under the influence of commercial demands. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes during the second half of the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a major part in the economy of modern Iran.&lt;ref name="Savory"/&gt; Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional dyeing with [[natural dye]]s, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention of modern and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian carpets and rugs were regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige from the first time they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers, until today.

Although the term "Persian carpet" most often refers to pile-woven textiles, flat-woven carpets and rugs like [[Kilim]], [[Soumak rug|Soumak]], and embroidered fabrics like [[Suzani (textile)|Suzani]] are part of the rich and manifold tradition of Persian weaving.  Persia was famous for its textiles at least as early as for its carpets.&lt;ref name="Savory"/&gt;

In 2010, the "traditional skills of carpet weaving" in [[Fārs]] and [[Kashan rug|Kashan]] were inscribed to the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00382|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00383|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian miniature==

{{main|Persian miniature}}

A Persian miniature is a small painting on paper, whether a book illustration or a separate work of art intended to be kept in an album of such works called a ''[[muraqqa]]''.  The techniques are broadly comparable to the Western and Byzantine traditions of [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  Although there is an older Persian tradition of wall-painting, the survival rate and state of preservation of miniatures is better, and miniatures are much the best-known form of Persian painting in the West, and many of the most important examples are in Western, or Turkish, museums.  Miniature painting became a significant Persian [[genre]] in the 13th century, receiving Chinese influence after the [[Mongol conquests]],&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest point in the tradition was reached in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), Chapters 3 and 4 respectively&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition continued, under some Western influence, after this,&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), Chapters 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; and has many modern exponents.  The Persian miniature was the dominant influence on other Islamic miniature traditions, principally the [[Ottoman miniature]] in Turkey, and the [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniature]] in the Indian sub-continent.

The tradition grew from book illustration, illustrating many narrative scenes, often with many figures.  The representational conventions that developed are effective but different from Western [[graphical perspective]].  More important figures may be somewhat larger than those around them, and battle scenes can be very crowded indeed. Recession (depth in the picture space) is indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space.  Great attention is paid to the background, whether of a landscape or buildings, and the detail and freshness with which plants and animals, the fabrics of tents, hangings or carpets, or tile patterns are shown is one of the great attractions of the form.  The dress of figures is equally shown with great care, although artists understandably often avoid depicting the patterned cloth that many would have worn.  Animals, especially the horses that very often appear, are mostly shown sideways on; even the love-stories that constitute much of the classic material illustrated are conducted largely in the saddle, as far as the prince-protagonist is concerned.  Landscapes are very often mountainous (the plains that make up much of Persia are rarely attempted), this being indicated by a high undulating horizon, and outcrops of bare rock which, like the clouds in the normally small area of sky left above the landscape, are depicted in conventions derived from Chinese art.  Even when a scene in a palace is shown, the viewpoint often appears to be from a point some metres in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 25-26, 48-49, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian art under Islam had never completely forbidden the human figure, and in the miniature tradition the depiction of figures, often in large numbers, is central.  This was partly because the miniature is a private form, kept in a book or album and only shown to those the owner chooses. It was therefore possible to be more free than in wall paintings or other works seen by a wider audience. The [[Qur'an]] and other purely religious works are not known to have been illustrated in this way, though histories and other works of literature may include religiously related scenes, including those [[Depictions of Muhammad|depicting the Prophet Muhammed]], after 1500 usually without showing his face.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, throughout; see Welch, 95–97 for one of the most famous examples, illustrated below&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the figurative scenes in miniatures and borders, there was a parallel style of non-figurative ornamental decoration which was found in borders and panels in miniature pages, and spaces at the start or end of a work or section, and often in whole pages acting as frontispieces.  In Islamic art this is referred to as "illumination", and manuscripts of the Qur'an and other religious books often included considerable number of illuminated pages.&lt;ref&gt;In the terminiology of Western [[illuminated manuscript]]s, "illumination" usually covers both narrative scenes and decorative elements.&lt;/ref&gt;  The designs reflected contemporary work in other media, in later periods being especially close to book-covers and Persian carpets, and it is thought that many carpet designs were created by court artists and sent to the workshops in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safavids==
[[Image:Plate pomegranates Louvre MAO868.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese-influenced ''Plate decorated with two pomegranates'', v.&amp;nbsp;1500, [[the Louvre]]]]
{{Main|Safavid art}}
Safavid art is the art of the Persian [[Safavid dynasty]] from 1501 to 1722. It was a high point for the art of the book and architecture; and also including ceramics, metal, glass, and gardens. The arts of the Safavid period show a far more unitary development than in any other period of Persian art,&lt;ref&gt;Welch&lt;/ref&gt; with the same style, diffused from the court, appearing in carpets, architectural tiles, ceramics, and manuscript illumination.&lt;ref name="Blair &amp; Bloom, 171"&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 171&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Safavids seized the throne Persian art had become divided into two styles: in the east a continuation of Timurid styles, and in the west a [[Turkmens|Turkman]] style. Two rulers of the new dynasty succeeded in encouraging new styles that spread all over their territories: Shah [[Tahmasp I]], who reigned 1524–1576 but lost interest in art after about 1555, and [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas I]] (r. 1588–1629).&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts of the book===
Under the Safavids, the art of the book, especially [[Persian miniature]] painting, constituted the essential driving force of the arts.  The ''ketab khaneh'', the royal library-workshop, provided most of the sources of motifs for objects such as carpets, ceramics or metal.  Various types of books were copied, illuminated, bound and sometimes illustrated:  religious books – [[Koran]]s, but also commentaries on the sacred text and theological works—and books of [[Persian literature]] – the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s ''[[Nizami Ganjavi#Quinary .28.22Panj Ganj.22 or .22Khamsa.22.29|Khamsa]]'', [[Jami al-Tawarikh]] by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], and shorter accounts of the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]], or "Night Journey" of the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 165–182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paper]], a Muslim Spain invention arriving early in Iran (13th century), was always used.  There is frequent use of coloured papers.  Towards 1540, a marbled paper also appeared, which however rapidly disappeared again.  The bindings were mostly in tinted [[Morocco leather]] of very fine quality.  They could be gilded and stamped with geometric, floral or figurative motifs, or embossed in blue. In the second half of the 16th century, they pierced the leather covers to allow the coloured paper or silk pages to be seen.  In the same period, at [[Shiraz]], appeared lacquered bindings, which remain however very rare and highly valued in Iran.  The decoration of page margins was realised in various ways: sometimes they were inserted in a different paper, (a tradition that appeared in the 15th century); sprinkled with gold, following a Chinese custom; or painted with colours or gold.  The style of illustrations varied greatly from one manuscript to another, according to the period and centre of production.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), chapter 2; Blair &amp; Bloom, 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

Tahmasp I was for the early years of his reign a generous funder of the royal workshop, who were responsible for several of the most magnificent Persian manuscripts, but from the 1540s he was increasingly troubled by religious scruples, until in 1556 he finally issued an "Edict of Sincere Repentance" attempting to outlaw miniature painting, music and other arts.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 77-86&lt;/ref&gt;  This greatly disrupted the arts, with many painters such as [[Abd al-Samad]] and [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] moving to India to develop the [[Mughal miniature]] instead; these two were the trail-blazers, headhunted by the Mughal Emperor [[Humayun]] when he was in exile in 1546.  Others found work at the provincial courts of Tahmasp's relations.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 83-88&lt;/ref&gt;

From this dispersal of the royal workshop there was a shift in emphasis from large illustrated books for the court to the production of single sheets designed to be put into a [[muraqqa]], or album.  These allowed collectors with more modest budgets to acquire works by leading painters. By the end of the century complicated narrative scenes with many figures were less popular, replaced by sheets with single figures, often only partially painted and with a garden background drawn rather than painted.  The master of this style was [[Reza Abbasi]] whose career largely coincided with the reign of Abbas I, his main employer.  Although he painted figures of old men, his most common subjects were beautiful young men and (less often) women or pairs of lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 91-101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceramics===
[[File:Iran Flasche makffm HSt13 image02.jpg|thumb|Flask, 2nd half of 17th century]]
The study and dating of ceramics under Shah Ismail and Shah Tahmasp is difficult because there are few pieces which are dated or which mention the place of production.  [[Chinese porcelain]] was collected by the elite and more highly valued than the local productions; Shah Abbas I donated much of the royal collection to the shrines at [[Ardabil]] and [[Mashad]], renovating a room at Ardabil to display pieces in niches.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 101-104, 121-123, 137-159&lt;/ref&gt;  Many locations of workshops have been identified, although not with certainty, in particular: [[Nishapur]], [[Kubachi ware]], [[Kerman]] (moulded monochromatic pieces) and [[Mashhad]]. [[Lusterware]] was revived, using a different technique from the earlier production, and typically producing small pieces with a design in a dark copper colour over a dark blue background. Unlike other wares, these use traditional Middle Eastern shapes and decoration rather than [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery|Chinese-inspired ones]].&lt;ref name="Blair &amp; Bloom, 171"/&gt;

In general, the designs tend to imitate those of Chinese porcelain, with the production of blue and white pieces with Chinese form and motifs, with motifs such as  chi clouds, and dragons.&lt;ref name="Blair &amp; Bloom, 171"/&gt;  The Persian blue is distinguished from the Chinese blue by its more numerous and subtle nuances.  Often, quatrains by Persian poets, sometimes related to the destination of the piece (allusion to wine for a goblet, for example) occur in the scroll patterns.  A completely different type of design, much more rare, carries iconography very specific to Islam (Islamic zodiac, bud scales, arabesques) and seems influenced by the Ottoman world, as is evidenced by feather-edged anthemions (honeysuckle ornaments) widely used in Turkey.  New styles of figures appeared, influenced by the art of the book:  young, elegant cupbearers, young women with curved silhouettes, or yet cypress trees entangling their branches, reminiscent of the paintings of [[Reza Abbasi]].

Numerous types of pieces were produced:  goblets, plates, long-necked bottles, spitoons, etc.  A common shape is flasks with very small necks and bodies flattened on one side and very rounded on the other.  Shapes borrowed from Islamic metalwork with decoration largely inspired by Chinese porcelain are characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 162-163, 218-219&lt;/ref&gt; With the closing of the Chinese market in 1659, Persian ceramic soared to new heights, to fulfill European needs.  The appearance of false marks of Chinese workshops on the backs of some ceramics marked the taste that developed in Europe for far-eastern porcelain, satisfied in large part by Safavid production.  This new destination led to wider use of Chinese and exotic iconography (elephants) and the introduction of new forms, sometimes astonishing ([[hookah]]s, octagonal plates, animal-shaped objects).

===Metalwork===
Metalwork saw a gradual decline during the Safavid dynasty, and remains difficult to study, particularly because of the small number of dated pieces. Under Shah Ismail, there is a perpetuation of the shapes and decorations of Timurid inlays: motifs of almond-shaped glories, of ''shamsa'' (suns) and of  ''chi'' clouds are found on the inkwells in the form of mausoleums or the globular pitchers reminiscent of [[Ulugh Beg]]'s jade one.  Under Shah Tahmasp, inlays disappeared rapidly, as witnessed by a group of candlesticks in the form of pillars.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 178; Canby (2009), 84-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloured paste (red, black, green) inlays begin to replace the previous inlays of silver and gold.  [[Openwork]] panels in steel appear, for uses such as elements of doors, plaques with inscriptions, and the heads of '[[alam]]s, the standards carried in Shi'ite religious processions.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 237&lt;/ref&gt;  Important shrines were given doors and [[jali]] grilles in silver and even gold.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardstone carvings===
Persian [[hardstone carving]]s, once thought to mostly date to the 15th and 16th centuries, are now thought to stretch over a wider period.  Jade was increasingly appreciated from the Ilkhanid period. As well as wine-cups,&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 160-161&lt;/ref&gt; there are a series of pitchers with globular bellies, mounted on a little ring-shaped base and having wide, short necks.  Two of these (one in black jade inlaid with gold, the other in white jade) are inscribed with the name of Ismail I.  The handle is in the shape of a dragon, which betrays a Chinese influence, but this type of pitcher comes in fact directly from the preceding period: its prototype is the pitcher of Ulugh Beg.  We also know of blades and handles of knives in jade, often inlaid with gold wire and engraved.  Hardstone serves also to make jewels to inlay in metal objects, such as the great zinc bottle inlaid with gold, rubies and turquoise dated to the reign of Ismail and conserved at the museum of [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapi]] in [[Istanbul]].

==Qajars==

{{main|Qajar art}}
Qajar art refers to the art, architecture, and art-forms of the [[Qajar dynasty]] of the late [[Greater Iran|Persian Empire]], which lasted from 1781 to 1925.  The boom in artistic expression that occurred during the Qajar era was the fortunate side effect of the period of relative peace that accompanied the rule of [[Agha Muhammad Khan]] and his descendants. With his ascension, the bloody turmoil that had been the eighteenth century in Persia came to a close, and made it possible for the peacetime arts to again flourish.  European influence was strong, and produced new genres like painted enamel decoration on metal, typically with flowers that clearly draw on French and other European styles.  [[Lacquer]] on wood is used in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 117–124; Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 177-181; Scarce&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qajar painting===
Painting now adopted the European technique of [[oil painting]]. Large murals of scenes of revelry, and historical scenes, were produced as murals for palaces and coffee houses, and many portraits have an arched top showing they were intended to be inset into walls.  Qajar art has a distinctive style of portraiture.  The roots of traditional Qajar painting can be found in the style of painting that arose during the preceding [[Safavid]] empire. During this time, there was a great deal of European influence on [[Persian culture]], especially in the arts of the royalty and noble classes. Though some modelling is used, heavy application of paint and large areas of flat, dark, rich, [[color saturation|saturated]] colours predominate.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 119–124; Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 154-161; Scarce&lt;/ref&gt;

While the depiction of inanimate objects and [[still life]]s is seen to be very realistic in Qajar painting, the depiction of human beings is decidedly [[idealism|idealised]]. This is especially evident in the portrayal of Qajar royalty, where the subjects of the paintings are very formulaically placed with standardised features. However, the impact of photography greatly increased the individuality of portraits in the later 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kamal-ol-molk]] (1845–1940) came from a family of court painters, but also trained with a painter who had studied in Europe. After a career at court, he visited  Europe in 1898, at the age of 47, staying for some four years. He was one of the artists who introduced a more European style to Persian painting.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ashraf with Layla Diba, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kamal-al-molk-mohammad-gaffari "Kamal-al-molk, Mohammad Gaffari], 2010–12, ''Encyclopædia Iranica''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Royal portraiture====
Most famous of the Qajar artworks are the portraits that were made of the various Persian [[Shahs]]. Each ruler, and many of their sons and other relatives, commissioned official portraits of themselves either for private use or public display. The most famous of these are the myriad portraits which were painted of [[Fath Ali Shah Qajar]], who, with his narrow waist, long black bifurcated beard and deepset eyes, has come to exemplify the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] image of the great Oriental Ruler. Many of these paintings were by the artist [[Mihr 'Ali]]. While the portraits were executed at various points throughout the life of the [[Fath Ali Shah|Shah]], they adhere to a [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] in which the distinctive features of the ruler are emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Scarce; Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 154&lt;/ref&gt;

There are portraits of Fath Ali Shah in a very wide assortment of settings, from the armor-clad warrior king to the flower smelling gentleman, but all are similar in their depiction of the Shah, differing only slightly, usually due to the specific artist of the portrait. It is only appropriate that this particular Shah be so immortalized in this style, as it was under his rule as the second Qajar shah that the style truly flourished. One reason for this were the stronger and stronger [[diplomacy|diplomatic ties]] that the Qajar rulers were nurturing with European powers.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 119–124; Scarce; Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 154&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12902">'''Post Occupancy Evaluation''' (POE) has its origins in [[Scotland]] and the [[United States]] and has been used in one form or another since the 1960s. Preiser and colleagues define POE as: &lt;blockquote&gt;the process of evaluating buildings in a systematic and rigorous manner after they have been built and occupied for some time" &lt;/blockquote&gt;The unique aspect of Post Occupancy Evaluation is that it generates recommendations based on all stakeholder groups' experiences of subject buildings' affects on productivity and wellbeing. &lt;ref&gt;Preiser, W. F., White, E., &amp; Rabinowitz, H. (2015). ''Post-Occupancy Evaluation (Routledge Revivals)''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes of POE==
Post Occupancy Evaluations is used to improve the ways that buildings are used to support productivity and wellbeing.

Specifically it is used to:
* Account for building quality
* Inform planning and briefing (programming) for new buildings and alterations
* Troubleshoot building/use problems (such as change management and new work styles)

The [[British Council for Offices]] (BCO)&lt;ref&gt;Oseland N A (2007) ''British Council for Offices Guide to Post-Occupancy Evaluation''. London: BCO.&lt;/ref&gt; summarises that a POE provides [[feedback]] of how successful the workplace is in supporting the occupying organization and the requirements of individual end-users. The BCO also suggests that POE can be used to assess if a project brief has been met. Furthermore, the BCO recommends that POE is used as part of the [[Evidence-based design]] process, where the project usually refers to a [[building design]] fit-out or refurbishment, or to inform the project brief where the project is the introduction of a new initiative, system or process. POE usually involves feedback from the building occupants, through questionnaires, interviews and workshops, but may also involve more objective measures such as environmental monitoring, space measurement and cost analysis.

==Building interest groups==
Post Occupancy Evaluations involve all stakeholder groups with interests in the subject buildings. Stakeholders are typically:
* [[Employees]] - working in the buildings
* [[Customer|Clients]], customers, students, prisoners, guests and patients - receiving services in the buildings
* [[Executive sponsor|Project sponsors]], [[Architect|architects]], engineers, builders - who produced the building
* Maintenance managers, tradespeople and cleaners - who maintain the building
* Future generations (represented by architects) - who will live in the environmental polluted by the buildings' construction and operation

==Components of POE==
The POE process provides value-neutral prompts to stimulate stakeholders to make testable observations about their experiences of buildings' effect on productivity and wellbeing. These observations are clarified and documented by the evaluator. Stakeholders' testable observations will be specific to building design, use and operating conditions and these may involve "negotiation" of all three dimensions of building evaluation to realize the optimum ways of achieving productivity and wellbeing.

Recommendations are based on complete set of stakeholders' observations. Most recommendations are to inform planning and design of future new buildings the operational practices. They also generate some recommendations for modifications to the subject buildings and for changes in the ways that they are used. POE evaluators may recommend monitoring, research, investigation or project management studies.

Some POE include other building studies. POE incorporate may include [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] techniques. Most POEs will involve seeking feedback from the occupants of the place being evaluated; this may be achieved through various [[survey methodology]] including [[questionnaire]], [[interview]] or [[focus group]]. The occupant feedback may be supplemented by [[environmental monitoring]], such as temperature, noise levels, lighting levels and indoor air quality. More recently, POEs tend to include sustainable measures such as energy consumption, waste levels, and water usage. Other commonly used quantitative measures include space metrics, for example occupational density, space utilization and tenant efficiency ratio. Cost, either expressed as the cost of the project per square meter or the total cost of occupancy, is considered a key metric in building evaluation and may be compared with the occupant feedback to provide a better understanding of value.

==Certification scheme==
Both [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] and [https://www.wellcertified.com/enWELL WELL] consider occupant surveys as part of their certification scheme. 

=== LEED v4 ===
[[Building science|IEQ]] survey, as a part of POE, is involved in [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification scheme v4. For all LEED [[Maintenance (technical)|O+M]] projects using LEED v4, one point (EQ Credit: Occupant Comfort Survey) can be awarded to those who intents to assess building occupants' comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20EBOM_01.5.18_current.pdf|title=LEED v4 for BUILDING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. Green Building Council|year=2018|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WELL v2 ===
WELL involves the occupant survey in both preconditions&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.2/en/community/feature/3|title=Occupant Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=International WELL Building Institute|archive-url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.2/en/community/feature/3|archive-date=2018-11-17|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and optimization&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.2/en/community/feature/4|title=Enhanced Occupant Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=International WELL Building Institute|archive-url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.2/en/community/feature/4|archive-date=2018-11-17|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; features in the concept of community. Besides, it has a particular feature related to occupant survey on [[thermal comfort]] concept&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.1/en/thermal%20comfort/feature/2|title=Enhanced Thermal Performance|last=|first=|date=|website=International WELL Building Institute|archive-url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.1/en/thermal%20comfort/feature/2|archive-date=2018-11-17|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Occupant Survey ====
Occupant Survey (Feature C03) is one of the precondition features of the community concept, which means it is mandatory for certification. This feature intends to establish minimum standards for the evaluation of experience and self-reported health and well-being of building occupants. The requirements of this feature are the following two parts&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;:

* Part 1: Select project survey. This can be either a third-party survey, or a custom survey;
* Part 2: Administer survey and report results.

==== Enhanced Occupant Survey ====
Enhanced Occupant Survey (Feature C04) is an optimization feature of community concept, which helps to achieve WELL certification. The purpose of this feature is to evaluate comfort, satisfaction, behavior change, self-reported health and other robust factors related to the well-being of occupants in buildings. A project can have up to 3 points  it meets below requirements&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;:

* Part 1: Select enhanced survey. This survey can be one of the pre-approved surveys in Feature C03 Part 1 with either additional one to three modules specific to WELL or additional  three to six project related topics (1 point);
* Part 2: Administer pre-occupancy survey and report results (1 point);
* Part 3: Monitor survey responses (1 point);
* Part 4: Facilitate interviews and focus groups (1 point).

==== Enhanced Thermal Performance ====
Enhanced Thermal Performance (Feature T02) is one of the optimization features of thermal comfort concept. This feature aims to enhance thermal comfort and promote human productivity by ensuring that a substantial majority of building users (above 80%) perceive their environment as thermally acceptable. The maximum points are three, and there are achieved by following parts&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;:

* Part 1:  Enhanced thermal environment. This is achieved by meeting specific standards (1 point);
* Part 2: Achieve thermal comfort. A post-occupancy survey should be administered at least twice a year to check whether regular occupants are satisfied with the thermal performance or not.

==POE at any stage after building occupancy==
The term "post occupancy" can be confusing and simply refers to an occupied building rather than a vacant one. Furthermore, POEs may be conducted at regular intervals to monitor how the building facilities and its operation are currently supporting the occupants. A pre-project POE may be used to:

* Document ways in which stakeholders experience buildings
* To inform the briefing and [[design process]] for proposed buildings and building alterations
* To negotiate and resolve new building features and qualities, which compromise productivity and well being
* Measure a dimension of project success
* [[feedback]] and feed-forward
* Set a baseline for measurement
* Establish [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] data
* Input to the [[change management]] programme and to align change management and design
* Highlight where future investments may be best placed, and best avoided

A POE is often carried out six to twelve months after construction work is complete and buildings are occupied. Post Occupancy Evaluations are also undertaken at any time buildings' "lives"; particularly to understand stakeholders' experience of them, for briefing alterations and changes.

==Any built environment accommodating people==
POE's have been conducted of facilities for schools, universities, technical institutes, kindergartens, museums, offices, courts, corrections, military, hospitals, landscape/civil works, learning environments,&lt;ref&gt;Barlex M J (2006) ''Guide to Post Occupancy Evaluation''. London: HEFCE/AUDE.&lt;/ref&gt; libraries,&lt;ref&gt;Lackney J A and Zajfen P (2005) Post-occupancy evaluation of public libraries: Lessons learned from three case studies. ''Library Administration and Management, 19(1)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enright S (2002) Post-occupancy evaluation of UK library building projects. ''Liber Quarterly, 12,'' pp 26-45.&lt;/ref&gt; jails,&lt;ref&gt;Wener R E (1994) ''Post Occupancy Evaluation Procedure: Instruments &amp; Instructions for Use''. Orange County Corrections Division and National Institute of Correction Jail Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; police stations,&lt;ref&gt;Home Office (2009) ''Design Policy, Post Occupancy Evaluation: North Kent Police''. London: Home Office.&lt;/ref&gt; housing,&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, F and Leaman A 2010) Housing occupancy feedback: Linking performance with behaviour. ''Building Research and Information, 38 (5).''&lt;/ref&gt; health centres&lt;ref&gt;Carthey J (2006) Post occupancy evaluation: Development of a standardised methodology for Australian health projects. ''The International Journal of Construction Management'', pp 57-75.&lt;/ref&gt; and zoos.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson M et al (2003) Post-occupancy evaluation of zoo Atlanta's Giant Panda Conservation Center. ''Zoo Biology, 22 (4) pp 365-363.''&lt;/ref&gt; It would be equally possible to apply POE techniques to ships and "virtual" environments. POE has been applied to selected parts of buildings, aspects of buildings and groups of buildings on the same campus and several sites.

==Independent evaluation==
POE is usually carried out by architects or building professionals with a [[social science]] or [[workplace consulting]] background. POE by independent [[consultant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can offer an impartial evaluation.

==Other building studies==
POE can be informed by reference to other building studies and POEs sometimes recommend other studies such as:
* [[Energy audit]]
* [[Survey (human research)]]
* [https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_74.htm Post Implementation Review]
* Proprietary building rating schemes
* Noise measurements
* [[Indoor air quality|Indoor Air Quality]] measurements
* [[Benefits realisation management]]
* Building (maintenance) inspection
* [[Life-cycle assessment]]
* [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]]
* Environmental rating schemes ([[BREEAM]], [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]], [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]])

==Relevant Organisations==
POE has been developed and discussed within these organisations:
* [[International Association of People-Environment Studies|International Association for People-Environment Studies]]
* [http://www.edra.org/ Environment Design Research Association]
*[[Center for the Built Environment]]

[[File:Liveaudioequip.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A portable setup of various live audio production and recording equipment]]

'''Professional audio''', abbreviated as '''pro audio''', refers to both an activity and a category of high quality, studio-grade audio equipment. Typically it encompasses [[sound recording]], [[sound reinforcement system]] setup and [[audio mixing]], and [[music producer|studio music production]] by trained [[sound engineer]]s, [[audio engineer]]s, [[record producer]]s, and audio technicians who work in [[live event support]] and recording using [[audio mixer]]s, recording equipment and sound reinforcement systems. In contrast, [[consumer electronics|consumer audio]] equipment is a lower grade of gear which is used by regular people for the reproduction of sound in a private home on a [[home stereo]] or [[home cinema]] system.

Professional audio can include, but is not limited to [[broadcast radio]], [[audio mastering]] in a [[recording studio]], [[television studio]], and [[sound reinforcement]] such as a live concert, [[DJ]] performances, [[Sampling (music)|audio sampling]], [[public address]] system set up, [[surround sound]] design in [[movie theatre]]s, and design and setup of [[piped music]] in hotels and restaurants. Professional audio equipment is sold at [[professional audio store]]s and [[music store]]s. While [[consumer electronics]] stores sell some of the same categories of equipment (e.g., [[power amplifier]]s and [[subwoofer]] cabinets), the equipment that consumer stores sells is a lower consumer-grade type of equipment, which does not meet the standards for low noise and low [[distortion (music)|distortion]] that are required in pro audio applications.

==Definition==
The term ''professional audio'' has no precise definition, but it typically includes:
* Operations carried out by trained [[audio engineers]]
* The capturing of sound with one or more [[microphone]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Alten | first=S.R. | title=Audio in Media | publisher=Cengage Learning | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-285-67529-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lesWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Balancing, mixing and adjusting sound signals from [[multitrack recording]] devices using a [[mixing console]]
* The control of audio levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Reinhardt | first=R. | last2=Dowd | first2=S. | title=Adobe Flash CS3 Professional Bible | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | series=Bible | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-470-11937-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQs0sJ0NLDsC&amp;pg=PA1165 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt; using standardised types of metering
* Sound signals passing through lengthy [[airchain|signal chain]]s involving processes at different times and places, involving a variety of skills
* Compliance with organisational, national and international practices and standards established by such bodies as the [[International Telecommunication Union]], [[Audio Engineering Society]] and [[European Broadcasting Union]]
* Setting up or designing sound reinforcement systems or recording studios.
==Equipment==
Compared to consumer-grade audio equipment, professional audio equipment tends to have such characteristics as:
* Greater mechanical robustness and reliability
* Many more options for "tweakability" and modification than typical consumer grade equipment. For example, whereas a typical home audio grade active subwoofer may have a factory set-[[audio crossover]] to determine at which point the audio signal will be routed to the subwoofer and a factory preset phase control and equalizer setting, pro audio active subwoofers (with built-in amplifiers and electronics) may offer adjustable crossover points, user-selectable phase control and equalizer controls{{efn|Some expensive, high-end [[hi-fi]] active subwoofers also offer "tweakability" and user controls, but the low-priced active subs sold at [[Big box]] [[consumer electronics]] stores do not usually include these features.}}
* Heavy-duty industrial-grade connectors, e.g. [[XLR connector|XLR]] balanced audio cables (for audio signals) rather than unbalanced cables and [[Speakon]] speaker connectors, rather than 1/4" speaker jacks
* Designed for touring and transportation. This includes the use of [[19-inch rack]]-mount devices for electronic [[effects unit]]s and [[power amplifier]]s, the provision of handles and/or dolly wheels on heavy equipment to facilitate moving gear onstage (large [[speaker enclosure]] cabinets for [[subwoofer]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]] main speakers typically have handles and wheels)
* [[Balanced audio]] interfaces (XLR) for lower noise and hum
* Higher [[analog audio]] signal levels of 0 [[decibel|dBu]] or more&lt;ref name="“books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=professional+audio+equipment+characteristics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1iWT0zIa5p&amp;sig=FLVzefRE9IQZi2or8bZnWP42rwg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OnE6VfGIGYmoNon_gcAG&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=professional%20audio%20equipment%20characteristics&amp;f=false/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AES3|AES/EBU]] [[digital audio]] interfaces
* Lower-noise audio equipment with less [[Total Harmonic Distortion]]

The [[broadcast quality]] of professional audio equipment is on a par with that of consumer [[high-end audio]] and [[hi-fi]] equipment, but is more likely to be designed purely on sound engineering principles and owes little to the consumer-oriented [[audiophile]] sub-culture.&lt;ref name=perlman1&gt;{{Cite journal

==Stores==
{{Main article|Professional audio store}}
A professional audio store is a retail establishment that sells, and in many cases rents, expensive, high-end [[sound recording]] equipment ([[microphone]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gardner | first=S. | last2=Birley | first2=S. | title=Blogging For Dummies | publisher=Wiley | series=For dummies | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-118-23925-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iM5-y-XlCQcC&amp;pg=PA229 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[audio mixer]]s, [[digital audio recorder]]s, speakers and surround sound speakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hanes | first=W. | title=The 30-30 Career: Making 30 Grand in 30 Seconds!: Becoming a Platinum Composer | publisher=AuthorHouse | issue=v. 2 | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4520-5097-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNhmVCpyibAC&amp;pg=PA67 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Studio monitor|monitor speakers]]) and [[sound reinforcement system]] gear (e.g., [[speaker enclosure]] cabinets, [[Foldback (sound engineering)|stage monitor speakers]], [[power amplifier]]s, [[subwoofer]] cabinets) and accessories used in both settings, such as [[microphone stand]]s. Some pro audio stores also sell video equipment, such as [[video projector]]s, as this equipment is commonly used in live audio settings (e.g., business presentations and conventions). Some pro audio stores also sell and/or rent [[DJ]] gear ([[record turntable]]s, [[DJ mixer]]s) and the [[stage lighting]] equipment used in rock concerts, [[dance club]]s, [[rave]]s and [[theater]]/[[musical theater]] shows.

[[Image:Ubud Cremation 1.jpg|thumb|An [[Ubud]] cremation ceremony in 2005]]
A '''pyre''' ({{lang-grc|πυρά}}; ''pyrá'', from {{lang|grc|πῦρ}}, ''pyr'', "fire"),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pura/2|πυρά}}, {{LSJ|pu{{=}}r|πῦρ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pyre}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''funeral pyre''', is a structure, usually made of wood, for burning a body as part of a funeral rite or execution. As a form of [[cremation]], a body is placed upon or under the pyre, which is then set on fire.

In discussing [[ancient Greek religion]], "pyre" (the normal Greek word for fire anglicized) is also used for the sacred fires at altars, on which parts of the [[animal sacrifice]] were burnt as an offering to the deity.

== Materials ==
Pyres are crafted using wood.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; The composition of a pyre may be determined through use of charcoal analysis. [[Charcoal]] analysis helps to predict composition of the fuel and local forestry of the charcoal being studied.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=Lorna|year=2016|title=The power of the pyre - A holistic study of cremation focusing on charcoal remains|url=|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=65|pages=161–171|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2015.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===

Specifically in the [[Bronze Age]], pyre materials were gathered based on local abundance and ease of access to the wood although materials were also selected due to the specific properties, potential traditional purpose, or due to economical reasons. In Templenoe, pyres typically consisted of oak and fruit wood compositions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Poland ===

From analyzing three [[necropolis]]es, in Kokotów, Pawłowice and Korytnica, it seems that [[Poland|Polish]]{{when?|date=December 2017}} pyres consisted of primarily Scots pine, birch, and oak trees, as pines, birch, and oak were dense in local woodlands.  All parts of the tree were used including the trunk, branches, twigs, and even pine cones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moskal-del Hoyo|first=Magdalena|year=2012|title=The use of wood in funerary pyres: random gathering or special selection of species? Case study of three necropolises from Poland|url=|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=39.11|pages=3386–3395|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2012.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During WWII, pyres were used in German death camps on Polish territory, such as [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/ForgottenCamps/Camps/TreblinkaEng.html|title=Treblinka Extermination Camp (Poland)|website=www.jewishgen.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pyre remains in Britain ===
Worked antler and bone objects, along with [[flint]] and [[flake tool]]s, and copper-alloys are most commonly found in pyre cremation remains. The [[List of copper alloys|copper-alloys]] leave a blue-green stain and are typically fused to the ribs, arms, and other areas where jewelry is commonly worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mckinley|first=Jacqueline|year=1994|title=A pyre and grave goods in British cremation burials; have we missed something?|url=|journal=Antiquity|volume=68.258|pages=132–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Analysis of bone fragment size ====
A study was done on the bone fragments of cremations to show that not only will movement of the bone fragments cause breakage but also environmental factors play a part. After studying cremation remains in [[urn]]s that had been tightly sealed and had no evidence of environmental disturbance it was found that on average bigger bone fragment sizes were observed meaning less bone breakage had occurred. It was concluded that if cremated bone is placed in an urn before burial the original bone fragment size will be preserved. This study was intended to explain that more cautionary measures should be taken during and after any cremation occurs and to educate those who are studying cremated bone that the size of the fragments will be smaller than there were right after cremation.&lt;ref name="Bone Fragment Size"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mckinley|first1=Jacqueline I.|title=Bone Fragment Size in British Cremation Burials and its Implications for Pyre Technology and Ritual|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1994|volume=21|issue=3|pages=339–342|doi=10.1006/jasc.1994.1033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Chan Kusalo cremation 04.jpg|thumb|The funeral pyre of Chan Kusalo (the Buddhist high monk of Northern Thailand) at [[Wat Chedi Luang]], Chiang Mai, Thailand]]
Traditionally, pyres are used for the cremation of the dead in the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religions, a practice which dates back several thousands of years.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1072759.ece|title='Illegal' funeral pyre burnt in secret|last=Norfolk|first=Andrew|date=13 July 2006|work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funeral pyres were also used in [[Viking]] and [[ancient Romans|Roman]] culture.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1820024,00.html|title=The question: Why are funeral pyres illegal?|last=Fernando|first=Shehani|date=14 July 2006|work=The Guardian |location=London|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular===
Pyres and bonfires are used in celebrations and remembrance in services. Examples of these are [[Guy Fawkes Night]] in the United Kingdom and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, where the 'Guy', either seen as an effigy of [[Guy Fawkes]] or the Pope, is burned.

Funeral pyres were used by the Nazis to cremate the bodies of 1,500,000+ prisoners in [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] extermination camps, as opposed to the [[cremation|crematoria]] used in other camps. Pyres have also been used to dispose of large quantities of livestock in agriculture, particularly those infected with disease.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

Pyres are lit around the clock in [[Varanasi]], [[India]] as it is considered one of the oldest standing cities. Hindu's believe that by resting the ashes of the dead in the [[Ganges|Ganges river]] in at Varanasi, the dead will achieve [[Moksha]]. Hindus will travel great lengths in order to perform [[ritual]]istic duties such as praying, attending to their dead, or to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2014/08/07/the-pyres-of-varanasi-breaking-the-cycle-of-death-and-rebirth/|title=The Pyres of Varanasi: Breaking the Cycle of Death and Rebirth|last=McBride|first=Pete|date=2014-08-07|website=Proof|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sati practice in India ===
In the early 19th century, some [[Hinduism|Hindu]] groups practiced [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] (also known as suttee). [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] is the act of immolation of the widow to honor devotion to the recently deceased husband. This involves being burned alive on the pyre or even being buried alive.&lt;ref name="Hawley1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Stratton Hawley|title=Sati, the Blessing and the Curse: The Burning of Wives in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_VbHItKQjYC|date=8 September 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536022-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impacts of pyres==
===Environmental impact in Southern Asia===

[[Image:Buddhist_monks_procession_in_front_of_a_pyre.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monks procession in front of a pyre in [[Laos]]]]
Chakrabarty RK, et al.  examined the environmental effects of Southern Asia’s funeral pyres in their study, “Funeral pyres in South Asia: Brown carbon aerosol emissions and climate impacts. Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters.” The heating of the atmosphere from carbonaceous aerosols resulting from human activities is a significant contributor to climate change in South Asia. In this region, fossil fuel use and residential biofuels have been documented to be the primary emitter of light-absorbing black carbon aerosols. The study determined the emitted organic carbon contributed 40% to smoke absorption of visible [[solar radiation]], about 92 Gg annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chakrabarty|first=Rajan K.|last2=Pervez|first2=Shamsh|last3=Chow|first3=Judith C.|last4=Watson|first4=John G.|last5=Dewangan|first5=Shippi|last6=Robles|first6=Jerome|last7=Tian|first7=Guoxun|date=2014-01-14|title=Funeral Pyres in South Asia: Brown Carbon Aerosol Emissions and Climate Impacts|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ez4000669|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters|volume=1|issue=1|pages=44–48|doi=10.1021/ez4000669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study examined the carbonaceous fractions associated with indoor PM2.5/PM10 during Asian cultural and ritual burning practices. (Dewangan, et al.) This study concluded drastically higher levels of biomass burning markers within [[Burial|burial rituals]] performed indoors compared to levels collected for residential indoors and ambient outdoors, with levels reaching three-eightfold higher levels of [[carbonaceous]] aerosols. These high chemical levels were also found to correlate to higher aerosol fraction levels during winter months in both Muslim Holy Shrines and marriage places. The study concluded PM concentrations were significantly higher in indoor-ritual locations and suggested further studies and actions be taken to investigate risk and health assessment and calls for regulatory agencies to propose new guidelines for indoor cultural/ritual locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dewangan|first=Shippi|last2=Pervez|first2=Shamsh|last3=Chakrabarty|first3=Rajan|last4=Watson|first4=John G.|last5=Chow|first5=Judith C.|last6=Pervez|first6=Yasmeen|last7=Tiwari|first7=Suresh|last8=Rai|first8=Joyce|date=2016-09-01|title=Study of carbonaceous fractions associated with indoor PM2.5/PM10 during Asian cultural and ritual burning practices|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013231630213X|journal=Building and Environment|volume=106|pages=229–236|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impacts in India===

A traditional Hindu funeral pyre takes six hours and burns 500–600 kilogrammes (1,102–1,323 pounds) of wood to burn a body completely.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/12/world/asia/india-funeral-pyres-emissions|title=India's burning issue with emissions from Hindu funeral pyres|last=Kermeliotis|first=Teo|date=17 September 2011|work=CNN|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year fifty to sixty million trees are burned during cremations in India, which results in about eight million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] or [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;  [[Air pollution]], [[deforestation]] and large quantities of [[wood ash|ash]], which are later [[water pollution|thrown into rivers]], adding to the [[toxicity]] of their waters, pose great environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/773085fbd7fb48369f90e439b14c8296/india-court-orders-shift-crematorium-protect-taj-mahal | title=India court orders action on crematorium near Taj Mahal | author=Nirmala George | date=17 November 2015 | access-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Revolution Foundation under the parent organisation of Sarthak Charitable Trust, a Delhi-based [NGO] working to reduce the environmental impact of funeral pyres, claims to have created an alternative of wood that reduces cutting of trees. It helps in saving environment. Also it promotes Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. As a result, the cost is reduced significantly and [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] are cut by up to 60%.&lt;ref name="Sarthak"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sharma |first1=Anita |title=Sarthak charitable trust..

==Legality of open-air pyres==
In ancient times burning bodies was a practiced form of burial.

== Roman pyres ==
In the time leading up to second century C.E., popular funeral practices in Rome consisted of cremation with a pyre.  Ideal funeral practices meant burning an ornamental pyre for the deceased, that would burn with enough heat and a long enough time to only leave ashes and small bone fragments.  Having to use another's pyre was a sign of poverty or emergency cases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noy|first=David|year=2000|title=‘Half-burnt on an Emergency Pyre ‘: Roman Cremations which Went Wrong.|url=|journal=Greece and Rome (Second Series)|volume=|pages=186–196|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of constructing and properly burning a funeral pyre is a skilled task.  Often, pyres would not burn with enough heat to properly cremate human remains.  Pyres had to be maintained by stoking the flame and raking the pyre to allow good oxygen flow.  Ancient literature refers to the skilled job of an ustor, meaning a professional pyre builder derived from the Latin word uro which means, to burn.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, regardless of professional build, pyres were unpredictable and would go wrong on a regular basis.  [[Pliny the Elder|The Elder Pliny]] writes of extreme cases in which bodies have been thrown from the pyre from the force of the flames. Other cases, described by [[Plutarch]], involving deceased victims of poisoning, resulted in the human body bursting open and dousing the pyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plutarch, Tiberius Gracchus|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.+TG+13&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0065|}}. Retrieved 28 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forensic evaluation of pyres ==
A study conducted by Alunni, et al. examined the forensic science behind cremations on wooden pyres. The study concluded the average pyre does not completely destroy a human body effectively, and differences in suicide via pyres are evident in the remains. A pyre suicide shows signs of remains being more charred rather than completely oxidized by high temperatures, are in anatomically correct positions, poor bone fragmentation, and is without suspicious burn patterns compared to an individual murdered via pyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alunni|first=Veronique|last2=Grevin|first2=Gilles|last3=Buchet|first3=Luc|last4=Quatrehomme|first4=Gérald|date=2014-08-01|title=Forensic aspect of cremations on wooden pyre|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073814002345|journal=Forensic Science International|volume=241|pages=167–172|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.05.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cremation|Cremated]] remains are different from traditional human remains in the sense that their physical appearance including bone vary in color, fragmentation, and differ from their original shape and dimension. This is why [[Forensic science|forensic]] experimental studies are necessary to fully understand the differences the body undergoes in a pyre. Coloring of bones before cremation is dependent on oxygen exposure, duration, and temperature. The bone color can range from black to brown or an oxidized white color. The type of bone and method of cooling may also alter the bone form. Cooling is also an important consideration, as if the remains are cooled via water increases warping. This knowledge is a consideration for [[archaeologists]] to understand the remains from pyres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bonesdontlie.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/experiments-for-understanding-cremated-remains/|title=Using Experiments and Forensics to Understand Cremated Remains|date=2011-11-01|work=Bones Don't Lie|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2824">The '''RIAI Travelling Scholarship''' is an award made annually by the [[Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland]] to one or more students of architecture attending a school of architecture in the [[Republic of Ireland]] or [[Northern Ireland]].

The award has been made annually since 1935 and has former the basis for the careers of many notable Irish architects, among them [[Arthur Gibney]], [[Sam Stephenson]] and [[Trevor Leaker]].

Over the course of its history, the scholarship has been competed for in numerous ways. Current practice is for the RIAI to set a competition brief, which is then the subject of the design of a building or landscape by the competitors. An appointed jury of distinguished and learned architects and pedagogues then selects the winning entry.

[[File:Nihâl Chand 001.jpg|thumb|220px|An 18th-century Rajput painting by the artist [[Nihâl Chand]].]]
[[File:Godhuli, Mewar, ca1813.jpg|thumb|''Godhuli'', [[Mewar]], ca. 1813]]
'''Rajput painting''', also called  '''Rajasthani painting''', evolved and flourished in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]] in [[India]].  Each Rajputana kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana. [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|Miniatures]] in manuscripts or single sheets to be kept in albums were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but many paintings were done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelis, particularly, the havelis of [[Shekhawati]], the forts and palaces built by [[Shekhawat]] Rajputs.

The colours were extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones.  Gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colours was a lengthy process, sometimes taking 2 weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

== Content ==
While there exist a plethora of themes in Rajput paintings, a common motif found throughout Rajput works is the purposeful manipulation of space. In particular, the inclusion of fuller spaces is meant to emphasize the lack of boundaries and inseparability of characters and landscapes. In this way, the individuality of physical characters is almost rejected, allowing both the depicted backgrounds and human figures to be equally expressive.

Outside of a purely artistic standpoint, Rajput paintings were often politically charged and commented on social values of the time. Mewar's rulers wanted these painting to portray their ambitions and establish their legacy. Therefore, paintings were often indicative of a ruler's legacy or their changes made to better society.

Both of these factors clearly distinguish Rajput paintings from Mughal works. While, from a chronological standpoint, both of these cultures clashed with one another, Rajput paintings only superficially adopted Mughal fashion and cultural standards. Elements, such as distinct portraiture, utilized by popular Mughal artists ([[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]], Hashim, etc.) are not found in Rajput works. Likewise, Rajput techniques are not predominantly seen in [[Mughal painting]]s. &lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;small&gt;"At the opening of the eighteenth century, therefore, Rajput painting remains recognizably different in intent from traditional Mughal attitudes" (Beach 175).&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 16th Century, Rajput art schools began to develop distinctive styles, combining indigenous as well as foreign influences such as Persian, Mughal, Chinese and European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neeraj|first=Jai Singh|title=Splendour Of Rajasthani Painting|year=1991|publisher=Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|pages=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGjTjmL29VIC&amp;pg=PP15&amp;lpg=PP15&amp;dq=shekhawati+painting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-1KPo1-Rmd&amp;sig=uBKBi0BtGlqniNoZhs8NxBjGbbs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=djcvUK6POdHRrQfRxIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=shekhawati%20painting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajasthani painting consists of four principal schools that have within them several artistic styles and substyles that can be traced to the various princely states that patronised these artists. The four principal schools are:
# The [[Mewar]] school that contains the [[Chavand, Rajasthan|Chavand]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Devgarh, Rajasthan|Devgarh]], [[Udaipur]] and [[Sawar]] styles of painting
# The [[Marwar]] school comprising the [[Kishangarh]], [[Bikaner]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Nagaur]], [[Pali]] and [[Ghanerao]] styles
# The [[Hadoti]] school with the [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]], [[Bundi]] and [[Jhalawar State|Jhalawar]] styles and
# The Dhundar school of [[Amber]], [[Jaipur]], [[Shekhawati painting|Shekhawati]] and [[Uniara]] styles of painting.

The [[Kangra painting|Kangra]] and [[Kullu]] schools of art are also part of Rajput painting. [[Nainsukh]] is a famous artist of [[Pahari painting]], working for Rajput princes who then ruled that far north.

Economic prosperity of commercial community and revival of “Vaisnavism” and the growth of Bhakti Cult were the major factors that contributed greatly to the development of Rajasthani paintings. In the beginning this style was greatly influenced by religious followers like Ramanuja, Meerabai, Tulsidas, Sri Chaitanya, Kabir and Ramanand.

All of Rajputana was affected by the attack of the Mughals but Mewar did not come under their control till the last. This was the reason that Rajasthani school flourished first in Mewar, (the purest form and later on in), Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bundi, Kota- Kalam, Kishangarh, Bikaner and other places of Rajasthan.

{{Sound change}}
'''Sandhi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʌ|n|d|i|,_|ˈ|s|æ|n|-|,_|ˈ|s|ɑː|n|-}}; {{lang-sa|[[wikt:संधि#Sanskrit|संधि]]}} ''{{IAST|saṃdhí}}'' {{IPA-sa|sən̪d̪ʱi|}}, "joining") is a cover term for a wide variety of [[phonology|sound]] changes that occur at [[morpheme]] or word boundaries. Examples include fusion of sounds across word boundaries and the alteration of one sound depending on nearby sounds or the grammatical function of the adjacent words. Sandhi belongs to [[morphophonology]].

Sandhi occurs in many languages, including particularly prominently in the phonology of [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] (especially [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Hindi]], [[Pali]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]), as well as in some [[North Germanic languages]].

==Types==

=== Internal and external sandhi ===
Sandhi can be either
* '''internal''', at [[morpheme]] boundaries within words, such as ''syn- + pathy'': ''sympathy'', or
* '''external''', at word boundaries, such as the pronunciation "''tem books''" for ''ten books'' in some dialects of [[English language|English]]. The [[Linking and intrusive R|linking {{IPA|/r/}}]] process of some dialects of English ("''I saw-r-a film''" in [[British English]]) is a kind of external sandhi, as are [[French language|French]] ''[[liaison (French)|liaison]]'' (pronunciation of usually silent final consonants of words before words beginning with vowels) and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''[[syntactic gemination|raddoppiamento fonosintattico]]'' (lengthening of initial consonants of words after certain words ending in vowels).
It may be extremely common in speech, but sandhi (especially external) is typically ignored in spelling, as is the case in English, except for the distinction between ''a'' and ''an''. Sandhi is, however, reflected in the orthography of [[Sanskrit]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Pali]] and some other Indian languages, as with in Italian in the case of compound words with lexicalised syntactic gemination.

In [[Japanese phonology]], sandhi is primarily exhibited in [[rendaku]] ([[consonant mutation]] from unvoiced to voiced when not word-initial, in some contexts) and conversion of {{lang|ja|つ}} or {{lang|ja|く}} (''tsu'', ''ku'') to a [[geminate consonant]] (orthographically, the [[sokuon]] {{lang|ja|っ}}), both of which are reflected in spelling – indeed, {{lang|ja|っ}} symbol for gemination is morphosyntactically derived from {{lang|ja|つ}}, and voicing is indicated by adding two dots as in {{lang|ja|か／が}} ''ka'', ''ga'', making the relation clear. It also occurs much less often in {{Nihongo|''[[renjō]]''|連声}}, where, most commonly, a terminal {{IPA|/n/}} on one morpheme results in an {{IPA|/n/}} (or {{IPA|/m/}}) being added to the start of the next morpheme, as in {{lang|ja|天皇: てん ＋ おう → てんのう}} (''ten'' + ''ō'' = ''tennō''); that is also shown in the spelling (the kanji do not change, but the kana, which specify pronunciation, change).

External sandhi effects can sometimes become morphologised (apply only in certain [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[syntax|syntactic]] environments) like in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Harold F.|last=Schiffman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oqe-QsaZnnQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=sandhi&amp;f=false|title=A Reference Grammar of Spoken Tamil|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1999|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gemination of stops in Tamil: implications for the phonology-syntax interface |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychlangsci/research/linguistics/publications/wpl/95papers/NAGARAJA |author=Hemalatha Nagarajan |format=PDF |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, over time, turn into [[consonant mutation]]s.

=== Tone sandhi ===
Most [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]]s have '''[[tone sandhi]]''' in which the tones of words alter according to certain rules. An example is the behavior of [[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|tone 3]] in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. When in isolation, tone 3 is often pronounced as a falling-rising tone. When a tone 3 occurs before another tone 3, however, it changes into tone 2 (a rising tone), and when it occurs before any of the other tones, it is pronounced as a low falling tone, with no rise at the end. A simple example occurs in the common greeting {{lang|zh|你好}} ''nǐ hǎo'' (with two words containing underlying tone 3), normally pronounced ''ní hǎo''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1669">[[Gian Francesco Malipiero]]'s '''Terza Sinfonia, ''delle Campane''''' is the third of his eleven numbered [[symphony|symphonies]] and it was completed in February 1945, two months before the end of the [[Second World War]] in Italy with the fall of the [[Italian Social Republic]]. It was premiered on November 4 in [[Florence]], with [[Igor Markevitch]] conducting.

The composition is inspired by the pealing of the [[St Mark's Campanile]]'s bells in [[Venice]], where Malipiero lived. The mournful finale reflects the night in September 1943 when the bells proclaimed the foundation of the Social Republic. In the composer's words, ''[the symphony] is connected to a terrible date, 18 September 1943. At dusk of that unforgettable day the bells of San Marco rang, but they couldn't deceive those who knew their true voice. They didn't ring for peace, but to announce new torments, more anguish''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flaminioonline.it/Guide/Malipiero-Sinfonia3.html Program notes] from a 1969 [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] concert, quoted in the Flaminio Virtual Orchestra's website&lt;/ref&gt; 

The symphony lasts c. 24 minutes, and it consists of four movements: 

#''Allegro moderato''
#''Andante molto moderato'' 
#''Vivace''
#''Lento''

This proposal, from a platform created in 2011, was shown to map the electoral results of the Catalan regional election of 21 December 2017, which provoked renewed interest. The word 'Tabarnia' went viral on 26 December 2017, reaching worldwide top-trending status with over 648,000 mentions. The first major demonstration organized by the Tabarnia movement took place in Barcelona on 4 March 2018, with 15,000 participants according to the Guarda Urbana and 200,000 according to organizers.&lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/ccaa/2018/03/04/catalunya/1520162880_273146.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of Tabarnia wish to distance themselves from the Catalan separatist movement and reclaim the right of a number of territories near the area of Barcelona and Tarragona to constitute themselves as an autonomous community within Spain. In the [[Catalan regional election, 2015|2015]] and [[Catalan regional election, 2017|2017]] Catalan regional elections, parties opposed to secession (mainly [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]], [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|PSC]] and [[People's Party of Catalonia|PP]]) received a [[Majority#Majority vote|majority]] of votes and seats in Tabarnia as a whole and in a small number of coastal ''comarques'' (Tarragonès, Baix Penedès and Baix Llobregat) including the city of Tarragona. They received a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in the comarca of [[Barcelonès]], yet not in the city of [[Barcelona]] itself. They allude to a series of fiscal arguments similar to those of Catalan separatism in regards to Spain. The term "Tabarnia" is a [[neologism]] based on the names of [[Province of Tarragona|Tarragona]] and [[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona]], the two Catalan provinces where support for separatism is lower,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The movement uses as a legal basis the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Clarity Act]], according to which regions opposed to [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebecois separatism]] are to remain within Canada in case of a secession, as well as Articles 143 and 144 of the [[Spanish constitution]], which allows the formation of autonomous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 4 March 2018 a protest mocking the Catalan independence bid was organized by the Tabarnia movement. 15 000 demonstrators according to the [[Guàrdia Urbana de Barcelona|urban guard]] and 200 000 according to the organizers gathered with Spanish, Tabarnian and Catalan flags and waived slogans for Tabarnia mimicking those of the Catalan independence movement. The protest started with a floral offering at the statue of [[Rafael Casanova]], Considered by the independentists a patriot of their cause, but that according to one of his descendants present at the protest was actually a Spanish patriot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Political claims ==
Tabarnians claim vote representation in Catalonia to be unfair across the four different provinces Lleida, Girona, Tarragona and Barcelona, resulting in unfair economic investment. Under the current electoral law, in the province of Barcelona 48,521 votes are needed to elect one representative in the Catalan Parlament for the 20,915 votes needed in Lleida, resulting in a 2.3 ratio. Tarragona requires 31,317 votes and Girona 30,048. Catalan separatists argue the current electoral law ensures political representation for areas with a lower population density while tabarnians argue the law has not been revised because historically Lleida and Girona have always had a majority of voters in favor of the separatist political parties that have kept them in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same way Catalan separatist have used an interpretation of economic data to argue they have an unfavourable finance balance towards the rest of Spain, Tabarnians argue Tarragona and Barcelona underrepresentation in the Catalan Parlament has resulted in unfavourable finance balance towards their region, also backed by similar interpretation of economic data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Tabarnia Movement is still in its early days and is too soon to know how their political claims will unfold. Some Tabarnians simply believe this movement to be a satirical response that mirrors separatist with their own logic. Some Tabarnians demand that, in case a hypothetycal referendum for Catalonia independence was held, the seven different veguerias ([[Vegueria]]) be decided separately, so "Tarragona" and "Àmbit metropolità" are not declared independent against their democratic will. Some Tabarnians have grown so tired of the Catalan separatist movement, that they seem committed to celebrating a referendum in October 2018 to split from Catalonia as a Spanish autonomous region whether the previous referendum takes place or not. Some Tabarnians want to be declared a new autonomous region, which they argue is legally plausible under the present [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

On 27 December 2017, following public enquiry by Spanish citizens, the [[Real Academia Española]] (Royal Academy of Spanish Language) informed through their Twitter account that the most appropriate demonym for Tabarnia would be "Tabarnés" among other possible options such as "tabarniense", "tabarniano", or "tabinososano".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By proposing the hypothetical separation of Tabarnia from Catalonia, the founders of the Tabarnia project want for the separatist politicians to realize that a large proportion of Catalans consider themselves Spanish and do no not want to leave Spain and that a declaration of independence could trigger similar movements within the territory, to the point of absurdity. According to Manuel Muñiz, the dean of the school of international relations at IE University in Madrid, it sparked a debate over "who is to vote and when" in a democracy and he questioned whether regions should be the ones entitled to decide on their independence or if cities would also qualify? Or should it be neighborhoods within cities?&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

According to Salvador Garcia Ruiz, the chief executive of [[Ara (newspaper)|''Ara'']], a Catalan pro-independence newspaper, Tabarnia is nothing more than a sour response to the results of the [[Catalan regional election, 2017]] in which the independentists did not lose their majority over the parliament. He labeled Tabarnia as [[Peter Pan]]'s "Neverland" for the unionists. Podemos' leader [[Pablo Iglesias Turrión|Pablo Iglesias]] was also critical with the movement because he claimed it was fueling an unhelpful "war of flags" but the spokesman for Tabarnia claims that the goal was never to break up Catalonia, but rather ending Catalan secessionism and all its disruptive consequences.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

'''''The Apotheosis of Homer''''' is a grand 1827 painting by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], now exhibited at the [[Louvre]] as INV 5417. The symmetrical composition depicts [[Homer]] being crowned by a winged figure personifying Victory or the Universe. Forty-four additional figures pay homage to the poet in a kind of classical confession of faith. 

==History==
A state commission to decorate a ceiling of the musée [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] at the Louvre (now the ancient Egyptian galleries), it formed part of a renovation project commissioned by Charles X to have himself remembered in the grand tradition of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] building works at the Louvre. A condition of the commission was that it was to be completed within a year's time.&lt;ref name="Condon_110"&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receiving the commission, Ingres conceived the idea for his painting quickly—it was a source of pride to him that he had required only an hour to establish the broad outlines of his composition.&lt;ref name="Condon_110"/&gt; The subsequent care he took in developing his idea is evident in more than 100 drawings and numerous painted sketches for it that survive, in which he can be seen making the composition and the details more and more precise. Ingres's level of research can be seen in the painting's portrait of [[Nicolas Poussin]], which is directly copied from Poussin's [[:File:Nicolas Poussin 078.jpg|1650 self-portrait]] now in the Louvre. 

The composition is a symmetrical grouping centred in a [[Neoclassicism|classical]] way in front of an [[ancient Greek]] temple. The painting's catalogue entry at the time of its first exhibition describes it as "Homer receiving homage from all the great men of [[ancient Greece|Greece]], [[ancient Rome|Rome]] and modern times. The Universe crowns him, [[Herodotus]] burns [[frankincense|incense]].&lt;ref&gt;Behind Homer, to the left, with his head covered to make a sacrifice, as was customary in classical religious practice, as with the [[Via Labicana Augustus]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iliad]] and [[Odyssey]] sit at his feet."
[[File:Study for Phidias in 'The Apotheosis of Homer' by Ingres, San Diego Museum of Art.JPG|thumb|Study for Phidias in ''The Apotheosis of Homer'', oil on canvas, 1827, [[San Diego Museum of Art]]]]

The final painting's colours are very fresh and clear, giving the impression of [[fresco]]. Ingres wished to compete with [[Raphael]] through this painting (it is strongly inspired by the Italian artist's ''[[The Parnassus|Parnassus]]'') and Raphael is to be seen top left (in black and white Renaissance dress), being led by [[Apelles]] (in a blue cloak). Other figures shown include [[Dante]] who is shown being led by [[Virgil]] as in the former's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (extreme left, behind Poussin) and [[Molière]] (right, by the feet of the personification of the ''Odyssey'').

The art historian [[Robert Rosenblum]] said ''The Apotheosis of Homer'' represents "Ingres' most doctrinaire statement of his belief in a hierarchy of timeless values that are based on classical precedent."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum 1990, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly successful in its genre, though leaves an impression of coldness, an impression which was reinforced at the time of its production by the exhibition of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s ''[[Death of Sardanapalus|The Death of Sardanapalus]]'' at the same year's [[Paris Salon]]. Ingres had been considered revolutionary early in his career, but this contrast now faced off a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] renewal under Delacroix against the purest classical tradition as shown by Ingres. ''The Apotheosis of Homer'' was taken down from its initial site in 1855 and replaced later that year with a copy by Paul and Raymond Balze (in collaboration with Michel Dumas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=15321 The Balzes' copy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figures shown==
Surrounding Homer are poets, artists, and philosophers both ancient and modern—the modern personages are mostly confined to the lower register of the composition, although Ingres deemed [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]] worthy of elevation to stand alongside the ancients. The figures are:&lt;ref name="Radius_103"&gt;Radius 1968, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later repetitions==
Ingres revisited the subject in several later works, including an undated watercolour (Lille, Musée des Beaux-Arts) and paintings such as ''Homer and His Guide'' (1861; Brussels, Royal Collection) and ''The Odyssey'' (Lyon, Musée des Beaux-Arts). In 1854 be began work on a drawing of the composition to be used as a model for the engraver [[Luigi Calamatta|Calamatta]].&lt;ref name="Condon_112"&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; This drawing, in which Ingres announced his intention to "amplify and complete" his conception, was not completed until 1865,&lt;ref name="Condon_112"/&gt; as the artist deliberated at length in choosing the appropriate historical personages to be included. He ultimately added dozens of new figures, including [[Ictinus]], [[Giulio Romano]], [[John Flaxman]], [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Plutarch]], [[Cosimo de Medici]], [[Louis XIV]], and [[Pope Leo X]].&lt;ref name="Radius_103"/&gt; Ingres also refined his selection by excluding Shakespeare, Tasso, and Camões from the 1865 drawing, as he had come to believe that they were too closely related to the Romantic tendency epitomized by his rival Delacroix.&lt;ref name="Radius_103"/&gt;

'''''The Gleaners''''' (''Des glaneuses'') is an [[oil painting]] by [[Jean-François Millet]] completed in [[1857 in art|1857]].

It depicts three [[peasant]] women [[gleaning]] a field of stray stalks of [[wheat]] after the harvest. The painting is famous for featuring in a sympathetic way what were then the lowest ranks of rural society; this was received poorly by the French upper classes.

== History ==
Millet's ''The Gleaners'' was preceded by a vertical painting of the image in 1854 and an etching in 1855. Millet unveiled ''The Gleaners'' at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1857. It immediately drew negative criticism from the middle and upper classes, who viewed the topic with suspicion: one art critic, speaking for other Parisians, perceived in it an alarming intimation of "the scaffolds of [[Reign of Terror|1793]]."&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kimmelman |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Kimmelman |date=August 27, 1999 |title= ART REVIEW; Plucking Warmth From Millet's Light |periodical=The New York Times |publication-place=New York City |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E2DC143BF934A1575BC0A96F958260 |accessdate=2008-01-10 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having recently come out of the [[French Revolution of 1848]], these prosperous classes saw the painting as glorifying the lower-class worker.&lt;ref name="nyt1" /&gt; To them, it was a reminder that French society was built upon the labor of the working masses, and landowners linked this working class with the growing movement of [[Socialism]].&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred|author2=Christian J. Mamiya |edition=12|title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages|publisher=Wadsworth/Thompson Learning|year=2005|location=California|isbn=0-534-64091-5|page=857}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the working class in ''The Gleaners'' made the upper classes feel uneasy about their status. The masses of workers greatly outnumbered the members of the upper class. This disparity in numbers meant that if the lower class was to revolt, the upper class would be overturned. With the French Revolution still fresh on the minds of the upper classes, this painting was not perceived well at all.

Millet's ''The Gleaners'' was also not perceived well due to its large size, 33 inches by 44 inches, or 84 by 112 centimetres. This is huge for a painting depicting labor. Normally this size of a canvas was reserved for religious or mythological style paintings. Millet's work did not depict anything religiously affiliated, nor was there any reference to any mythological beliefs. The painting illustrated a realistic view of poverty and the working class. One critic commented that "his three gleaners have gigantic pretensions, they pose as the [[Moirai|Three Fates]] of Poverty...their ugliness and their grossness unrelieved."&lt;ref name="andrew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~waste/timeline/story-pic1.html |title=Story behind the picture – The Gleaners |accessdate=2008-01-10 |work=University of St. Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the act of gleaning was not a new topic—representations of [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] had existed in art—this new work was a statement on [[rural poverty]] and not Biblical piety:&lt;ref name="andrew" /&gt; there is no touch of the Biblical sense of community and compassion in the contrasting embodiments of grinding poverty in the foreground and the rich harvest in the sunlit distance beyond. The implicit irony was unsettling. After the Salon, Millet, short on money, sold his piece for 3,000 [[French franc|francs]]—below his asking price of 4,000&lt;ref name="bullet"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fratello |first=Bradley |date=December 2003 |title=France embraces Millet: the intertwined fates of The Gleaners and The Angelus |journal=The Art Bulletin |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=685–701|doi=10.2307/3177365 |jstor=3177365 |publisher=The Art Bulletin, Vol. 85, No. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;—after haggling with an Englishman named Binder who would not budge for his meagre counter-offer; Millet tried to keep the miserable price a secret.&lt;ref&gt;Étienne Moreau-Nélaton, ''Millet racconté par lui-même'', (Paris: 1921)&lt;/ref&gt; While ''The Gleaners'' garnered little but notoriety during his life, after his death in 1875, public appreciation of his work steadily broadened. In 1889, the painting, then owned by banker Ferdinand Bischoffsheim, sold for 300,000 francs at auction.&lt;ref name="bullet" /&gt; The buyer remained anonymous, but rumours were that the painting was coveted by an American buyer. It was announced less than a week later that Champagne powerhouse [[Pommery|Jeanne-Alexandrine Louise Pommery]] had acquired the piece, which silenced gossip on her supposed financial issues after leaving her grapes on the vines weeks longer than her competitors.

At Madame Pommery's death in 1891, and following the conditions of her will, the painting was donated to the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref name="bullet" /&gt; It now resides in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]].

== Legacy ==
''The Gleaners'' is one of Millet's best known works. Its imagery of bending peasant women gleaning was paraphrased frequently in works by younger artists such as [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], and [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda. ''Millet''. London: Oresko, 1977, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[Robert Rosenblum]] says Millet's painting introduced "imposing new presences in the repertory of mid-century art, with endless progeny in city and country. [[Honoré Daumier|Daumier]]'s and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]]'s laundresses, and even more so [[Les raboteurs de parquet|Caillebotte's floor-scrapers]], are almost unthinkable without Millet's epic hymn to labor."&lt;ref&gt;*Rosenblum, Robert (1989). ''Paintings in the Musée d'Orsay''. New York: Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Gleaners'' provides evidence of Millet's role as a contemporary social critic. His brutal depiction of three hunched, female paupers segregated from the laborers and the abundant crop in the distance demonstrates his attention to, if not necessarily sympathy for, the plight of the poorest members of the community around Barbizon and its larger neighbor, Chailly, as the area experienced the growing pains of French modernization. Only about thirty-five miles from the French capital (whose population doubled between 1831 and 1851), the rich, broad plain bordering the forest of Fontainebleau was among the earliest with a rail link to Paris, readily lending itself to feeding the burgeoning city. Studies tracing the transformation of rural France in the nineteenth century note that little change in peasant life occurred beyond northern France and the Paris basin until the last quarter of the century. Millet's representation of class strife on a large-scale farm was thus uniquely modern in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fratello|first1=Bradley|title=France Embraces Millet: The Intertwined Fates of 'The Gleaners' and 'The Angelus'|journal=The Art Bulletin |date=2003|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=17&amp;sid=a8ef2419-4c55-4aae-8ef5-fc7aa220e5c3%40sessionmgr4004&amp;hid=4102&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib13|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting inspired the name of the [[Gleaner Manufacturing Company]].{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}
The painting inspired, and is discussed in, the film by Agnes Varda, ''[[The Gleaners and I]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9613">'''Tony Shafrazi''' born May 8th, 1943, is the owner of the Shafrazi [[Art Gallery]] in New York, who deals artwork by artists such as [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Keith Haring]], and [[David LaChapelle]].

==Early life and education==
Shafrazi was born in [[Abadan, Iran]] to Christian&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/tony-shafrazi/#_ Interview Magazine: "TONY SHAFRAZI" By OWEN WILSON] April 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armenian people|Armenian]] parents who divorced when he was two.&lt;ref&gt;David Grogan (March 26, 1984), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20087449,00.html Once He Vandalized Picasso's Guernica, but Now Tony Shafrazi Is a Successful Patron of the Arts] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bettina von Hase (February 20, 2010), [http://howtospendit.ft.com/arts-giving/1211-the-fine-art-of-philanthropy The fine art of philanthropy] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 13, his father – an oil-company executive – and stepmother took Shafrazi to England and left him to study there.&lt;ref name=people&gt;David Grogan (March 26, 1984), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20087449,00.html Once He Vandalized Picasso's Guernica, but Now Tony Shafrazi Is a Successful Patron of the Arts] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He first went to a vicarage in [[Bilston]], then to boarding school in [[Whittlebury]]&lt;ref&gt;Bettina von Hase (February 20, 2010), [http://howtospendit.ft.com/arts-giving/1211-the-fine-art-of-philanthropy The fine art of philanthropy] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College|Hammersmith College of Art &amp; Building]]. He attended the [[Royal College of Art]] from 1963 to 1967&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Wilson]] (November 2007), [http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/tony-shafrazi/#_ Tony Shafrazi] ''Interview Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; before coming to New York in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (October 12, 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/12/arts/another-look-at-bacon-newfound-canvases-shed-more-light-on-a-master.html Another Look at Bacon; Newfound Canvases Shed More Light on a Master] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; where he lectured at several universities, including the [[School of Visual Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;David Grogan (March 26, 1984), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20087449,00.html Once He Vandalized Picasso's Guernica, but Now Tony Shafrazi Is a Successful Patron of the Arts] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
On February 28, 1974, Shafrazi [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] [[Picasso]]'s painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', which hung in [[Museum of Modern Art|the Museum of Modern Art]], with the words "KILL LIES ALL" in foot-high letters.&lt;ref&gt;David Grogan (March 26, 1984), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20087449,00.html Once He Vandalized Picasso's Guernica, but Now Tony Shafrazi Is a Successful Patron of the Arts] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; When a guard finally grabbed him, Shafrazi shouted, "Call the curator. I am an artist."&lt;ref&gt;David Grogan (March 26, 1984), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20087449,00.html Once He Vandalized Picasso's Guernica, but Now Tony Shafrazi Is a Successful Patron of the Arts] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The paint was easily removed as the painting was heavily varnished. It is believed that Shafrazi was protesting the announcement, the day before, of the release on bail of U.S. lieutenant [[William Calley]]. Calley, then under house arrest following his conviction, in 1971, for his part in the [[My Lai Massacre|My Lai massacre]] in Vietnam, had petitioned for [[habeas corpus]]; he had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment. Although his appeal was overturned in June, he was finally released from U.S. Army custody later in the year after having received a limited pardon from [[Richard Nixon]]. Shafrazi was a member of the [[Art Workers' Coalition]], which in 1970 had staged a protest at MoMA by unfurling a copy of the famous [[My Lai]] protest poster ''[[And babies]]'' in front of the ''Guernica'' painting, which itself depicts the tragedies of war and the suffering it inflicts upon innocent civilians. Shafrazi was later given five years' probation, without a trial.&lt;ref&gt;David Grogan (March 26, 1984), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20087449,00.html Once He Vandalized Picasso's Guernica, but Now Tony Shafrazi Is a Successful Patron of the Arts] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to his 1974 vandalism of the painting, he gave the following statement to ''[[Art in America]]'' in December 1980: "I wanted to bring the art absolutely up to date, to retrieve it from [[art history]] and give it life. Maybe that's why the ''Guernica'' action remains so difficult to deal with. I tried to trespass beyond that invisible barrier that no one is allowed to cross; I wanted to dwell within the act of the painting's creation, get involved with the making of the work, put my hand within it and by that act encourage the individual viewer to challenge it, deal with it and thus see it in its dynamic raw state as it was being made, not as a piece of history."

==Art dealer==
In 1976, only a few years after the spray painting incident, Shafrazi returned to his homeland and became the art advisor to [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|the Shah of Iran]] and [[Kamran Diba]], then director of the [[Teheran Museum of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (October 12, 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/12/arts/another-look-at-bacon-newfound-canvases-shed-more-light-on-a-master.html Another Look at Bacon; Newfound Canvases Shed More Light on a Master] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Shafrazi went to about 15 of the top New York dealers at the time — including [[Leo Castelli]], [[Ileana Sonnabend]], Paula Cooper, John Weber, and Irving Blum — and helped assemble a 20th-century [[Collection (museum)|art collection]] on the Shah's behalf within four years.&lt;ref&gt;Olga of Greece (December 2, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/style/tmagazine/02masterpiece.html Masterpiece Basement] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As he did so his power expanded in the art market. The museum Shafrazi had constructed in Tehran to house this collection epitomized the Shah's modern Iranian state, thus the collection was predominantly Western: from [[Impressionism]] to [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]], [[Pop art|Pop]] and [[Conceptual art|Conceptual Art]], including works by [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], and [[Willem de Kooning]].

A '''tract''' is a [[literature|literary work]], and in current usage, usually [[religious]] in nature. The notion of what constitutes a tract has changed over time.  By the early part of the 21st century, a tract referred to a brief [[pamphlet]] used for religious and political purposes, though far more often the former.  Tracts are often either left for someone to find or handed out.  However, there have been times in history when the term implied tome-like works. A ''tractate'', a derivative of a tract, is equivalent in Hebrew literature to a ''chapter'' of the Christian Bible.

==History==
The distribution of tracts pre-dates the development of the [[printing press]], with the term being applied by scholars to religious and political works at least as early as the 13th century. They were used to disseminate the teachings of [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century. As a political tool, they proliferated throughout Europe during the 17th century. They have been printed as persuasive religious material since the invention of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s [[printing press]], being widely utilized by [[Martin Luther]] during the start of the [[Lutheran]] movement of [[Christianity]].

[[Image:CIM Gospel Tract.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[Good News (Christianity)|Gospel]] tract printed by the [[China Inland Mission]]]]

===Religious tracts===
As religious literature, tracts were used throughout the turbulence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the various upheavals of the 17th century. They came to such prominence again in the [[Oxford Movement]] for reform within the [[Church of England]] that the movement became known as "Tractarianism", after the publication in the 1830s and 1840s of a series of religious [[essay]]s collectively called ''[[Tracts for the Times]]''.

These tracts were written by a group of [[Anglican]] [[clergy]] including [[John Henry Newman]], [[John Keble]], [[Henry Edward Manning]], and [[Edward Pusey]]. They were [[theology|theological]] discourses that sought to establish the continuity between the Church of England and the [[Church father|patristic]] period of [[History of Christianity|church history]]. They had a vast influence on [[Anglo-Catholicism]]. They were learned works and varied in length from four to over 400 pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/tracts-list.html|title=Modern History Sourcebook: The Tracts for the Times, 1833-1841|work=fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important center for the spreading of tracts was the London-based [[Religious Tract Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/jsp/search/article.jsp?i_sect_id=330356&amp;i_history=1 The article ''traktatsällskap''] in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'', web edition, visited 2006-11-22 (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; Tracts were used both within England, affecting the conversion of pioneer missionary to China, [[Hudson Taylor]], as well as in the crosscultural missions that movements such as Taylor founded: the [[China Inland Mission]].

[[Charles Spurgeon]] wrote many tracts, and in addition to these evangelical writings, his "Penny Sermons" were printed weekly and distributed widely by the millions and used in a similar way, and they still are today. In America, the American Tract Society distributed vast quantities of tracts in multitudes of languages to newly arriving immigrants at [[Ellis Island]] and sought to assist them in their struggles in their new country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/02/24/101855405.pdf The New York Times, ''The Gospel in 30 Tongues''], February 24, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wipermail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tracts are often left in places with high amounts of public traffic. This tract was left under a vehicle [[windshield wiper]].]]

The publishing of tracts for religious purposes has continued unabated, with many evangelical tract ministries{{Who|date=October 2011}}, in particular, existing today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tractlist.com&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[American Tract Society]] has continuously published literature of this type since 1825. {{anchor|JW|Watch Tower}} By the late 19th century, [[Bible Student movement#Watch Tower Society|Bible Students]] associated with ''[[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society]]'' were distributing tens of millions of tracts each year;&lt;ref&gt;"Kingdom Proclaimers Active in All the Earth", ''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1994, page 15, "In 1881, just two years after the Watch Tower was first published,... In a few years, tens of millions of tracts were being distributed annually in many languages."&lt;/ref&gt; by the start of World War I, they had distributed hundreds of millions of tracts in dozens of languages worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;"Witnesses to the Most Distant Part of the Earth", ''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', ©1993 Watch Tower, page 421, "Before the devastation of the first world war was unleashed, an extensive witness had been given worldwide.... Millions of books, as well as hundreds of millions of tracts and other pieces of literature in 35 languages, had been distributed by the Bible Students."&lt;/ref&gt; The Watch Tower Society continues to publish hundreds of millions of religious tracts in more than 400 languages, which are distributed by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;"Presenting the Good News—With Tracts and Handbills", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', January 1991, page 8, ©Watch Tower&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"“The Silver Is Mine, and the Gold Is Mine”", ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 2007, page 18, "Tracts, brochures, magazines, and books have been translated into 437 languages."&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|reason=The sources listed have a reputation for academic dishonesty. Third party sources should be cited here.| date=March 2016}}

As evangelistic tools, tracts became prominent in the [[Jesus movement]]. One of the most widely distributed was "[[The Four Spiritual Laws]]" authored by [[Bill Bright]] of [[Campus Crusade for Christ]] and first published in 1965. "This Was Your Life" was the first of many tracts written by [[Jack Chick]]. Later [[Chick tract]]s followed the pattern of vivid [[cartoon]] images and began to focus on issues of [[Fundamentalist Christianity]], including vehement [[Anti-Catholic]] opinions.

In the 1980s and 1990s, [[Last Days Ministries]] reprinted articles in the ''Last Days Newsletter'' by [[Keith Green]] and other contemporary and historic writers including [[David Wilkerson]], [[Leonard Ravenhill]], [[Winkie Pratney]], [[Charles Finney]], [[John Wesley]], and [[William Booth]]. More recently [[Living Waters Publications]] prints tracts such as "The Atheist Test" or "Are You Good Enough to Go to Heaven?", as well as tracts which feature attention-getting illusions or gags. These include the "[[The Great News Network#Million Dollar Bill Tract Seizure|Million Dollar Bill]]", which caused a legal controversy in June 2006. Most Christian tract ministries operate as non-profit "faith" organizations, some to the degree that they do not require a fee for their tracts. One of the most productive among these is Fellowship Tract League, which has printed over 4 billion Gospel tracts since 1978, available in over 70 different languages, and  have been distributed into more than 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fellowshiptractleague.org/about.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201004133/http://www.fellowshiptractleague.org/about.htm |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tracting" is a colloquialism commonly used by [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Mormon missionaries]] to refer to door-to-door proselytizing, whether or not actual tracts are dispensed.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Political tracts===
{{main|Pamphlet}}
Brochure-like tracts, also known as [[pamphlet]]s, advocating political positions have also been used throughout history as well. They were used throughout Europe in the 17th century. In the 18th century, they featured prominently in the political unrest leading up to the [[American Revolution]], and in the English response to the [[French Revolution]], a "pamphlet war" known as the [[Revolution Controversy]]. A well-known example of a far-reaching tract from this era is [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] by [[Thomas Paine]].

Tracts were used for political purposes throughout the 20th century. They were used to spread Nazi propaganda in [[central Europe]] during the 1930s and 1940s. According to Jack Chick, his impetus to design cartoon-based religious tracts was brought on by hearing of a similar promotional tool used by Communists in [[China]] to wide success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/information/authors/chick.asp|title=Biography of Jack Chick|work=chick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the months before the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]], [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] handed out pamphlets promoting [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Communism|Communist]] [[Cuba]] on the streets of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].

The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) maintains many cemeteries specifically devoted to veterans. Most have various rules regarding what must take place in order to be interred there.

==Procedure==
The VA only permits graphics on Government-furnished headstones or markers that are approved emblems of belief, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Union Army|Union Shield]] (including those who served in the U.S. military through the [[Spanish–American War]]), the [[Confederate States of America|Civil War Confederate]] [[Southern Cross of Honor]], and the [[Medal of Honor]] insignia. [[Arlington National Cemetery]] has similar restrictions on headstones, though it is maintained by [[US Department of the Army]].

The [[religious symbol]]s are rendered as simple [[Monumental inscription|inscriptions]] without sculptural [[relief]] or coloring other than [[black]]. The emblem of belief is an optional feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Funerals/Scheduling-a-Funeral/Headstones-and-Niche-Covers/Government-Headstone-Niche-Covers |title=Arlington National Cemetery &gt; Funerals &gt; Scheduling a Funeral &gt; Headstones and Niche Covers &gt; Government Headstone/Niche Covers |quote=White marble niche covers (15¾ x 11¼ x ¼) generally contain 11 lines of text with or without  an optional emblem of belief.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the VA adds a new symbol a few months after receiving a petition from a faith group.&lt;ref name=Banerjee /&gt; However, the [[Wicca]]n symbol was only added in 2007 to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of several families by [[Americans United for the Separation of Church and State]] in November 2006.&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;{{cite news|last=Banerjee|first=Neela|title=Use of Wiccan Symbol on Veterans’ Headstones Is Approved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/washington/24wiccan.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 1, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 24, 2007}} The VA added emblem of belief #37 – "WICCA (Pentacle)".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.au.org/media/press-releases/veterans-affairs-department-must-accommodate-wiccan-symbol-on-memorial-markers|title=Veterans Affairs Department Must Accommodate Wiccan Symbol On Memorial Markers At Government Cemeteries, Says Americans United|publisher=AU|date=June 8, 2006|accessdate=July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stewart v. Nicholson|url=https://www.au.org/our-work/legal/lawsuits/stewart-v-nicholson|publisher=AU|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate parallel lawsuit was filed on behalf of two Wiccan churches and three families by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] in September 2006, which was resolved by the same settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Veterans Denied Right to Post Religious Symbol on Headstones, ACLU Charges|url=https://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/veterans-denied-right-post-religious-symbol-headstones-aclu-charges|date=September 29, 2006|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|title=Pagans Sue on Emblem for Graves|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/washington/30grave.html|accessdate=August 1, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Veterans Win Right to Post Religious Symbol on Headstones|url=https://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/veterans-win-right-post-religious-symbol-headstones|date=April 23, 2007|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first interfaith headstone, which includes a Wiccan [[pentacle]] for Jan Deanna O'Rourke and a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Cross]] for her husband, was installed at Arlington National Cemetery on May 1, 2007, and dedicated on July 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=Christopher|title=A First Dedication at Arlington|journal=Action|year=2007|url=http://aren.org/newsletter/2007-lammas/action.php?num=2|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Headstone and marker symbols==
The following emblems and emblem numbers are publicized as available for Government headstones and markers as of September 2017.&lt;ref name="DVA"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Cemetery Administration |url=http://www.cem.va.gov/hmm/emblems.asp |title=Available Emblems of Belief for Placement on Government Headstones and Markers – National Cemetery Administration |publisher=Cem.va.gov |date=2013-07-03 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process is in place to consider approving additional religious or belief system emblems requested by the families of individuals eligible for these headstones and markers.&lt;ref name="DVA" /&gt;

Each emblem is given its official USVA name and designation, with added additional links for related symbolism (*) and for related movements (†).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23150">Radio and club DJ [[Gilles Peterson]] every three months or so does an ''All Winners Special'' in which he replays the previous few months' best new [[track (song)|tracks]]—both [[single (music)|singles]]/individual [[album]] tracks as well as whole albums—he has either played out when [[DJing]] or played on his [[BBC Radio 1]] show ''[[Gilles Peterson#Radio 1|Worldwide]]''. At the end of the year, these winners, plus a few further favourites that may have been overlooked, get compiled into a [[longlist]]. Listeners of the show then get to vote this longlist down to a shortlist of ten '''''Worldwide Winners''''' in each section, via the Radio 1 website, which Gilles then plays over the last couple of editions of his [[radioshow]] at the end of the year. It has been compiled in various forms at the end of every year since 1998 to present, though the first few years did not involve any public vote.

In recent years, from 2004 onwards, this has been expanded into the '''''Worldwide Winners Awards''''' with an event held at a London club venue during the very end of December or beginning of January, with outside broadcast recording by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], edited highlights of which are broadcast on a further one or two editions of the radio show at the start of January. 
Also further sections were added, like "Best Clubnight", "Best Recordshop", "Best Compilation Album", and a special award called "The [[John Peel]] ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'Play More Jazz'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' Award" (a tribute to his Radio 1 colleague who died suddenly in 2004) given to an artist, often a newcomer, who has displayed special noteworthy work over the year.

'''Zsuzsi Roboz''' (15 August 1929 – 9 July 2012) was a London-based [[Hungary|Hungarian]] painter &lt;ref name="guardianObit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/19/zsuzi-roboz|title=Zsuzsi Roboz dies|author=Edward Lucie-Smith|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Guardian|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; known for her [[Portrait|portraiture paintings]] and [[painting|paintings]] of the arts, her work hangs at multiple prominent galleries including the [[Tate|Tate Britain]] and [[National Portrait Gallery, London|The National Portrait Gallery]].&lt;ref name="messumsZsuszi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.messums.com/artists/view/19Zsuzsi_Roboz|title=Zsuzsi Roboz|website=www.messums.com|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Zsuzsi Roboz was born in [[Budapest]]. Her father, Imre Roboz, was the manager of the [[Comedy Theatre of Budapest]] ([[Comedy Theatre of Budapest|Vígszínház theatre]]), which specialised in [[operettas]]. Her mother, Edith Roboz, was a society hostess.&lt;ref name="guardianObit" /&gt;

As an only child, Roboz was largely raised by governesses seeing relatively little of her parents, but enjoyed spending time with them whenever their busy lives would permit. The Sunday morning walks with her parents were a happy memory for Roboz as it was one of the only times she could really talk to her parents, especially her father.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roboz: A Painter's Paradox|last=Taylor|first=John Russell|publisher=The Studio of Fine Art Publications|year=2005|isbn=1-903438-85-3|location=Buckinghamshire|pages=13-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, Roboz felt a change in Hungary as right-wing ideas became more prominent, especially with [[Nazi Germany]] invading Hungary's former sister state [[Austria]] in 1938. Eventually the liberal arts fell out of favour and Roboz's father, Imre, was deprived of his job which resulted in him handing it over to a friend, writer Harsanyi Zsolt. It was soon necessary for Imre to go into hiding, shortly followed by Roboz and her mother being moved to a separate accommodation. They heard very little of Imre and was eventually declared dead, although his body was never found.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to [[The Times]], after the [[Hungary in World War II|occupation of Hungary]] Imre was eventually forced to a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] where he had been reported dead.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi"&gt;{{cite news |title=Zsuzsi Roboz |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/zsuzsi-roboz-009s790dflp |accessdate=17 November 2018 |publisher=The Times |date=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different articles state different causes of Imre’s death, no one is certain of how he actually passed. Zsuzsi and her mother were hidden by a neighbour and eventually crossed the [[Danube]] where they were rescued by the Americans.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;

After the war, the pair moved to [[France]] as her mother had remarried a Frenchman, but Zsuzsi found life in France difficult and left for secretarial school in [[London]] at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;  After arriving in London in 1947&lt;ref name="messumsZsuszi" /&gt;, she worked for an old friend of her fathers, [[Alexander Korda]], an active and well-known figure in Cinema, as a typist and occasional dinner guest with celebrities such as [[John Garfield]].&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;

It was during this time that Roboz was attending art classes at the [[Royal Academy Schools]] under the supervision of Peter Greenham&lt;ref name="messumsZsuszi" /&gt;,  and would later catch the eye of [[Pietro Annigoni]].&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;  She would later leave to study in Italy as Annigoni’s pupil and upon returning to London after the year was up, she was considered a “brilliant draughtsman.”&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;

== Career ==
After a brief period in [[France]], she was sent to secretarial school in [[London]] but would pursue a career in painting. Some of her paintings are exhibited at the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] and the [[Tate Gallery]]. She was best known for her portraits of dancers, musicians and writers.&lt;ref&gt;Profile, ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 23 August 2008; retrieved September 26, 2008, No 5504, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

While she may be known for her portraits and could have built a grand clientele based on her work, Roboz had other interests and passions as well. Roboz regarded “herself as a painter who sometimes painted portraits, rather than a specialist in the genre.”&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt; These other interests included series on music and the ballet.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt; Yet it was for her talent as a portrait painter that she commissioned to do a series of portraits for the 10th anniversary [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] where her second husband, Alfred T. (Teddy) Smith was employed in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;  

After her second independent show, she caught the attention of Jacques O’Hana, an art dealer from Mayfair who took her on as a recurring artist.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt; 

Although she had become relatively well known in the art world, she still wanted to further her artistic skills and travelled thoroughly, from places like the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian Coast]] to [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;
By the mid-nineties, she developed a symbolist style which can be seen her in series ''Spirit of Nature''.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;

Her symbolist style can also be seen in her final series, ''Face to Face'' (2011), a portraiture series of British and Irish writers that went beyond realism. The series was dedicated to not only show casing these writers but capturing their creative aura to celebrate their works that made them who they are.&lt;ref name="guardianObit" /&gt;
Among her other stylistic choices, Messum’s describes her work as ranging from “sensual drawings to oils which hint at the surreal absurdity of life’s experiences.”&lt;ref name="messumsZsuszi" /&gt;
