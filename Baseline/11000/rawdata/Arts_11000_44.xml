==Top-grossing films (U.S.)&lt;ref&gt;Box Office Digest, April 1941, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;==
At the time, box office numbers were reported as a percentage of business for each theater in comparison to 'normal' business. For example, [[Boom Town (film)|Boom Town]] performed at 232% and [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]] at 130%.  This is why exact dollar grosses for films are unreliable at best.

{{Years in film}}
The decade of the '''1970s in film''' involved many significant films.

== Asian cinema ==
{{see also|Chinese films of the 1970s|Hong Kong films of the 1970s|Japanese films of the 1970s|Pakistani films of the 1970s|Philippine films of the 1970s}}
Asian cinema of the 1970s catered to the rising middle class fantasies and struggles. In the [[Bollywood]] cinema of India this was epitomized by the films of Bollywood superhero [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. These films portrayed adventurous plots with car chase trying to imitate Hollywood films like ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', presented music with Disco beats and also presented the young middle class man as an "''angry young man''". The women on the other hand were shown as ones who have adopted western values and outfits especially by heroines like [[Parveen Babi]] (who was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine for a story on Bollywood's success) and [[Zeenat Aman]]. However towards the very end of the 1970s, especially after the steep rise in land prices in urban areas and the decline in employment security, the heroines were seen more often as [[saree]]-women striving to have a prosperous middle-class family especially heroines like [[Jaya Prada]] and [[Hema Malini]]. In this way, the cinema of Asian region becomes a [[sociological]] statement of the [[social-economic]] times of the region and its people. In [[Malayalam cinema]], [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]] made ''Swayamvaram'' in 1972, which got wide critical acclaim. This was followed by the film ''Nirmalyam'' by [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]] in 1973.

Another Asian touchstone beginning in the early 1970s was traditional [[Hong Kong martial arts film]] which sparked a greater interest in Chinese martial arts to the West. [[Martial arts film]] reached the peak of its popularity largely in part due to its greatest icon, [[Bruce Lee]]. His films elevated the genre to a new level and sparked a greater interest in martial arts in the West. Lee became famous for playing Kato in the TV series The Green Hornet during the 1960s yet it was when he returned to Hong Kong and starred in three films that shot him to stardom all over Asia, ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971), ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972) and ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' (1972). Yet he achieved global stardom in his last completed film and the first [[Kung fu (term)|Kung fu]] film to be produced by a Hollywood studio, ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973).

==European cinema==
{{see also|List of British films|Danish films of the 1970s|French films of the 1970s|Turkish films of the 1970s|Georgian films of the 1970s|List of German films: 1970s|List of Polish films of the 1970s|Portuguese films of the 1970s|Spanish films of the 1970s|Swedish films of the 1970s}}
In [[European cinema]], the failure of the [[Prague Spring]] brought about nostalgic motion pictures reminiscent of the ones that celebrate the 1970s itself. These films expressed a yearning and as a premonition to the decade and its dreams. The [[Hungary|Hungarian]] director [[István Szabó]] made the motion picture ''[[Szerelmesfilm]]'' (1970), which is a nostalgic portrayal and a premonition of the fading of the young 1970s ethos of change and a friendlier social structure. The Italian director [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] made the motion picture ''[[The Conformist (film)|The Conformist]]'' (1970). German films after the war asked existential questions especially the works of [[Rainer Fassbinder]]. The films of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] director [[Ingmar Bergman]] reached a new level of expression in motion pictures like ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' (1973). Young German directors made films that came to be known as the [[German New Wave|German new wave]]. It was the voice of a new generation that had grown up after the second world war. These included directors like [[Wim Wenders]], [[Hans-Jürgen Syberberg]] and [[Werner Herzog]].

==North American cinema==

The decade opened with [[Hollywood]] facing a financial slump, reflecting the monetary woes of the nation as a whole during the first half of the decade. Despite this, the 1970s proved to be a benchmark decade in the development of cinema, both as an art form and as a business. With young filmmakers taking greater risks and restrictions regarding language and sexuality lifting, Hollywood produced some of its most critically acclaimed and financially successful films since its "[[Cinema of the United States#Golden Age of Hollywood|golden era]]."

In the years previous to 1970, Hollywood had begun to cater to the younger generation with films such as ''[[The Graduate]]''. This proved a folly when anti-war films like ''[[R. P. M.]]'' and ''[[The Strawberry Statement (film)|The Strawberry Statement]]'' became major box-office flops. Even solid films with [[bankable star]]s, like the [[Pearl Harbor]] epic ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', flopped, leaving studios in dire straits financially. Unable to repay financiers, studios began selling off land, furniture, clothing, and sets acquired over years of production. Nostalgic fans bid on merchandise and collectibles ranging from [[Judy Garland]]'s [[Ruby slippers|sparkling red shoes]] to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM's]] own back lots.

More of the successful films were those based in the harsh truths of war, rather than the excesses of the 1960s. Films like the [[Francis Ford Coppola]]-scripted ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]] as the World War II general, and [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', about a [[Korean War]] field hospital, were major box-office draws in 1970. Honest,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} old-fashioned films like ''[[Summer of '42]]'', and the [[Erich Segal]] adaptation, ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'', were commercial and critical hits. (Love Story and "Summer" remain, {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, two of the most successful films in Hollywood history. "Summer", costing $1,000,000 USD, brought in $25,000,000 at the box office, while "Love Story", with a budget of $2,200,000, earned $106,400,000).

One of the most insightful films of the decade{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} came from the mind of a Hollywood outsider, Czechoslovakian director [[Miloš Forman]], whose ''[[Taking Off (film)|Taking Off]]'' became a bold reflection of life at the beginning of the 1970s. The 1971 film satirized the American middle class, following a young girl who runs away from home, leaving her parents free to explore life for the first time in years. While the film was never given a wide release in America, it became a major critical achievement both in America and around the world (garnering the film high honors at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and several [[BAFTA Award]] nominations).

[[Sean Connery]] returned to the role of [[James Bond]] in 1971 in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' after [[George Lazenby]] filled the role in 1969. [[Roger Moore]] succeeded Connery in 1973 with an adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' which was the most successful of his Bond films in terms of admissions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' was followed by an adaptation of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' in 1974, which at the time garnered the lowest box office taking of any Bond film before it. After its release [[Harry Saltzman]] co-owner of [[Danjaq]] with [[Albert R. Broccoli]] sold his half to [[United Artists]] causing a three-year gap until the next Bond film, the longest gap since the start of the franchise in 1962. The series picked up again in 1977 with ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' and ended the decade with ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' in 1979, which was the highest grossing Bond film (not adjusting for inflation) of all time until ''[[GoldenEye]]'' in 1995.

An adaptation of an [[Arthur Hailey]] novel would prove to be one of the most notable films of 1970, and would set the stage for a major trend in 1970s cinema.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The film, ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', featured a complex plot, characters, and an all-star cast of Hollywood A-listers and legends. ''Airport'' followed an airport manager trying to keep a fictional [[Chicago]] airport operational during a blizzard, as well as a bomb plot to blow up an airplane. The film was a major critical and financial success, helping pull [[Universal Studios]] into the black for the year. The film earned senior actress [[Helen Hayes]] an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] and garnered many other nominations in both technical and talent categories. The success of the film launched several other [[disaster film]]s, many of which following the same blueprint of major stars, a melodramatic script, and great suspense.

Three ''Airport'' sequels followed in 1974, 1977, and 1979, each successor making less money than the last.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} 1972 brought ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'', which starred a young [[Gene Hackman]] leading an all-star cast to safety in a capsized luxury liner. The film earned an [[Academy Award]] for visual effects (and Best Original Song for "[[The Morning After (1974 film)|The Morning After]]"), as well as numerous nominations, including one for its notable supporting star, [[Shelley Winters]], but its sequel in 1979 was far less successful. ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' teamed [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] and [[Paul Newman]] against a fire in a San Francisco skyscraper. The film cost a whopping $14 million to produce (expensive for its time), and won Academy Awards for Cinematography, Film Editing, and Best Original Song. The same year, the epic ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' featured questionable effects (camera shake and models) to achieve a destructive 9.9 earthquake in Los Angeles. Despite this, the film was one of the most successful of its time, earning $80 million at box office. By the late 1970s, the novelty had worn off and the disasters had become less exciting. 1977 brought a terrorist targeting a ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'', 1978 a ''[[The Swarm (film)|Swarm]]'' of bees, and a less-than-threatening ''[[Meteor (film)|Meteor]]'' in 1979.

The early 1970s also brought a rebirth of gritty crime film,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} three years after the influential ''[[Bullitt]]''. [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', starring [[Gene Hackman]] as a drug detective and [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[Serpico]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]] in the true-life story of an honest cop who fought corruption, were two of the most famous ones. Films like ''[[Get Carter]]'' featured gratuitous nudity, while [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s groundbreaking ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' featured much physical and sexual violence to complement its complex story. [[African American]] filmmakers also found success in the 1970s with such hits as ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' and ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]''. Like other sequels in the 1970s, ''Shaft'' went on to have two more adventures, each less successful than the last.

An adaptation of a [[Mario Puzo]] novel, ''[[The Godfather]]'', was a box-office and critical success in 1972. The three-hour epic followed a Mafia boss, played by [[Marlon Brando]], through his life of crime. Beyond the violence and drama were themes of love, pride, and greed. ''The Godfather'' went on to earn $134 million at American box office, and $245 million throughout the world, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. It won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay. Its director [[Francis Ford Coppola]] was passed over in favor of [[Bob Fosse]] and his musical, ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'', which also earned an Oscar for its star, [[Liza Minnelli]]. ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' followed in 1974, with roughly the same principal cast and crew, earning Oscars for star [[Robert De Niro]], its director, composer, screenwriters and art directors. The film also earned the Best Picture Oscar for that year.

Not all of the "street smart" urban related films were 100% live action. Director [[Ralph Bakshi]] released the first animated full-length feature specifically oriented towards adults (''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'') then moved on to two other features that dealt with the mafia and other ethnic-related urban issues. Both ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'' and ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]'' would prove that this kind of material could be handled effectively in the animation genre. Bakshi would later produce fantasy oriented films (''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'') before the decade ended.

Inaugurated by the 1969 [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre|release]] of [[Andy Warhol]]{{'s}} ''[[Blue Movie]]'', the phenomenon of [[Erotic art|adult erotic films]] being publicly discussed by celebrities (like [[Johnny Carson]] and [[Bob Hope]]),&lt;ref name="TM-20050329"&gt;{{cite web |last=Corliss |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Corliss |title=That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html |date=March 29, 2005 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taken seriously by critics (like [[Roger Ebert]]),&lt;ref name="RE-19730613"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Devil In Miss Jones - Film Review |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-devil-in-miss-jones-1973 |date=June 13, 1973 |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=February 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RE-19761124"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Alice in Wonderland:An X-Rated Musical Fantasy |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/alice-in-wonderland-1976 |date=November 24, 1976 |publisher=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=February 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a development referred to, by Ralph Blumenthal of ''[[The New York Times]]'', as "[[Golden Age of Porn#"Porno chic"|porno chic]]", and later known as the [[Golden Age of Porn]], began, for the first time, in modern American culture.&lt;ref name="TM-20050329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19730121"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |title=Porno chic; 'Hard-core' grows fashionable-and very profitable |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/pornochic-hardcore-grows-fashionableand-very-profitable.html |date=January 21, 1973 |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |accessdate=January 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jahsonic.com/PornoChic.html Porno Chic (Jahsonic.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to award-winning author [[Toni Bentley]], [[Radley Metzger]]{{'s}} 1976 film ''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]'', based on the play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]] (and its derivative, ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''), and due to attaining a mainstream level in storyline and sets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cult Film Reader |last=Mathijs |first=Ernest |last2=Mendik |first2=Xavier |publisher=[[Open University Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0335219230|page=}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the "crown jewel" of this '[[Golden Age of Porn|Golden Age]]'.&lt;ref name="PB-201406"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bentley |first=Toni |authorlink=Toni Bentley |title=The Legend of Henry Paris |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/the-legend-of-henry-paris |date=June 2014 |work=[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]] |accessdate=January 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204030128/http://www.playboy.com/articles/the-legend-of-henry-paris |archive-date=2016-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TB-201406"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bentley |first=Toni |authorlink=Toni Bentley |title=The Legend of Henry Paris |url=http://www.tonibentley.com/pdfarticles/playboy/RadleyMetzger_AuteuroftheErotic_ToniBentley.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |date=June 2014 |work=ToniBentley.com |accessdate=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle 1970s, films began to also reflect the disenfranchisement brought by the excesses of the past twenty years. A deeply unsettling look at alienation and city life, [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' earned international praise, first at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and then at the [[Academy Awards]], where it was nominated for Best Leading Actor ([[Robert De Niro]]), Best Supporting Actress ([[Jodie Foster]]), Best Score ([[Bernard Herrmann]]), and Best Picture. ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' dealt with the impeachment of [[Richard Nixon]], while Lumet's ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]'' portrayed greed and [[narcissism]] in both American society and television media. The film won Oscars for Best Actor ([[Peter Finch]]), Best Actress ([[Faye Dunaway]]), Best Supporting Actress ([[Beatrice Straight]]), and Best Screenplay ([[Paddy Chayefsky]]). Thanks to a stellar cast, experienced director, and a poignant story, ''Network'' became one of the largest critical successes of 1976. Another film, ''[[Rocky]]'', about a clubhouse boxer (played by [[Sylvester Stallone]]) who is granted a world championship title fight won the Best Picture [[Academy Award]] that year. The film also became a major commercial success and spawned four sequels through the rest of the 1970s and 1980s.

Throughout the 1970s, the horror film developed into a lucrative genre of film. It began in 1973 with the terrifying ''[[The Exorcist]]'', directed by [[William Friedkin]] and starring the young [[Linda Blair]]. The film saw massive success, and the first of several sequels was released in 1977. 1976 brought the equally creepy suspense thriller, ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'', about a man who becomes the target of a former Nazi dentist's torment after his brother dies. The same year, the [[Devil]] himself made an appearance in ''[[The Omen]]'', about the spawn of [[Satan]]. 1978's ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' was a precursor to the "slasher" films of the 1980s and 1990s with its psychopathic Michael Myers. Cult horror films were also popular in the 1970s, such as [[Wes Craven]]'s early gore films ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|Last House on the Left]]'' and ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'', as well as [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''.

The [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] was born in 1975. While the 1973 horror classic ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' was among the top five grossing films of the 1970s, the first film given the blockbuster distinction was 1975's ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. Released on June 20, the film about a series of horrific deaths related to a massive great white shark was director [[Steven Spielberg]]'s first big-budget Hollywood production, coming in at $9 million in cost. The film slowly grew in ticket sales and became one of the most profitable films of its time, ending with a $260 million gross in the United States alone. The film won Academy Awards for its skillful editing, chilling score, and sound recording. It was also nominated for Best Picture that year, though it lost to [[Miloš Forman]]'s ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (which also won acting awards for [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Louise Fletcher]]). It spawned the successful sequel, ''[[Jaws 2]]'' in 1978, which featured the same cast, but without [[Steven Spielberg]]. Another tailor-made blockbuster, [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' was released, but to less than stellar success. ''King Kong'' did mark the first time a film was booked to theaters before a release date, a common practice today.

The massive success of ''Jaws'' was eclipsed just two years later by another legendary blockbuster and film franchise. The [[George Lucas]] science-fiction film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' hit theater screens in May 1977, and became a major hit, growing in ticket sales throughout the summer and the rest of the year. In time earning some $460 million, the good versus evil fantasy set in space was not soon surpassed. The film's breathtaking visual effects won an [[Academy Award]]. The film also won for [[John Williams]]'s uplifting score, as well as art direction, costume design, film editing, and sound. ''Star Wars'' effectively removed any specter of studio bankruptcy that had haunted the studios since early in the decade. When a television film, ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', was released as a spin-off from ''Star Wars'' in 1978; it failed to receive the status of the original film, and was deemed a flop. It would be two years until the ''Star Wars'' series would be revived with ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Another success in visual effects came the same year as ''Star Wars'', with Spielberg's ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', another blockbuster and alien contact set in the wilderness. For the picture, Spielberg received his first Oscar nomination for directing. A year later the most iconic [[superhero]] was brought to the screen in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', who was portrayed by classically trained actor [[Christopher Reeve]]. It was met by resounding praise for strong performances and its epic scope which resulted in numerous sequels and is regarded as one of the greatest [[superhero film]]s ever made, beginning a new era of superhero films.

The success of [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Annie Hall]]'' in 1977 stirred a new trend in filmmaking.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} ''Annie Hall'', a love story about a depressed comedian and a free-spirited woman, was followed with more sentimental films, including [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Goodbye Girl]]'', ''[[An Unmarried Woman]]'' starring [[Jill Clayburgh]], the autobiographical [[Lillian Hellman]] story, ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'', starring [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]], and 1978's ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' and ''[[International Velvet (film)|International Velvet]]''.

Younger audiences were also beginning to be the focus of cinema, after the huge blockbusters that had attracted them back to the theater. [[John Travolta]] became popular in the pop-culture landmark films, ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', which introduced Disco to middle America, and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', which recalled the world of the 1950s. Comedy was also given new life in the irreverent ''[[Animal House]]'', set on a college campus during the 1960s. ''[[Up in Smoke]]'', starring [[Cheech &amp; Chong]], was another irreverent comedy about marijuana use became popular among teenagers. The new television comedy program, "[[Saturday Night Live]]", launched the careers of several of its comedians, such as [[Chevy Chase]], who co-starred in the 1978 hit ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' with [[Goldie Hawn]].

The decade closed with two films chronicling the [[Vietnam War]], [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''. Both films focused on the horrors of war and the psychological damage caused by such horrors. [[Christopher Walken]] and director [[Michael Cimino]] earned Oscars for their work on the film, which earned a Best Picture [[Academy Award]]. [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Meryl Streep]] were also nominated for their work in ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''. ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' won for cinematography and sound, and earned nominations for [[Robert Duvall]] and Coppola. [[Hal Ashby]]'s ''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'' portrayed life for Vietnam veterans. Actor [[Jon Voight]] won an [[Academy Award]] for his role in the film.

1979 saw the poignant ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', the inspiring ''[[Norma Rae]]'', and the nuclear thriller, ''[[The China Syndrome]]''. ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' scared summer film-going audiences of 1979 with its horrible monster from outer space, achieving similar success that Jaws had seen four years earlier. Meanwhile, ''[[The Onion Field]]'' and ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]'' focused on the failures of the American judicial system. The year ended with Hal Ashby's subtle black comedy ''[[Being There]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', a family film based on the [[Jim Henson]] puppet characters.

==Events==
The films in the 1970s came in many different varieties, as the socially conscious directors that emerged in the late 1960s grew in very different ways, influenced by music, literature, crime and war. The decade is most known for excelling in the crime-drama genre. The early part of the decade focused on increasingly realistic, gritty films, including [[Francis Ford Coppola|Coppola]]'s first two ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' pictures and [[Robert Altman]]'s [[black comedy]] ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''. A trend that lasted through the decade was the popularity of [[disaster film]]s, starting with ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' in 1970. Another trend was the birth of the blockbuster horror film, initiated by [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', which spawned numerous imitators. A pivotal moment in films was the release of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s first blockbuster hit, ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', which was considered to be the birth of the [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] motion picture (a trend sealed two years later with the release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''). The end of the decade saw two epic [[Vietnam War]] films, from directors [[Michael Cimino]] (''[[The Deer Hunter]]'') and Coppola (''[[Apocalypse Now]]'').

'''''A proper dyaloge betwene a Gentilman and a Husbandman eche complaynynge to other their miserable calamite through the ambicion of the clergye''''' was printed in two versions by "[[Hans Luft]]" (i.e., [[Johannes Hoochstraten]]) of [[Antwerp]] in 1529. This book appears in Robert Steele's list of books banned in Henry's reign; Steele refers to it as "Dialogue between gentleman &amp; plowman." While clearly in the [[Piers Plowman Tradition]], Piers does not appear as a character. The first version has a 684 line acrostic poem opening and dialogue that was written in the sixteenth-century invention. Following this, there is an authentic, late fourteenth-century [[Lollard]] anti-clerical text, written ca. 1375-85. (It is included in Matthew, ed. ''The English Works of Wyclif''.) To all this, the second version adds another prose tract probably from the late fifteenth century, which argues in favor of vernacular Bible translations. 

The dialogue begins with the gentleman lamenting how his class has fallen low and is unable to help the poor, because long ago they were fooled into giving their lands and wealth to the church. The husbandman then argues for confiscating the possessions of a corrupt clergy which preys upon the poor. Belief in [[purgatory]] and [[indulgences]] is singled out as the favorite swindle of the clergy, who are ultimately to blame for rising rents. The husbandman suggests taking the issue to parliament (the 1529 "Reformation Parliament"), but the gentleman demurs, alluding to [[Simon Fish]]'s ''[[A Supplicacyon for the Beggers]]'' and [[Thomas More]]'s rebuttal and defense of purgatory in ''[[The Supplycacyon of Soulys]]'' (1529). [[John I of England|King John]], [[Sir John Oldcastle]], and [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] are listed as good men who came to bad ends for opposing the clergy. Then there is an allusion to the burning of [[William Tyndale]]'s [[New Testament]] in 1526 and [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s persecution of Lollards. To defend [[Lutherans]] and opposition to clerical possessions from charges of "newfangledness," the husbandman introduces what he takes to be a century-old treatise; i.e., a late-fourteenth-century Lollard text that supports disendowment of the clergy and barring them from secular offices. (The husbandman places it in the time of Richard II.)

    Now I promyse the after my iudgement
    I haue not hard of soche an olde fragment
    Better groundyd on reason with Scripture.
    Yf soche auncyent thynges myght come to lyght
    That noble men hadde ones of theym a syght
    The world yet wolde chaunge perauenture
    For here agaynst the clergye cannot bercke
    Sayenge as they do thys is a newe wercke
    Of heretykes contryued lately.
    And by thys treatyse it apperyth playne
    That before oure dayes men did compleyne
    Agaynst clerkes ambycyon so stately.

The "I" of the husbandman at this point leads into the "I" of the Lollard treatise which is attached at the end with little done to make a transition; it is revised to function as contemporary anti-Roman polemic.

[[File:Launch of advertising campaign for visitors to 2014 World Cup in Johannesburg 2010-07-09 1.jpg|thumb|Launch of the advertising campaign for visitors to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]]]

An '''advertising campaign''' is a series of [[advertisement]] messages that share a single idea and theme which make up an [[marketing strategy|integrated marketing]] [[marketing communications|communication]] (IMC). An IMC is a platform in which a group of people can group their ideas, beliefs, and concepts into one large media base. Advertising campaigns utilize diverse media channels over a particular time frame and target identified audiences.  

The campaign theme is the central message that will be received in the promotional activities and is the prime focus of advertising campaign, as it sets the motif for the series of individual advertisements and other marketing communications that will be used. The campaign themes are usually produced with the objective of being used for a significant period but many of them are temporal due to factors like being not effective or market conditions, competition and [[marketing mix]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising and Promotion: an integrated marketing communications perspective|last1=Belch|first1=George|last2=Belch|first2=Michael,|first=|publisher=MacGraw-Hill/Irwin|year=2004|isbn=0078028973|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising campaigns are built to accomplish a particular objective or a set of objectives. Such objectives usually include establishing a brand, raising brand awareness, aggrandizing the rate of conversions/sales. The rate of success or failure in accomplishing these goals is reckoned via effectiveness measures.  There are 5 key points at which an advertising campaign must consider to ensure an effective campaign. These points are, integrated marketing communications, media channels, positioning, the communications process diagram and [[touch point]]s.

== Integrated marketing Communication: (IMC) ==

Integrated marketing communication (IMC) is a conceptual approach used by the majority of organizations to develop a strategic plan on how they are going to broadcast their marketing and advertising campaigns. Recently there has been a shift in the way marketers and advertisers interact with their consumers and now see it as a conversation between Advertising/ Marketing teams and consumers. IMC has emerged as a key strategy for organizations to manage customer experiences in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;"Integrated Marketing Communications - Medill - Northwestern University". ''www.medill.northwestern.edu''. Retrieved 24/ 3/16&lt;/ref&gt; The more traditional advertising practices such as newspapers, billboards, and magazines are still used but fail to have the same effect now as they did in previous years.

The importance of the IMC is to make the marketing process seamless for both the brand and the consumer. IMC attempts to meld all aspects of marketing into one cohesive piece. This includes sales promotion, advertising, public relations, direct marketing, and social media. The entire point of IMC is to have all of these aspects of marketing work together as a unified force. This can be done through methods, channels, and activities all while using a media platform. The end goal of IMC is to get the brands message across to consumers in the most convenient way possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thedma.org/membership/member-groups-communities/integrated-marketing-community/integrated-marketing-definitions/|title=Integrated Marketing Definitions - Definition of Integrated Marketing {{!}} thedma.org|work=thedma.org|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of using IMC are that it has the ability to communicate the same message through several channels to create brand awareness. IMC is the most cost-effective solution when compared to mass media advertising to interact with target consumers on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://igotit.com/en/page/about.html|title=Buying, selling, trading and connecting with local businesses|last=Shultz|first=Orion|date=1 July 2008|website=igotit.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMC also benefits small businesses, as they are able to submerge their consumers with communication of various kinds in a way that pushes them through the research and buying stages creating a relationship and dialogue with their new customer. Popular and obvious examples of IMC put into action are the likes of direct marketing to the consumer that the organisation already has a knowledge that the person is interested in the brand by gathering personal information about them from when they previously shopped there and then sending mail, emails, texts and other direct communication with the person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In-store sales promotions are tactics such as ‘30% off’ sales or offering loyalty cards to consumers to build a relationship. Television and radio advertisement are also a form of advertising strategy derived from IMC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of the components of IMC play an important role and a company may or may not choose to  implement any of the integration strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Don E.|last2=Schultz|first2=Heidi F.|date=1998-01-01|title=Transitioning marketing communication into the twenty-first century|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/135272698345852|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|volume=4|issue=1|pages=9–26|doi=10.1080/135272698345852|issn=1352-7266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media Channels ==

Media channels, also known as, marketing communications channels, are used to create a connection with the target consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pcl.stanford.edu/campaigns/|title=PCL: Political Campaigns|website=pcl.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional methods of communication with the consumer include newspapers, magazines, Radio, television, billboards, telephone, post and door to door sales. These are just a few of the historically traditional methods.

Along with traditional media channels, comes new and upcoming media channels. Social media has begun to play a very large role in the way media and marketing intermingle to reach a consumer base. Social media has the power to reach a wider audience. Depending on the age group and demographic, social media can influence a company's overall image. Using social media as a marketing tool has become a widely popular method for branding. A brand has the chance to create an entire social media presence based around their own specific targeted community. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.contentfac.com/9-reasons-social-media-marketing-should-top-your-to-do-list/|title=Why Social Media Marketing Is Important For Any Business|website=www.contentfac.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With advancements in digital communications channels, marketing communications allow for the possibility of two-way communications where an immediate consumer response can be elicited. Digital communications tools include: websites, blogs, social media, email, mobile, and search engines as a few examples. It is important for an advertising campaign to carefully select channels based on where their target consumer spends time to ensure market and advertising efforts are maximized.

== Modern day implications to the advantages &amp; disadvantages of traditional media channels ==
In the rapidly changing marketing and advertising environment, exposure to certain consumer groups and target audiences through traditional media channels has blurred. These traditional media channels are defined as print, broadcast, out-of-home and direct mail.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising: Strategy, Creativity and Media|last=Fill|first=Chris|last2=Hughes|first2=Graham|last3=De Francesco|first3=Scott|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=0273760890|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of various new modern-day media channels has altered their traditional advantages and disadvantages. It is imperative to the effectiveness of the Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) strategy that exposure to certain demographics, consumer groups and target audiences is anticipated to provide clarity, consistency, and maximum communications impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Marketing Communication: Maybe Definition Is in the Point of View|last=Schultz|first=D. E|publisher=Marketing News|year=1993|isbn=0324593600|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Print media is mainly defined as newspapers and magazines. With the transition in last decade [2006 – 2016] to digital information on phones, computers and tablets, the demographic that still are exposed to traditional print media is going to be older. It is also estimated that there will be a reduction of print material in coming years. This has to be taken into account by the advertisers and in some cases, they could use this to their advantage. Newspapers advantages would be that it is low cost, timely, reader controls exposure and has moderate coverage to the older generations in western society. Disadvantages would obviously be the aging demographic, short life, clutter and low attention-getting capabilities. Magazines are similar in some cases but have defined differences as they are a niche product increasing segmentation potential; they also have high informational content and longevity. Disadvantages are they are visual only, lack of flexibility and a long lead time for advertisement placement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Traditional broadcast media’s primary platforms are television and radio. These are still relatively prominent in modern-day society, but with the emergence of online content such as YouTube, Instagram and Vine it would difficult to anticipate where the market is headed in the next decade. Televisions advantages are that it has mass coverage, high reach, quality reputation, low post per exposure and impacts human senses. Disadvantages would be that it has low selectivity, short message life and high production costs. Alternatively, radio offers flexibility, high frequency and low advertising &amp; production costs. Disadvantages to radio are that its audio only, low attention-getting and short message.

Out-of-home (OOH) media a broad marketing concept that is no longer relegated to large, static billboards on the side of motorways. More current and innovative approaches to OOH media range from street furniture to aerial blimps. Due to the constant and contemporary nature of the outdoors there will always be new ways in which a campaign can revitalize this media channel. Advantages would be the accessibility and reach, geographic flexibility and relatively low cost. Disadvantages to OOH media are that it has a short life, difficult to measure / control and it can convey poor brand image.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Direct mail is classified as messages sent directly to consumers through the mail delivery service. One of the more ‘dated’ media channels and in the modern day has very little advantages, other than it is highly selective and has high information content. Disadvantages are that it promotes a poor brand image – junk mail and that it has a high cost to contact ratio.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Target Market ==
{{Manual|date=March 2017}}
When an organisation begins to construct their advertising campaign they need to research each and every aspect of their target market and target consumer. The target consumer is the person or group of people who is most likely to buy from an organisation, he is also called 'potential customer'. A target consumer can be categorized by several key characteristics; Gender, age, occupation, marital status, geographical location, behavioral,&lt;ref&gt;CBS(2014). ''Blue Jeans: The fabric of freedom.'' Retrieved December 8, 2016 from &lt;nowiki&gt;Https://www.youtube.com/watch?V=UzOGdtV-_4w&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; level of income and education to name the main factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/target-market|title=Target Market|last=Staff|first=Entrepreneur|website=Entrepreneur|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is called segmenting customers on the basis of demographics.

Gender is simply whether a person is male or female. Age is usually broken up into bracketed intervals of ten or so years, for example, a person's age between 15–25 years old. By understanding which age bracket the target market falls into the advertisers can position their efforts accordingly. Occupation is also known as a profession and refers to what a person does for a living; this could be a particular job, student, unemployed etc. A person’s marital status defines whether they are married or unmarried. Geographical location is a broad term specifying a particular area or place within a given country, state/ city, suburb or street as some examples. Income refers to how much money a person is earning annually which can help identify how much money they have left over after expenses to potential spend on a brand. The final factor to explain is education, whether a person went to school or not, what school they attended, what standard of education they have, diplomas, certificates, graduate, degrees, masters, Ph.D. or other forms of defining educational factors. Knowing this information can help an advertiser understand their target markets level of thinking to help adapt the advertising campaign to be understood by the given target consumer/s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

For a business to successfully find the appropriate Target Market for their products or services, it is important that they segment the market to better decide which customers to target. This is best done when the market is segmented into the four following areas: geographic, demographic, psychographic and behavioural.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Geographic segmentation involves the market being divided into different nations, regions, states, counties, cities, or neighbourhoods. Segmenting the Target market geographically is effective as different areas have different needs, which can be affected by weather, fashion, etc.

Demographic segmentation separates the market into groups according to age, gender, family size, income, occupation, education, religion, nationality, and race. It is important to note that this is the easiest and least expensive way to segment the market, as the research has already been done.

Psychographic segmentation is the process of markets being divided into groups based on social class, personality characteristics, and values.

Behavioural segmentation “divides a market into groups based on consumer knowledge, attitude, use, or response to a product” (Krause, T. 2007). This is believed to be the best starting point, when a business is building a market segment. The behavioural segment is important because it focuses on why consumers consume products. For example, during Father’s day and Mother’s day, flowers were promoted due to the heavy demand of flowers during these holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Target_Marketing.aspx|title=Target Marketing Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Target Marketing|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defining the target market helps businesses and individuals design a marketing campaign. This in turns helps businesses/ individuals avoid waste and get their advertisements to likely customers. While attempting to find the correct target market it is important to focus on specific groups of individuals that will benefit from your product. By marketing to specific groups of individuals that specifically relate to the product, businesses and individuals will more quickly and efficiently find those who will purchase the product. Businesses and individuals that monitor their existing data (customer and sales data) will find it easier to define their target market, and surveying existing customers will assist in finding more customers.  Avoiding inefficiencies when finding a target market is equally as important. Wasting time and money advertising to a large group of potential customers is inefficient if only a handful become customers. A focused plan that reaches a tiny audience can work out well if they’re already interested in what you’re selling. Over time target markets can change. People interested today might not be interested tomorrow, and those not interested in the present time, might become interested over time. Analysing sales data and customer information helps businesses and individuals understand when their target market is increasing or decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-defining-target-market-69728.html|title=The Importance of Defining a Target Market|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many advantages that are associated with finding your Target Market. One advantage is the “ability to offer the right product” (Suttle. R. 2016) through knowing the age and needs of the customer willing to purchase the item. Another advantage of Target Marketing assists businesses in understanding what price the customer will pay for the products or service. Businesses are also more efficient and effective at advertising their product, because they “reach the right consumers with messages that are more applicable” (Suttle. R. 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/broad-targeting-advantages-marketing-25610.html|title=The Broad Targeting Advantages in Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are several disadvantages that can be associated with Target Marketing. Firstly, finding your Target Market is expensive. Often businesses conduct primary research to find whom their Target Market is, which usually involves hiring a research agency, which can cost “tens of thousands of dollars” (Suttle, R. 2016). Finding ones Target Market is also time-consuming, as it often “requires a considerable amount of time to identify a target audience” (Suttle, R. 2016). Also focusing on finding your Target Market can make you overlook other customers that are interested in your product. Businesses/ Individuals may find that their ‘average customer’ might not include those that fall just outside of the average customers “demographics” (Suttle, R. 2016), which will limit the sale of their products. The last disadvantage to note is the ethical ramifications that are associated with Target Marketing. An example of this would be a “beer company that may target less educated, poorer people with larger-sized bottles” (Suttle, R. 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/disadvantages-target-marketing-36131.html|title=The Disadvantages of Target Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positioning ==
{{Confusing section|small=no|date=March 2017}}
In advertising various brands compete to overtake the perceptual mapping in a consumers mind. Everyday consumers view advertising and rank particular brands compared to their competitors. Individuals rank these specific brands in an order of what is most important to them. For example, a person may compare brands of cars based on how sporty they think they look, affordability, practicality and classiness. How one person perceives a brand is different to another but is largely left to the advertising campaign to manipulate and create the perception that they want you to envision as the consumer. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Positioning is an important marketing concept that businesses implement to market their products or services. The positioning concept focuses on creating an image that will best attract the intended audience.  Businesses that implement the positioning concept focus on promotion, price, placement and product. When the positioning concept is effective and productive it elevates the marketing efforts made by a business, and assists the buyer in purchasing the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/positioning-marketing-plan-22983.html|title=What Is Positioning in a Marketing Plan?|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The positioning process is imperative in marketing because of the specific level of consumer-based recognition is involved. A company must create a trademark brand for themselves in order to be recognizable by a broad range of consumers. For example, a fast food restaurant positions itself as fast, cheap, and delicious. They are playing upon their strengths and most visible characteristics. On the other hand a luxury car brand will position its brand as a stylish and expensive platform because they want to target a specific brand very different than the fast food brand. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://strategiccfo.com/market-positioning/|title=Market Positioning • The Strategic CFO|date=2013-07-24|work=The Strategic CFO|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the positioning concept to be effective one must focus on the concepts of promotion, price, place and product.

There are three basic objectives of promotion, which include: presenting product information to targeted business customers and consumers, increase demand among the target market, and differentiating a product and creating a brand identity. Tools that can be used to achieve these objectives are advertising, public relations, personal selling, direct marketing, and sales promotion.

Price of an object is crucial in the concept of positioning. Adjusting or decreasing the product price has a profound impact on the sales of the product, and should complement the other parts of the positioning concept. The price needs to ensure survival, increase profit, generate survival, gain market shares, and establish an appropriate image.

Positioning a product is essential in the positioning concept. It is the process marketers use to communicate their products’ attributes to the intended target market. In order for products to be successful businesses must focus on the customer needs, competitive pressures, available communication channels and carefully crafted key messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-product-positioning-marketing-plan-24275.html|title=The Importance of Product Positioning to the Marketing Plan|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Product Positioning presents several advantages in the advertising campaign, and to the businesses/ individuals that implement it. Positioning connects with superior aspects of a product and matches “them with consumers more effectively than competitors” (Jaideep, S. 2016). Positioning can also help businesses or individuals realise the consumer’s expectations of the product/s they are willing to purchase from them. Positioning a product reinforces the companies name, product and brand. It also makes the brand popular and strengthens customer loyalty. Product benefits to customers are better advertised through positioning the product, which results in more interest and attention of consumers. This also attracts different types of consumers as products posse’s different benefits that attract different groups of consumers, for example: a shoe that is advertised for playing sports, going for walks, hiking and casual wear will attract different groups of consumers. Another advantage of positioning is the competitive strength it gives to businesses/ individuals and their products, introducing new products successfully to the market and communicating new and varied features that are added to a product later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marketing/product/top-10-benefits-of-product-positioning/48605/|title=Top 10 Benefits of Product Positioning|website=YourArticleLibrary.com: The Next Generation Library|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication Process Diagram ==

The Communication of processes diagram refers to the order of operation an advertising campaign pieces together the flow of communication between a given organisation and the consumer. The diagram usually flows left to right (unless shown in a circular array) starting with the source. An advertising campaign uses the communication process diagram to ensure all the appropriate steps of communication are being taken in order.

The &lt;u&gt;source&lt;/u&gt; is the person or organisation that has a message they want to share with potential consumers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Belch,G., &amp; Belch, M. A. (2012) ''Advertisng and promotion: AN integrated marketing communication perspective'' (9th ed.) New York, NY: McGraw- Hill Irwin page 147- 158&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is Vodafone wanting to tell their consumers and new consumers of a new monthly plan.

The diagram then moves on to &lt;u&gt;encoding&lt;/u&gt; which consists of the organisation putting messages, thoughts and ideas into a symbolic form that be interpreted by the target consumer using symbols or words.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The third stage in the diagram is &lt;u&gt;channel message&lt;/u&gt;. This occurs when the information or meaning the source wants to convoy, is put into a form to easily be transmitted to the targeted audience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This also includes the method that communication gets from the source to the receiver. Examples of this is Vodafone advertising on TV, bus stops and university campuses as students may be the intended consumer for the new plan.

&lt;u&gt;Decoding&lt;/u&gt; is the processes that the viewer interprets the message that the source sent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Obviously it is up to the source to ensure that the message encoded well enough so that it is received as intended.

The &lt;u&gt;receiver&lt;/u&gt; is also known as the viewer or potential consumer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is the person who interprets the source message through channeling whether they are the intended target audience or not. Every day we interpret different advertisements even if we are not the target audience for that advertisement.

In between these steps there are external factors acting as distractions, these factors are called &lt;u&gt;noise&lt;/u&gt;. Noise distorts the way the message gets to the intended target audience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These distractions are from all other forms of advertising and communication from every other person or organisation. Examples of noise are State of mind, unfamiliar language, unclear message, Values, Attitudes, Perceptions, Culture and Knowledge of similar products or services to name a few forms of noise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Finally there is the &lt;u&gt;response or feedback&lt;/u&gt;. This is the &lt;u&gt;receiver’s&lt;/u&gt; reaction to the communication of message&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the way they understood it. &lt;u&gt;Feedback&lt;/u&gt; relates to the way sales react as well as the interest or questions that arise in relation to the message put out.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Touch Points ==

[[File:Customer journey with touchpoints English.png|thumb|Customer journey with touchpoints English]]
When considering touch points in an advertising campaign a brand looks Multisensory touch points. These touch points help the brand to develop a point of contact between themselves and the consumer. Modern day advancements in various forms of technology have made it easier for consumers to engage with brands in numerous ways. The most successful touch points are those that create value in the consumer and brands relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Persson, J. (n.d.). ''Brand TouchPoint'' ''Matrix''. Retrieved March 19, 2016 from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://brandtouchpointmatrix.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of touch points include social media links, QR codes, person handing out flyers about a particular brand, billboards, web sites and various other methods that connect the brand and consumer.

Multi sensory touch points are subconscious yet helps use to recognise brands through characteristic identified through human sensors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Heath, R., Brandt, D., &amp; Nairn, A. (2006). Brand relationships: Strengtheng. by emotion, weakened by attention. ''Journal of Advertising Research, 46''(4), 410-419.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics could be shape, colour, textures, sounds, smell or tastes associated with a given brand.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is important for an advertising campaign to consider sensory cues into their campaign as market places continue to become increasingly competitive and crowded. Anyone of the given sensory characteristics may remind a person of the brand they best associate with. A prime example of this is Red Bull who use the colour, shapes and size of their cans to best relate their product to success and winning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A taller can looks like the 1st place podium when placed next to competitors, the design looks like the finish flag in racing representing winning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The opportunity for an advertising campaign to succeed is significantly increased with the use of multi sensory touch points used as a point of difference between brands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Guerrilla marketing==

Guerrilla marketing is an advertising strategy which increases brand exposure through the use of unconventional campaigns which initiate social discussion and "buzz". This can often be achieved with lower budgets than conventional advertising methods, allowing small and medium-sized businesses the chance to compete against larger competitors. Through unconventional methods, inventiveness and creativity, guerrilla marketing leaves the receiver with a long lasting impression of the brand as most guerrilla marketing campaigns target the receivers at a personal level, taking them by surprise and may incorporate an element of shock. Guerrilla marketing is typically executed exclusively in public places, including streets, parks, shopping centres etc., to ensure maximum audience resulting in further discussion on social media.&lt;ref&gt;Hutter, K., &amp; Hoffmann, S. (2011). Guerrilla marketing: The nature of the concept and propositions for further research. Asian Journal of Marketing, 5(2), 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla marketing is the term used for several types of marketing categories including street marketing, ambient marketing, presence marketing, alternative marketing, experimental marketing, grassroots marketing, wild posting, guerrilla projection advertising, undercover marketing and [[astroturfing]].{{cn|date=August 2016}}

Jay Conrad Levinson coined the term ''Guerrilla Marketing'' with his 1984 book of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Paksoy, T &amp; Chang, C. (2010). Applied Mathematical Modelling. Revised multi-choice goal programming for multi-period, multi-stage inventory controlled supply chain model with popup stores in Guerrilla marketing, 34(34), 3586-3587&lt;/ref&gt; Through the enhancement of technology and common use of internet and mobile phones, marketing communication has become more affordable and guerrilla marketing is on the rise, allowing the spread of newsworthy guerrilla campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kolegjifama.eu/materialet/Biblioteka%20Elektronike/Chaotics%20The%20Business%20of%20Managing%20and%20Marketing%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Turbulence.pdf|title=Chaotics - The Business of Managing and Marketing in the Age of Turbulance.|author1=Kotler, P  |author2=Caslione, J|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When establishing a guerrilla marketing strategy, there are seven elements to a clear and logical approach.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 1989"&gt;Levinson, J. (1989). Guerrilla Marketing Attack – New Stratigies, Tactics and Weapson for Winning Big Profits for your Small Business). Boston, United States of America: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, write a statement that identifies the purpose of the strategy. Secondly define how the purpose will be achieved concentrating on the key advantages. Next Levinson (1989) suggests writing a descriptive summary on the target market or consumers. The fourth element is to establish a statement that itemizes the marketing tools and methods planning to be used in the strategy (for example, radio advertising during 6.30am – 9am on weekday mornings or window displays that are regularly updated). The fifth step is to create a statement which positions the brand/product/company in the market. Define the brands characteristics and give it an identity is the sixth element. Lastly, clearly identify a budget which will be put solely towards marketing going forward.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 1989"/&gt;

For a successful overall guerrilla marketing campaign, combine the above steps with seven winning actions.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrilla Marketing Attack – New Stratigies, Tactics and Weapons for Winning Big Profits for your Small Business). Boston, United States of America: Houghton Mifflin Company.  p39&lt;/ref&gt; These seven principles are commitment – stick to the marketing plan without changing it; investment – appreciate that marketing is an investment, consistency – ensure the marketing message and strategy remains consistent across all forms of, confidence – show confidence in the commitment to the guerrilla marketing strategy, patience – time and dedication to the strategy, assortment – incorporate different methods of advertising and marketing for optimum results, and subsequent – build customer loyalty and retention though follow up marketing post-sale.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 1989"/&gt;

Levinson suggests guerrilla marketing tactics were initiated to enable small businesses with limited financial resources to gain an upper hand on the corporate giants who had unlimited budgets and resources at their disposal. Large companies cottoned on to the success of guerrilla marketing and have had hundreds of effective attention grabbing campaigns using the strategies originally designed for smaller businesses with minimal marketing budgets.&lt;ref&gt;McNaughton, M. (2008). Guerrilla communication, visual consumption, and consumer public relations. Public Relations Review, 34(1), 303-305.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-traditional, unconventional and shocking campaigns are highly successful in obtaining media coverage and therefore brand awareness, albeit good or bad media attention. However, like most marketing strategies a bad campaign can backfire and damage profits and sales.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 2010"&gt;Levinson, J. &amp; Gibson, S. (2010). Guerrilla Social Media Marketing: 100+ Weapons to Grow Your Online Influence, Attract Customers, and Drive Profits. California, United States of America: Entrepreneur Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Undercover marketing and astroturfing are two type of guerrilla marketing that are deemed as risky and can be detrimental to the company.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 2010"/&gt;

“Advertising can be dated back to 4000 BC where Egyptians used papyrus to make sales messages and wall posters. Traditional advertising and marketing slowly developed over the centuries but never bloomed until early 1900s” ("What Is Guerrilla Marketing?", 2010). Guerrilla marketing are relatively simple, use tactics to advertise on a very small budget. It is to make a campaign that is “shocking, funny, unique, outrageous, clever and creative that people can’t stop talking about it” (Uk essays, 2016). Guerrilla marketing is different when compared to traditional marketing tactics (Staff, 2016).  “Guerrilla marketing means going after conventional goals of profits, sales and growth but doing it by using unconventional means, such as expanding offerings during gloomy economic days to inspire customers to increase the size of each purchase” (Staff, 2016).  Guerrilla marketing also suggests that rather than investing money, it is better to “invest time, energy, imagination and knowledge” (Staff, 2016) instead. Guerrilla marketing puts profit as their main priority not sales as their main focal point, this is done to urge the growth of geometrically by enlarging the size of each transactions. This all done through one of the most powerful marketing weapons around, the telephone. Research shows that it will always increases profits and sales. The term “guerrilla first appeared during the war of independence in Spain and Portugal at the beginning of the 19th century it can be translated as battle” (Uk essays, 2016).  Even thou guerrilla marketing was aimed for small business; this did not stop bigger business from adopting the same ideology. “Larger business has been using unconventional marketing to complement their advertising campaigns, even then some marketers argue that when bigger business utilize guerrilla marketing tactics, it isn’t true guerrilla” ("What Is Guerrilla Marketing?", 2010).  The reason being that larger companies have bigger budgets and usually their brands well established.  In some cases, it is far riskier for a larger business to do guerrilla marketing tactics. Which can cause problem when their stunts become a flop when compared to smaller business, as they do not run as much risk, as most people will just write it off as another failed stunt.  Many methods in guerrilla marketing consist of “graffiti (or reverse graffiti, where a dirty wall is selectively cleaned), interactive displays, intercept encounters in public spaces, flash mobs, or various PR stunts are often used” ("Guerrilla Marketing | What is Guerrilla Marketing?” 2016).

Small business use social media as a form of marketing. This Is due to that social media in the 21st century is phenomenon. “Collecting billions of people around the world through a series of status updates, tweets, and other rich media” ("Guerrilla Marketing Strategies for Small Businesses", 2013). Social media is a powerful tool in the world of business. Guerrilla marketing strategies and tactics are a great and cost effective way to generate” awareness for your business, products and services. To maximize full potential in your marketing efforts, it’s to blend them with a powerful and robust online marking strategy with a marketing automation software” ("Guerrilla Marketing Strategies for Small Businesses", 2013). Which can boost small businesses. Guerrilla tactics consist of instruments that have effects on the efforts. Some instruments are usually there to maximize the surprise effect and some of these instruments mainly cutting advertising costs.” Guerrilla marketing is a way of increasing the number of individuals exposed to the advertising with the cost of campaign. The instrument of diffusion helps to each a wide audience, which causes none or little cost because consumers (viral marketing) or the media (guerrilla PR) pass on the advertising message” ("Guerrilla Marketing: The Nature of the Concept and Propositions for Further Research", 2016).  Guerrilla campaigns usually implement a free ride approach, this means that to cut their costs and increase the number of recipients simultaneously to maximize the low cost effect. For example, they will try to benefit from placing advertisements on big events e.g. sporting events. Guerrilla marketing was regarded to target existing customers rather than new ones, aiming to increase their engagement with a product and/ or brand. “When selecting audiences for a guerrilla message, a group that is already engaged with the product at some level is the best target; they will be quicker to recognize and respond to creative tactics, and more likely to share the experience with their friends, as social media has become a major feature of the market landscape, guerrilla marketing has shown to be particularly effective online. Consumers who regularly use social media are more likely to share their interactions with guerrilla marketing, and creative advertising can quickly go viral” ("Guerrilla Marketing | What is Guerrilla Marketing?", 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Guerrilla Marketing | What is Guerrilla Marketing?.

[[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]] flies over the [[Andes]] on October 13, 1972. The raucous rugby players and a few of their relatives and friends are eagerly looking forward to an upcoming match in Chile.

Upon emerging from clouds, the plane encounters turbulence and collides with a mountain. The wings and tail are separated from the fuselage, which slides down a mountain slope before coming to a stop. Six passengers and one flight attendant are ejected from the plane and die. Antonio, the team captain, coordinates efforts to help the injured. [[Roberto Canessa]] and [[Gustavo Zerbino]], both medical students, aid the injured. Another six passengers soon die, including both pilots and Nando's mother, Eugenia. Nando, who sustained a head injury, falls into a coma, and his sister Susana has suffered harsh internal injuries.

As the sun sets, the survivors make preparations for the night. Canessa discovers that the seat covers can be unzipped and used as blankets. The survivors go inside the fuselage and curl up beside one another to stay warm. Antonio, [[Roy Harley]], and Rafael Cano plug the gaping hole at the end of the fuselage with luggage to keep out the wind. Two passengers die overnight. With nothing to hunt or gather on the mountain, Antonio declares they will use rationing when the survivors find a tin of chocolates and a case of wine. After seeing a plane fly past, they think it dips its wing, and the survivors celebrate. Expecting to be rescued the next day, everyone except Javier, his wife Liliana, and Antonio eat the remaining chocolates. This causes a quarrel among Antonio and several others.

Nando regains consciousness. After learning of his mother's death, Nando watches over Susana vigilantly. Knowing she will die of her injuries within a few days, he vows to set off on foot and find a way out of the mountains. When Carlitos reminds him that he will need food, Nando suggests eating the flesh of the deceased pilots to give him the strength to survive the journey to find help. Susana dies from her injuries. The survivors listen to a radio for word of their rescue but are devastated to hear the search called off after nine days.

After great debate, the starving passengers decide to eat the flesh of their dead relatives and friends. Zerbino, Rafael, and Juan Martino set off to search for the tail of the plane in hopes of finding batteries for the plane's radio to transmit their location. Among pieces of the wreckage, the teammates find additional corpses, but return to the group with news that the tail of the plane is likely a little farther away. Later in the week, an avalanche strikes the plane and fills much of the interior with snow. Eight of the survivors are smothered by the snow or freeze to death. A second team, made up of Nando, Canessa, and [[Antonio Vizintin|Antonio "Tintin" Vizintin]], sets out and find the tail of the plane. Unable to bring the batteries to the fuselage, they return to the fuselage to get Roy, who is thought to have experience with electrical equipment. They bring him to the tail of the plane to see whether he can fix the radio. When Roy is unsuccessful, the team returns to the fuselage.

Federico and Alberto die from their injuries, as does Rafael, leading Nando to convince a reluctant Canessa to search for a way out of the mountains, taking Tintin with them. Two days into the journey, they send Tintin back to the fuselage so they can appropriate his rations and continue on their own. After a 12-day trek, the two escape the mountains and alert the authorities of their companions' location. As helicopters land on the mountain, the remaining 14 survivors celebrate.

In the present, Carlitos describes how the survivors later returned to the site of the crash and buried the corpses under a pile of stones, marked with a cross. The memorial to the 29 deceased and 16 survivors is shown.

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 64% of 25 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.3/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1042538-alive/ | title=Alive Movie Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate = 2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' said that, while, "Piers Paul Read's acclaimed book ... paid special attention to the social structure that evolved among the group ... Marshall ... downplays the fascinating sociological details—and the ambiguities of character—in favor of action, heroism and a vague religiosity that's sprinkled over the story like powdered sugar."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/116009 | title=Hot And Cold Survival Skills Newsweek.com | publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' |date= January 18, 1993 | first=David | last=Ansen  | accessdate =2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Ray Green, praised the tactful nature of the film stating that, "despite the potential for lurid sensationalism, Marshall manages to keep his and the film's dignity by steering an effectively downbeat course through some grim goings on thanks in no small manner to the almost allegorical ring of Shanley's stylized dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;Green, Ray. "Alive." ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Box Office]]'' (March 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  Green continues by describing the film as, "thrilling and engrossing as it is at times, ''Alive'' is more than an action film—in its own way it is also a drama of ideas, and of the human spirit as well."

[[Roger Ebert]] wrote "There are some stories you simply can't tell. The story of the Andes survivors may be one of them."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19930115/REVIEWS/301150301/1023 | title=Alive Review | publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |date= January 15, 1993 | first=Roger | last=Ebert  | accessdate =2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also questioned the realism of how normal the actors' bodies looked after portraying two months of near starvation.&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt;

==Documentary==
A companion documentary, ''[[Alive: 20 Years Later]]'', was released at the same time as the film. It includes interviews with the survivors, as well as documentary footage of the rescue. The 30th Anniversary Edition of ''Alive: The Miracle of the Andes'' (on DVD) includes this documentary in the ''Extras'' section.

'''Art history''' is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts; that is [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-potts/what-history-art|title=What is the History of Art? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;www.arthistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012). [https://www.academia.edu/1841926/Evocative_Research_in_Art_History_and_Beyond_Imagining_Possible_Pasts_in_the_Ways_to_Heaven_Project Evocative Research in Art History and Beyond: Imagining Possible Pasts in the Ways to Heaven Project], Digital Creativity, 23, 1, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of prominent methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main article|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===

Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). "Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.
Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Feminist art history===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.

While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical "re-reading" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum studies and collecting===
Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New materialism===
Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor–network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.

===Nationalist art history===
The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one’s country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country’s identity.

Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s [[Lives of the Artists]] is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht Dürer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.

Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country’s own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

"Contemporary art history" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''artist cooperative''' (also [[co-operative]] or co-op) is an autonomous [[visual arts]] organization, enterprise, or association jointly owned and democratically controlled by its members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html International Co-operative Alliance ''Statement on the Co-operative Identity''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204081503/http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html |date=2012-02-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist cooperatives are legal entities organized as non-capital stock [[corporations]], [[non-profit organizations]], or [[voluntary association|unincorporated associations]]. Such cooperatives typically provide professional facilities and services for its artist-members, including studios, workshops, equipment, exhibition galleries, and educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/cooperatives/whatis.html#arts Small Farm Center, University of California] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305050618/http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/cooperatives/whatis.html#arts |date=March 5, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By design, all economic and non-economic benefits and liabilities of the cooperative are shared equally among its members.

It is located near the Black Sea. The museum offers contemporary art and traditional handcrafts.  The basic aim of the foundation is, as quoted by founder Professor Hüsamettin Koçan, to "disseminate art and culture by bringing together contemporary and traditional art, to collect, document, classify, preserve and promote works of contemporary and traditional art, to use this base in realizing creation, and to hand local and national cultural values down to future generations" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.baksi.org/about-baksi/what-kind-of-museum.aspx?lvl1=1|title=Baksı Müzesi|website=en.baksi.org|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
The museum was the idea of the painter and academic Professor [[Hüsamettin Koçan]], who decided to build a museum in his hometown in the [[Black Sea]] region of Bayburt.&lt;ref name=hur&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanat|first=Milliyet|title=Black Sea museum combines Turkish crafts, contemporary art|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=traditional-and-the-contemporary-combines-2010-07-14|accessdate=2014-03-09|newspaper=Huriyet Daily News|date=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum was opened in July, 2010, after taking approximately 20 years of preparation. Professor Hüsamettin Koçan said, “I didn’t do this for my own village, I did it for the people who live in my village and everywhere.”

'''''Better Out Than In''''' was a residency undertaken by [[pseudonym]]ous [[graffiti artist]] and political activist [[Banksy]] in [[New York City]] during October 2013. Banksy unveiled at least one work of art daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an [[Instagram]] account. The majority of the works were [[stencil graffiti]] and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with [[dark humor]] and [[Political satire|satire]].

The unpredictability of the show and Banksy's elusive nature stirred excitement amongst fans, while [[Defacement (vandalism)|defacement]] from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official complaints were reported to the police; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. 

An HBO documentary film covering this period and residency titled ''[[Banksy Does New York]]'' was released in 2014.

==Background==
On 1 October 2013, Banksy announced on his website that he would be attempting to host a show in New York City for the entire month. This came after posters promoting an October event started showing up in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vankin|first=Deborah|title=Banksy show to take place in New York -- but where is Banksy now?|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-banksy-chinatown-but-where-is-banksy-now20131001,0,6799862.story|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes_announcement&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryzik|first=Melena|title=Banksy Announces a Monthlong Show on the Streets of New York|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/banksy-announces-a-monthlong-show-on-the-streets-of-new-york/|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ''Better Out Than In'' is a reference to a quote by [[impressionist]] [[Paul Cézanne]], "All pictures painted inside, in the studio, will never be as good as those done outside."&lt;ref name=cbs_lookout&gt;{{cite web|title=New Yorkers On The Lookout For Banksy Street Art Creations|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/06/new-yorkers-on-the-lookout-for-banksy-street-art-creations/|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Village Voice]]'', Banksy said "New York calls to graffiti writers like a dirty old lighthouse. We all want to prove ourselves here," and that he chose it for the high foot traffic and hiding places.&lt;ref name=village_interview&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Keegan|title=Village Voice Exclusive: An Interview With Banksy, Street Art Cult Hero, International Man of Mystery|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-10-09/art/banksy-better-out-than-in-new-york-residency-street-art-graffiti/full/|work=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works Banksy has included in ''Better Out Than In'' primarily consist of [[stencil graffiti]], much of which are political in nature. His first installment, which he captioned "the street is in play", depicted a child reaching for a bottle of spray paint on a sign reading "graffiti is a crime".&lt;ref name=usnews&gt;{{cite web|last=Sneed|first=Tierney|title=So How Is Banksy's New York Street Art Spree Going?|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/08/so-how-is-banksys-new-york-street-art-spree-going|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign was stolen and later replaced by [[Queens]]-based graffiti group [[Smart Crew]] with a new sign that read "street art is a crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chung|first=Jen|title=Smart Crew Sorta Recreated Banksy's Stencil After Sign Was "Stolen"|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/smart_crew_sorta_recreated_banksys.php#photo-2|work=[[Gothamist]]|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000804/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/smart_crew_sorta_recreated_banksys.php#photo-2|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of his other works, the piece has audio accompaniment that can be heard either on the website or by calling a toll-free 800 number.&lt;ref name=nydaily_les&gt;{{cite news|last=Stebner|first=Beth|title=Street artist Banksy gets political in latest Lower East Side work|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-political-latest-les-work-article-1.1480889|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], Banksy's fifth work was housed in a delivery truck as a "mobile garden," which included [[theatrical property]] showing a rainbow, waterfall, and butterflies. The following day Banksy posted a photo of a tracking device he found under the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Shirley|title=Banksy watch: The street artist's latest works -- and defacements|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/10/11/banksy-street-art-new-york-tour/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeveloff|first=Julie|title=Banksy's 5th Work In New York Will Be A 'Mobile Waterfall' Inside A Delivery Truck|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/banksy-garden-inside-a-delivery-truck-2013-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banksy's installments are located all across the [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]], with some being purely [[Multimedia art|multimedia exhibits]]. On 6 October, as a way to have made an installment in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]], a primary arts district of the city, Banksy posted a video featuring the [[Walt Disney]] character [[Dumbo]] being shot down by [[Syrian]] rebels, the meaning behind which puzzled many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunning|first=Jennifer|title=Banksy kills Dumbo in new video showing Syrian rebels shooting down elephant|url=http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/yourcommunity/2013/10/banksy-kills-dumbo-in-new-video-showing-syrian-rebels-shooting-down-elephant.html|work=CBC News|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"Hammer Boy" Banksy in Upper West Side October 2013.jpg|thumb|left|''Hammer Boy'' was the 20th installment, located on the [[Upper West Side]]. Utilizing an existing [[siamese connection]] fire hydrant, it depicts a child playing a [[high striker]].]]

On 9 October, Banksy unveiled one of the more elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side. Instead of commentary about the work, the accompanying audio was that of a classified video from the [[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike]].&lt;ref name="nydaily_les" /&gt; After being dismantled, the car was towed away to prevent further defacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlson|first=Jen|title=Photos: LES Banksy Car Has Been Towed To A Safe Place|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/photos_les_banksy_being_dismantled.php#photo-1|work=Gothamist|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018051843/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/photos_les_banksy_being_dismantled.php#photo-1|archivedate=18 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day 11 saw an elaborate political display questioning the "casual cruelty" of the meat industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hubbard|first=Amy|title='Sirens of the Lambs': Banksy fills slaughterhouse truck with toys|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-banksy-sirens-of-the-lambs-20131014,0,4832074.story|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''Sirens of the Lambs'', Banksy drove around a military-style cargo truck filled with squealing, stuffed animatronic livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Raillan|title=Banksy Day 11: A Truck Full of Very Loud Stuffed Animals In the Meatpacking District|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/10/banksy_day_11_sirens_of_the_lambs.php|work=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015150158/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/10/banksy_day_11_sirens_of_the_lambs.php|archivedate=15 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The truck fittingly made its debut in [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan]], but toured the rest of the city in the following weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeveloff|first=Julie|title=Banksy Unleashes A Creepy Slaughterhouse Delivery Truck On The Meatpacking District|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/banksy-truck-filled-with-stuffed-animals-2013-10|work=Business Insider|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October, Banksy made headlines when it was revealed that the art an older man was selling outside [[Central Park]] was actually authentic, signed Banksy canvases, sold for only $60 each.&lt;ref name="nytimes_race"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=Racing to See Banksy Graffiti, While It Can Still Be See|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/nyregion/racing-to-see-banksy-graffiti-while-it-can-still-be-seen.html?_r=0|work=New York Times|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having not announced this beforehand, tourists and park goers were unaware of the value the paintings had, which the BBC estimated could be upwards of $32,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Banksy stall sells art works for $60 in New York|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24518315|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=20 October 2013|date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banksy posted a video on his website chronicling the surprise sale, which revealed that a total of seven paintings were sold for $420 taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/banksy-sold-original-artwork-60-nyc-20562101 |title=Banksy: I Sold Original Artwork for $60 in NYC - ABC News |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date= |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/14/living/banksy-street-art-sale/?hpt=hp_c3 |title=Graffiti artist Banksy says he offered $60 paintings in Central Park - CNN.com |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banksy unveiled one of his most controversial pieces of the series on 15 October, with a depiction of the [[Lower Manhattan]] skyline featuring the former [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|Twin Towers]], with a burnt-orange [[chrysanthemum]] in place where one of the hijacked airplanes struck the North Tower.&lt;ref name=nytimes_race /&gt;&lt;ref name=mirroruk&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Natalie|title=Banksy in New York: Twin Towers graffiti with orange flower 'explosion' is latest controversial street art installation|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/banksy-new-york-twin-towers-2459315|work=Mirror News|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silhouette appeared on the side of a building in [[TriBeCa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeveloff|first=Julie|title=Banksy Pays Homage To The Twin Towers In Today's Artwork|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/banksy-pays-homage-to-the-twin-towers-2013-10|work=Business Insider|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an identical depiction along the [[Brooklyn Heights Promenade]], facing the downtown skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Banksy Reveals 9/11 Tribute Piece In New York City|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/15/banksy-911-tribute_n_4101204.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|first=Priscilla|last=Frank|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brooklyn Heights piece was eventually buffed out by the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City ‘cleans up’ after Banksy art|url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/17/city-cleans-up-after-banksy-art/|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring chemicals and a high-powered pressure washer.

Banksy extended his work beyond the canvas and city street with other political statements, including on 16 October, when he crafted a giant [[fiberglass]] sculpture of [[Ronald McDonald]], with a real live Banksy assistant shining its shoes. It was unveiled in [[the Bronx]] but was moved outside of a different [[McDonald's]] restaurant across the city around lunch time for several days. The work criticized the "heavy labor required to sustain the polished image of a mega-corporation", as the narrator of the audio accompaniment put it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant |first=Drew |url=http://observer.com/2013/10/banksys-ronald-mcdonald-statue-and-live-shoeshine-boy-take-manhattan/ |title=Banksy Unveils 'Shoeshine Boy' at McDonald's &amp;#124; The New York Observer |publisher=[[The New York Observer]]|date=16 October 2013 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeane MacIntosh, Larry Celona and Bruce Golding |url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/16/banksy-clowns-around-in-new-work/ |title=Banksy zings McDonald’s &amp;#124; New York Post |publisher=New York Post |date=16 October 2013 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October there was a pair of paintings that Banksy collaborated on with Os Gemeos depicting a single soldier amongst masked citizens and vice versa. "The audio commentary Banksy provided suggests that this piece functions both as situational criticism of the art world as well as a tribute to the Occupy movement. Yet it also recognizes that the installation may be unsuccessful at actually advancing any agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Banksy In New York|last = Mock|first = Ray|publisher = Carnage NYC|year = |isbn = 978-0-9906437-0-8|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banksy's second trip to the [[South Bronx]] was on 21 October and resulted in a piece depicting a child spray-painting the words "Ghetto 4 Life" on a wall, while a butler waited on him with a platter of spray paints. The work immediately drew a crowd from fans, despite angering many residents, who found the message offensive.&lt;ref name=independent_bronx&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyatt|first=Daisy|title=Banksy upsets Bronx residents with 'Ghetto 4 Life' graffiti|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/banksy-upsets-bronx-residents-with-ghetto-4-life-graffiti-8898535.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2 November 2013|location=London|date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx&gt;{{cite news|last=Scarborough|first=Joey|title=Banksy’s latest work annoys Bronx residents|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/banksy-ghetto-4-life-work-offends-article-1.1492198|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sphinx sculpture appeared on a worksite in [[Willets Point, Queens|Willets Point]] on 22 October, entitled ''Everything but the kitchen sphinx'', and was quickly swarmed by eager Banksy fans. The attention caught the workers interest, who were reportedly selling bricks for $100 each, and onlookers watched as it was loaded into a truck and taken away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/22/who_owns_the_queens_banksy_sculptur.php#photo-1|title=Who "Owns" The Queens Banksy Sculpture?|work=Gothamist|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesledger.com/stories/2015/22/banksy_2015_05_29_q.html|title=A Queens’ creation by street artist Banksy resurfaces in New York|work=TimesLedger|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fate of this piece was heavily chronicled by the HBO documentary ''[[Banksy Does New York]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2014/11/things-we-learned-from-the-banksy-takes-new-york-hbo-documentary/sphinx|title=15 Things We Learned From the "Banksy Does New York" HBO Documentary The Sphinx piece at Willets Point in Queens was lifted by mechanics in the area who were about to lose their business.|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was taken from its original site, kept in a garage and later appeared in the Art Miami New York modern art fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesledger.com/stories/2015/22/banksy_2015_05_29_q.html|title=A Queens’ creation by street artist Banksy resurfaces in New York|work=TimesLedger|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"Waiting in Vain" Banksy in Hells Kitchen October 2013.jpg|thumb|left|''Waiting in Vain'', Banksy's 24th installment outside a [[Hustler Club]] in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].]]

The 23rd installment was cancelled due to police activity, according to Banksy's official website, which stirred rumors that he had come under arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yakas|first=Ben|title=Today's New Banksy Was...Cancelled By Police Activity|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/23/photos_new_banksy_piece_goes_up_in.php|work=Gothamist|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026041501/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/23/photos_new_banksy_piece_goes_up_in.php|archivedate=26 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, an outlined canvas with the caption "Better Out Than In #AnonymousGuestbook" appeared on a building in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]]. The idea of an open-canvas collaborative piece was presented to Banksy two weeks prior by a community art director. The story then led many to believe the "anonymous guestbook" was outlined by Banksy himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Sasha|title=Banksy gets help from budding Michelangelos with Red Hook Art Project|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/red-hook-kids-pitch-bansky-article-1.1494689|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this was later debunked to have been the work of a group under the name Anonymous Guestbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cush|first=Andy|title=SORRY, THE "ANONYMOUS GUESTBOOK" ISN’T BANKSY|url=http://animalnewyork.com/2013/sorry-the-anonymous-guestbook-isnt-banksy/|work=Animal New York|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Waiting in Vain'' was the show's 24th installment. Located outside a [[strip club]] in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], it illustrated a man in a [[tuxedo]] holding flowers, presumably jilted by his date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bucktin|first=Christopher|title=Banksy is back!

It is planned to go on permanent display inside the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heins|first=Scott|title=Photos, Video: The Night They Drove Old Banksy Down|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/banksy_hustler_club_stripper_video.php|work=Gothamist|accessdate=23 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112052/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/banksy_hustler_club_stripper_video.php|archivedate=10 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 25th piece came suitably [[Halloween]]-themed. Located on the [[Bowery]], it exhibited a [[Grim Reaper]] riding a [[bumper car]] in circles to an elaborate light show, [[fog machine]] and [[Blue Öyster Cult]]'s "[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]."&lt;ref name=daily_reaper&gt;{{cite news|last=Stebner|first=Beth|title=Banksy on the Bowery: Artist debuts spooky Grim Reaper that thrills New Yorkers|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-bowery-artist-debuts-spooky-grim-reaper-article-1.1497493|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mocking interpretation, with Banksy stating that often "the role of art is to remind us of our mortality," implying that with this mounted art show that goes on "for so long we wish we were dead already."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dodero |first=Camille |title=Banksy's Newest NYC Installation: The Grim Reaper in a Bumper Car |url=http://gawker.com/banksys-newest-nyc-installation-the-grim-reaper-in-a-1452430639 |work=[[Gawker]] |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030090617/http://gawker.com/banksys-newest-nyc-installation-the-grim-reaper-in-a-1452430639 |archivedate=30 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months. This prompted other interpretations of the installation's message, paying homage to the "ghosts of Bowry," as the antique store owner suggested.&lt;ref name=daily_reaper /&gt;

The 27 October piece was a message on a wall in Greenpoint that read "This site contains blocked messages." It made reference to an unpublished column Banksy had submitted to ''[[The New York Times]]''. The controversial essay criticized the city's decision in approving the [[One World Trade Center]], which he described as "vanilla" and looking like "something they would build in Canada."&lt;ref name=cnn_wtc&gt;{{cite news|last=Draznin|first=Haley|title=Banksy calls One World Trade Center a "betrayal"|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/28/us/banksy-world-trade-center-editorial/index.html|work=CNN|accessdate=3 November 2013|date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moya-Smith|first=Simon|title=British street artist Banksy trashes design of One World Trade Center|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/27/21194968-british-street-artist-banksy-trashes-design-of-one-world-trade-center|work=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what became his second reference to the [[September 11 attacks]], Banksy argued the building was a betrayal to everyone who lost their lives that day, and that its blandness is a sign the terrorist won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Connor|title=Banksy Really Hates the New World Trade Center Building|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/10/banksy-really-hates-new-world-trade-center-building/70980/|work=[[The Atlantic Wire]]|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final piece of the month-long series was a group of balloons that together read "BANKSY!", tied to the wall of a building alongside the [[Long Island Expressway]] in Queens. Banksy included the message "Save [[5 Pointz|5pointz]]" in the caption for the piece on his website, referring to 5 Pointz, a nearby outdoor art exhibit considered to be a focal point of such culture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyette|first=Chris|title=Banksy bids farewell to New York with balloons|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/us/new-york-banksy-residency-ends/|work=CNN|accessdate=3 November 2013|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had recently been approved by the [[New York City Department of City Planning]] to be [[5 Pointz#Demolition plans|demolished]] to make way for condominiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5Pointz Not Alone: City Planning Commission Also Approves Huge Hallets Point Project|url=http://queens.brownstoner.com/2013/08/the-city-planning-commission-votes-for-big-changes-in-queens-today/|work=brownstoner.com|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defacement==
{{Main|Works by Banksy damaged or destroyed}}
Most of the works that make up the ''Better Out Than In'' series were [[Defacement (vandalism)|defaced]], some just hours after the piece was unveiled.&lt;ref name=nytimes_welcome&gt;{{cite news|title=Banksy’s New York Welcome|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/opinion/banksys-new-york-welcome.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Janeczko|first=Jane|title=Banksy Piece In Queens Defaced By Other Graffiti Artists|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/15/banksy-destroyed_n_4101145.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one defacement was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Janeczko|first=Jane|title=Banksy Hater, OMAR NYC, Defaces Art In Red Hook|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/08/banksy-hater-defaces_n_4065250.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turco|first=Bucky|title=BANKSY THOROUGHLY RAGGED|url=http://animalnewyork.com/2010/banksy-thoroughly-ragged/|work=Animal New York|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dobkin|first=Jake|title=Banksy Gets Dissed|url=http://gothamist.com/2010/05/18/banksy_gets_dissed.php?#photo-1|work=Gothamist|accessdate=21 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072201/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/18/banksy_gets_dissed.php#photo-1|archivedate=10 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the continued defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced.&lt;ref name=nytimes_race /&gt; A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in [[East New York]], charging money for people to take photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jefferson |first=Cord |title=These Men Are Now Charging People to Look at Banksy's Latest Stencil |url=http://gawker.com/these-men-are-now-charging-people-to-look-at-banksys-l-1443562694 |work=[[Gawker]] |accessdate=21 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019141644/http://gawker.com/these-men-are-now-charging-people-to-look-at-banksys-l-1443562694 |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes_monthlong&gt;{{cite news|last=Buckley|first=Cara|title=Monthlong Chase Around New York City for Banksy’s Street Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/nyregion/monthlong-chase-around-new-york-city-for-banksys-street-art.html|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some took matters into their own hands by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caulfield|first=Philip|title=Banksy fans restore Williamsburg ‘geishas’ after tussle with tagger|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-fans-restore-williamsburg-geishas-tussle-tagger-article-1.1488985|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art.

==Response==

The month-long show was widely publicized and covered by the media. Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], while supporting the arts, criticized Banksy's work, calling him a vandal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeveloff|first=Julie|title=Banksy Taunts Cops After Mayor Bloomberg Calls Him A Vandal|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/banksy-taunts-cops-after-bloomberg-calls-him-a-vandal-2013-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; contending that defacing property was not his definition of art.&lt;ref name=huffington_bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|last=Gutterman|first=Amanda|title=Calling for a Bloomberg-Banksy Ceasfire|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-gutterman/banksy-new-york_b_4125535.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=3 November 2013|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October the ''[[New York Post]]'' wrote under the front-page headline "Get Banksy!" that police were pursuing Banksy, but noted the hunt is difficult because he has never been positively identified in public.&lt;ref name=atlanticwire&gt;{{cite web|last=Schonfeld|first=Zach|title=The NYPD Is Finding it 'Kind of Hard' to Hunt Down Banksy|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/10/hunting-down-banksy-is-kind-of-hard-for-nypd/70650/|work=The Atlantic Wire|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response Banksy posted an image of the front page on his website with the caption "I don't read what i believe in the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banksy riles Big Apple|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/banksy-riles-big-apple-20131019-2vtvl.html|work=[[Brisbane Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Artists Say Banksy "Defacing" Claims Overblown|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/lifestyles/arts/190737/local-artists-say-banksy--defacing--claims-overblown|work=[[NY1]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021064952/http://www.ny1.com/content/lifestyles/arts/190737/local-artists-say-banksy--defacing--claims-overblown|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NYPD]] later denied they were actively looking for Banksy as no property owners had filed any formal complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tracy|first=Thomas|title=Banksy debuts latest piece in Brooklyn as NYPD denies cops are hunting for the elusive graffiti artist|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/nypd-searching-banksy-source-article-1.1488808|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
[[File:"Ghetto 4 Life" Banksy in South Bronx October 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Banksy's 21 October piece in the [[South Bronx]] angered many residents and graffiti artists.]]
[[The Bronx|Bronx]] [[Borough President]] [[Rubén Díaz, Jr.]] called Banksy a "modern-day Picasso" and praised him for choosing to unveil his 16 October Ronald McDonald replica in the South Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlson|first=Jen|title=Photos, Video: Banksy's New Piece Is A Traveling Ronald McDonald Statue|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_ronald_mcdonald.php|work=Gothamist|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019220758/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_ronald_mcdonald.php|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx2&gt;{{cite news|last=Scarborough|first=Joey|title=Borough President Ruben Diaz disses Banksy one day after ‘Ghetto 4 Life’ slur|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-borough-president-reviles-banksy-article-1.1493215|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came before Banksy's 21 October piece, which brought discontent to the President and other residents. The piece featured a child spray-painting the words "Ghetto 4 Life" on a wall. Díaz stated it reinforced "outdated negative stereotypes," and defended that Banksy should become aware that graffiti art and culture originated in the Bronx.&lt;ref name=independent_bronx /&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx2 /&gt; The owner of the graffitied wall and his partner, however, praised the work and its message, calling it "beautiful" and owning its preservation to the artist's fame.&lt;ref name=daily_bronx /&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx2 /&gt;

Banksy's [[op-ed]] article about One World Trade Center, posted on his website on 27 October, came as an insult to many across the city. Former [[FDNY]] Deputy Chief Jim Riches wrote that it was a "disgrace to New York City and all the families who lost loved ones on 9/11."&lt;ref name=cnn_wtc /&gt; [[Sally Regenhard]], a leading voice for families of [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|11 September victims]], expressed concerns about Banksy's 15 October depiction of the Twin Towers in TriBeCa, saying the piece was "horrific" and that the placed flower looked more like an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blau|first=Reuven|title=Banksy criticizes 1 World Trade Center as ‘Canadian,’ ‘vanilla’|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-disses-1-wtc-canadian-vanilla-article-1.1498564|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Century 21 (department store)|Century 21]] department store near [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] had planned to show Banksy's work on 29 October, but cancelled due to the controversy.&lt;ref name=cnn_wtc /&gt;

===Critical reception===
Banksy's ''Better Out Than In'' series has received mixed reviews.&lt;ref name=npr_review&gt;{{cite web|last=Rose|first=Joel|title=Art Or Act? New Yorkers Give Banksy Residency Mixed Reviews|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/10/31/242028452/art-or-act-banksys-reviews-are-mixed|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fans raved over his work, flocking to each site everyday of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buckley|first=Cara|title=Monthlong Chase Around New York City for Banksy’s Street Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/nyregion/monthlong-chase-around-new-york-city-for-banksys-street-art.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=4 November 2013|date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York City|New York]]'' magazine art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] wrote Banksy's well-executed work stood out from other graffiti, but that the meaning behind the pieces aren't as deep as fans like to believe.&lt;ref name=npr_review /&gt; "No other graffiti artist has a [[Public relations|PR]] machine remotely like Banksy's," he writes, arguing Banksy is more of a "promo man" than an artist.&lt;ref name=saltz_ranking&gt;{{cite web|last=Saltz|first=Jerry|title=Jerry Saltz Ranks Banksy’s New York City (So-Called) Artistic Works|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/saltz-ranking-banksys-nyc-pieces.html|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=[[New York Magazine]]|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will Ellsworth-Jones, author of ''Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall'' writes that ''Better Out Than In'' shows Banksy's range of mediums has grown to incorporate multi-media and performance-based works. He pointed out the "wonderful commentary on money and art" displayed with hiring an anonymous salesman to sell Banksy paintings in Central Park for $60.&lt;ref name=npr_review /&gt;

==Overview==
BiennaleOnline was founded by David Dehaeck and Nathalie Haveman in 2012. The exhibition was set to be launched on September 2012, however it was moved to April 2013.&lt;ref name="Art Daily"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=54541#.URkWJKJeGQk | title=New mobile platform for smart investments in emerging Contemporary art | publisher=''Art Daily'' | accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition is organized by ARTPLUS, a mobile exhibition platform for art lovers and collectors of contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Art in America 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/news/2013-01-29/online-biennial/ | title=Does the Art World Need an Online Biennial? | publisher=''[[Art in America]]'' | date=January 29, 2013 | accessdate=February 11, 2013 | author=Brian Boucher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deredactie 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.francais/magazine/130125_JanHoetBiennaleOnline/ | title=Jan Hoet dirige la première biennale d’art en ligne | publisher=''Deredactie'' | date=January 15, 2013 | accessdate=February 11, 2013 | language= French}} {{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first BiennaleOnline is directed by [[Jan Hoet]]. Hoet previously served as the artistic director of [[Documenta IX]] and the museum [[MARTa Herford]], [[Germany]], and was a founder of [[SMAK]] in Ghent, Belgium. 25 artists, which are carefully chosen by Hoet, will be represented in the center section of the exhibition called "''Reflection &amp; Imagination''".&lt;ref name="Art in America 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Excelsior 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/2013/02/06/882901/ | title=Encuentro de creación en la web, crean una bienal en línea | publisher=''[[Excélsior]]'' | date=February 6, 2013 | accessdate=February 11, 2013 | author=Sonia Ávila | language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Hoet died in a hospital in Ghent on February 27, 2014.

BiennaleOnline is the first of its kind, curated, exclusively online biennial exhibition of contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Deredactie 1"/&gt; 29 Leading international curators select the 183 most promising artists at a critical moment, when they are poised to become established artists.&lt;ref name="Deredactie 1"/&gt; BiennaleOnline aimes to offer an exhibition which breaks away from the conventional notion of Art as an elite pastime, confined to faraway galleries and those with the leisure and funds to enjoy it.

BiennaleOnline started with a "Pay What You want" payment wall. The founders very soon noticed that it was blocking visitors from entering the exhibition. In the best interest of the artists it was decided in May 2012 to remove the payment wall to ensure maximum exposure of their works. Soon after the removal of the payment wall the number of visitors surged to 400.000 within 1 year after opening.

==The second BiennaleOnline==
The second BiennaleOnline will launch in 2017
.
The BiennaleOnline attracted more than 400.000 visitors since its launch in April 2012. The success the BiennaleOnline led to the decision to present the exhibition on its native platform separate from ART+.  In 2014 ART+ modified its business model to focus solely on facilitating secure ownership and trade of media art online.

The '''Birds' Head Haggadah''' (c. 1300) is the oldest surviving [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]].{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=350}}{{sfn|Estrin|2016}} The manuscript, produced in the [[Upper Rhine]] region of Southern Germany in the early 14th century, contains the full Hebrew text of the Haggadah, a ritual text recounting the story of Passover – the liberation of the [[Israelites]] from slavery in [[ancient Egypt]] – which is recited by participants at a [[Passover Seder]]. The text is executed in block calligraphy and accompanied by colorful illustrations of Jews performing the Seder practices and reenacting Jewish historical events. The Birds' Head Haggadah is so called because all Jewish men, women, and children depicted in the manuscript have human bodies with the faces and beaks of [[bird]]s. Non-Jewish and non-human faces (such as those of angels, the sun, and the moon) are blank or blurred. Numerous theories have been advanced to explain the unusual [[iconography]], usually tied to [[Aniconism in Judaism|Jewish aniconism]]. The Haggadah is in the possession of the [[Israel Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]], where it is on permanent exhibition.

==Description==
A [[Haggadah]] is a ritual Jewish text containing prayers, hymns, [[Midrash]]ic statements, and commentary on the story of [[Passover]] – the liberation of the [[Israelites]] from slavery in [[ancient Egypt]]. This text is recited by participants at a [[Passover Seder]].&lt;ref name=jvl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-passover-haggadah|title=Passover: The Haggadah|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|year=2017|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Italie|2011}} Illuminated manuscripts of the Haggadah began appearing in the 13th century, and printed Haggadahs began to be published in the 15th century.{{sfn|Cohen|2017}}

The Birds' Head Haggadah is an [[illuminated manuscript]] dated to the beginning of the 14th century.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=350}} The style and coloring of the figures reflects that of other illuminated manuscripts from the Upper Rhine region of Southern Germany in that era,{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=350}} perhaps from the vicinity of [[Würzburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Ursula|date=1988|title=Die Vogelkopf-Haggada.

The manuscript measures {{convert|27|cm}} long by {{convert|18.2|cm}} wide.&lt;ref name=exhibit/&gt; It is believed to have originally contained about 50 pages, gathered into five bindings of eight pages each and one binding of 10 pages.{{sfn|Raff|2005}} In its current condition, it contains 47 pages.{{sfn|Epstein|2015|p=97}}

===Text===
The text was copied by a scribe named Menahem; the letters of his Hebrew name, מנחם, are graphically accentuated in the similarly-spelled Hebrew word מֻנָּחִים (''Munahim'') in the Haggadah text, [[Hebrew abbreviations#Text|revealing his signature]].{{sfn|Raff|2005}}{{efn|The passage in which the Hebrew word ''Munahim'' ("are placed") appears references the Jew's obligation to recite the Haggadah when the [[matzo]] and [[maror]] are placed before him.{{sfn|Touger|2017}}}} The scribe Menahem is also credited with copying the [[Leipzig]] [[Machzor]] ([[High Holy Days]] prayerbook) around the same time; he encoded his name in that illuminated manuscript in a "decorated text panel".{{sfn|Fishof|1994|p=58}}{{sfn|McBee|2009}}

Each page of the Birds' Head Haggadah contains 12 rows of text, copied in block calligraphy.&lt;ref name=exhibit/&gt;{{sfn|Raff|2005}} The calligraphy and illustrations were executed in dark brown ink and [[tempera]] on parchment.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=350}}&lt;ref name=exhibit/&gt;

The extant manuscript shows smaller, densely packed script written in the margins of some pages, detailing instructions for conducting the Seder and fulfilling the [[Halakha|laws]] pertaining to Passover.{{sfn|Raff|2005}} "Captions" have also been appended to certain illustrations.{{sfn|Epstein|2011|p=47}} According to Epstein, these glosses and captions were added by unknown owners of the Haggadah over the centuries.{{sfn|Epstein|2011|p=47}}

The manuscript contains two full-page [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]]. The first, placed at the beginning, depicts a husband and wife seated at their Seder table.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=350}}{{sfn|Raff|2005}} The second, appearing at the end of the Haggadah, depicts a vision of a rebuilt Jerusalem in the messianic era.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=350}}&lt;ref name=exhibit/&gt;

 |source=–Professor [[Marc Michael Epstein]] on the&lt;br&gt;Birds' Head Haggadah{{sfn|Kuruvilla|2016}}
}}
Numerous theories have been advanced to explain the choice of facial features in the Haggadah's illustrations. A prevalent theory for the use of bird rather than human faces is the illustrator's attempt to circumvent the Second Commandment prohibition against [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|making a graven image]], in the tradition of [[Aniconism in Judaism|Jewish aniconism]].{{sfn|Schapiro|1980|p=384}}{{sfn|Estrin|2016}}{{sfn|Gindi|1998|p=34}} Other Ashkenazi Hebrew illuminated manuscripts from the 13th and 14th centuries depict humans with animal heads in keeping with this prohibition.{{sfn|Fishof|1994|p=58}} Notably, the Leipzig Machzor, copied by the same scribe who copied the Birds' Head Haggadah, features human-looking faces with noses resembling curved beaks.{{sfn|McBee|2009}}

Epstein theorizes that the choice of birds' heads for the Jewish figures in the Birds' Head Haggadah hints at the spiritual and national characteristics of the Jewish people. He argues that the beaked visages in the manuscript are not birds' heads at all, but the heads of [[griffin]]s. The legendary griffin – the body of which resembles both a lion and an eagle – reflects the prevalent use of "lion-eagle-human hybrids" in Jewish iconography.{{sfn|Epstein|2015|p=101}} Moreover, the lion-eagle-human hybrid incorporates three of the [[Living creatures (Bible)|four creatures]] represented in [[Ezekiel]]'s [[Merkabah mysticism|vision of the divine chariot]] ({{bibleref|Ezekiel|1|RSV}}), suggesting a connection between the Jewish people and God.{{sfn|Epstein|2011|p=57}} [[Lion of Judah|The lion]] may also allude to the symbol of the tribe of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] while [[Reichsadler|the eagle]] evokes the symbol of the German emperor, suggesting the Jews' identification as both subjects of the realm and as Jews.{{sfn|Epstein|2011|p=57}} Epstein further theorizes that the blank faces assigned to non-Jewish and non-human figures sends a message to Jewish readers of the Haggadah that these entities have no intrinsic power, but are subject to God's will.{{sfn|Epstein|2015|p=104}}

Art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]], who wrote an introduction to the first [[facsimile]] edition of the Haggadah published by M. Spitzer in 1965,{{sfn|Roth|1969}} maintains that the birds' heads are those of eagles, noting a very similar head on "an unmistakable eagle" in the contemporary Christian [[Codex Manesse]]. The [[Reichsadler|Imperial Eagle]] was the heraldic symbol of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], under whose protection Jews in Germany lived, which the depiction as eagles may symbolize.  In addition, a number of biblical passages can be taken as identifying the Jews with eagles, including {{bibleref|Exodus|19:4|RSV}}, especially relevant to the Passover, and {{bibleref|Deuteronomy|32:11–12|RSV}}{{sfn|Schapiro|1980|p=384}}

Carol Zemel postulates that the birds' heads affixed to Jewish men and women going about their Passover preparations are a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the [[Theriocephaly|animal-head]] gods worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. This connection elevates the spiritual importance of the Jews' work.{{sfn|Zemel|2016|p=92}}

Ruth Malinkoff, in her 1999 book ''Antisemitic Hate Signs in Hebrew: Illuminated Manuscripts from Medieval Germany'', asserts that the appendage of pigs' ears to some Jewish characters clues the reader to the fact that these are [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[caricature]]s instigated by Christian artists. Jewish artists, who were more familiar with the Hebrew text, did the design and copying, and the manuscript was commissioned by Jews as well, but Christian antisemitism heavily influenced the illustrations. This expressed itself in the "[[Jewish nose|stereotypical long noses]]" and "large eyes", the pigs' ears, and the conical hat worn by many Jewish figures. The fact that the birds' heads themselves are those of [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] – which are [[Tumah and taharah|ritually impure]] according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] – also point to the antisemitic undertones of the manuscript, according to Malinkoff.{{sfn|Raff|2005}}

However, Meyer Schapiro believes the artists were Jewish,{{sfn|Schapiro|1980|p=382, elsewhere he talks of a single artist}} trained in the contemporary Gothic idiom, and confident in their style, but "not in the forefront" of contemporary artists; the manuscript "now so exceptional, was in its day a piece of local everyday art".{{sfn|Schapiro|1980|p=385}} Epstein also challenges Malinkoff's assertion that an antisemitic manuscript would be accepted by its Jewish patrons.{{sfn|Epstein|2011|pp=49–50}} He notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead, it makes more sense to assume that the griffins' heads were the specific choice of the patrons. Far from being anti-Jewish caricatures, the griffin-headed figures in the Birds' Head Haggadah are dignified portrayals of Jews, full of character and personality. All are going seriously about their business or are posed with stateliness and monumentality in spite of the singular strangeness of their heads.{{sfn|Epstein|2011|p=54}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Provenance==
[[File:Birds' Head Haggadah at Israel Museum.jpg|275px|right|thumb|The Birds' Head Haggadah on display at the [[Israel Museum]], 2013]]
The original [[Patronage|patron]] of the Haggadah is unknown.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=350}} In the 20th century, the manuscript was owned by the family of Johanna Benedikt, who gave it as a wedding present to Benedikt's new husband, German Jewish lawyer and parliamentarian [[Ludwig Marum]].{{sfn|Estrin|2016}}{{sfn|D'Arcy|2016}} Marum reportedly stored the manuscript in his law office.{{sfn|Estrin|2016}} Following his arrest and deportation by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] in 1933, the manuscript disappeared.&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; It resurfaced in 1946 in [[Jerusalem]] when Herbert Kahn, a German Jewish refugee, sold it to the Bezalel National Museum, the predecessor of the [[Israel Museum]], for $600.{{sfn|D'Arcy|2016}}&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; The museum keeps the manuscript on permanent exhibition.&lt;ref name=exhibit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.imj.org.il/imagine/galleries/viewItemE.asp?case=26&amp;itemNum=199815|title=The Birds' Head Haggadah|publisher=[[Israel Museum]]|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shimon Jeselsohn, a law colleague of Marum in Germany who immigrated to Israel after the war, read about the museum's acquisition of the manuscript and connected it with the work that he had seen in Marum's possession. He wrote to Marum's daughter, Elisabeth, who was then living in New York, to tell her of the Haggadah's whereabouts.{{sfn|Estrin|2016}} In 1984 Elisabeth made a trip to Israel and saw the manuscript in the museum; afterwards she wrote a letter to the museum saying that Kahn "had no right to sell" their family's Haggadah, but that the family would allow the museum to keep the Haggadah on exhibit "for the benefit of the public".{{sfn|Estrin|2016}}{{sfn|D'Arcy|2016}}&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; According to her daughter, Elisabeth thought there was no way she could retrieve the manuscript, so she did not try to.{{sfn|Estrin|2016}} 

===Ownership dispute===
[[File:Ludwig Marum LMZ039657.jpg|125px|right|thumb|[[Ludwig Marum]]]]
In 2016 Marum's grandchildren, led by Marum's 75-year-old grandson Eli Barzilai, began demanding compensation, claiming the Haggadah had been sold without the family's permission.&lt;ref name=fight&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.782762|title=Jewish Family Renews Fight With Israel Museum Over 'Holocaust-looted' 14th-century Haggadah|agency=Associated Press|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=11 April 2017|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barzilai engaged the services of [[E. Randol Schoenberg]], a U.S. attorney specializing in the recovery of [[Nazi plunder|Nazi-looted artwork]].{{sfn|Estrin|2016}} According to ''[[Artnet]]'', the compensation demand was "less than" USD$10&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Estrin|2016}} In addition to financial reimbursement, the family asked for the manuscript to be renamed the "Marum Haggadah".&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; 

The Israel Museum has acknowledged the family's ownership claim predating World War II.{{sfn|Estrin|2016}} It has requested documentation of ownership between 1933 and 1946, at which point it purchased the Haggadah from Kahn.&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; In late 2016 the Marum family obtained more than 1,000 documents from German historians in [[Karlsruhe]], which depict Kahn as a low-paid schoolteacher in constant need of cash. The family asserted that Kahn somehow obtained the Haggadah without their permission, but that they do not think he stole it.&lt;ref name=fight/&gt;

==Other editions==
In 1965/1967 a two-volume color [[facsimile]] edition of the Birds' Head Haggadah was published in Israel by M. Spitzer, bringing the manuscript to international attention.{{sfn|Roth|1969}} 

In 1997 [[Koren Publishers]], in conjunction with the Israel Museum, published ''The Haggada of Passover: With Pop-Up Spreads'', incorporating illustrations from the Birds' Head Haggadah.{{sfn|Bluemel|Taylor|2012|p=290}} Designed for children, the book is printed on heavy cardstock and incorporates [[Pop-up book|pop-ups]] and pull-tabs for users to manipulate the illustrations of the bird-headed characters reenacting historical and Seder practices. The illustrations include the reenactments of the [[Plagues of Egypt|Ten Plagues]], baking matzo, [[crossing the Red Sea]], drinking the [[Passover Seder#The Four Cups|Four Cups]] at the Passover Seder, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csCcl25LzGc|title=The Israel Museum Passover Haggadah with Pop-Up Spreads (video)|publisher=judaicawebstore.com|date=21 February 2012|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jweek&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jweekly.com/2012/03/30/new-haggadahs-from-the-basics-to-illuminating-storytelling/|title=New haggadahs from the basics to illuminating storytelling from Jonathan Safran Foer|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=14 September 2017|work=[[J.

The '''Castle of Alva''' ({{lang-pt|Castelo de Alva}}) is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[castle]] located in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Viade de Baixo e Fervidelas]], in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Freixo de Espada à Cinta]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Bragança District|district of Bragança]].

==History==
As part of the [[Kingdom of León|Leonese]] invasion, in June 1212, the first reference to the castle between Freixo de Espada à Cinta and Urros.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=477 |title=Castelo de Alva (IPA.00000477/PT010404060006) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Ernesto |last=Jana |first2=Marisa |last2=Costa |year=2001 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152317/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=477 |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1236 it was occupied by Leonese forces with the consent of its habitants.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; Shortly after, King D. [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]] donated the place to the municipality of Freixo "como sua aldeia" (''with its village''), ordering the expulsion of the residents who lived there during the Leonese occupation.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; At the time of the 1258 ''Inquirições'' (''Inquiries'') indicated that King Sancho had transferred the title to Freixo.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

During the reign of King D. [[Denis of Portugal|Dinis]], the municipality of Alva requested that King ''expand its settlement of 400 residents''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; But, by 1311, in a letter, the King refused the request, owing to opposition from the municipality of Freixo.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Between 1527 and 1532, the village of Alva was not listed in the ''Numeramento'', suggesting that the settlement no longer existed by the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

During the 17th century, António Coelho Gasco, external judge and captain-major of the town of Freixo, described the state of abandonment that the structure, which he referred to as the ''"Antiquario"'' (''antiquary''), during a presentation on his visit to the Archbishop of Braga, D. Rodrigo da Cunha.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; By the end of the same century, Father Carvalho da Costa, referring to the limits of Poiares in the ''Corografia Portuguesa'', included a small list of landmarks; this included the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Alva and ''"alongside it the ruined Castle with its walls, where in the past, was founded the Town of Alva"'', remembering that D. Sancho II had deprived the village of its residents.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Continuing, that he:
:''"gave the village to Freixo and later, depopulated and ruined it, remaining only the boat, that navigated the river, with the name of Alva, and the referred Hermitage of Santa Maria, where is annexed a simple benefit of the Royal Patronage"''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

==Architecture==
The castle is situated in an area of abundant archaeological vestiges; the parish of Poiares is located between the Serra do Marão and Serra de Avões, along the Couro and Douro Rivers in a rural area, situated on a {{convert|700|m|ft}} hilltop dominating the Douro valley.&lt;ref name="IGESPAR"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/72908 |title=Castelo de Alva |publisher=IGESPAR – Instituto de Gestão do Património Arquitectónico e Arqueológico (Portuguese Institute of Architectural and  Archaeological Heritage) |year=2013 |first=A. |last=Martin |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actually location is covered in vegetation and olive orchards.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The '''Church of Spiritual Technology''' ('''CST''') is a [[California]] 501(c)(3) [[non-profit corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:IRS-Recognition-Denmark.djvu|Letter by the Internal Revenue Service to Flemming Paludan, Regional Director, Danish Tax-Office, Washington, D.C., USA, December 22nd, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated in 1982, which owns all the [[copyright]]s of the estate of [[L.

In a 1993 memorandum by the [[Church of Scientology International]], the role and function of CST has been described as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] CST [...] is an autonomous church of the Scientology religion outside the international Scientology ecclesiastical hierarchy. CST conducts an extensive program of activities to preserve and archive the Scientology Scriptures for use by future generations. CST also owns the option to acquire RTC's rights to the Scientology advance[d] technology and religious marks under three narrowly defined sets of circumstances, each of which contemplates a serious threat to continued existence of the religion. CST is the principal beneficiary of Mr. Hubbard's estate, provided that it obtains recognition of its tax-exempt status. [...]" &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Summary Description CST-AT-ASI.pdf|Summary Description of Other Scientology Organizations - CST (Church of Spiritual Technology), Author's Family Trust, ASI (Author Services Inc.) - CSI Prod. 11-4-93, Bate Stamp: 151412 - 151413, Ex. 1-8, Washington, DC 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Corporate information ==

The Church of Spiritual Technology (CST) was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] by Sherman Lenske in Woodland Hills, [[California]] on May 27, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:CST-Incorporation.djvu|Articles of Incorporation of Church of Spiritual Technology, Endorsed Filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California, Woodland Hills, California, May 27th, 28th &amp; June 1st, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bylaws]] of CST were signed on June 7, 1982 by its General and Special [[Board of directors|Directors]], who were at that time Lyman Spurlock, Rebecca Pook, Maria Starkey, Stephen A. Lenske, Sherman D. Lenske and Lawrence A. Heller.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Bylaws-CST.pdf|Bylaws of Church of Spiritual Technology, California, June 7th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; In 1986, CST's [[Articles of Incorporation]] were amended to clarify the "[[disposition]] of the [[corporation|corporation's]] [[assets]] upon [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]]".&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Amended Articles of Incorporation CST.pdf|Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation - Church of Spiritual Technology, Endorsed filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California, Bate Stamp: 02008 - 02009, California, April 9th, May 13th &amp; 14th, 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt;'''= --&gt;
On August 18, 1993, CST filed an application for [[tax exemption]] under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;!-- [[:File:Application-501-CST.pdf|Form 1023 - Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code - Church of Spiritual Technology, Washington, DC, August 18th, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The [[Internal Revenue Service]] granted CST's request for exemption through an official recognition letter on October 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Image:IRS-Recognition-CST.pdf|Recognition Letter for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status - Church of Spiritual Technology, Washington, DC, October 1st, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the filing for [[tax exemption]], the following individuals held [[corporate]] positions at CST: The [[Board of Trustees]] was composed of John Allcock, David Lantz and Russell Bellin. Thomas Vorm, Russell Bellin and Catherine Schmidt formed the [[Board of Directors]]. CST's [[President (corporate title)|President]] was Russell Bellin, its [[Vice-President]] Thomas Vorm, its [[Secretary]] Jane McNairn and its [[Treasurer]] Catherine Schmidt.

===Licensing of trademarks and service marks===
[[File:IRS-CST-Denial-Letter.pdf|thumb|left|July 8, 1988 [[IRS]], final adverse ruling letter with regards to application for tax exempt status of Church of Spiritual Technology]]

The existence and founding of CST is intimately connected to the creation of the [[Religious Technology Center]], which was incorporated on January 1, 1982. Shortly after its inception, RTC received on May 16, 1982 "the ownership, supervision and control" of the [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]], identifying "Scientology applied religious philosophy" and "Dianetics spiritual healing technology" by the originator and founder of Scientology, [[L. Ron Hubbard]] through a so-called "[[Assignment (law)|Assignment]] [[Contract|Agreement]]".&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Assignment-RTC.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, County of Los Angeles, California, May 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

This agreement was subject to an additional "Option Agreement" between Hubbard, RTC and CST.  In two so-called "Option Agreements" from May 1982, Hubbard granted CST the right to purchase at any time from RTC the "Marks", the "Advanced Technology" and all the rights to them for the sum of $100.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST.pdf|"Option Agreement (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, County of Los Angeles, California, May 10th, 1982/July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST-AT.pdf|Option Agreement (Advanced Technology-U.S.) - Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, California, May 10th &amp; July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Parallel and similar-sounding agreements between Hubbard, RTC and CST were created during that period concerning the so-called "Advanced Technology," which consists of unpublished derivates of Scientology's confidential "Advanced technology".&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Assignment-Agreement-LRH-RTC-AT.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Advanced Technology - US)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, Los Angeles, California, May 10th &amp; 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Under these agreements, RTC is forced to turn over 90% of its net income to CST. A document from 1991, reflecting the "financial money flows" of RTC during the year 1989, actually showed a turnover of 59% of RTC's net income towards CST.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Analysis-Financial-Flows-RTC.pdf|"Religious Technology Center - Analysis of Financial Flows 1989", Exhibit I-9 for Application for Tax-Exempt Status 501(c)(3), Bate Stamp: CSI Prod 11-4-93 151414]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Other examples of [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]] owned by CST are [[The Way to Happiness]] and The Way to Happiness symbol. As such, CST operates as the L. Ron Hubbard Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.twth.org/reprinting/files/reprint-instructions.pdf |format=PDF| title = How to obtain permission to reprint The Way to Happiness booklets | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | publisher = The Way to Happiness Foundation International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facility locations ==
CST operates numerous bases throughout the western United States.  Locations include:

=== Twin Peaks, California ===
As of 1988, this property has 15 buildings totaling approximately 22,000 square ft, including a three-story administration office, dormitories, dining halls, residences and other buildings and offices. The originals are kept here, with copies made for other vault locations. [[Shelly Miscavige]], wife of leader David Miscavige, who hasn't been seen in public since 2007, is said to be held at this location.

=== Creston, California (Creston Ranch / Whispering Winds Ranch) ===
While not a vault location, the Creston Ranch, where L. Ron Hubbard died, is marked with the CST logo.

=== Triple Jay Ranch, California ===

=== Petrolia, California (Sunset View / Eureka) ===
The usage for the property is an archival document storage repository there which will store religious documents preserved by CST.
=== Tuolumne, California (Lady Washington Mine) ===
Located at 18749 First Avenue, Tuolumne serves as archival storage for the writings of L Ron Hubbard.  The Lady Washington Mine and two houses on 26.23 acres were purchased in 1988 by William and Donna Daniels. In 1988, the Daniels gave the property to Norman Starkey, trustee of "Author's Family Trust". Starkey gave the property to the Church of Spiritual Technology in 1993. Digging began in 1997. According to the Los Angeles Times, the CST "is using state-of-the-art technology to protect Hubbard's writings, tape-recorded lectures and filmed treatises from natural and man-made calamities, including nuclear holocaust."

According to plans filed with the Tuolumne County Building Department the facility features a 15-foot-wide, 250-foot-long-tunnel. The first 98 feet from the entrance are improved, with a 10.5-foot domed ceiling. At the end of the 98 feet is a 10-foot-long storage room. 

=== Trementina, New Mexico (San Miguel Ranch / Trementina Base) ===
According to CST, the purpose of this base is to provide storage space for an archiving project to preserve Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Scientology bibliography|writings]], [[Scientology filmography|films]] and recordings for future generations. Hubbard's texts have been engraved on stainless steel tablets and encased in titanium capsules underground. The project began in the late 1980s.

The base includes a number of dwellings and the archives themselves, the latter in a network of underground tunnels. The base also has its own private, concrete airstrip, the San Miguel Ranch Airport (NM53).

The site is about a 2 1/2-hour drive east of Santa Fe. Access is through a gated road and a private concrete airstrip, the San Miguel Ranch Airport (NM53). The Trementina location is supposedly a store for material written by L.R. Hubbard, as shown in 1998 on ABC News's "20/20.":

"Buried deep in these New Mexico hills in steel-lined tunnels, said to be able to survive a nuclear blast, is what Scientology considers the future of mankind," ABC's Tom Jarriel said in his report. "Seen here for the first time, thousands of metal records, stored in heat-resistant titanium boxes and playable on a solar-powered turntable, all containing the beliefs of Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard."

The site is marked from the air with Church of Spiritual Technology double diamonds. A runway for smaller airplanes is located on CST owned land in connection to the site. The original short strip was expanded in the early 1990s on land acquired by a land swap deal between CST and neighboring land owners in 1992.

==Archives==
The CST oversees the Scientology scriptural archiving project, which aims to preserve the works of Hubbard on stainless steel tablets and encased in [[titanium]] capsules in specially constructed [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Bob | last = Henderson | title = Vault to get Hubbard's writings | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/50647275.html?dids=50647275:50647275&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | work =  | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1991-07-25 | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of Hubbard's works go through a rigorous process, beginning with the [[Mass deacidification|removal of deterioration-causing acid from the paper]], and then being placed in plastic envelopes. They are then placed in the titanium "time capsules." The writings are also carved into stainless steel plates, which, according to Church of Scientology officials, can withstand being sprayed with salt water for a thousand years. Hubbard’s taped lectures are recorded again into gold compact discs encased in glass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientologysided062490-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church places prime value to Hubbard’s volumes of works and because of this has instituted the CST to “engrave the entire corpus of Hubbard’s original texts on steel plates.”&lt;ref name="Cowan 2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowan |first1=Douglas |last2=Bromley |first2=David |title=Cults and New Religions: A Brief History |chapter=Wiley Blackwell Brief Histories of Religion |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2015 |accessdate=2015-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example is the [[Trementina Base]], an underground vault built into a mountainside near [[Trementina, New Mexico]]. It is marked by a CST logo visible only from a high altitude and was built in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/26/AR2005112601065.html | title=A Place in the Desert for New Mexico's Most Exclusive Circles | publisher=Washington Post | date=November 27, 2005 | accessdate=July 11, 2012 | author=Leiby, Richard | pages=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Anderson| last = Cooper| authorlink = Anderson Cooper | title = Inside the Church of Scientology| url = http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0512/02/acd.01.html| format = Transcript | work = [[Anderson Cooper 360°]]| publisher = CNN | date = 2005-12-02 | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former members claim that the purpose of CST's archival efforts is to ensure that Hubbard's work survive a [[nuclear apocalypse]] and reform civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/07/scientology_shelly_miscavige_disappeared.php Scientology Leader David Miscavige's Disappeared Wife Shelly: What We Know], ''The Village Voice'', 5 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/02/scientologys_se.php Scientology's Secret Vaults: A Rare Interview With a Former Member of Hush-Hush "CST"], ''The Village Voice'', 6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The church believes that these plates will last beyond a thousand years and that Hubbard’s teachings will be vital for "rebuilding civilization," in the event of global turmoil.&lt;ref name="Cowan 2015"/&gt; Former members of the church also claim that the symbols in the logo are “guide markers for Scientologists returning from other parts of the universe," according to ''Scientology in Popular Culture: Influences and Struggles for Legitimacy.''

According to the Scientology website, the Church of Spiritual Technology “is not involved in the ecclesiastical management of Scientology churches or the delivery of Scientology religious services. Its day-to-day activities are the long-term archival preservation methods to ensure that Mr. Hubbard’s written recorded works will be preserved for future generations.” The website also states that the archive’s purpose is to make available L. Ron Hubbard’s technology “in its exact and original form, no matter what happens to the society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=J. |title=Handbook of Scientology |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first time the Church of Spiritual Technology was mentioned publicly to Scientologists was by COB RTC David Miscavige in 2000 at the New Year's event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freezone.najbjerg.info/dokumenter/the-new-year-2000-event?set_language=en New Year 2000 event speech excerpt, by D.Miscavige]&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders included [[Meade Emory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/seattletimes/obituary.aspx?n=george-meade-emory&amp;pid=145944048 | title=George Meade Emory Obituary | publisher=Seattle Times | date=October 12, 2010 | accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-Scientologist who used to work for the [[Internal Revenue Service]] but went into private practice as a tax lawyer. He was hired as a specialist for the complex Internal Revenue Codes. The Church of Scientology International and most Scientology organizations settled with the IRS about 11 years later when the service passed a resolution in 1993 declaring the Church tax-exempt.

Other Scientology organizations require all corporate officers to be Scientologists in good standing, along with Scientologist general directors and staff. The Church of Spiritual Technology, however, includes "Special Directors" who are not required to be Scientologists, but who are required to be lawyers "to ensure that CST takes no action to jeopardize its tax-exempt status" (CST vs. IRS, US Claims Court No. 581-88T, June 29, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/blog/suleiman2/cst_vs_irs_1992.html CST vs. IRS - United States Claims Court, June 29 1992&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cigar Factory Artist Studios''' is an emerging artist community in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]’s art district. The site formerly belonged to the Bondy and Lederer Cigar Company, and consists of a 101,239 square-foot repurposed cigar factory on North 4th and Green Street.  Today the building houses galleries, shops, and 45 artist studios.&lt;ref name=Whelan&gt;Whelan, Frank (February 18, 2014).  "History’s Headlines: From ‘Seegars’ to Artists’ Mecca.” ''WFMZ-TV History’s Headlines'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical overview of Allentown's industries==
Throughout history, Allentown has been a major contender in the manufacturing arena.  In the early nineteenth century, the area’s grain production was among the highest in the country, and by the middle of the century, the Industrial Revolution was well underway.  The [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] exported load after load of Allentown’s iron and steel.  By the turn of the twentieth century, the city had greatly diversified their economy and was now producing silk, beer, and cigars.&lt;ref name=Whelan /&gt;

==The cigar factory==
The factory building located at 707 North 4th Street was built between 1898 and 1900, for the purpose of [[cigar]] production.  The New York-based Bondy and Lederer Cigar Company were notable [[tobacco]] merchants and cigar manufacturers that employed 600 cigar rollers at their New York City headquarters in the late 19th century.  They chose Allentown for their business expansion because of the area’s reputation for its high-quality tobacco production and cigar manufacturing.   In 1913-1914, there were nearly 60 cigar manufacturing companies operating and contributing toward federal revenue of $482,505 made as a result of Allentown’s cigar production.&lt;ref name=Whelan /&gt;

The growing popularity of the cigarette was a large cause of the eventual decline of many cigar companies’ success in Allentown.  Cigarette manufacturers were enjoying better success by the 1920s, and their ability to mass-produce the more economical cigarette proved to be too much of a competition for the cigar manufacturers.  Against all odds, Bondy and Lederer continued to maintain their presence as a major Allentown cigar manufacturer until the 1960s.  After the cigar factory closure, the site was used briefly as a knitting mill.  After the knitting mill closed, 707 North 4th Street, along with many of its neighboring factory buildings, stood vacant.&lt;ref name=Whelan /&gt;

Today, the city attracts a wide variety of creative manufacturing, art producers, and light industrial companies wanting to lease space in the area.  There is a lack of available land for new construction, and the demand for affordable, structurally-sound space in general is high.  There is an attraction to refinished older buildings that have been refinished to meet modern needs.&lt;ref name=Martinez&gt;Martinez, Arlene (August 24, 2008). “Could it be another SOHO?” ''The Morning Call'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Lehigh Valley’s largest arts building==
The former Bondy and Lederer factory building currently houses commercial space utilized by apparel manufacturers, and in 2012 the owner and developer secured a contractor that would redevelop remaining space into retail and office space, 45 artist studios, and a community art gallery.  Evidence of the building's original purpose remains present, such as the first floor's tobacco blowing tubes, where tobacco leaves were transported through the factory.&lt;ref name=Pedersen&gt;Pedersen, Brian (August 10, 2012). “Firm Transforms Old Factory into New Artist Building.” ''Lehigh Valley Business''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The North of Tilghman neighborhood, or No-Tie district, is a concentrated area of working artists and other creative minds that are enthusiastic and advocating for redevelopment projects.  This site in particular is unique in that the building and its revitalized surrounding area caters to artists and others producing within the creative arena.&lt;ref name=Martinez /&gt;

Because of this trend, the Cigar Factory Artist Studios has been well received by the community.  Monthly open house events and art installations are hosted by FUSE Art Infrastructure, and feature original works by occupants of the Cigar Factory, as well as other notable area artists.  Private studio spaces are often open to the public during these events. 
Since the ribbon cutting ceremony held on November 19, 2013, the Cigar Factory Artist Studios has grown to become Lehigh Valleys largest arts building.&lt;ref name=McEvoy&gt;McEvoy, Colin (November 19, 2013).

The '''coat of arms of [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]''', was adopted in 1902. The arms existed only in black and white until 1984, when an alderman asked the City to develop it in full colour.

==Symbols==
*'''[[Crest (heraldry)|Crest]]''': A [[mural crown]] signifying loyalty, with a setting sun.
*'''[[Escutcheon (heraldry)|Shield]]''': 
**'''[[Chief (heraldry)|Chief]]''': A setting sun over the [[Rocky Mountains]]
**'''[[Charge (heraldry)|Charges]]''': A [[Bison|bull buffalo]] charging a [[maple leaf]] (representing [[Canada]]) that surmounts the [[St George's Cross]].
*'''[[Compartment (heraldry)|Compartment]]''': The mount consists of two red [[maple]] leaves (symbolizing Canada), a [[thistle]] (for [[Scotland]]), [[leek]] (for [[Wales]]), [[shamrock]]s (for [[Ireland]]) and a [[rose]] (for England).
*'''[[Supporters]]''': A horse and a steer, representing the early Calgarian economy.
*'''Scroll''': The city motto, "Onward" between the years of incorporation as a town (1884) and as a city (1894).

The [[Union Flag]] and the [[Canadian Red Ensign]] are crossed under the scroll.

The landscape in the chief and the cross in the shield body are a reversal of the [[coat of arms of Alberta]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3928">The '''Commonwealth Literary Fund (CLF)''' was an Australian Government initiative founded in 1908 to assist needy Australian writers and their families. It was Federal Australia's first systematic support for the arts. Its scope was later broadened to encompass non-commercial literary projects.

==History==
In 1908 the [[Alfred Deakin|Deakin]] government established the fund, using Britain's [[Royal Literary Fund]] as a model, appointed a Committee and allocated ₤500 for grants for the first year. Its purpose was to provide a modest income for writers who were doing good work but had inadequate means to support themselves, and for widows and dependent families of writers who died destitute. A committee consisting of Sir [[Langdon Bonython]], the Rev. [[E. H. Sugden]], B.A., master of Queen's College, [[Melbourne University]], and Professor [[Mungo William MacCallum|Mungo McCallum]], M.A., [[Challis Professor]] of Modern Literature at the [[University of Sydney]], formed the committee which framed its regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5057976 |title=A Literary Fund |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |volume=XLIX, |issue=15,097 |location=South Australia |date=8 March 1907 |accessdate=16 March 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the Fund, which had increased incrementally to ₤1500, was trebled by the government in response to agitation by the [[Fellowship of Australian Writers]] and ex-Prime Minister [[Jim Scullin]]. The scope of the Fund was broadened to grant [[scholarship|fellowship]]s to writers, and to provide guarantees against loss to Australian publishers of works approved by the Committee. It also provided assistance to Australian literary magazines ''[[Meanjin]]'', ''[[Overland (magazine)|Overland]]'', ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' and ''[[Southerly (journal)|Southerly]]''. The Committee was replaced by a Board comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and one other, with an Advisory Board comprising leading writers, publishers and academics, which in practice was responsible for all decisions and disbursements.&lt;ref name=Dunlevy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110683348 |title=Writers' World: How valuable are fellowships? |author=Dunlevy, Maurice |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=46, |issue=12,949 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=23 October 1971 |accessdate=16 March 2016 |page=14 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership of the Advisory Board was generally confined to older (mostly) male writers of long-established reputations: [[Grenfell Price]], [[Vance Palmer]], [[T. Inglis Moore]], [[Douglas Stewart (poet)|Douglas Stewart]], [[Geoffrey Blainey]], [[Kenneth Slessor]], [[Flora Eldershaw]] and [[Kylie Tennant]].
Maurice Dunlevy, in his article for the Canberra Times, echoed Grenfell Price in saying that the Fund may have enabled works to be published which otherwise would not have been written, or would have been of lesser quality, and helped in the careers of a few great writers ([[Les A. Murray]], [[David Ireland (author)|David Ireland]], [[Alex Buzo]], [[William Leonard Marshall|William Marshall]], [[H. M. Green]], and [[Judith Wright]]), but much of the work produced was of mediocre quality, and no book sponsored by the Fund could be called a work of genius.&lt;ref name=Dunlevy/&gt;

In 1973, by which time its budget had grown to $300,000, the functions of the CLF were taken over by the Literature Board, an arm of the [[Australia Council for the Arts]].

[[File:Antiques restoration.jpg|thumb|Antiques restoration]]
A '''conservator-restorer''' is a professional responsible for the [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|preservation of artistic and cultural artifacts]], also known as [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation#.WSymX8m1tPs About Conservation: What is conservation? What is a conservator?]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservators possess the expertise to preserve cultural heritage in a way that retains the integrity of the object, building or site, including its historical significance, context and aesthetic or visual aspects.&lt;ref name="Defining2003"&gt;Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies. (2003). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1.&lt;/ref&gt;  This kind of preservation is done by analyzing and assessing the condition of cultural property, understanding processes and evidence of deterioration, planning [[collections care]] or site management strategies that prevent damage, carrying out conservation treatments, and conducting research.&lt;ref name="Careers2014"&gt;Careers in Conservation. (2014). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/publications-resources/careers-in-conservation/become-a-conservator#.VPPIxMaLTwN.&lt;/ref&gt;  A conservator's job is to ensure that the objects in a museum's collection are kept in the best possible condition, as well as to serve the museum's mission to bring art before the [[public]].&lt;ref name="Neuman2011"&gt;Neuman, R. (2011). MFA Highlights: Conservation and Care of Museum Collections. Boston, MA: Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation and restoration ==
Essentially, the term "conservation" refers to a manner of care or treatment that repairs damage and also takes action to prevent or slow down further deterioration of an object.&lt;ref name="Landry2000"&gt;Landry, G. (2000). The Wintertbur Guide to Caring for Your Collection. Winterthur, Delaware, DE: Winterthur Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "restoration" refers to a manner of care or treatment in which the goal is to bring an object back to its original appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt; "Restoration" can be part of the care and treatment of an object and is a subset of the umbrella term "conservation".&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;  Both terms come into play when it comes to the treatment and care of all cultural heritage.

== Responsibilities and duties ==
Conservators and restorers care for, manage, treat, preserve, and document many different historical items including [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], [[art]], and specimens.&lt;ref name="Baker2015"&gt;Baker, G. D. (2015). How to Become a Museum Conservator. Retrieved from http://collegemouse.com/jobs/how-to-become-a-museum-conservator.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Examining artifacts, both visually and using scientific tools such as x-rays, infrared photography and microscopic analysis to determine the extent and causes of deterioration.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013"&gt;Johnston, L. (2013). Museum/gallery conservator job description. Retrieved from http://www.prospects.ac.uk/museum_gallery_conservator_job_description.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation science (sometimes called museum science) aids every aspect of a museum’s mission to study its collections, both inside and out of the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Maintaining full conservation records by documenting the condition of an object or site, including any previous restoration work and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Documentation ensures the careful recording of treatment procedures and materials so there can be no misunderstanding in the future about what is part of the original work of art and what has been added or altered by the conservator&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Producing a visual record of the object for identification purposes and to illustrate its condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The examination of the object, treatment proposal, and the actual treatment is documented with written reports and photographs&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Monitoring and recording display and storage conditions with the aim of keeping objects in a stable condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Preservation is the ultimate goal of conservation.  By taking into account the possible day-to-day stresses caused by an object’s environment, museum conservators do their best to preserve art for generations to come.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Proposing and estimating the costs of treatments to halt decay and stabilize an artifact.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservators, present a proposal for work to be done as well as a report on the completion of the treatment.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Although conservators cannot exactly recapture the original appearance, they are able to make highly educated decisions about how to restore an object if they identify the materials from which it was made and fully understand their properties.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Organizing the logistics of long-term projects and collaborating with other conservators.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  This collaboration can take place when items are on loan or when outside help is needed for complex conservation projects.
* Working out creative solutions to clean, support and repair sensitive objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Ultimately, just as every object is unique, every conservation decision must be considered on its own and on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Developing and maintaining appropriate standards within the specialist area.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Critical information can be lost and an object permanently damaged when things are cared for without basic guidelines and information.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Keeping up to date with the latest conservation techniques and practices, through research and training.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservation is a young profession, which means it continues to evolve over time and conservators must be able to keep up to date with the latest trends.
* Advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials .  Museum conservators strive to maintain the integrity of each work of art throughout its life, whenever it is handled, stored, displayed, or shipped to other locations for exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Direct and supervise curatorial, technical, and student staff in the handling, mounting, care, and storage of art objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Other museum departments look to conservators and restorers for direction on safety procedures when it comes to objects in the museum's collection.
* Recommend preservation procedures, such as control of temperature and humidity, to curatorial and building staff.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The most important step you can take to ensure the preservation of any collection is to create a safe display and storage environment that will not cause further deterioration of the objects.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;

== Knowledge and skills ==
* Working knowledge of the vocabulary of conservation and scientific methodology in order to effectively examine an object, assess its state, understand its history, and articulate its needs.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Must have a firm grasp of philosophical precepts expressed in the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice in order to formulate a treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;  The conservator must understand that it’s important to respect the integrity of the object and that his or her actions should not jeopardize the long-term preservation of the object.
* Understanding and appreciation of the aesthetic, cultural, economic, historical, political, religious, scientific, and social values of objects, buildings and sites.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;  This understanding and appreciation are critically important when devising preservation and conservation plans, strategies, and treatments.
* Working knowledge of how materials constituting cultural heritage were acquired, modified, processed, or manufactured and how craft or manufacturing techniques and processes have evolved through time.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Possess knowledge of the chemical and physical properties and long-term behavior of a wide range of materials and whether these materials were used in the original fabrication of an object or in its subsequent treatment and preservation.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Must be aware of issues that arise from the ways that culturally significant materials will be accessed or used by society.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Knowledge of the context in which cultural heritage is used, as context may be critically important to understanding its condition, formulating appropriate treatment and recommending future care.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Knowledgeable about safety in the workplace and must carry out his or her practice in compliance with federal, state, and logical regulations.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Working knowledge of scientific principles as they apply to conservation, including how to access and use scientific literature and how to assess the validity of published research in conservation and allied fields.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Ability to recognize and understand the changes that occur in cultural heritage over time and be able to distinguish the cause of the changes (natural, chemical, physical, biological, or by human influence).&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Versed in the many ways in which light, relative humidity, temperature, and pollutants can influence the long-term preservation of cultural heritage and must be familiar with techniques, equipment, and resources that can assist in managing these important environmental factors&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Ability to conduct a safe, thorough examination of cultural materials in order to gather relevant information about their condition and to formulate an appropriate plan for preservation and treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Know which tools and techniques are appropriate, how extensive the examination should be, and how or whether to perform external, intrusive, and occasionally destructive sampling.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Understand the purposes of documentation and must be knowledgeable and proficient in appropriate methods of written and pictorial documentation as well as in the maintenance and preservation of the body of information produced during examination and treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Awareness of various treatment methods available as well as their effects on different types of cultural heritage, based on an understanding of condition, natural use, cultural, historic, and scientific significance, and, if applicable, the artist’s or maker’s intent.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;

== Education and training ==

=== Undergraduate and graduate education ===
Conservators can receive training through apprenticeships, internships and graduate programs. In order to be accepted into a graduate program, they will need to fulfill some undergraduate prerequisites.  This includes undergraduate coursework in science, the humanities (art history, anthropology, and archaeology), and studio art.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Some graduate programs may also require internship, volunteer, apprenticeship, or paid conservation experience.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Many may also require a personal interview where candidates are asked to present a portfolio of art and conservation project work that demonstrates manual dexterity and familiarity with techniques and materials.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Graduate programs generally require two to four years of study, which can also include a full-time internship in the final year where students work under the guidance of experienced conservators.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  There are also a limited number of Ph.D. programs for advanced study in conservation.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservation-related programs are described on the websites of the AIC,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/jobs/become-a-conservator#.WSycysm1tPt Careers in Conservation: Become a Conservator]".

=== Post-graduate fellowships ===
Post-graduate fellowships have also been cited as valuable experiences in their professional development.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  These fellowships provide intensive research, practice, and exposure to diverse professional staff or significant collections.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  A few institutions that offer fellowships include the [[Getty Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/gradinterns/ Graduate Internships]".

Harvard Art Museums. www.harvardartmuseums.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued professional development ===
The specialty of conservation is ever-changing and evolving, which means that practicing conservators must stay up-to-date of advances in technology and methodology.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservators usually expand their knowledge through reading publications, attending professional meetings, and enrolling in short-term workshops or courses.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt; AIC offers many workshops, conferences, and online courses and tutorials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/courses#.WSykcMm1tPt Professional Development Courses in Conservation Education]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org.

Conservation OnLine (CoOL). cool.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of specialty ==
Some conservators specialize in a particular material or group of objects, such as archaeology, ceramics and glass, furniture and wood, gilding and decorative surfaces, historic interiors, metals, paintings, paper and books, photographic materials, stained glass, stone and wall paintings, textiles, sculptures, and architecture.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;

== Ethics ==
The primary goal for conservators and restorers is the preservation of cultural property.  In order to achieve this goal, conservators abide by a code of ethics and guidelines that establish the principles that guide conservation professionals and others who are involved in the care of cultural property.  An example of a code of ethics and guidelines for practice were created by the [[American Institute for Conservation|American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.VPPM0saLTwM Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practive]" (2015). American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important principles in a conservator's code of ethics is that treatments should be reversible, which means that one must be able to undo any treatment in the future.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;  Conservators strive to only minimize interventions and not completely alter an object during restoration.  Conservation focuses on the material aspects of art, and respect for original materials remains a crucial element of the field's ethics.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;

Dance in [[China]] is a highly varied art form, consisting of many modern and traditional dance genres. The dances cover a wide range, from folk dances to performances in opera and ballet, and may be used in public celebrations, rituals and ceremonies. There are also 56 officially recognized [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups in China]], and each ethnic minority group in China also has its own folk dances. The best known Chinese dances today are the [[Dragon dance]] and the [[Lion Dance]].

==History==
[[File:Tang dancer.jpg|thumb|upright|A Tang Dynasty dancer from a mural unearthed in [[Xi'an]] dancing with a shawl.]]
{{Main|History of Chinese dance}}

There is a long recorded history of various forms of dance in China. The earliest Chinese character for "dance", [[File:舞-oracle.svg|20px]], written in the [[oracle bones]], is itself a representation of a dancer holding oxtails in each hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chinese Dance |author= Wang Kefen|publisher= China Books &amp; Periodicals |page=7 |year= 1985 |isbn=978-0835111867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Chinese dances today such as dancing with long sleeves have been recorded since the very early periods, dating from the at least as early as the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. The most important dances of the early period were the ritual and ceremonial music and dances called ''[[yayue]]'', and these dances were performed at the imperial court until the Qing dynasty, but only survive today as performances in Confucian ceremonies.

The imperial court from the Qin dynasty onward established various departments responsible for the collection of music and dances, training of performers as well as their performances at the court, such as the [[Music Bureau]] and [[Royal Academy (China)|Royal Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VA5tKw11K8YC&amp;pg=PA224 |pages=224–225 |title=China: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary|first= Michael |last=Dillon|publisher=Routledge |date=24 February 1998|isbn= 978-0700704392  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Six Dynasties]] era (220 - 589 CE), there were strong influences from Central Asia in music and dance. The art of dance reached a peak in the [[Tang Dynasty]], and the dances of the period were highly diverse and cosmopolitan, dances from Central Asia in particular were popular. A great number of dances were recorded in the Tang dynasty, for example there are over 60 Grand Compositions alone which are large scale performances from the Tang court, and there were tens of thousands of musicians and dancers at the Imperial palaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&amp;pg=PA458&amp;lpg=PA458&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= China: Five Thousand Years of History and Civilization |pages=458 |publisher=City University of Hong Kong Press |year= 2007|isbn=978-9629371401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of dance however declined after the Tang dynasty. This is due in part to the increasing popularity of the practice of [[footbinding]], which may have first arisen from dancers themselves but later tighter binding limited their movements, and greater social restriction placed on women may have also led to a virtual elimination of female dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|author= Anders Hansson|page=46 |publisher=Brill |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-9004105966 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tsBC-yHL_7IC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Dancing Female: Lives and Issues of Women in Contemporary Dance | editors= by Sharon E. Friedler, Susan Glazer |publisher=Routledge |year= 2003 |isbn=978-9057020261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, dance was absorbed into [[Chinese opera]] that started to take shape in the Song dynasty and became increasingly popular and further developed in the following dynasties, and dance as a separate performance art largely survives in folk traditions.  In more recent times, the art of dance in China has enjoyed a resurgence, and modern developments in Chinese dances are continuing apace.

==Traditional dance==
Many of the traditional dances have a long history. These may be folk dances, or dances that were once performed as rituals or as entertainment spectacle, and some may have been performed in the imperial court. Among the best-known of the Chinese traditional dances are the [[Dragon dance]] and [[Lion dance]], and both dances were known in earlier dynasties in various forms. A form of lion dance similar to today's lion dance was described as early as the Tang Dynasty, the modern form of the dragon dance however may be a more recent development.

[[File:Dragon dance at China 1.jpg|thumb|Dragon dance.]]
In some of the earliest dances recorded in China, dancers may have dressed as animal and mythical beasts, and during the Han Dynasty, some forms of the dragon dance were mentioned. The Dragon dances of Han Dynasty however do not resemble modern form of the dance. Dragon dances mentioned include a dance performed during a ritual to appeal for rain at time of drought as [[Chinese dragon]] was associated with rain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUwTxocaOGsC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Chinese Mythology |author= Lihui Yang, Deming An |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=107–108 |year= 2008 |isbn=978-0195332636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctext.org/chun-qiu-fan-lu/qiu-yu/ |title=《求雨》|work=Chinese Text Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; acts in the ''baixi'' variety shows where performers dressed up as a green dragon playing a flute, and acts where fish turned into a dragon.&lt;ref name="baixi"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YMT4U_abB6oC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Culture and Customs of China |author= Richard Gunde |page=104 |publisher= Greenwood |year= 2001 |isbn=978-0313361180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%AC%E8%B3%A6 |title=西京賦 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Dragon Dance uses light-weight structure manipulated by a dozen or so of men using poles at regular intervals along the length of the dragon, and some forms of the dragon can be very long and involve hundreds of performers.

[[File:8280 MGM Macau International Lion Dance Championship 2010.JPG|thumb|A lion dance]]
The [[Lion dance]] has been suggested to have been introduced from outside China as lion is not native to China, and the Chinese word for lion itself, ''shi'' (獅), may have been derived from the Persian word ''šer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xy45AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA201&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Music for a Lion Dance of the Song Dynasty |series=Musica Asiatica: volume 4| author= Laurence E.

A version of lion dance resembling modern lion dance was described by Tang poet Bai Juyi in his poem "Western Liang Arts" (西凉伎), where the dancers wear a lion costume made of a wooden head, a silk tail and furry body, with eyes gilded with gold and teeth plated with silver, and ears that moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shicimingju.com/baidu/list/63979.html |title=《西凉伎》 |quote=西凉伎，假面胡人假狮子。刻木为头丝作尾，金镀眼睛银贴齿。奋迅毛衣摆双耳，如从流沙来万里。紫髯深目两胡儿，鼓舞跳粱前致辞。 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main forms of Chinese Lion Dance, the Northern Lion and Southern Lion.

===Folk dances of Han Chinese===
Folk dances are important historically in the development of dance in China, some of the earliest dances in court rituals and ceremonies may have evolved from folk dances. Rulers from various dynasties collected folk dances, many of which eventually became court dances. However, at various times there had also been antipathy towards some folk dances and some emperors attempted to ban them.

Many of the folk dances are related to harvest and hunting and the ancient gods associated with them. For example, the Constellation Dance was performed to procure as much seed grain as there are stars in the sky, while the Harpoon Dance was associated to [[Fuxi]] who according to the mythology gave the Han people fish net, and the Plough Dance was connected to [[Shennong]], the god of agriculture.&lt;ref name=asian&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tCYjXOtkdgC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asian Dance |author=Janet Descutner |pages=99–100 |publisher= Chelsea House Publishing |isbn=978-1604134780 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of Chinese folk dance:
*[[Yangge]] - a dance that is common in Northern China.
*Lantern Dance - a dance found in Southern China.
*[[Er Ren Zhuan]]
[[File:China (3209957696) (2).jpg|thumb|Folk dance from a minority group in China.]]

===Folk dances of ethnic minorities in China===
There are many minority groups in China and each have their own dances that reflect their culture and way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=upFF1gbzMuIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Dances of the Chinese Minorities |author=Li Beida |publisher=China Intercontinental Press |year= 2006 |isbn=978-7508510057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few examples of their dances:
*[[Baishou Dance]] - a dance of the [[Tujia people]]
* Mongolian Bowl Dance (頂碗舞) - a dance where female dancers balance several bowls on their heads while dancing.
* Long Drum Dance (長鼓舞) - a dance of the [[Yao people]] which inspired the orchestral composition [[Dance of the Yao People]].
*[[Sanam (dance)|Sanam]] - an [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] dance.
*[[Lhamo]] - a Tibetan opera with dancing and singing

===Dance in theatre===
[[File:Beijing opera03.jpg|thumb|Dance as part of the [[Peking Opera]] in a performance of "Heavenly Lady Scatters Flowers" (天女散花).]]
In the entertainment centres called ''wazi'' during the Song Dynasty, various theatrical forms flourished and [[Chinese opera]] began to take shape, and dance started to become merged into opera. Dances such as "Dance Judgement" (舞判, also called the Dance of [[Zhong Kui]], 跳鐘馗) became opera pieces in the Ming Dynasty, and dances of the Song Dynasty such as Flapping the Flag (撲旗子). Other dances found in opera include the [[Sword dance#Sword Dance in China|Sword Dance]]. Chinese opera became very popular by the [[Yuan Dynasty]], and dances became absorbed into opera over the following centuries.

===Ritual dance===
Most early records of dances in China were ritual or ceremonial dances, and these dances formed the ''[[yayue]]'' which were considered to be of great importance in the court. These dances have largely disappeared from modern Han Chinese culture, although ritual dances are still found in some folk traditions and the cultures of ethnic minorities in China.

* Yi Dance ([[:zh:釋奠佾舞|佾舞]], literally "row dance") was originally a court dance, but adopted to form part of a Confucian ceremony. This ancient dance may be performed with rows of dancers holding pheasant feathers and red flutes in a square formation (Civil dance) or they may hold a shield and a battleaxe (Military Dance). The tradition of dancing holding items such as feather plumes dated back to Shang Dynasty.&lt;ref name="gunde"&gt;{{cite book |title=Culture and Customs of China |author= Richard Gunde |pages=104 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMT4U_abB6oC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Greenwood |year=2001 |isbn=978-0313361180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important ceremony is performed with 8 rows of 8 dancers (the Eight Yi Dance, 64 dancers in all). Originally dances were only performed in 6 rows of dancers (36 dancers in all) in Confucian temples as 8 rows were restricted to the Imperial court,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&amp;id=1142 Ba Yi (八佾)] According to ancient texts, this dance should only be offered in court. Confucius once complained of one such performance in the house of a noble: "The 8 yi dance is supposed to be performed in court, if he can bear to do this, what else can he bear to do?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wcbuFDI5cX8C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucius: His Life and Thought |author= Shigeki Kaizuka |page=134 |publisher=Dover Publications |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0486421391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but permission was later granted to perform the 8-row dance as well on the basis that he was given the title of a king by an emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ln2_BtBjVGYC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=State Sacrifices and Music in Ming China: Orthodoxy, Creativity and Expressiveness |author= Joseph Sui Ching Lam |pages=35–36 |publisher=State University of New York Press |year= 1998 |isbn=978-0791437063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernized version of such performances are presented for tourists at the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|confucian temple]] in [[Qufu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=174112&amp;ctNode=124&amp;mp=9 |title=The Melodies of the Emperors |work=Taiwan Today |author=Cindy Sui |date=September 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This confucian dance is also performed in [[Taiwan]] and Korea.

According to ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'', during the time of [[Emperor Yao]], a dance was created as an exercise for the people to keep healthy after a prolonged spell of wet weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5qDqKBsrLwC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=History and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine |author= Zhen'guo Wang, Peiping Xie |editor=Ping Chen|page=8 |publisher=IOS Press |year= 1997 |isbn=978-9051993240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally some Chinese dances may also have connection with the martial arts that were used to train fighting skills as well as for fitness, and some martial art exercises such as [[Tai chi]] or [[Qigong]] are similar to a choreographed dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last= Garripoli | first = Garri | title = Qigong: Essence of the Healing Dance | year =1999 | publisher = HCI | location =  | isbn = 1-55874-674-9 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[modern China]], it is common to find people using dance as a form of exercise in parks.

Western ballroom dancing became popular in the 20th century, previously it would not have been permissible for men and women from respectable families to dance together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YMT4U_abB6oC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Culture and Customs of China |author= Richard Gunde |pages=110–112 |publisher= Greenwood |year= 2001 |isbn=978-0313361180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popular in the 1940s Shanghai nightclubs, and early Communists leaders such as [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] were also avid Soviet-style ballroom dancers. Ballroom dancing however later disappeared after the [[Cultural Revolution]] to be replaced by massive group dances such as [[yangge]] dance. Ballroom dances however reappeared after the liberalisation of China later in the century, and it is now commonly found performed by many people in public parks in the morning as exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxXlIn99ef8C&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Globalization and Cultural Trends in China |author= Kang Liu |pages=87–88 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=2003|isbn=978-0824827595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Du "Cubisme"''''', also written '''''Du Cubisme''''', or '''''Du « Cubisme »''''' (and in English, '''''On Cubism''''' or '''''Cubism'''''), is a book written in 1912 by [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]]. This was the first major text on [[Cubism]], predating ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes]]'' by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (1913). The book is illustrated with black and white photographs of works by [[Paul Cézanne]] (1), Gleizes (5), Metzinger (5), [[Fernand Léger]] (5), [[Juan Gris]] (1), [[Francis Picabia]] (2), [[Marcel Duchamp]] (2), [[Pablo Picasso]] (1), [[Georges Braque]] (1), [[André Derain]] (1), and [[Marie Laurencin]] (2).

The highly influential treatise was published by [[:fr:Eugène Figuière|Eugène Figuière Éditeurs]], Collection "Tous les Arts", Paris, 1912. Prior to publication the book was announced in the ''Revue d'Europe et d'Amérique'', March 1912; for the occasion of the Salon de Indépendants during the spring of 1912 in the ''Gazette des beaux-arts'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k61200690/f393.image ''Les Salons de 1912'', Gazette des beaux-arts, VII, 4eme Périod, April 1912, p. 360], Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Paris-Journal'', October 26, 1912. It is thought to have appeared in November or early December 1912.&lt;ref&gt;William Stanley Rubin, Judith Cousins, ''Picasso and Braque, Pioneering Cubism'', Museum of Modern Art, New York, N.Y., 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke, On Cubism"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/contents Peter Brooke, ''On "Cubism" in context]&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently published in English and Russian in 1913.

A new edition was published in 1947 with an ''avant-propos'' by Gleizes and an epilogue by Metzinger. The artists took the occasion to reflect upon the evolution of this avant-garde artistic movement thirty three years after the appearance of the first publication of ''Du "Cubism"''.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, ''Du Cubisme'', R.

==Background==
The collaboration between Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger that would lead to the publication of ''Du "Cubisme"'' began during the aftermath of the 1910 [[Salon d'Automne]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, On Cubism" /&gt; At this massive Parisian exhibition, renowned for displaying the latest and most radical artistic tendencies, several artists including Gleizes, and in particular Metzinger, stood out from the rest. The utilization of a non-conventional form of geometry had permeated the works of these artists who ''a priori'' had little or no contact between one another.

In a review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne the poet [[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]] (1885-1961) announced the appearance of a new school of French painters who—in contrast with [[Fauvism|Les Fauves]] and [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]]—concentrated their attention on form rather than on color. A group formed following the exhibition that would include Gleizes, Metzinger, [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Robert Delaunay]] (a friend and associate of Metzinger since 1906). They convened regularly at the studio of le Fauconnier where he worked on his ambitious allegorical painting entitled ''L'Abondance''. "In this painting" writes Brooke, "the simplification of the representational form gives way to a new complexity in which foreground and background are united and the subject of the painting obscured by a network of interlocking geometrical elements".&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt; But it was Metzinger, a ''[[Montmartre|Montmartrois]]'' in close contact with [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] and its habitués—including [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Maurice Princet]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]—who introduced to Gleizes and the others of the group, with his ''[[Nu à la cheminée]] (Nu)'', 1910, an extreme species of 'analytic' Cubism (a term that would emerge years later to describe the 1910-1911 works of Picasso and Braque).

A few months later, during the spring of 1911 at the [[Salon des Indépendants]], the term "Cubisme" (derived by critics' attempts to  derogatorily ridicule the "geometrical follies" that gave a "cubic" appearance to their work) would officially be introduced to the public in relation to these artists exhibiting in the 'Salle 41', which included Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Léger, and Delaunay (but not Picasso or Braque, both absent from public exhibitions at the time resulting from a contract with the [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]] gallery).&lt;ref name="Brooke, On Cubism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51056.html Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Jean Metzinger, ''Tea Time (Woman with a Teaspoon)'', 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminal text written by Metzinger titled ''Note sur la peinture'', published during the fall of 1910, closely coinciding with Salon d'Automne, cites Picasso, Braque, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier as painters who were realising a 'total emancipation' ['affranchissement fondementale'] of painting.&lt;ref name="Brooke, On Cubism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, October–November 1910, "Note sur la peinture" Pan: 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of moving around an object in order to see it from different view-points later treated in ''Du "Cubisme"'' was a central idea of Metzinger's ''Note sur la Peinture''. Indeed, prior to Cubism painters worked from the limiting factor of a single view-point. Metzinger enunciated for the first time in ''Note sur la peinture'' the stimulating interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time. In that article, Metzinger notes that Braque and Picasso "discarded traditional perspective and granted themselves the liberty of moving around objects." This is the concept of "mobile perspective" that would tend towards the representation of the "total image"; a series of ideas that still today define the fundamental characteristics of Cubist art.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting the stage for ''Du "Cubisme"'', Metzinger's ''Note sur la peinture'' not only highlighted the works of Picasso and Braque, on the one hand, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay on the other. It was also a tactical selection that highlighted the fact that only Metzinger himself was positioned to write about all four. Metzinger, uniquely, had been closely acquainted with the Montmartre group (gallery cubists) and the burgeoning Salon Cubists simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vSvh8CytIC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=gleizes+baigneuses&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes%20baigneuses&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905-1914'', Yale University Press, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section d'Or==
{{main article|Section d'Or}}
The Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] was an exhibition organized by the Salon Cubists with the goal of bringing together all the most radical trends in painting and sculpture to date. Scheduled to take place at the Galerie La Boétie in Paris, October 1912, directly after the Salon d'Automne. Gleizes and Metzinger, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, published ''Du "Cubisme"'', a major defense of Cubism, resulting in the first theoretical essay on the new movement; predating ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques (The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations)]]'' by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (1913) and ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'' by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1920).&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert"&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf From ''Du Cubisme'', Paris, 1912, pp. 9-11, 13-14, 17-21, 25-32.

Before [[World War I]] the image of Cubism in France and abroad was founded on an extremely broad definition. "A more heterogeneous view of Cubism is certainly encouraged by the earliest promotional writings by its practitioners and associates", writes art historian Christopher Green:

:Picasso, Braque and Gris made almost no published statements on the subject before 1914. The first major text, ''Du cubisme'', was produced by two 'Salle 41' Cubists, Gleizes and Metzinger, in 1912; this was followed in 1913 by a far from systematic collection of reflections and commentaries by the poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire, who had been closely involved with Picasso (from 1905) and Braque (from 1907), but who gave as much attention to artists such as Delaunay, Picabia and Duchamp. Along with Léger he identified these three with a new tendency, which he labelled Orphic Cubism or Orphism and which he considered of special significance for the future. Painters such as Gleizes, Metzinger, Delaunay and Duchamp were powerful influences alongside Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger in the development of art related to Cubism in Russia, Czechoslovakia, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain, Spain and the USA.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Origins and application of the term'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salon d’Automne of 1912 led to a debate on Cubism in the Chambre des Députés: since the exhibition was held in the State’s [[Grand Palais]], the State was seen as subsidizing Cubism. It was against this background of public anger and revolt that Gleizes and Metzinger wrote ''Du "Cubisme"''. It was not solely an initiative to explain the new art, but an attempt to persuade the masses that their intentions were genuine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020542#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Cubist milieux: Kahnweiler’s Cubists and the Salon Cubists'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Salle 41' Cubists, through Gleizes, were closely associated with the [[Abbaye de Créteil]]; a group of writers and artists that included [[Alexandre Mercereau]], [[Jules Romains]], [[:fr:Georges Chennevière|Georges Chennevière]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]], [[Pierre Jean Jouve]], [[Georges Duhamel]], [[:fr:Luc Durtain|Luc Durtain]], [[Charles Vildrac]] and [[:fr:René Arcos|René Arcos]]. Many were interested in notion of 'duration' proposed by the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], according to which life is experienced subjectively as a continual movement in the direction of time, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. Other Cubists showed affinities with this concept, and to Bergson’s insistence on the 'elasticity' of our consciousness in both time and space.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neo-Symbolist writers Jacques Nayral and [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]] associated with the [[Unanimism|Unanimist movement]] in poetry. In his capacity as Figuière's editorial assistant Nayral had selected for publishing ''Du "Cubisme"'' and ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' as part of a projected series on the arts. These writers and other [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolists]] valued expression and subjective experience over an objective view of the physical world, embracing an antipositivist or antirationalist perspective.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Du "Cubisme"'' Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related the concept of 'multiple perspective' to the Bergsonian sense of time. The faceted treatment of physical objects and space blurred the distinctions (by means of 'passage') between subject and abstraction, between representation and non-objectivity. Effects of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] were used to convey a [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] sense of fluidity of consciousness. These preoccupations are in tune with [[Jules Romains]]’ theory of [[Unanimism]], which stresses the importance of collective feelings in the breaking down of barriers between people.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

One major innovation made by Gleizes and Metzinger was the inclusion of the concept of [[simultaneity]] into not just the theoretical framework of Cubism, but into the physical paintings themselves. It was in part a concept born out of a conviction based on their understanding of [[Henri Poincaré]] and Bergson that the separation or distinction between space and time should be comprehensively challenged. New philosophical and scientific ideas were emerging based on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], [[Riemannian geometry]] and the [[Relativism|relativity of knowledge]], contradicting notions of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;

Poincaré postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that 'understood' them and that no theory could be considered 'true'. "The things themselves are not what science can reach..., but only the relations between things. Outside of these relations there is no knowable reality", Poincaré wrote in his 1902 ''Science and Hypothesis''.

==Passages from ''Du "Cubisme"''==
Metzinger and Gleizes wrote with reference to [[non-Euclidean geometry]] in ''Du "Cubisme"''. It was argued that Cubism itself was not based on any geometrical theory, but that [[non-Euclidean geometry]] corresponded better than classical, or [[Euclidean geometry]], to what the Cubists were doing. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective; an understanding that would include and integrate the fourth dimension with [[3-space]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linda Henderson, The Fourth Dimension and NonEuclidean geometry in Modern Art, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

The reconstruction of the ''total image'' was left to the creative intuition of the observer. The spectator now played an active role. Taken at face value, each of the constituent parts (the fragments or facets) are just as important as the whole. Yet, the ''total image'', greater than the sum of the parts of which it is composed, now resides in the mind of the beholder. The dynamism of form implicit or explicit in the quantitative and qualitative properties of the work, set in motion by the artist, could be reassembled and understood in a dynamic process no longer solely restricted to the artist and subject matter.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;

The concept of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously (multiple or mobile perspective) ''"to seize it from several successive appearances, which fused into a single image, reconstitute in time"'' developed by Metzinger (in his 1911 article ''Cubisme et tradition''&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Cubisme et tradition'', Paris Journal, August 16, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;) and touched upon in ''Du "Cubisme"'', was not derived from [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], though it was certainly influenced in a similar way, through the work of [[Jules Henri Poincaré]] (particularly Science and Hypothesis). Poincaré's writings, unlike Einstein's, were well known leading up to 1912. Poincaré's widely read book, ''[[La Science et l'Hypothèse]]'', was published in 1902 (by Flammarion).

Gleizes and Metzinger render homage to Cézanne in their 1912 Cubist manifesto ''Du "Cubisme"'':

:To understand Cézanne is to foresee Cubism. Henceforth we are justified in saying that between this school and previous manifestations there is only a difference of intensity, and that in order to assure ourselves of this we have only to study the methods of this realism, which, departing from the superficial reality of Courbet, plunges with Cézanne into profound reality, growing luminous as it forces the unknowable to retreat. (Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, 1912)&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, ''Du "Cubisme"'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, T. Fisher Unwin, London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Metzinger and Gleizes, Cubism was nothing less than an extension of a tradition in painting:

:Some maintain that such a tendency distorts the curve of tradition. Do they derive their arguments from the future or the past? The future does not belong to them, as far as we are aware, and one be singularly ingenuous to seek to measure that which exists by that which exists no longer.

:Unless we are to condemn all modern painting, we must regard cubism as legitimate, for it continues modern methods, and we should see in it the only conception of pictorial art now possible. In other words, at this moment cubism is painting."&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;

The artist endeavours to enclose the unmeasurable sum of the affinities perceived between the visible manifestation and the tendency of his mind, write Metzinger and Gleizes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let the picture imitate nothing; let it nakedly present its ''raison d'être''. We should indeed be ungrateful were we to deplore the absence of all those things flowers, or landscape, or faces whose mere reflection it might have been. Nevertheless, let us admit that the reminiscence of natural forms cannot be absolutely banished; not yet, at all events. An art cannot be raised to the level of a pure effusion at the first step.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This is understood by the cubist painters, who indefatigably study pictorial form and the space which it engenders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This space we have negligently confounded with pure visual space or with Euclidian space. Euclid, in one of his postulates, speaks of the indeformability of figures in movement, so we need not
insist upon this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As for visual space, we know that it results from the agreement of the sensations of convergence and "accommodation" in the eye.&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The convergence of classical perspective to evoke depth is treated in ''Du "Cubisme"'' as an illusion. "Moreover, we know that even the most serious infractions of the rules of perspective by no means detract from the spatiality of a painting. The Chinese painters evoke space, although they exhibit a strong partiality for ''divergence''."

&lt;blockquote&gt;To establish pictorial space, we must have recourse to tactile and motor sensations, indeed to all our faculties. It is our whole personality, contracting or dilating, that transforms the plane of the picture. Since in reaction this plane reflects the viewer's personality back upon his understanding, pictorial space may be defined as a sensible passage between two subjective spaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The forms which are situated within this space spring from a dynamism which we profess to command. In order that our intelligence may possess it, let us first exercise our sensibility. There are only ''nuances''; form appears endowed with properties identical with those of colour. It can be tempered or augmented by contact with another form; it can be destroyed or emphasized; it is multiplied or it disappears. An ellipse may change its circumference because it is inscribed in a polygon. A form which is more emphatic than the surrounding forms may govern the whole picture, may imprint its own effigy upon everything. Those picture-makers who minutely imitate one or two leaves in order that all the leaves of a tree may seem to be painted, show in a clumsy fashion that they suspect this truth. An illusion, perhaps, but we must take it into account. The eye quickly interests the mind in its errors. These analogies and contrasts are capable of all good and all evil; the masters felt this when they tried to compose with pyramids, crosses, circles, semicircles, etc.&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Cubists, according to the 1912 manifesto written by Gleizes and Mtezinger, revealed a new manner of regarding light:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to them, to illuminate is to reveal; to colour is to specify the mode of revelation. They call luminous that which strikes the imagination, and dark that which the imagination has to penetrate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We do not mechanically connect the sensation of white with the idea of light, any more than we connect the sensation of black with the idea of darkness. We admit that a black jewel, even if of a dead black, may be more luminous than the white or pink satin of its case. Loving light, we refuse to measure it, and we avoid the geometrical ideas of the focus and the ray, which imply the repetition-contrary to the principle of variety which guides us-of bright planes and sombre intervals in a given direction. Loving colour, we refuse to limit it, and subdued or dazzling, fresh or muddy, we accept all the possibilities contained between the two extreme points of the spectrum, between the cold and the warm tone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Here are a thousand tints which issue from the prism, and hasten to range themselves in the lucid region forbidden to those who are blinded by the immediate...&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are two methods of regarding the division of the canvas, in addition to the inequality of parts being granted as a prime condition. Both methods are based on the relationship between color and form:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the first, all the parts are connected by a rhythmic convention which is determined by one of them. This—its position on the canvas matters little—gives the painting a centre from which the gradations of colour proceed, or towards which they tend, according as the maximum or minimum of intensity resides there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

According to the second method, in order that the spectator, himself free to establish unity, may apprehend all the elements in the order assigned to them by creative intuition, the properties of each portion must be left independent, and the plastic continuum must be broken into a thousand surprises of light and shade. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Every inflection of form is accompanied by a modification of colour, and every modification of colour gives birth to a form.&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gleizes and Metzinger continue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing real outside ourselves; there is nothing real except the coincidence of a sensation and an individual mental direction. Far be it from us to throw any doubts upon the existence of the objects which strike our senses; but, rationally speaking, we can only have certitude with regard to the images which they produce in the mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It therefore amazes us when well-meaning critics try to explain the remarkable difference between the forms attributed to nature and those of modern painting by a desire to represent things not as they appear, but as they are. As they are! How are they, what are they? According to them, the object possesses an absolute form, an essential form, and we should suppress chiaroscuro and traditional perspective in order to present it. What simplicity! An object has not one absolute form; it has many. It has as many as there are planes in the region of perception. What these writers say is marvelously applicable to geometrical form. Geometry is a science; painting is an art. The geometer measures; the painter savours. The absolute of the one is necessarily the relative of the other; if logic takes fright at this idea, so much the worse! Will logic ever prevent a wine from being different in the retort of the chemist and in the glass of the drinker?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We are frankly amused to think that many a novice may perhaps pay for his too literal comprehension of the remarks of one cubist, and his faith in the existence of an Absolute Truth, by painfully juxtaposing the six faces of a cube or the two ears of a model seen in profile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Does it ensue from this that we should follow the example of the impressionists and rely upon the senses alone? By no means. We seek the essential, but we seek it in our personality and not in a sort of eternity, laboriously divided by mathematicians and philosophers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Moreover, as we have said, the only difference between the impressionists and ourselves is a difference of intensity, and we do not wish it to be otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There are as many images of an object as there are eyes which look at it; there are as many essential images of it as there are minds which comprehend it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But we cannot enjoy in isolation; we wish to dazzle others with that which we daily snatch from the world of sense, and in return we wish others to show us their trophies. From a reciprocity of concessions arise those mixed images, which we hasten to confront with artistic creations in order to compute what they contain of the objective; that is of the purely conventional.&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==English edition==
Reviewing the English edition, ''Cubism'', [[T. Fisher Unwin]], 1913, a critic in ''The Burlington magazine for Connoisseurs'' writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the authors of this book "painting is not—or is no longer—the art of imitating an object by means of lines and colours, but the art of giving our instinct a plastic consciousness". Many will follow them so far who will be unable or unwilling to follow them further on the road to cubism. Yet even to the unwilling their book will prove suggestive. Their theory of painting is founded upon a philosophic idealism. It is impossible to paint things "as they are", because it is impossible to know how and what they "really" are. Decoration must go by the board; decorative work is the antithesis of the picture, which "bears its pretext, the reason for its existence, within it". The authors are not afraid of the conclusions which they find resulting from their premisses. The ultimate aim of painting is to touch the crowd; but it is no business of the painter to explain himself to the crowd. On the contrary, it is the business of the crowd to follow the painter in his transubstantiation of the object, "so that the most accustomed eye has some difficulty in discovering it". Yet the authors disapprove of "fantastic occultism" no less than of the negative truth conveyed by the conventional symbols of the academic painters. Indeed, the object of the whole book is to condemn systems of all kinds, and to defend cubism as the liberator from systems, the means of expression of the one truth, which is the truth in the artist's mind. The short but able and suggestive essay is followed by twenty-five half-tone illustrations, from Cézanne to Picabia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/burlingtonmagazi24londuoft#page/354/mode/2up ''Cubism'', Reviews, The Burlington magazine for Connoisseurs, Volume XXIV — October 1913 to March 1914, p. 335]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Annual Gen Con EN World RPG Awards''' (or '''ENnie Awards''') are annual, fan-based awards for [[role-playing game]] products and publishers hosted at [[Gen Con]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. The name of the award is derived from the [[EN World]] web site that has hosted the awards since their inception in 2001. The ENnies were created by [[Russ Morrissey]] and [[Eric Noah]] and have been run and owned by [[Russ Morrissey]] since 2001.

The awards were initially focused on ''[[d20 System]]'' products and publishers and were a solely [[internet]]-based event (hosted by EN World). They have since broadened their scope to include all forms of roleplaying, and since 2002 have been announced at a live awards ceremony at Gen Con.
 
In 2007, the ENnies were sponsored for the first time by a corporation, [[Your Games Now]]. In 2008 they were sponsored by [http://www.avatarart.com Avatar Art]. In 2010, 2011, and 2012 they were sponsored by both [[Indie Press Revolution]] and [[DriveThruRPG]]. From 2013-2016  they were sponsored by [[DriveThruRPG]].  In 2015, [[Campaign Coins]] made the medals as a sponsorship.  In 2017, [[Lone Wolf Development]] became a sponsor.

The ENnies comprise two rounds. In the first round, publishers submit their products for nomination by that year's five  democratically elected judges. As of 2017, judges have had a two-year term limit, but are permitted to return after a year off. In the second round, the public votes on the nominated products, with the results being presented live at [[Gen Con]].

'''''Essays in Radical Empiricism''''' ('''''ERE''''') by [[William James]] is a collection edited and published posthumously by his colleague and biographer [[Ralph Barton Perry]] in 1912.  It was assembled from ten out of a collection of twelve reprinted journal articles published from 1904–1905 which James had deposited in August, 1906, at the [[Harvard University Library]] and the Harvard Department of Philosophy for supplemental use by his students. Perry replaced two essays from the original list with two others, one of which didn't exist at the earlier time.

Because ERE is a collection of essays written over a period of time, and ultimately not selected or collated by their author, it is not a systematic exposition of his thought&lt;ref&gt;ERE Harvard critical edition, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; even though Perry suggests otherwise in his preface.  This circumstance, in addition to the evolution of James own philosophic stance, has contributed to a wide variance in understanding, misunderstanding, and critical opinion of radical empiricism.

==History==

===Unpublished 1906 collection===
This is the original collection of articles deposited by James (as bound by Harvard about 1912), with dates of journal publication:&lt;ref&gt;ERE Harvard critical edition, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Does Consciousness Exist?" (September 1904)
#"La Notion de Conscience" (French language, June, 1905)
#"A World of Pure Experience" (Sept–October, 1904)
#"The Pragmatic Method" (December, 1904)
#"The Thing and Its Relations" (January, 1905)
#"The Essence of Humanism" (March, 1905)
#"How Two Minds Can Know One Thing" (March, 1905)
#"Is Radical Empiricism Solipsistic?" (April, 1905)
#"The Place of Affectional Facts in a World of Pure Experience" (May, 1905)
#"The Experience of Activity" (January, 1905)
#"Humanism and Truth" (October, 1904)
#"Humanism and Truth Once More" (April, 1905)

===James' 1907 list===
In mid-1907 James composed a list of 15 essays for an anticipated book titled "Essays in Radical Empiricism".&lt;ref&gt;ERE Harvard critical edition, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the essays in the 1906 collection are not present on this list. "The Pragmatic Method" had been adapted as chapter three for James' book ''Pragmatism''. "Humanism and Truth Once More" was combined with "Humanism and Truth" in the 1909 book ''The Meaning of Truth'' (MT).

James' plans for a book on radical empiricism based on this list never came to fruition.  ''Pragmatism'' was published in June 1907 and was well received.  In the spring of 1909 James began to assemble material for a follow-up book called ''The Meaning of Truth''.  His 1907 list fell victim to the needs of the immediate book. The two strikeout lines were made by James on his actual list. The notes to the right of the titles have been added to clarify how the essays were later used.

#"The Function of Cognition" (1885) → MT
#"The Knowing of Things Together" (1895) → extracted "The Tigers in India" → MT
#"Does Consciousness Exist?"
#"A World of Pure Experience" → extracted "The Relation Between Knower and Known" → MT
#"La Notion de Conscience"
#"The Essence of Humanism" → MT
#"How Two Minds Can Know One Thing"
#"Is Radical Empiricism Solipsistic?
#"The Place of Affectional Facts in a World of Pure Experience"
#"Humanism and Truth" → plus excerpt of "Humanism and Truth Once More" → MT
#&lt;s&gt;"The Thing and Its Relations"&lt;/s&gt; published 1909 as Appendix A, ''A Pluralistic Universe'' (PLU)
#"Controversy About Truth" (1907)
#"One Word More About Truth" (1907) → MT
#"Pratt On Truth" (1907) → MT
#&lt;s&gt;"The Experience of Activity"&lt;/s&gt; published 1909 as Appendix B, PLU

===Perry's 1912 book===
After James' death, Ralph Perry thought it appropriate to assemble a book on radical empiricism, and mined the earlier lists to come up with this one:

#"Does Consciousness Exist?"
#"A World of Pure Experience"
#"The Thing and Its Relations"
#"How Two Minds Can Know One Thing"
#"The Place of Affectional Facts in a World of Pure Experience"
#"The Experience of Activity"
#"The Essence of Humanism"
#"La Notion de Conscience"
#"Is Radical Empiricism Solipsistic?
#"Mr. Pitkin's Refutation of Radical Empiricism" (1906, Perry addition)
##"A Reply to Mr. Pitkin" (1907)
#"Humanism and Truth Once More"
#"Absolutism and Empiricism" (1884, Perry addition)

Harvard added one more article, "Controversy About Truth", from James' 1907 list to its 1976 critical edition.

'''''Girl, Interrupted''''' is a best-selling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981084,00.html The Unconfessional Confessionalist], [[Time Magazine]], July 11, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[1993 in literature|1993]] [[memoir]] by [[Americans|American]] author [[Susanna Kaysen]], relating her experiences as a young woman in a [[psychiatric hospital]] in the 1960s after being diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]]. The memoir's title is a reference to the [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] painting ''[[Girl Interrupted at Her Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117759846.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 Girl, Interrupted], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], December 10, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing the novel ''Far Afield'', Kaysen began to recall her almost two years at [[McLean Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5503309_ITM A teenager's interrupted life], [[Knight Ridder]] Newspapers, December 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained her file from the hospital with the help of a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4491115_ITM |title=''Girl, Interrupted'' (Reel Life) |journal=Clinical Psychiatry News |date=August 1, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218150247/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4491115_ITM |archivedate=February 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the memoir was adapted into a [[Girl, Interrupted (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Winona Ryder]], [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Brittany Murphy]]. It was directed by [[James Mangold]].

==Plot==
In April 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen is admitted to McLean Hospital, in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], after attempting [[suicide]] by overdosing on pills. She denies that it was a suicide attempt to a psychiatrist, who suggests she take time to regroup in McLean, a private mental hospital. Susanna is diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]], and her stay extends to 18 months&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5486864_ITM Susanna Kaysen finds stability in examining youthful 'insanity'], [[Knight Ridder|Knight-Ridder Newspapers]], August 4, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the proposed couple of weeks.

Fellow patients Polly, Cynthia, Lisa Rowe, Lisa Cody, Georgina and Daisy contribute to Susanna's experiences at McLean as she describes their personal issues and how they come to cope with the time they must spend in the hospital. Susanna also introduces the reader to particular staff members, including Valerie, Dr. Wick and Mrs. McWeeney. Susanna and the other girls are eventually informed that the recently released Daisy committed [[suicide]] on her birthday. Daisy's death deeply saddens the girls and they hold a prolonged moment of silence in her memory.

Susanna reflects on the nature of her illness, including difficulty making sense of visual patterns, and suggests that [[sanity]] is a falsehood constructed to help the "healthy" feel "normal" in comparison. She also questions how doctors treat [[mental illness]], and whether they are treating the [[brain]] or the [[mind]]. During her stay in the ward, Susanna also undergoes a period of [[depersonalization]], where she bites open the flesh on her hand after she becomes terrified that she has "lost her bones". She develops a frantic obsession with the verification of this proposed reality and even insists on seeing an X-ray of herself to make sure. This hectic moment is described with shorter, choppy sentences that show Kaysen's state of mind and thought processes as she went through them. Also, during a trip to the dentist with Valerie, Susanna becomes frantic after she wakes from the general [[anesthesia]], when no one will tell her how long she was unconscious, and she fears that she has lost time. Like the incident with her bones, Kaysen here also rapidly spirals into a panicky and obsessive state that is only ultimately calmed with medication.

After leaving McLean, Susanna mentions that she kept in touch with Georgina and eventually saw Lisa, now a single mother who was about to board the subway with her toddler son and seemed, although quirky, to be sane.

===Structure===
''Girl, Interrupted'' does not follow a linear [[Narrative structure|storyline]], but instead the author provides personal stories through a series of short descriptions of events and personal reflections on why she was placed in the hospital. She begins by talking about the concept of a parallel universe and how easy it is to slip into one, comparing insanity to an alternate world. She discusses how some people fall into insanity gradually and others just snap. Kaysen also details the doctor's visit before first going to the hospital and the taxi ride there at the beginning of the book before launching into the chronicles of her time at the hospital.

==Characters==
There are two main groups of characters, the patients and the staff. In addition to those there are her parents, her boyfriend and various other minor characters such as her former boss.

===Patients===
;Susanna Kaysen
:The autobiographical main character, Susanna Kaysen is admitted to a psychiatric ward to be treated for [[borderline personality disorder]] following a suicide attempt. She voluntarily admits herself after a short consultation with a psychiatrist who is also an acquaintance of the family. She is told that she will only be staying there for a few weeks, but it turns out to be one and a half years instead. Throughout the book, she frequently contrasts the time of the consultation, twenty minutes, to the time she ended up spending there.
;Lisa Rowe
:Lisa is diagnosed as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]], but whether she actually is one is left open to interpretation. Lisa periodically escapes from the hospital, only to be found a day or two later and re-admitted. She is usually happy enough to be back though she does put up a fight when restrained. She is an ex-junkie who never sleeps and barely eats, and enjoys making trouble for the staff. She apparently takes some pride in her diagnosis. Although she has a therapist assigned to her, she never actually sees him. Lisa is not in contact with her family except her brother, but the extent of their contact is not described. She also has a lawyer, though it appears he is mostly used to threaten the staff if she doesn't get what she wants. Her behavior is wildly unpredictable, and while she can be kind, she is also capable of cruelty towards the other patients. For example, Lisa has an ongoing rivalry with Lisa Cody that ends in Lisa Cody reverting to drugs.
;Polly Clark
:Polly is a disfigured patient who was hospitalised for [[schizophrenia]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Polly has severe scarring on her body, the result of setting herself on fire. According to Kaysen, because of the sheer guts it took to actually do it, Polly is highly respected for her courage, to the extent that none of the patients will ask why she did it. During her first year at the hospital, she appears calm and even cheerful: "Life was hellish, she knew that. But, her smile hinted, she'd burned all that out of her."&lt;ref name=Virago&gt;Susana Kaysen, ''Girl, Interrupted'' (Virago Press, 2000 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; But one day she suddenly breaks down and begins to scream inconsolably, as if realizing for the first time her appearance and the permanency of it. Kaysen then realizes that while the other patients might be released from the hospital, Polly is trapped forever in her scarred body.
;Georgina Tuskin
:Hospitalized for [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref name=Virago/&gt; Georgina is Susanna's roommate at the institution. The two of them are considered the healthiest patients on the ward and are good friends throughout the book. Georgina apparently experienced her first symptoms after an episode in a movie theatre where she suddenly felt as if the darkness had surrounded her completely. It is not clear what the immediate reason for her diagnosis is. She also has a boyfriend in the hospital named Wade. 
;Lisa Cody
:Lisa is admitted to the ward after Susanna, and from her first days there she looks up to Lisa Rowe. She, too, is diagnosed as a sociopath, though Rowe questions this and is clearly annoyed that she is no longer the only sociopath there. A former drug addict like Rowe, she tries hard to defend herself from Lisa Rowe's accusations that she isn't "real". She eventually escapes and is apparently found by Lisa Rowe during one of her escapes from the hospital. Lisa tells the other girls with pride that Lisa Cody has become a "real" drug addict. Her fate after her escape is not described any further.
;Daisy Randone
:Daisy is a thin girl who arrives before Thanksgiving each year, staying through Christmas. She has a single room, where she spends most of her time. The other girls think she is addicted to [[laxatives]]. She eats only chicken, and does so only in her room. However, after letting Lisa into her room, Lisa reports back to the rest of them that she only needs the laxatives because of all of the chicken. She peels off the meat and keeps the carcasses, saying that when she has 14 carcasses, it's time to leave the hospital, possibly due to [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. Daisy's father visits her quite often, and it is implied he has [[incest]]uous feelings for her. Daisy eventually commits suicide on her birthday. Susanna describes her as "sexy" and says Daisy had a spark that the rest of the girls lack. Daisy is reclusive and often refuses to be social. She hates it when anyone goes near her and is hostile when people approach her. However, she does allow Lisa to enter her room. Sometimes they even share cigarettes, indicating that Daisy does respect Lisa out of all the other patients on the ward.
;Torrey
:Torrey is a former drug addict. She was put into the ward after her parents discovered her promiscuity. She is the best friend of all the fellow patients. Her parents take her out against her will, and take her back to [[Mexico]], where she believes she will become an [[amphetamine]] addict again. She describes Mexico, saying "being in Mexico means being dead and shooting speed to feel like you're not quite dead" (Kaysen, 97). The girls do try to help her with an escape plan and pool their money for her to help her, but eventually that plan is ruined, partly by Torrey herself, as she is too afraid to do it, and partly by Valerie after she gives Torrey a cup of [[thorazine]] just prior to her departure to calm her down. Though she only appears for a short time she is an important character. Kaysen distinguishes between those put there indefinitely by parents willing to pay without questioning the progress of their treatment and those whose parents are not willing to do so. Torrey is used as an example of the latter group.
;Alice Calais
:At first Alice seems quiet and, in Kaysen's words, "not too crazy"; but after about a month she breaks down and is taken to maximum security. When the girls go to visit her they find that she has painted herself and the walls in her seclusion room with her own feces. Most of the other patients believe she was "raised in a closet" because she is ignorant about the trivial things in life. For example, she has never tasted honey and doesn't know how it tastes. She is also completely unaware that her last name is a [[Calais|well-known location in France]] and is overwhelmed in awe when she hears of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. It is not explained what happens to her after the girls visit her.
;Wade
:Wade, Georgina's boyfriend, is also a patient. Wade entertains the female patients with stories about his father, who he claims to be a CIA agent. He is prone to violent outbursts, which eventually results in his being moved to the maximum-security ward.
;Cynthia Crowley
:A severely depressive patient who undergoes weekly [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name=Virago/&gt; There are only a few references to her in the book and she isn't a major character in it.

===Staff===
;Valerie
:The head nurse on  the ward. She works there during the day and though she can be strict she is generally liked by the patients and Kaysen in particular. She is described as down to earth and rarely uses the psychiatric terms used by the therapists, which is something that Susanna herself despises. Kaysen recalls her as honest and direct. 
;Mrs. McWeeney
:The evening nurse on the ward. Described as the exact opposite of Valerie and very much disliked by the patients. Kaysen recalls her as "clearly nuts". Valerie does not like her and tends to ignore her, although she does describe her as a professional when the patients complain to her. Although the patients don't like her, they recognize that she needs to earn a living and that she has to work somewhere for that to happen.
;Dr. Wick
:The [[consultant psychiatrist]]. She is described as very old-fashioned and easy to embarrass. Susanna purposely tries to embarrass her, deliberately saying things that she knows Dr. Wick will react to, during their sessions together. She has previously worked in Africa and her direct contact with the patients is very limited, talking to them for only a matter of minutes in a session.
;Melvin
:Kaysen's late therapist and analyst. Susanna says that the two of them used to be good friends and that she once enjoyed sessions with him. According to her, he was old, balding, and slightly unattractive. Susanna would go into his office sometimes and just sit there in silence because there wasn't very much silence in the hospital and she needed a break. However, this relationship was short-lived; Melvin rolled into the hospital parking lot, and, when greeted enthusiastically by Susanna, refused to entertain her. Her opinion of him spiraled downward from that point.

'''Hybrid arts''' is a contemporary art movement in which artists work with frontier areas of science and emerging technologies.  Artists work with fields such as biology, robotics, physical sciences, experimental interface technologies (such as speech, gesture, face recognition), artificial intelligence, and information visualization.  They address the research in many ways such as undertaking new research agendas, visualizing results in new ways, or critiquing the social implications of the research.  The worldwide community has developed new kinds of art festivals, information sources, organizations, and university programs to explore these new arts.
'''Hybrid arts''' is also the name of a non profit Arts education company in the United Kingdom. Set up in 2003 after a four-year development period to create a new species of training and arts engagement provider in the cultural industries...see Hybrid:arts

==Overview/ history of the term==
Many artists are responding to the central role scientific and technological research plays in contemporary culture. They are going beyond merely using technological tools and gadgets (e.g. computers) in their work to engage deeply with the processes of research. They are creating revolutionary art at the frontiers of [[Scientific method|scientific research]]. They see art as an independent zone of research that pursues areas of science and research ignored by mainstream [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]]. They are developing technologies that would be rejected by the marketplace but are nonetheless culturally critical. They are pursuing inquiries that are seen as too controversial, too wacky, too improbable, too speculative for regular science and technology. Their theoretical orientation ranges from celebration of human curiosity to critique of science's arrogance. They enter into the processes in research at all stages: setting research agendas, development of research processes, visualization, interpretations of findings, and education of the public.

There has been some confusion over the last years of what to call this kind of art that crosses so many disciplines. It is descended from computer and [[internet art]] but reaches out to cover many new disciplines. [[Ars Electronica]], which is considered one of leading world organizations concerned with experimental arts, decided three years ago to create a new category to encompass these kinds of arts. Every year they host an international competition for artists working in these experimental fields. They decided to use the name 'Hybrid Arts'. The worldwide community of artists, theorists, and journalists interested in this art are increasingly using this term. Here is a quote from their web site that offers their definition and a preliminary list of kinds of art covered.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The “Hybrid Art” category is dedicated specifically to today’s hybrid and transdisciplinary projects and approaches to [[New media art|media art]]. Primary emphasis is on the process of fusing different media and genres into new forms of artistic expression as well as the act of transcending the boundaries between art and research, art and social/political [[activism]], art and [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Jurors will be looking very closely at how dynamically the submitted work defies classification in a single one of the Prix categories of long standing.

This category is open to all types of current works in any form:

 * Autonomic Installations and Artworks&lt;br /&gt;
 * Autonomous Sculptures&lt;br /&gt;
 * Performance and Stageprojects&lt;br /&gt;
 * Media architectures&lt;br /&gt;
 * Media based Interventions in public spaces&lt;br /&gt;
 * Mechatronics / Kinetics / Robotics&lt;br /&gt;
 * Location-based and geospatial storytelling&lt;br /&gt;
 * [[Multi-user]] environments&lt;br /&gt;
 * Annotation software tools&lt;br /&gt;
 * Artificial Life&lt;br /&gt;
 * Transgenic Art&lt;br /&gt;
 * [[Software art|Software Art]], Generative Art&lt;br /&gt;
 --- Ars Electronica Website [http://www.aec.at/prix_categories_en.php?cat=Hybrid%20Art Ars Electronica Website]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many new support systems have evolved to nurture, show, and interpret this kind of art. New educational programs have been developed. Books have been written.

==Sample of the research fields addressed in hybrid arts==
-Genetics, Bioengineering, [[stem cell]]s, proteomics &lt;br /&gt;
-Art and Biology of Living Systems: microorganisms, plants, animals, ecology&lt;br /&gt;
-Human Biology: the body, bionics, [[Body modification|body manipulation]], brain &amp; body processes, body imaging, and medicine&lt;br /&gt;
-Physical Sciences: [[particle physics]], [[atomic energy]], geology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, [[space science]], nanotechnology, [[materials science]] &lt;br /&gt;
-Kinetics, Electronics, Robotics: [[physical computing]], [[ubiquitous computing]], mixed reality&lt;br /&gt;
-Alternative Interfaces: motion, gesture, touch, [[facial expression]], speech, [[wearable computing]], [[3D audio effect|3-d sound]], and VR
-Code: algorithms, software art, genetic art, [[Artificial life|A-life]], artificial intelligence&lt;br /&gt;
-Information Systems: databases, surveillance, RFID/barcodes, synthetic cinema, information visualization&lt;br /&gt;
Telecommunications: telephone, radio, telepresence, web art, mobiles, locative media

==Festivals, shows, conferences related to hybrid arts==
Since much of the art does not fit into historical categories such as painting or sculpture, many museums and art festivals did not show the work.  Curators who were interested created new kinds of festivals, competitions, museums and shows to present the work.  Examples include Ars Electronica (note especially Interactive and Hybrid priz competitions. ISEA (International symposium of Electronic Arts), V2 - DEAF (Dutch Electronic Arts Festival), VIDA - Art &amp; Artificial Life International Competition.  Ars Electronica offers a festival each year that addresses transdisciplinary themes.Both artists and scientists are invited to speak at the conferences. Recent exhibitions focused on themes such as New Sex, Simplicity and Privacy.

==Organizations, information sources, art/science collaboration support, educational programs==
The hybrid arts community also established organizations and information sources to promote, disseminate, and interpret these new art activities. There are hundreds of such organizations of which a few examples are offered here. The external links show where to get more information.  The Journal Leonardo published by MIT Press has a 40-year history of ‘promoting and documenting work at the intersection of the arts, sciences, and technology, and… encouraging and stimulating collaboration between artists, scientists, and technologists.’ The organization also has web sites, abstract services, and collaborates with other organizations in presenting conferences.  The website  We Make Money Not Art covers media/research conferences, interviews artists/researchers, and discusses developments in various fields from activism and biology to surveillance and wearables.

Other organizations offer public events and facilitate the process of artists collaborating with researchers.  For example, [[Arts Catalyst|The Arts Catalyst]] in the UK seeks to ‘extend the practice of artists engaging with scientific processes, facilities and technologies in order to reveal and illuminate the social, political and cultural contexts that brought them into being’ through public symposia, exhibitions, and commissions.  SymbioticA in Australia is an ‘artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning and critique of life sciences.’ It ‘provides an opportunity for researchers to pursue curiosity-based explorations free of the demands and constraints associated with the current culture of scientific research.’ The arts lab is sponsored by the medicine department of a university.  Other examples include the Art and Genomics Centre(NL), the [[LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial]] (ES) and Artists in Labs (CH) program.

New forms of educational programs are being established at universities around the world.  Students are expected to master topics in art, media, and research disciplines. For example, the  U of Washington’s DXArts program offers a ‘creative research convergence zone for intrepid artists and scholars’ who seek to reach out beyond the arts.  The Conceptual/Information Arts (CIA) is the "experimental program within the Art Department at San Francisco State University dedicated to preparing artists and media experimentors to work at the cutting edge of science and technology".  Courses cover topics such as art &amp; biology, robotics, locative media, and physical computing.

'''Imamzadeh Mausoleum''' is mosque on the Imamli street in the central part of the city of [[Shamakhi]]. It is the oldest mosque in the territory of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]. The mosque was registered by [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan Republic]] as a historical and cultural monument of the country.

==History==

[[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov]] mentioned in his famous Gulistani-Iram work in 1841: ''"In many ways, the ruins of the village and the high-ranking three imamzadehs in the cities of Shamakhi, Ganja and Barda, Imamzadeh in the Bulbule village show that this country has always been the homeland of the religious elders"''&lt;ref&gt;Gulistani-Iram, p.35-37&lt;/ref&gt;

The mausoleum was built on the tomb of one of the sons of the fourth imam, Zeynalabdin – Allama Seyyid Mohammed Saleh al-Madirris. Also, Seyid Mirmehdi Agha Seyidali oghlu, who had worked here as [[akhund]] for a long time, was buried here in 1911. The mosque was built in 1370 and was reconstructed on the basis of project of Zivar bey Ahmadbayov in 1910–1917. Generally, the mosque is supposed to be built five times. In 1991 it was restored under leadership of akhund, Haji Elshan Rustamov. It is possible that 400 people can worship here at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;K.Abdullayev "Azərbaycanda müqəddəs ziyarətgahlar", Bakı, "Çinar-Çap", 2007, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosque complex consists of three parts – pilgrimage (Allama Seyyid Mohammed Saleh al-Madirris was buried there), place of worship and hoseyniyeh.

'''Italian Baroque art''' is a term that is used here to refer to [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque art|painting and sculpture in the Baroque manner]] executed over a period that extended from the late sixteenth to the mid eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''Baroque'' may derive from the Portuguese word ''barocco'' which means an irregularly shaped pearl.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
During the [[Counter Reformation]], the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63), in which the [[Roman Catholic Church]] answered many questions of internal reform raised by both [[Protestants]] and by those who had remained inside the Catholic Church, addressed the representational arts in a short and somewhat oblique passage in its decrees. This was subsequently interpreted and expounded by clerical authors such as [[Molanus]], the Flemish theologian, who demanded that paintings and sculptures in church contexts should depict their subjects clearly and powerfully, and with decorum, without the stylistic airs of [[Mannerism]].

==The emergence of Italian baroque painting==
Two of the leading figures in the emergence of Baroque painting in Italy were [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]] and [[Annibale Carracci]]

Caravaggio (1571–1610), born and trained in [[Milan]], stands as one of the most original and influential contributors to late sixteenth century and early seventeenth century European painting. Controversially, he not only painted figures, even those of classical or religious themes, in contemporary clothing, or as ordinary living men and women, but his inclusion of the seedier side of life (such as dirty feet) was in marked contrast to the usual trend of the time which was to idealise the religious or classical figure by treating it with the decorum considered appropriate to its status. He used [[tenebrism]] and stark contrasts between partially lit figures and dark backgrounds to dramatic effect. Some of his famous paintings are 'The Calling of St. Mathew', 'St. Thomas', 'The Conversion of St. Paul', 'The Entombment', and 'The Crowning of the Christ'. His use of light and shadow was emulated by the [[Caravaggisti]], the followers of Caravaggio, such as [[Orazio Gentileschi]](1563–1639), [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] (1592-1652/3),&lt;ref&gt;[[Artemisia Gentileschi]] was the daughter of the painter [[Orazio Gentileschi]], and, unusually for the time, was a painter in her own right. Amongst her famous paintings are ‘Judith Slaying Holofernes’ and ‘Self Portrait’ in the Royal Collection, London.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]].
 
Annibale Carracci (1560–1609) came from Bologna where, with his brothers [[Agostino Carracci]] (1557–1602) and [[Ludovico Carracci]] (1555–1619), he set up an influential studio or academy to train painters. Amongst their various  joint commissions, the Carracci carried out the fresco decorations in the [[Palazzo Fava]]. There followed a succession of important altarpieces in which the critical lessons of such artists as [[Correggio]], [[Titian]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] are progressively developed and integrated by Annibale within a unifying concept of naturalistic illusionism, based, in particular, upon an unmannered design that is given optical verisimilitude through the manipulation of pure, saturated colors and the atmospheric effects of light and shadow. Two of his famous paintings are ‘The Assumption of the Virgin Mary’ and ‘A Holy Woman at the Tomb of Christ’. In the 1590s he went to Rome to decorate the gallery in the [[Palazzo Farnese]]. This ceiling became highly influential on the development of painting during the seventeenth century. Its exuberance and colour was picked up on by later Baroque painters while the classicising aspects of its design (disegno) influenced painters who followed the more classical cannon. 
 
Other influential painters during this early period who influenced the development of Baroque painting included [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Giovanni Lanfranco]] and [[Guercino]], whilst artists such as [[Guido Reni]]&lt;ref&gt;Guido Reni was received into the guild of painters in 1599, and after 1601 he divided his time between his studios in Bologna and Rome. The frescoes of Raphael and ancient Greek sculptures were the main inspiration for Reni's art. He strove toward a classical harmony in which reality is presented in idealized proportions. The mood of his paintings is calm and serene, as are the studied softness of colour and form. Some of his famous paintings were 'The Adoration of the Shepherds' and 'Salome with the Head of St. John the Baptist'.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Domenico Zampieri]] known as Domenichino, pursued a more classical approach.

==Italian High Baroque painting==
The principal painter of the Roman High Baroque, a period that spanned several papal reigns from 1623 to 1667, was [[Pietro da Cortona]]. His baroque manner is clearly evident in paintings that he executed for the Sacchetti family in the 1620s and the vault fresco in the [[Palazzo Barberini]] (finished 1639) in Rome. During the 1630s, Cortona had a debate at the [[Accademia di San Luca]], the painting academy in Rome, with [[Andrea Sacchi]], a painter with classicising trends, about the perceived differences between their painting styles. The argument essentially concerned the number of figures in a painting and was couched in literary terms, with Cortona arguing for an ‘[[epic (genre)|epic]]’ approach with an abundance of figures and Sacchi making the case for ‘[[tragedy]]’ with fewer figures to convey the messages in a painting.

Baroque painters such as Cortona, [[Giovan Battista Gaulli]] and [[Ciro Ferri]] continued to flourish alongside the classical trend represented by painters such as Sacchi and [[Nicholas Poussin]], but even a classicising painter like Sacchi's pupil [[Carlo Maratta]] was influenced in his use of colour by the Baroque. In the 1672, [[Gian Pietro Bellori]]'s ‘Lives of the artists’ was published. This promoted classical idealism in art so artists of this trend were included (so was Caravaggio) but some of the leading artists of the seventeenth century were omitted such as Cortona, the sculptor [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] and the architect [[Francesco Borromini]].

==Later Italian Baroque painting==

Monumental ceiling frescoes mainly date to the latter part of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Wittower R. ''Art and Architecture in Italy 1600-1750'', p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Some were dramatically illusionistic such as Gaulli's nave fresco (1674-9) in the church of the [[Gesu]] and [[Andrea Pozzo]]'s nave vault (1691-4) in [[Sant'Ignazio]], both in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Illusionistic painting techniques such as [[quadratura]] were often employed by Italian Baroque artists in an architectural context; Andrea Pozzo's ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'', a two-volume treatise on the techniques involved which was published in 1693 and 1700, appeared in various editions and translations during the eighteenth century and became highly influential (Alexander Grönert, ‘Andrea Pozzo’, in ''Architectural theory: from the Renaissance to the present : 89 essays on 117 treatises'', ed. by B. Evers and C. Thoenes (Köln and London: Taschen, c2003), pp. 138–40)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luca Giordano]] 1634-1705 was born in Naples and was so prodigious in his output of paintings that he was known as ‘Luca fa presto’ (Luke fast work)

Important Venetian painters included [[Sebastiano Ricci]] (1659–1734) and [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] (1683–1754) but the greatest baroque exponent was [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]] (1696–1770). He is renowned for his light palette of colours used with fluid brush strokes, and it is his frescoes rather than his canvases that exhibit these techniques most effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; His works include frescoes at the [[Palazzo Labia]] and  the [[Scuola Grande dei Carmini]] in [[Venice]], [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"|Villa Valmarana]] at [[Vicenza]], [[Villa Pisani]] at [[Stra]], works at the [[Würzburg Residence]] and the throne room at the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]].  

An important centre of Italian Baroque painting was [[Genoa]]. Many, even from abroad, came to the city to gain Baroque artistic experience, and later went to Venice, [[Florence]], Rome or other important Baroque centres. Prolonged visits to the town were made by artists from other parts of Italy and other countries, including [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Van Dyck]], the French sculptor [[Pierre Puget]], [[Bernardo Strozzi]] and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].

Another Italian city which had a vibrant Baroque movement was [[Milan]]. The city hosted numerous formidable artists, architects and painters of that period, such as Caravaggio.&lt;ref&gt;Caravaggio's Baroque masterpiece "Basket of Fruit", is held in Milan's Biblioteca Ambrosiana and his "Supper at Emmaus" is held in the Brera Academy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baroque sculpture==
[[Image:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Bernini]]'s ''[[Ecstasy of St Theresa|Ecstasy of St. Teresa]]''.]]
[[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] (1598–1680) was the leading sculptor of [[Trecento|his day]] and the favorite artist of several popes and their relatives, who gave him important commissions. His ‘Apollo and Daphne’ in the [[Villa Borghese]]  in Rome illustrates how he could precisely capture in white marble the dramatic moment when Daphne, fleeing the pursuing sun god,  realizes she is metamorphosing into a laurel tree. This ability to make expressive dramatic narratives in sculpture can also be seen in his [[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]] (1645–52), created for the [[Cornaro Chapel]] in [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]], the Blessed [[Ludovica Albertoni]] in [[San Francesco a Ripa]] in Rome, and St Longinus in [[St Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]]. He was also a fine sculptor of portrait busts. He had a workshop which trained sculptors such as [[Antonio Raggi]] and [[Ercole Ferrata]]. His main rival in sculpture was [[Alessandro Algardi]].

[[Melchiorre Caffà]] (1635–1667) was the pupil of Ferrata and executed ‘The ecstasy of Saint Catherine’ in S Catherina da Siena a Monte Magnapoli in Rome, before his early death.

[[Filippo Parodi]] (1630–1702) was an important sculptor from Genoa. [[Francesco Queirolo]] executed several sculptures for the [[Cappella Sansevero]] in [[Naples]] including the technically demanding ‘Deception unmasked’ (after 1750). [[Giacomo Serpotta]] was the outstanding [[Sicilian Baroque]] sculptor and known particularly for his [[stucco]] figures and decorations in several oratories in [[Palermo]].

[[File:LesXX.1889.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Poster of the 1889 Les XX exhibition]]

'''''Les XX''''' was a group of twenty [[Belgium|Belgian]] painters, designers and sculptors, formed in 1883 by the [[Brussels]] lawyer, publisher, and entrepreneur [[Octave Maus]]. For ten years "''Les Vingt''" ({{IPA-fr|le vɛ̃}}), as they called themselves, held an annual exhibition of their art; each year twenty international artists were also invited to participate in the exhibition. Artists invited over the years included [[Camille Pissarro]] (1887, 1889, 1891), [[Claude Monet]] (1886, 1889), [[Georges Seurat]] (1887, 1889, 1891, 1892), [[Paul Gauguin]] (1889, 1891), [[Paul Cézanne]] (1890), and [[Vincent van Gogh]] (1890, 1891).

''Les XX'' was in some ways a successor to the group [[L'Essor (artist group)|L'Essor]]. The rejection of [[James Ensor|Ensor]]'s ''The Oyster Eater'' in 1883 by L'Essor Salon, following the earlier rejection by the Antwerp Salon, was one of the events that led to the formation of ''Les XX''.

In 1893, the society of ''Les XX'' was transformed into "''[[La Libre Esthétique]]''".

== History ==
''Les XX'' was founded on 28 October 1883 in Brussels and held annual shows there between 1884 and 1893, usually in January–March. The group was founded by 11 artists who were unhappy with the conservative policies of both the official academic Salon and the internal bureaucracy of ''[[L'Essor (artist group)|L'Essor]]'', under a governing committee of twenty members. Unlike ''L'Essor'' ('Soaring'), which had also been set up in opposition to the Salon, ''Les XX'' had no president or governing committee. Instead [[Octave Maus]] (a lawyer who was also an  art critic and journalist) acted as the secretary of ''Les XX'', while other duties, including the organization of the annual exhibitions, were dispatched by a rotating committee of three members. A further nine artists were invited to join to bring the group membership of ''Les XX'' to twenty. In addition to the exhibits of its Belgian members, foreign artists were also invited to exhibit.&lt;ref name=OxfordArtOnline&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Block | first=Jane | title=XX, Les |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T089756 | encyclopedia=Grove Art Online, [[Oxford Art Online]]| publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate = 6 March 2014}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a close tie between art, music and literature among the ''Les XX'' artists. During the exhibitions, there were literary lectures and discussions, and performances of new classical music, which  from 1888 were organised  by [[Vincent d'Indy]],&lt;ref name=Indy2&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Manuela|title=Vincent d'Indy et son temps|publisher=Mardaga|year=2006|pages=391|isbn=978-2-87009-888-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwNn8rHcqIQC&amp;pg=PA335&amp;dq=maus+xx&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=IO4xS-iHM6K0zASVutHPAQ&amp;cd=21#v=onepage&amp;q=maus%20xx&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with from 1889 until the end in 1893 very frequent performances by the [[Quatuor Ysaÿe]].&lt;ref name=Ysaye/&gt; Concerts included recently composed music by [[Claude Debussy]], [[Ernest Chausson]] and [[Gabriel Fauré]]. Leading exponents of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement who gave lectures include [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Théodore de Wyzewa]] and [[Paul Verlaine]].&lt;ref name=OxfordArtOnline/&gt;

Together with Maus, the influential jurist [[Edmond Picard]] and the Belgian poet [[Emile Verhaeren]] provided the driving force behind an associated periodical, ''L'Art Moderne'', which was started in 1881. This publication aggressively defended ''Les XX'' from attacks by critics and members of the visiting public. Picard polemically fomented tensions both with the artistic establishment and within ''Les XX''. By 1887, six of the more conservative original members had left, sometimes under pressure from Picard and Maus, to be replaced by artists who were more sympathetic to the cause. Altogether, ''Les XX'' had 32 members during the ten years of its existence.&lt;ref name=OxfordArtOnline/&gt;

'''''Luncheon of the Boating Party''''' ([[1881 in art|1881]]; {{lang-fr|Le déjeuner des canotiers}}) is a [[painting]] by [[France|French]] [[impressionism|impressionist]] [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. Included in the Seventh [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] Exhibition in 1882, it was identified as the best painting in the show by three critics.&lt;ref name=newpaint&gt;{{cite book|title=The New painting, Impressionism, 1874-1886 : an exhibition organized by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco with the National Gallery of Art, Washington|date=1986|publisher=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco|location=[San Francisco]|isbn=0884010473|page=379|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased from the artist by the dealer-patron [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] and bought in 1923 (for $125,000) from his son by industrialist [[Duncan Phillips (art collector)|Duncan Phillips]], who spent a decade in pursuit of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/renoir/land/dejeuner-canotiers/|title=WebMuseum: Renoir, Pierre-Auguste: Le déjeuner des canotiers|website=www.ibiblio.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Panko|first1=Ben|title=Exhibit Sheds New Light on Renoir’s “Luncheon of the Boating Party”|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-exhibit-looks-behind-and-beneath-famed-renoir-painting-180965178|accessdate=11 October 2017|publisher=Smithsonian|date=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now in [[The Phillips Collection]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering light.

==Description==
The painting, combining figures, still-life, and landscape in one work, depicts a group of Renoir's friends relaxing on a balcony at the [[Maison Fournaise]] restaurant along the [[Seine]] river in [[Chatou]], France. The painter and art patron, [[Gustave Caillebotte]], is seated in the lower right. Renoir's future wife, [[Aline Charigot]], is in the foreground playing with a small dog, an [[affenpinscher]]; she replaced an earlier woman who sat for the painting but with whom Renoir became annoyed.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; On the table is fruit and wine.

The diagonal of the railing serves to demarcate the two halves of the composition, one densely packed with figures, the other all but empty, save for the two figures of the proprietor's daughter Louise-Alphonsine Fournaise and her brother, Alphonse Fournaise, Jr, which are made prominent by this contrast. In this painting Renoir has captured a great deal of light. The main focus of light is coming from the large opening in the balcony, beside the large singleted man in the hat. The [[Sleeveless shirt|singlets]] of both men in the foreground and the table-cloth all work together to reflect this light and send it through the whole composition.

===Subjects depicted===
As he often did in his paintings, Renoir included several of his friends in ''Luncheon of the Boating Party''.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; Identification of the sitters was made in 1912 by [[Julius Meier-Graefe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New painting, Impressionism, 1874-1886 : an exhibition organized by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco with the National Gallery of Art, Washington|date=1986|publisher=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco|location=[San Francisco]|isbn=0884010473|page=412|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luncheon of the Boating Party|url=http://www.acesart.com/boatingparty/people.htm|publisher=acesart.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725024052/http://www.acesart.com/boatingparty/people.htm|archivedate=25 July 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The seamstress [[Aline Charigot]], who is holding an [[affenpinscher]] dog, sits near the bottom left of the composition. Renoir married her in 1890, and they had three sons.
* [[Charles Ephrussi]]—wealthy amateur art historian, collector, and editor of the ''[[Gazette des Beaux-Arts]]''—appears wearing a top hat in the background. The younger man to whom Ephrussi appears to be speaking, more casually attired in a brown coat and cap, may be [[Jules Laforgue]], his personal secretary and also a poet and critic.
* Actress [[Ellen Andrée]] drinks from a glass in the center of the composition. Seated across from her is Baron Raoul Barbier, former mayor of colonial Saigon.
* Placed within but peripheral to the party are the proprietor's daughter [[Maison Fournaise|Louise-Alphonsine Fournaise]] and her brother, [[Maison Fournaise|Alphonse Fournaise, Jr.]], both sporting traditional straw boaters and appearing to the left side of the image.  Alphonsine is the smiling woman leaning on the railing; Alphonse, who was responsible for the boat rental, is the leftmost figure.
* Also wearing boaters are figures appearing to be Renoir's close friends Eugène Pierre Lestringez, a bureaucrat, and Paul Lhote, himself an artist. Renoir depicts them flirting with the actress [[Jeanne Samary]] in the upper righthand corner of the painting.
* In the right foreground, [[Gustave Caillebotte]] wears a white boater's shirt and flat-topped straw boater's hat as he sits backwards in his chair next to actress Angèle Legault and Italian journalist Adrien Maggiolo. An art patron, painter, and important figure in the impressionist circle, Caillebotte was also an avid boatman and drew on that subject for several works.

==Contemporary critical reception==
At the Seventh Impressionist Exhibition in 1882, the painting generally received praise from critics. "It is fresh and free without being too bawdy," wrote Paul de Charry in ''[[Le Pays]]'', March 10, 1882. In ''La Vie Moderne'' (March 11, 1882), Armand Silvestre wrote, "...one of the best things [Renoir] has painted...There are bits of drawing that are completely remarkable, drawing- true drawing- that is a result of the juxtaposition of hues and not of line. It is one of the most beautiful pieces that this insurrectionist art by Independent artists has produced." Alternatively, ''Le Figaro'' published Albert Wolff's comment on March 2, 1882: "If he had learned to draw, Renoir would have a very pretty picture..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New painting, Impressionism, 1874-1886 : an exhibition organized by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco with the National Gallery of Art, Washington|date=1986|publisher=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco|location=[San Francisco]|isbn=0884010473|page=413|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Actor [[Edward G. Robinson]] (1893-1973) is quoted as saying: “For over thirty years I made periodic visits to Renoir's ''Luncheon of the Boating Party'' in a [[The Phillips Collection|Washington museum]], and stood before that magnificent masterpiece hour after hour, day after day, plotting ways to steal it."&lt;ref&gt;Biography from Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia: http://www.worldofepicmovies.net/edwardg.htm. Retrieved May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*The painting was featured prominently in [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]]'s film ''[[Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain]]'' — released in English as ''Amélie'' (2001). The most prominent reference is a comparison between the film's protagonist, Amélie, and the woman in the centre sipping a glass (Actress Ellen Andrée), seemingly gazing out of the canvas, uninterested, while everyone else is enjoying the day together. The painting and its relationship to Amélie is also featured in the ''[[Amélie (musical)|musical]]'' version of the film in the song "The Girl with the Glass."
*A [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to this painting appears in the final panel of ''[[On the False Earths]]'', the seventh volume of [[Jean-Claude Mézières]] and [[Pierre Christin]]'s long-running [[comic book]] series ''[[Valérian and Laureline]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dugueta.club.fr/references_canotiers.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616195535/http://dugueta.club.fr/references_canotiers.htm |date=June 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Renoir's creation of the painting is dramatized in [[Susan Vreeland]]'s 2007 novel, ''Luncheon of the Boating Party''.

The '''''Martyrdom of Four Saints''''' is an [[oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting by the  Italian Renaissance artist [[Antonio Allegri|Correggio]], dating from around  1524  and housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale di Parma|Galleria Nazionale]] of [[Parma]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The work is one of the canvasses commissioned by Parmesan noble Placido Del Bono for a chapel in the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Parma|San Giovanni Evangelista]] in Parma. They are mentioned (although wrongly assigned to the [[Parma Cathedral|city's cathedral]]) by late Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] in the first edition of his ''Lives'' (1550).

The subject of the painting, rather rare in western religious art, is the martyrdom of [[Placidus (martyr)|Placidus]] and his sister Flavia (who had allegedly lived in the 4th century) and, behind them, that of two earlier Roman siblings, Eutychius and Victorinus, who appear to have been already beheaded. An angel flies above them and holds the palm of martyrdom.

A '''modello''' {{IPA-it|moˈdɛllo|}} (plural '''modelli'''), from Italian,&lt;ref&gt;The term ''modello'' avoids the ambiguity in English of ''model'', which may equally refer to the finished [[work of art]] that provided detailed inspiration for a variant or later copy.&lt;/ref&gt; is a preparatory study or model, usually at a smaller scale, for a work of art or architecture, especially one produced for the approval of the commissioning patron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Modello Glossary, National Gallery, London]; Irene Earls; [https://books.google.com/books?id=xAdrziNnqLIC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U36ePp8oMeVe0otIfoYZyo8eDz0Yw ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained currency in art circles in [[Tuscany]] in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The texts from five contracts and other documents 1376–1508 published by Michael Hirst (Hirst and Carmen Bambach Cappel, "A Note on the Word Modello', ''The Art Bulletin'' '''74'''.1 (March 1992:172–173) are all Tuscan, as Hirst remarks, though the contemporaneous term extended as far as the [[Marche]].&lt;/ref&gt; Modern definitions in reference works vary somewhat. Alternative and overlapping terms are "[[oil sketch]]" (''schizzo'') and "[[cartoon]]" for [[painting]]s or [[stained glass]], [[maquette]], plastico or bozzetto&lt;ref&gt;A ''bozzetto'' is a roughly-modelled preliminary sketch in clay for a sculpture; those that survive have mostly been kiln-fired to preserve them.&lt;/ref&gt; for sculpture or architecture, or [[architectural model]].&lt;ref&gt;Fourteenth century uses of ''modello'' in connection with [[Santa Reparata, Florence]], are noted in A. Grote, ''Studien zur Geschichte der Opera Santa Reparata zu Florenz in Vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' (Munich 1960:113ff).&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in Gothic figural arts bishops and abbots are often represented carrying small simulacra&lt;ref&gt;The Latin term ''modulus'', a synonym of ''typus'', "[[archetype]]" is given as source for the usage in the Tusacan [[Accademia della Crusca]]'s early dictionaries; other early dictionary definitions in Italian are noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel 1992:173. See also [[Donor portrait]]&lt;/ref&gt; of buildings they had constructed—"models" in the familiar modern sense—''modello'' is only used of pieces which pre-date the finished work, and were at least in part produced by the main artist involved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michelangelo]] was in the habit of assigning to members of his studio ''modelli'' done to his specifications: "in Michelagelo studies the presentation drawings are understood to be the group of finished drawings that Michelangelo gave to his friends such as [[Tommaso de' Cavallieri]]", remarked Bernadine Barnes (Barnes "A Lost Modello for Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment'" ''Master Drawings'' '''26'''.3 (Autumn 1988:239–248) p. 247 note 4) in justifying her use of ''modello'' for the lost original of two copies in public collections. In the case of architectural ''modelli'', the actual construction could be by craftsmen from drawings by the architect. A discussion about a [[Hieronymous Bosch]] drawing that illustrates when the term is appropriate to use is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIb45zQG-o4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U27JzKo-RkzM5KkC7v3NlImFkIOig#PPA73,M1 note 23 on page 21] of: J.O. Hand &amp; M. Wolff, ''Early Netherlandish Painting'', National Gallery of Art, Washington catalogue (Cambridge UP), 1986, {{ISBN|0-521-34016-0}}; the correspondence concerning the appropriateness or not of ''modello'' applied by Michael Hirst to presentation drawings by [[Michelangelo]] that were "done expressly for patronal approval, criticism or rejection" (Hirst, ''Michelangelo and His Drawings'', 1988:79) is noted above.&lt;/ref&gt; The&lt;span id="Ricordo" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- The preceding heading-less link-target is linked to by [[Ricordi]] and [[Ricordo]] --&gt; less frequently found term '''ricordo''' (Italian for "record" or "memory") means a similar piece produced as a small copy ''after'' completion of the work as a record for the workshop.&lt;ref&gt;A small finished bronze representing a completed sculpture on a reduced scale, made for a [[connoisseur]] or the art market, is a ''reduction''.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally it is not always easy for art historians to decide whether a particular piece is one or the other, and, especially in the Late Renaissance and Baroque periods, when several versions of a painting were made, the ''ricordo'' for the [[prime version]] might serve in the atelier as the ''modello'' for the subsequent ones.&lt;ref&gt;See: Jonathan Brown, Richard G. Mann; ''Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth Through Nineteenth Centuries: The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue'', National Gallery of Art, Oxford University Press US, 1990, {{ISBN|0-521-40107-0}}. In the [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIb45zQG-o4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U27JzKo-RkzM5KkC7v3NlImFkIOig#PPA73,M1 last paragraph of p.73], the view is advanced that an [[El Greco]] was produced as a ''ricordo'' for the first version of a work, and then used as the ''modello'' for a second version.&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt a modello was often modified after the main work was completed to reflect any changes in the composition during painting, thus making it a ricordo also; this would normally be impossible for art historians to distinguish from a modello altered during its original production. 

The [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] at right was catalogued as a modello by [[Michael Levey]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]], ''The 17th and 18th century Italian Schools; National Gallery Catalogues'', p.223, 1971, National Gallery, London, {{ISBN|0-901791-09-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent [[x-ray]] investigation of the huge finished work in Munich has revealed that in its [[underpainting]] it was closer to another, very different and less finished modello, now in the [[Courtauld Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;Braham Helen, ''The Princes Gate Collection'', p. 74, Courtauld Institute Galleries, London 1981, {{ISBN|0-904563-04-9}} [http://www.courtauldprints.com/image.php?id=147902&amp;idx=1&amp;fromsearch=true Courtauld Institute image] – note this is reversed compared to the final painting.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been asserted that the National Gallery picture illustrated is a ricordo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886961 Francisco Bayeu. Saragossa; Review of Exhibition] by Xavier Bray, [[The Burlington Magazine]], Vol. 138, No. 1120 (Jul., 1996), p. 479, note 3. JSTOR – on free page&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery still describe it as "probably a modello", presumably produced after work had already begun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng6273 National Gallery, London]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ghiberticompetition.jpg|thumb|left|''Sacrifice of Isaac''; [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s successful competition modello for the bronze doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare with [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Brunelleschi%20Filippo/imagepages/image2.html Brunelleschi's unsuccessful version]. Both are in the [[Bargello]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
"Cartoon", named for the sturdy ''cartone'' paper on which they were generally executed, is usually used of working drawings, often at full scale,&lt;ref&gt;Cartoons for [[tapestry]] were always at full scale; often cut into loom-width strips, they were set behind the warps of the loom as a direct guide for the weavers. The most famous tapestry cartoons are the "[[Raphael Cartoons]]" conserved in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]; they were re-used in the 17th century in England to produce series of [[Mortlake|Mortlake tapestries]].&lt;/ref&gt; but the distinction is not a firm one, and the terms ''cartoon'' and ''working drawing'' are often used interchangeably. ''Modello'' is especially used of older Italian art and architecture from the late Middle Ages onwards; initially these were mostly drawings, perhaps with some colour from chalk or [[watercolour]], or with colours indicated in writing. The diminutive term '''modeletto''' will always be used of small-scale versions. As an Italian word, ''modello'' may be printed in [[italic type|italic]]s, or not.&lt;ref&gt;Surprisingly, the word does not appear in the original ''[[OED]]'' or the First Supplement of 1933&lt;/ref&gt; The French version of the word, ''modèle'', may be used of French works, and is normally italicised.

Especially in the case of oil sketches, many ''modelli'' are greatly valued in their own right, as they may show a freedom in execution and freshness of inspiration missing in the final work, and also may show changes in composition from the finished work, throwing light on the process of artistic creation. Earlier stages of the creative process may be recorded in "preparatory drawings" or "studies", either for the whole composition, or a part of it, such as a single figure.

[[File:Passignano Michelangelo che da il modellino di San Pietro a Paolo IV.jpg|thumb|[[Michelangelo]] shows [[Pope Julius II]] his ''modellino'' of St Peter's in this 19th-century artist's impression]]
An example of a modello of a fresco cycle, which was rescued for its intrinsic value is in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of [[Rosso Fiorentino]]: Vasari reports that a modello for Rosso's frescoes in Santa Maria delle Lagrime, Arezzo, was carried out by Rosso for Giovanni Pollastra, the inventor of the complex program there, "un bellisimo modello di tutto l'opera, che è oggi nelle nostre case di Arezzo."&lt;ref&gt;"A most beautiful ''modello'' of all the works, which is today in our houses in Arezzo."&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary ''modello colorito'' in the form of a painted three-dimensional model was especially important to prejudge the finished effect of [[Illusionistic ceiling|illusionistic ''sotto-in-su'' perspectives]] on the curved surfaces of vaulted ceilings, as [[Andrea Pozzo]], the perfector of the illusionistic ceiling, noted in his ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'' (1700–17)&lt;ref&gt;In vol. II, section "Breve instruttione per dipingere a fresco", noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel, ''loc. cit.''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many modelli show versions of works which were never actually realised, or have been lost. Famous examples are the alternative designs produced for the competition in 1401 to design the North doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]]. [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] won, beating six other artists, including [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and [[Jacopo della Quercia]]; the modelli survive, for a single panel, of the first two named ([[Bargello]] – picture above).

There are alternative, unrealised, modelli for many famous buildings, including [[St Peter's, Rome]] and the "Great Model" of [[St Paul's Cathedral, London]], showing a different design by [[Sir Christopher Wren]] from that actually built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explore-stpauls.net/oct03/textMM/TriforumGreatModelN.htm Explore St Paul's – Wren's Great Model]&lt;/ref&gt; When accepted, such models were retained during the work, as concrete expressions of what was expected under the terms of the contract, and afterwards were preserved in storage through salutary neglect.

[[Image:Dipsacus fullonum MHNT.BOT.2005.0.269.jpg|thumb|Dried teasel fruit pods]]

A '''raising card''' is used to raise [[cloth]]. '''Raising''' is the technique used to produce the [[nap (textile)|nap]] of cloth. Originally, only [[woolen]] cloth was raised, but now [[flannel#Flannelette|flannelette]] and other [[cotton]] fabrics are also raised. Raising is one of the last steps in the [[finishing (textiles)|finishing]] process for cloth. It teases out the ends of the fibers in the cloth to produce a nap. 

The raising was first done using the dried fruit pod of a [[teasel]] plant, then technology moved on and raising cards were created. A raising card is a brush with metal bristles, similar to [[Carding|hand cards]] and to the original teasel pod.

[[Image:Double carder.JPG|thumb|A carding machine]]
The process was mechanized during the industrial revolution, and the raising machine (the Gigmill) looks and works much like the large carding machines, in that it has a large main roller with several small ones positioned around it. The small one rotate quickly, in either the same direction or opposite of that of the cloth.

After the raising process, the [[nap (textile)|nap]] is uneven. In order to gain an even surface, the nap is then sheared, or cut, to the desired height.

'''''Shock Illustrated''''' was an American black and white magazine published by [[EC Comics]] from late 1955 to early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The artists drew one to four panels per page with the text overlaid onto the artwork. The first issue appeared with a cover date of September–October 1955 and featured three psychology-themed stories, similar in theme to the comic ''Psychoanalysis'' published by EC in 1955. Starting with the second issue this type of story was generally reduced to one per issue, with the remaining stories being similar in theme to those that appeared in EC's comic ''[[Shock SuspenStories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Russ. ''Complete EC Library: Terror Illustrated''. Gemstone, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shock Illustrated'' ran for a total of three issues. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and when EC's distributor went bankrupt, the company had no choice but to cancel the prints. The third issue of this magazine is known as the rarest EC publication of all time. Although all 250,000 copies had been printed, publisher [[William Gaines|Bill Gaines]] lacked the funds to bind them, and all but 100 copies were destroyed.

==Contributors==
The editor of ''Shock Illustrated'' was [[Al Feldstein]]. In addition to those stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote under the pseudonym [[Alfred E. Neuman]]. Feldstein included multiple retellings of previous stories, a move suggested by Gaines. This included "A Question of Time" and "Dead Right" in the second issue and "Curiosity Killed" in the third issue. Contributing writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had worked as a writer on EC's earlier publications), Robert Bernstein, John Larner, and [[Daniel Keyes]] (using the pseudonyms Kris Daniels and A.D. Locke).

Artists featured in ''Shock Illustrated'' included [[Jack Kamen]], Rudy Nappi, [[Reed Crandall]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Al Williamson]], [[Angelo Torres]] and [[Graham Ingels]].

''Shock Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines in hardbound volumes by Russ Cochran (and [[Gemstone Publishing]]) for the first time in 2006 as the final part of his ''Complete EC Library''. With these reprints, published for the first time, was the fourth issue of the title which had been produced but never printed.

{{Literature}}

A '''short story collection''' is a book of [[short story|short stories]] and/or [[novella]]s by a single author, as distinguished from an [[anthology]] of fiction, which would contain work by several authors (e.g., ''[[Les Soirées de Médan]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/17/the-10-best-short-story-collections Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://electricliterature.com/electric-literatures-25-best-story-collections-of-2014/ Electric Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/the-best-short-story-collections-from-childish-gabbling-to-jaded-nihilism/ The Spectator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/books/a-good-fit-for-small-screens-short-stories-are-selling.html?_r=0 The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The stories in a collection may or may not share a [[theme (literature)|theme]], [[setting (fiction)|setting]], or [[fictional character|characters]] with one another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2415">The '''Symphony''' in [[D major]], [[Opus number|Op]]. 24, is the only work in this genre by the [[Bohemia]]n-born composer [[Jan Václav Voříšek]]. He wrote it in 1821 at age 30; he died young, at only 34.

The dedication to [[Aloys von Fuchs]] was inscribed in the composer's own hand on 14 April 1823.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Hodgson, Liner notes from Unicorn recording: [[Philharmonia Orchestra|New Philharmonia Orchestra]] under [[Michael Bialoguski]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is scored for a standard classical orchestra typical of late [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or early [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] symphonies: 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings.&lt;ref name=imslp/&gt; Indeed, it has often been compared to early Beethoven, although it was written only six years before that master's death, 16 months after Voříšek.  He was a friend of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and may well have been influenced by that composer as well.

The Symphony in D is Voříšek's most famous work, and is the first major [[Czech Republic|Czech]] contribution to the 19th century symphonic literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culturecatch.com/music/prague-philharmonia-jiri-belohlavek Culture.catch.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The movements are:
* ''Allegro con brio''
* ''Andante''
* Scherzo: ''Allegro ma non troppo''
* Finale: ''Allegro con brio''.&lt;ref name=imslp&gt;[http://imslp.org/wiki/Symphony,_Op.24_(Vo%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%A1ek,_Jan_V%C3%A1clav) IMSLP]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
The Symphony in D has been recorded by:
* [[Czech National Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Paul Freeman (conductor)|Paul Freeman]]
* [[Czech Philharmonic]] under [[Karel Ančerl]]
* [[Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie]] under [[Thomas Hengelbrock]]
* [[Philharmonia Orchestra|New Philharmonia Orchestra]] under [[Michael Bialoguski]]

{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}
A '''talking animal''' or '''speaking animal''' is any non-human animal that can produce sounds or gestures resembling those of a [[human language]]. Several species or groups of animals have developed [[animal communication|forms of communication]] which superficially resemble verbal language, however, these are not defined as language because they lack one or more of the defining characteristics, i.e. [[grammar]], [[syntax]], [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursion]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]. Researchers have been successful in teaching some animals to make gestures similar to [[sign language]]. However, these animals fail to reach one or more of the criteria accepted as defining language.

== Possibility of animal language ==
[[Image:CleverHans.jpg|thumb|[[Clever Hans]] performing]]

The term refers to animals which can imitate (though not necessarily understand) human speech. [[Parrot]]s, for example, repeat things nonsensically through exposure.{{citation needed|reason=This is not necessarily true|date=July 2015}} It is a form of [[anthropomorphism]] to call this human speech, as it has no [[Semantics|semantic grounding]].

Researchers have attempted to teach [[Great ape language|great apes]] (gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos) spoken language with poor results as they can only be taught how to say one or a few basic or limited words or phrases or less, and sign language with significantly better results as they can be very creative with various [[sign language|hand signals]] like those of [[deaf|deaf people]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  However, even the best communicating great ape has shown an inability to grasp the idea of syntax and grammar, instead communicating at best at the same level as a [[pidgin]] language in humans.  They are expressive and communicative, but lack the formality that remains unique to human speech.

Modern{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} research shows that the key difference is the animal's lack of asking questions and that formal syntax is merely a superficial detail, however Alex the parrot has been recorded as having asked an existential question.&lt;ref name = "jordania"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Asked the First Question?

There are other differences as well, including poor precision, as shown by Kanzi the bonobo used the lexigram for ''chase'' interchangeably with that for ''get'', though this behavior may not be the same for all animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kluger, J.|title=Inside the minds of animals|year=2010|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2008867,00.html | work=Time | first=Jeffrey | last=Kluger | title=Inside the Minds of Animals | date=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research supports the idea that the linguistic limitations in animals are due to limited general brainpower (as opposed to lack of a specific module),{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and that words are created by breaking down sentences into pieces, making grammar more basic than semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Lacerda: A ecological theory of language acquisition&lt;/ref&gt;

An owner hears a dog making a sound that resembles a phrase says the phrase back to the dog, who then repeats the sound and is rewarded with a treat. Eventually the dog learns a modified version of the  original sound. Dogs have limited vocal imitation skills, so these sounds usually need to be shaped by selective attention and social reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-dogs-can-talk/| title=Fact or Fiction: Dogs Can Talk |first=Tina | last=Adler | publisher = Scientific American | date = June 10, 2009 | accessdate = February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Target-girl Astrid with knife in flight.jpg|thumb|right|Astrid Schollenberger rehearses with top knife thrower Rev Dr David Adamovich. One knife is captured in flight, fractions of a second before impact.]]
In [[circus]] and [[vaudeville]] acts, a '''target girl''' is a female assistant in "[[impalement arts|impalement]]" acts such as [[knife throwing]], [[archery]] or [[Exhibition shooting|sharpshooting]]. The assistant stands in front of a target board or is strapped to a moving board and the impalement artist throws knives or shoots projectiles so as to hit the board but miss the assistant. The image or character of the target girl has become an icon in fiction and visual media.

==Introduction==
Although some assistants are male there is no common equivalent term for a male assistant. This reflects the fact that, historically at least, female assistants have predominated in the acts in question.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Brion in the foreword to Adamovich, Heil &amp; Schollenberger, ''A Day on Broadway: The art of being a knife thrower's assistant'', (pub. Turnshare, London, 2005), p.x&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of an assistant as a human target provides a powerful element of risk. Without assistants placing themselves in danger these acts would be simple demonstrations of accuracy, but with the potential for injury or death the show is much more dramatic. Target girls often wear revealing costumes, thus adding an element of overt [[Human female sexuality|sexuality]] to an act. In this respect there is some similarity to [[magician's assistant|magicians' assistants]], although there is a distinct difference in that any apparent danger to an assistant in a magic act is mostly an illusion, whereas impalement acts are demonstrations of accuracy, nerve and calculated risk and the danger is real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some observers have perceived target girls as masochistic or passive and some feminists criticise the concept as [[misogynist]], several target girls have given accounts of themselves as assertive women and portrayed their experiences as empowering (see [[#Target girls as authors|Target girls as authors]]).

Various theories have been put forward to explain the enduring appeal of the target girl. These range from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of [[BDSM|sadomasochistic]] [[erotic]]ism, others cite [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] works and point to parallels with the story arc of the [[hero]] in classic drama.&lt;ref&gt;The most extensive evidence of the debate on this topic is to be found in various online forums, including the ''Dangerous Circus Acts'' groups on Yahoo!&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the [[Monomyth#Initiation|hero's ordeal]], in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Joachim Heil PhD, "A short philosophical essay on the art of knife throwing", in Adamovich, Heil &amp; Schollenberger, ''A Day on Broadway'', pp.83-114&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jim Steinmeyer]], a noted illusion designer who has written well-regarded books on the history of magic, has identified a fashion for female peril as entertainment in the post-First World War period. Steinmeyer has written that [[P. T. Selbit]]'s stage debut of the ''[[Sawing a woman in half|Sawing Through A Woman]]'' illusion in 1921 marked the beginning of a trend for women as the victims of choice for acts simulating danger or torture. While Steinmeyer focuses on stage magic and attributes some of the trend to practical factors, he also points to a broader pattern in entertainment generally, which he links to social trends. He concludes that: "...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment".&lt;ref name="hiding"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further view on historical trends is provided by performer and blogger Ula the Painproof Rubbergirl, who has acted as a target girl for New York-based knife thrower The Great Throwdini. In an extensive article on her experiences and philosophical approach to the art she notes: "Knife throwing is an old act. So is high wire. And rodeo. And stone throwing, witch burning, beheading, Roman gladiators, jousting, dog fights,you name it - we, humans, love it. And we love a vulnerable woman. Isn't there something oddly attractive about the woman in danger? I remember seeing lots of soundless black and white movies with a girl tied to the railroad tracks or a girl tied to a sawmill by some evil perverted landlord."&lt;ref name="ula"&gt;Ula, [http://www.painproofrubbergirls.com/stories/knife/index.html The Knife Thrower's Assistant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812235016/http://www.painproofrubbergirls.com/stories/knife/index.html |date=12 August 2007 }}, painproofrubbergirls.com, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable real life target girls==
Like [[magicians' assistant]]s, target girls have often suffered the injustice of not receiving the same recognition and billing as their co-performers. Those that have received equal billing have generally been part of husband and wife acts, which are common in this field. Acts that involve a domestic partnership as well as an on-stage one have tended to have greater longevity than pairings where a thrower recruits an assistant as an employee. It has been suggested that this is because the off-stage domestic ties serve to keep the partnership together in the face of the tensions that can occur within such acts. The lack of individual billing for target girls adds to the difficulty of picking out notable examples. The following is therefore a small selection who are distinguished by particular features of their careers rather than a definitive "hall of fame".

* '''Elizabeth Collins''' is almost unique in having effectively ended up with top billing in the knife throwing act she formed with her husband Martin Collins. The couple met and married in their native Hungary at around the time of the outbreak of World War II and began performing together as "Elizabeth and Collins". For their signature stunt they developed an extremely demanding trick that involved Elizabeth spinning on a "[[Wheel of death (Impalement arts)|wheel of death]]" target while her husband balanced on a tightrope and threw knives at her. After the war they settled in Britain and toured clubs and theatres around the world. They were one of the first impalement acts to break into television. Elizabeth retired from performing in the early 1960s and was replaced by their daughter who was also named Elizabeth (although additionally known as Agnes). Elizabeth and Collins performed on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' three times and appeared as themselves in an episode of the 1960s spy series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

*'''Helga and Sylvia Brumbach''' are a mother and daughter who have both been part of a family act that is regarded by many other artists as setting the standard in their field. The Brumbachs, also known as Los Alamos, began with Fritz Brumbach as a knife thrower and whip cracker and his wife Helga as target girl. Later daughter Sylvia joined the act as a second target girl and then son Patrick became a thrower. Fritz and Helga have since retired but Patrick and Sylvia continue the act. Fritz is a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] holder for rapid throwing around a live target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* '''Irene Stey''' married into an old established Swiss circus family when she wed Rolf Stey. The couple worked as a knife act called "Two Tornados" between 1965 and 1985 and are notable for being one of only two acts to repeat the combined "wheel of death" and tightrope stunt developed by Elizabeth and Collins. After retiring as a target girl Irene continued in the circus business with an equestrian act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* '''Montana Nell''' was the performing name of Pearl Collins who, between 1929 and 1950, toured with her husband Robert Collins in a western arts act under the billing of "Texas Slim and Montana Nell". She was born Pearl Miller and grew up on a farm, which helped her become a highly proficient horse rider. In 1923 she married a man called Seamor Russell with whom she had a daughter named Doris. Seamor died of an illness in 1925 and Pearl went on to marry Collins in 1929. When  Doris was 16 she joined her parents' show as a trick rider and sharp shooter named "Little Miss Peggy". Pearl and Robert Collins were posthumously honoured by the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* '''Ekaterina Sknarina''' is a model, actress, contortionist, aerial artist and former international gymnast. She was born in Russia and competed at world championship level for the Russian rhythmic gymnastics team. She later trained as an aerial artist with [[Cirque du Soleil]]. After re-locating to New York she began working as a [[contortionist]] in the burgeoning new burlesque scene. She also began working as a model and appeared in magazines including [[FHM]], One World, and [[GQ]]. She added the role of target girl to her portfolio after meeting knife thrower The Great Throwdini. In 2005 she was one of the stars of the off-Broadway show ''Maximum Risk'', during which she helped set two world records for the number of knives thrown around a human target in a minute. She was Miss [[Coney Island]] 2007.

===Target girls as authors===
A very small and select group of women are notable for having used personal experience to write about the impalement arts from the point of view of the target girl. They include:
* '''Astrid Schollenberger'''  a middle-aged German single mother with a master's degree in philosophy and a regular job who, at the suggestion of her boyfriend Dr Joachim Heil, volunteered as a target girl for knife thrower Dr David Adamovich (aka The Great Throwdini). Schollenberger worked with Adamovich for a show in New York in 2002 where he first publicly performed the "[[Wheel of death (Impalement arts)|Wheel of death]]" stunt. Later Schollenberger, Adamovich and Heil wrote a book about the experience titled ''A Day on Broadway: The art of being a knife thrower's assistant''.&lt;ref&gt;Adamovich, Heil &amp; Schollenberger, ''[http://www.knifethrower.net A Day on Broadway: The art of being a knife thrower's assistant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415193805/http://www.knifethrower.net/ |date=15 April 2007 }}'', Turnshare (London, 2005), {{ISBN|1-903343-73-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Ronnie Claire Edwards]]''' is an American actress born in 1933. She is best known for the role of "Corabeth Walton Godsey" in the series ''[[The Waltons]]'' (1972 - 1981). Her substantial and often quirky career is recalled in an autobiography titled ''The Knife Thrower's Assistant: Memoirs of a Human Target''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronnie Claire Edwards]], ''The Knife Thrower's Assistant: Memoirs of a Human Target'', Hawk Publishing Group, (October 2000), {{ISBN|1-930709-16-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ula the Painproof Rubbergirl''' started as one half of a duo called The Painproof Rubbergirls who did [[contortion]] and various [[sideshow|sideshow-type]] stunts, such as the [[Bed of nails]]. After her partner left for other work, Ula continued as a solo performer doing various aerial acts as well as a signature routine that involves contortion feats on a bed of swords. In 2003 she worked as a target girl for Dr David Adamovich (aka The Great Throwdini) and later wrote a lengthy article about the act and the philosophy behind her part in it.&lt;ref name="ula"/&gt; Ula was featured as a target girl in the US edition of FHM magazine in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Celebrity target girls===
A small group of target girls are notable for the fact that they are well known celebrities who performed the role for charitable purposes or other reasons apart from their main career. These are examples of the target girl, rather than the thrower, being the main individual in the act. The annual ''[[Circus of the Stars]]'' television special, made by [[CBS]] between 1977 and 1994, provided a number of examples. They include:
* '''[[Lynda Carter]]''', the actress best known as television's [[Wonder Woman]], appeared as a target girl on the very first ''Circus of the Stars'' in January 1977, with actor [[David Janssen]] throwing knives at her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.wonderland-site.com/html/miscel/appear/WLA-00016.htm

 |publisher = Wonderland - The Ultimate Wonder Woman site
 |accessdate = 2007-03-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carter_note"&gt;It has been suggested that Janssen and Carter's act was faked using a trick target board that worked in a manner similar to the method exposed on the ''Masked Magician'' television show. Professional throwers have observed that Janssen's throwing style is wrong and would result in wildly inaccurate throws if he were really throwing knives. This seems to be the only occasion when a knife throwing act was faked on ''Circus of the Stars''. All the other occasions when the show included a knife act involved professional throwers and the genuine nature of the acts has been confirmed through study of video footage.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Actress and model '''[[Ann Turkel]]''' performed the role of target girl for knife thrower Skeeter Vaughan in the second ''Circus of the Stars'' in December 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* '''[[Sally Kellerman]]''', the actress who played [[Margaret Houlihan|Major Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan]] in the film ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', appeared as a target girl for knife thrower Larry Cisewski on the 1981 ''Circus of the Stars''. She was seen holding balloons for Cisewski to burst and also braved being spun around on his "Devil's door" target board as he planted knives around her.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=001419|name=Sally Kellerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Linda Blair]]''', the actress who rose to fame as a child star in ''The Exorcist'', appeared as a target girl for knife thrower Paul Lacross on ''Circus of the Stars'' in 1983.&lt;ref name="lindablair"&gt;Linda Blair appeared on the show three times, in 1982, 1983 and 1990. See {{IMDb name|id=0000304|name = Linda Blair}}.  She was pictured in costume and holding a set of throwing axes on the cover of the 18–24 December 1983 issue of ''TV News'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;
* Actress '''[[Britt Ekland]]''' appeared as a target girl for knife thrower Fritz Brumbach on ''Circus of the Stars'' in 1986.
* Television presenter and actress '''[[:de:Ursula von Manescul|Ursula von Manescul]]''' appeared as a target girl on the annual German charity circus show ''[[Stars in der Manege#Other versions and variations|Stars in der Manege]]'' in 1967.

==Fictional and artistic representation==
The mixture of peril, nerve and sexuality inherent in the idea of a target girl has proved attractive to writers, artists, moviemakers and television executives.

===Movie and television===

There are many instances of target girls as iconic or emblematic images in film and television. The most notable movie example is the character Adele portrayed by [[Vanessa Paradis]] in the film ''[[Girl on the Bridge]]'' (1999), in which the knife throwing act is at the centre of the plot and serves as a powerful erotic metaphor.

Other examples include:
* The fourth season of the television series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', featured an episode (first aired in 2009) in which title character [[Temperance "Bones" Brennan]] goes undercover as a target girl with Special Agent [[Seeley Booth]] as a knife-thrower.
* [[Cameron Diaz]]'s character Jenny Everdeane acts as a target girl in a scene in the film ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002) which was used in promotional clips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Theatre===
The play ''Pin Cushion'', by Clay McLeod Chapman is based around a husband and wife knife throwing act and consists of the target girl delivering a monologue while her husband throws knives around her. It was performed as part of Chapman's ''Pumpkin Pie Show'' at The Red Room Theatre, New York, in May and June 2002. The performance involved a genuine knife throwing act, with actress Niabi Caldwell as the target girl and professional knife thrower Dr. David Adamovich (aka The Great Throwdini) playing her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Cock Fight''''' ({{Lang-fr|'''Un combat de coqs'''}}) is an 1846 painting by the French artist [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. It is also known as '''''Young Greeks Attending a Cock Fight''''' (''Jeunes Grecs faisant battre des coqs''). It is an example of the [[Neo-Grec]] style. It was one of Gérôme's first successes.&lt;ref name="orsay1" /&gt;

==Provenance==
After his failed attempt to win the [[Prix de Rome]], Gérôme was hesitant to exhibit ''The Cock Fight'' out of fear for another setback, but was convinced by his teacher [[Paul Delaroche]] to enter it into the 1847 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]]. It was well received at the Salon and was sold to Mr. Roux-Laborie.&lt;ref name="orsay1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/oeuvres-commentees/recherche/commentaire_id/jeunes-grecs-faisant-battre-des-coqs-272.html|title=Jeunes Grecs faisant battre des coqs dit aussi Un combat de coqs|language=French|publisher=[[Musée d'Orsay]]|accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orsay2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;zsz=5&amp;lnum=5|title=Jeunes Grecs faisant battre des coqs|language=French|publisher=[[Musée d'Orsay]]|accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art dealer Adolphe Goupil bought it from the widowed Countess H. de Bussat, born Laborie, in 1872 and sold it to the [[Musée du Luxembourg]] in 1873. From 1920 to 1986 it was at the [[Louvre]], and since 1986 it is housed at the [[Musée d'Orsay]].&lt;ref name="orsay2" /&gt;

''''' The Verdict of the People''''' is an 1854 painting by [[George Caleb Bingham]], currently owned by the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]].

The last painting of Bingham's Election Series, ''The Verdict of the People'' tells the end of the story represented in the series. Within this painting, Bingham hid several political motives and ideas similar to the rest of the Election Series.  Historians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/opinion/donald-trump-verdict-of-the-people-821138|title=Donald Trump Meets The Verdict of the People - artnet News|date=18 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; say the painting depicts public reaction to a likely proslavery candidate's election victory.

Completed in 1854, the work covered issues of slavery, temperance, and a representative government, subjects that had gone from a local to a national level. During the early 1850s, the temperance movement grew and more states were abolishing alcohol. A book by Herman Humphrey, titled ''Parallel between Intemperance and Slavery'', associated the cause of anti-slavery to that of temperance. Bingham showed his view on intemperance and slavery by painting a banner that said, "Freedom for Virtue[,] Restriction for Vice." The banner referred to temperance by saying that the vice and alcohol would need to be restricted for the people to be free. The banner then references Bingham's ideas of slavery by using the connection of the temperance movement and the anti-slavery movement to show that Bingham thought negatively about slavery and shared that view with intemperance.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

'''''Traceroute''''' is a 2016 Austrian/American documentary film directed by [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]]. The autobiographical documentary and [[road movie]] deals with the history, politics and impact of [[nerd]] culture. Grenzfurthner calls his film a "personal journey into the uncharted depths of nerd culture, a realm full of dangers, creatures and more or less precarious working conditions",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/47/47614/1.html|title=Über den Raum in die Zeit|first=Peter|last=Mühlbauer|website=Telepolis|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an attempt to "chase the ghosts of nerddom's past, present and future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://laughingsquid.com/traceroute-a-nerds-eye-view-of-a-fascinating-road-trip-across-the-united-states/|title='Traceroute’, A Nerd’s Eye View of a Fascinating Road Trip Across the United States|date=2 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was co-produced by art group [[monochrom]] and Reisenbauer Film. It features music by [[Kasson Crooker]], Hans Nieswandt, and many others.

==Concept==

Artist and self-declared [[nerd]] [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]] is documenting his personal road trip from the West Coast to the East Coast of the United States, to introduce the audience to places and people that shaped and inspired his art and politics. Traceroute is a reflection on Grenzfurthner's own roots of nerddom, and "On the Road style romp across the United States as he visits icons of the counterculture, the outré, and the generally questionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furtherfield.org/features/reviews/traceroute-%E2%80%93-personal-journey-uncharted-depths-nerd-culture|title=Review on Furtherfield; March 11, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grenzfurthner summarizes the concept in an interview for [[Boing Boing]]: "It is a film on biographies and obsessions and spaces of possibility – in other words something between loving embrace and merciless vivisection. Maintaining a critical meta-outlook was just as important to me as abandoning myself to unfathomable stammerings of adoration. And that all works for one simple reason: because I take a step forward, introducing myself and confessing my guilt like in Alcoholics Anonymous, only to then take off and visit the best whiskey distilleries. In my case these destinations are not whiskey makers, but people and places and symbols of a very special pop culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2016/04/14/the-story-of-traceroute-about.html|title=The story of Traceroute, about a Leitnerd's quest|date=14 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Film Threat]] he adds: "It was important for me to take nerddom apart, not only analyzing it, but also excavating its potential for greatness."&lt;ref name="filmthreat.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmthreat.com/interviews/johannes-grenzfurthner-is-kinda-nerdy/|title=Johannes Grenzfurthner is Kinda Nerdy – Film Threat|website=filmthreat.com|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film incorporates art and illustrations by James Brothwell, Bonni Rambatan, [[Michael Marrak]], Karin Frank, Ben Lawson, Michael Zeltner, Josh Ellingson and [[eSeL]] in a cinematic collage&lt;ref name="filmthreat.com"/&gt; that draws inspiration from 1990s [[fanzine]] and [[Punk subculture|punk]] aesthetics, [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] culture, [[ANSI art]] and [[fantastic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressplay.at/2016/03/14/traceroute/ Review on Press Play by Marco Rauch, March 14, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; UK Film Review's Hannah Sayer summarizes the artistic style of the film in her review: "There is a real sense that this is a collaborative exploration of creativity: of the old and the new, the past and the present, and the traditional and the digital. The use of photography and drawings interspersed between the interviews with various people associated with nerd culture shows an artistic approach to the material and these images act as reflective snapshots of moments in time, reinforcing the importance of looking back to the past as well as looking forward to the future of the digital age."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukfilmreview.co.uk/#!Traceroute-documentary-review/cu0l/5730ed7a0cf20cbfb2963dc0 UK Film Review, May 9, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
[[File:Traceroute--Johannes Grenzfurthner and Matt Winston.jpg|thumb|Traceroute: Johannes Grenzfurthner and Matt Winston talk about Stan Winston and special effects]]
Traceroute features interviews with [[Matt Winston]], [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Jason Scott]], Christina Agapakis, [[Trevor Paglen]], Ryan Finnigan, Kit Stubbs, [[V. Vale]], Sean Bonner, Allison Cameron, Josh Ellingson, Maggie Mayhem, [[Paolo Pedercini]], Steve Tolin, Dan Wilcox, [[Jon Lebkowsky]], Jan "Varka" Mulders (of [[Bad Dragon]]), Adam Flynn, Abie Hadjitarkhani, Kelly Poots, and some special guest appearances (e.g. [[National Park Service|NPS]] spokesperson Vickie Carson, hacker Nick Farr and cultural curator [[Scott Beale (cultural curator)|Scott Beale]]).

Metronaut writes: "Traceroute offers deep insights into the world of nerddom. A woman who creates cheese from bacteria on sweaty feet. A man who wants to construct a giant network of independent Geiger counters. Or a sex worker who identifies as a nerd. The multitude of topics and people shows how being a nerd is not restricted to programming and computers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metronaut.de/2016/02/traceroute-von-nerd-zu-nerd/|title=Traceroute: Von Nerd zu Nerd - Metronaut.de|website=www.metronaut.de|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

===Writing===
Grenzfurthner performed a [[stand-up]] show called ''Schicksalsjahre eines Nerds'' at Vienna's Rabenhof Theater in 2014. Parts of this show form the basis of Traceroute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2000007033569/Pornos-und-tote-Huehner|title=Pornos und tote Hühner|author=Dorian Waller|work=derStandard.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic script, although many scenes and interviews were improvised, was written by Johannes Grenzfurthner. The film's main language is English, but features archival footage in German.

===Filming===
Principal photography commenced on March 5, 2015 and ended March 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4490762/|title=Traceroute|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film can be considered [[microfilmmaking]] and [[guerrilla filmmaking]].

===Sound design===
Daniel Hasibar and Christian Staudacher created the sound design and audioscape underlying Grenzfurthner's narration.

==Music==
The film features music by Peter Barnett, [[Kasson Crooker]], Damien Di Fede, Matthew Huffaker, Brady Leo, [[Vera Lynn]], [[Kevin MacLeod (musician)|Kevin MacLeod]], Hans Nieswandt, Roger Sandega, Eric Skiff, among others.

==Distribution==

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Reviews of the film have been positive. Bradley Gibson of ''[[Film Threat]]'' gives Traceroute 10/10 points and writes: "Traceroute is the most fun I've ever had watching a documentary. If you're a nerd (and you are) this is the road trip you've always wanted to take with your smartest, geekiest friend. You're not going to want to come home. It's Cosmos. It's DragonCon on wheels. It's your favorite sex fantasy. It's alcohol soaked nonviolent subversive protest mobile and WiFi linked. It's ''On The Road'' updated with tech, science, pseudoscience, sex, and fandom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmthreat.com/reviews/traceroute|title=Traceroute – Film Threat|website=filmthreat.com|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mental Floss]]' Chris Higgins writes about Traceroute: "As many nerds have noticed, there's a glut of nerd-positive documentaries out there, but they tend to be either too self-serious, or too focused on the trappings of fandom to actually say much. Traceroute manages to be a real film, with humor and true insight (sometimes called out for us—and delightfully nullified—with a blinking 'INSIGHT' faux-HTML tag onscreen), primarily because it focuses on Grenzfurthner's personal journey, and he doesn't take himself too seriously. Let's put that another way: The director uses himself and a handful of subjects to create his story, and that specificity—coupled with his playfulness—makes it work. At one point he licks the chrome head of a Terminator prop. Then he licks a zombie head prop. Then he licks the propmaster himself. It's delightful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/79393/traceroute-documentary-about-nerds-and-annihilation|title=&lt;em&gt;Traceroute&lt;/em&gt;, A Documentary about Nerds and Annihilation|date=1 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop culture magazine [[Boing Boing]] calls Traceroute "a brilliantly careening biography of a highly enigmatic species. [...] Traceroute is radical individual empiricism, a narrative biographical puzzle and an experimental projection matrix. Despite continual stimulus satiation, it is wonderful fun: the film tickles the synapses with a perfectly mixed cocktail of collectively shared context and quirkiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2016/04/14/the-story-of-traceroute-about.html|title=The story of Traceroute, about a Leitnerd's quest|date=14 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Lichty of net culture magazine [[Furtherfield]] calls it "magical (...) After watching Traceroute, I was left with a real exhilaration and a deeply reflective feeling at once. (...) What Traceroute reveals is the tradition of alterity just beneath the surface of Western culture, and that it has a powerful effect on our mass consciousness, whether it is in plain sight or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furtherfield.org/features/reviews/traceroute-%E2%80%93-personal-journey-uncharted-depths-nerd-culture|title=Patrick Lichty, Furtherfield; March 11, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felix Knoke of [[Engadget]] Germany writes: "For me it is the best nerd documentary I've seen so far. Simply for the fact that it doesn't take itself as deadly serious as the other ones. (...) Traceroute deserves high praise because it represents an old-school definition of nerd culture, one that is never compatible with fintech, unicorn and iGod."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.engadget.com/2016/03/23/traceroute-nerd-doku-kommt-nach-deutschland/|title=Traceroute: Nerd-Doku kommt nach Deutschland|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop culture critic Thomas Kaestle comments: "Traceroute is game, challenge, encyclopedia, and sentimental journey all in one. As a documentary it is most skillfully composed. And as a narration it is highly compatible. This film will, in passing, sweep proclaimed nerds off their feet. And it will touch the hearts of those who still need some explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zebrabutter.net/traceroute-unterwegs-mit-dem-leitnerd.html|title=Thomas Kaestle on Zebrabutter, January 13, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diamond in the Rough Films'' praises Grenzfurthner's hosting and storytelling: "This doc works in some very unconventional ways, not the least of which is our plucky protagonist. Grenzfurthner is an absolute charmer as our host and his narration is note-perfect (the accent is so cool in that Werner Herzog kind of way). It's really rare in a documentary about a not-that-famous person where you become almost instantly won-over and invested in their personal journey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ditrfilms.com/#!traceroute/hvlta|title=ditrfilms|website=ditrfilms|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blogger and sci-fiction author [[Cory Doctorow]] states about Traceroute that "Johannes is a brilliant lunatic of surpassing and delightful weirdness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/ondemand/traceroute|title=Watch Traceroute Online - Vimeo On Demand|first=|last=monochrom|date=27 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018|via=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt; MicroFilmmaker Magazine writes: "The different people Grenzfurthner chatted with were genuinely interesting and the organic way he moved from place to place was intriguing. [...] You'll find that you've learned an awful lot about technology, nerdiness, and America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microfilmmaker.com/2016/04/traceroute_ssr/|title=Traceroute (Straight Shooter Film Review) - MicroFilmmaker Magazine|website=www.microfilmmaker.com|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Propes (The Independent Critic) writes: "It's challenging. It's thought-provoking. It's remarkably honest. It's well researched. [...] If you're expecting nothing more than your usual nerd doc with its cosplay cuteness and asocial gamers, you're going to be not just disappointed but probably traumatized. Grenzfurthner is clearly full-on willing to challenge culture, stereotypes, accepted thoughts and just about everything else. There's a healthy dose of sexuality in Traceroute, which one might expect, yet Grenzfurthner also immerses the film in politics, activism and social shifts.

The '''Victorian Artists Society''', which can trace its establishment to 1856 in [[Melbourne]], promotes artistic education, art classes and gallery hire [[art gallery|exhibition]] in Australia.

The Victorian Artists Society was formed in March 1888 following the decision of the Victorian Academy of Arts and the Australian Artists' Association to amalgamate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6109757 |title=VICTORIAN ACADEMY OF ARTS. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=14 March 1888 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian Academy of Arts had been formed in 1870 with 'about twenty artists and amateurs' amongst its first members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13199253 |title=OUR MELBOURNE LETTER. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=22 January 1870 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy's forerunner, the Victorian Society of Fine Arts, was established in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71468655 |title=HISTORIC MELBOURNE. |newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]] |location=NSW |date=22 June 1901 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=30 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Artists' Association held its first exhibition in 1886 with works by [[Tom Roberts]], [[Louis Buvelot]], [[Frederick McCubbin]], and [[Arthur Streeton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11571934 |title=EXHIBITION OF THE AUSTRALIAN ARTISTS' ASSOCIATION. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=7 September 1886 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding president of the new amalgamated Society was Joseph Anderson Panton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article89950234 |title=DEATH OF MR. J. A. PANTON. |newspaper=[[Bendigo Advertiser]] |location=Vic. |date=27 October 1913 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later presidents included [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Paul Raphael Montford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4396813 |title=IN A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=5 May 1931 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premises at 430 Albert Street in East Melbourne were erected for the society in 1888, enlarged in 1892 and modernised in 1953. Facilities include four galleries, teaching studio, members room, offices and other ancillary facilities.

Membership is restricted to 1000, a figure last reached in 1979, and is open for new members to join. Membership is open to all persons interested in the fine arts, with the emphasis on practising artists.

Regular classes are held in various media which are open to members and non-members including watercolour, oil painting, drawing, mixed media, life model.

Exhibitions are held annually, including the seasonal spring, summer, autumn and winter exhibitions, with awards given at each.

The 2017 Artist of the Year Award was given to Ray Hewitt.
