[[File:Alessandro Martini.jpg|thumb|Alessandro Martini]]
'''Alessandro Martini''' (16 May 1812 – 14 March 1905)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/alessandro-martini_(Dizionario-Biografico)/&lt;/ref&gt; was an Italian businessman, founder of one of the most important [[vermouth]] companies in the world, [[Martini &amp; Rossi]], which produces the [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini vermouth]].

In 1830 he purchased a small wine company situated very close to [[Turin]]. In 1847 several Italian businessmen started producing wine, spirits and vermouth for the Distilleria Nazionale di Spirito di Vino of Turin. Thanks to the [[Risorgimento]], the economic prospects were bright and the organization soon began to turn a profit. A few years later, Alessandro Martini joined the small team, becoming the director in 1863 along with Luigi Rossi (who was the inventor of a vermouth) and Teofilo Sola. During this early period the Distilleria Nazionale di Spirito di Vino kept on growing and a several subsidiaries were created in [[Genoa]], [[Cagliari]] and [[Narbonne]] thanks to the protection of the King of [[Piedmont]].

In 1863, which can be considered one of the most important dates in the company's history (so much so that it is still written on the bottle), Martini, Sola and Rossi changed the name of the company to "Martini, Sola &amp; Cia". They started exporting the bottles of vermouth around the world. New York city was given its first crates in 1867. At the same time the firm was awarded a good many prizes, which are still proudly recorded on the bottles: Dublin (1865), Paris (1867 and 1878), Vienna (1873) and Philadelphia (1876). Just thirty years after its creation, Martini was drunk in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Greece, Portugal, Belgium, Egypt and other countries.

In 1879 Sola died, and his sons sold all their shares in the company. The firm consequently decided to change its name to Martini &amp; Rossi, the name seen today on the bottles sold in the United States. Between 1870 and 1880 the company diversified and the two directors launched Vino Canelli [[Spumante]] (now known as [[Asti (wine)|Asti]] Martini). One of their successes was to build upon the traditions of the late 19th-century European courts' fondness for vermouth. In 1868 the company was authorized by King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy]] to put the symbols of the royal family on their packaging. King Louis of Portugal (1872), the Queen of Austria, Christina (also regent of Spain) (1897) and the British Parliament did the same. The symbols of Melbourne, Anvers and Mendoza quickly followed; their marks are still seen on the packaging to this day.

When Alessandro Martini died in 1905, the three sons of Luigi Rossi inherited the company. They had already launched [[Martini Extra Dry]] (1900) and Martini Bianco before his death, and had created subsidiaries around the world. In 1922 the company officially became known as Martini, except in the United States where they were compelled to keep Martini &amp; Rossi because [[Martini (cocktail)|Martini]] was already an American cocktail.

'''Cellana, Inc.''' is a Hawaii- and San Diego-based developer of [[algae]]-based [[bioproducts]] for high-value [[nutrition]], [[ink]], and [[bioenergy]] applications, including [[Omega-3]] nutraceutical applications, sustainable [[ink]], [[aquaculture]] and [[animal feeds]], human [[food]] ingredients, [[pigments]], specialty [[chemicals]], and [[biofuels]].  Cellana has received (or has been a member of consortia that have received) multiple multimillion-dollar grants from the [[United States Department of Energy]] and [[United States Department of Agriculture]].  In 2018, Cellana and POS Bio-Sciences announced the signing of a letter of intent for the joint development and commercialization of high-value EPA Omega-3 oils from Cellana’s algae biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://cellana.com/press-releases/cellana-and-pos-bio-sciences-sign-letter-of-intent-for-the-joint-development-and-commercialization-of-high-value-algae-biomass-for-epa-omega-3s/&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016, the [[United States Department of Energy]] published a funding opportunity announcement in which Cellana's lead commercial algae strains KA32 and CO46, and the biomass yields demonstrated from these strains as part of the DOE-funded Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership (ATP3), were designated as DOE's "State of Technology" for the photosynthetic algae sector in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Available at Page 7 of the FOA, which can be found at https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/Default.aspx?Search=PEAK&amp;SearchType=#FoaId7e516e41-db54-4c51-a274-48604245e917/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, Cellana and Living Ink Technologies announced the signing of a letter of intent for the joint development and commercialization of inks containing Cellana’s renewable algae biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://cellana.com/press-releases/cellana-and-living-ink-enter-into-a-joint-development-and-offtake-agreement-for-sustainable-algae-inks//&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Cellana and [[Neste Oil]], the world's largest refiner of [[renewable diesel]], announced the signing of a multi-year, commercial-scale off-take agreement for algae-based biocrude oil.&lt;ref&gt;http://cellana.com/press-releases/cellana-and-neste-oil-enter-into-multi-year-commercial-scale-off-take-agreement-for-algae-oil-feedstock-for-biofuels/&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellana, Inc. was founded in 2004 as HR BioPetroleum, Inc. and changed its name to Cellana, Inc. in May 2011. On January 31, 2011, Cellana LLC, a joint venture company formed by Royal Dutch Shell and HR BioPetroleum in 2007, became a wholly owned subsidiary of HR BioPetroleum, Inc./Cellana, Inc. Shell had previously announced on December 11, 2007 that it entered into a joint venture with HR BioPetroleum to, among other things, build and operate a demonstration facility in Hawaii for growing [[algae fuel|algae as a source of biofuels]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=54866&lt;/ref&gt;  This 2.5-hectare facility, known as the [[Kona Demonstration Facility]] (KDF), was completed and commissioned in 2009.

The original goal of the facility was to cultivate algae in [[photobioreactor]]s and [[raceway pond|open raceway ponds]] filled with seawater using a proprietary process, then harvest the algae and extract oil for conversion into fuels such as biodiesel and utilize the residual high protein algae meal for additional co-products.

KDF is located on a 2.5-hectare (6-acre) parcel of land leased from the [[Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority]] (NELHA), which is located on the west shore of the island of Hawaii.  NELHA pipes in a constant supply of fresh ocean water. NELHA was originally built to support a DOE project for ocean thermal energy conversion, and it continues to employ the project's seawater supply pipes to support a variety of research projects and commercial enterprises, including facilities that currently grow and harvest [[microalgae]] for pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements.

Cellana's facility grows only non-genetically modified, marine [[microalgae]] species using proprietary technology.

A '''collateralized debt obligation''' ('''CDO''') is a type of [[structured finance|structured]] [[asset-backed security]] (ABS).&lt;ref&gt;An "asset-backed security" is sometimes used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assets—including collateralized debt obligations and [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (Example: "A capital market in which ''asset-backed securities'' are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs".

Separate [[Special purpose entity|special purpose entities]]—rather than the parent [[investment bank]]—issue the CDOs and pay interest to investors.

==Market history==

===Beginnings===

In 1970, the US government backed mortgage guarantor [[Ginnie Mae]] created the first MBS ([[mortgage-backed security]]), based on FHA and VA mortgages. It guaranteed these MBSs.&lt;ref&gt;McClean, Nocera, p 7&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the precursor to CDOs that would be created two decades later. In 1971, [[Freddie Mac]] issued its first Mortgage Participation Certificate . This was the first [[mortgage-backed security]] made of ordinary mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/freddie-mac-nyse-fre History of Freddie Mac].&lt;/ref&gt; All through the 1970s, private companies began mortgage asset securitization by creating private mortgage pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Asset Securitization Comptroller's Handbook |url= http://www.dallasfed.org/news/ca/2005/05wallstreet_assets.pdf |date= November 1997 |publisher= US Comptroller of the Currency Administrator of National Banks |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218013346/http://www.dallasfed.org/news/ca/2005/05wallstreet_assets.pdf |archivedate= 2008-12-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] in USA imposed heavy sanctions for financial institutions found guilty of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age&lt;ref&gt;Regulation B, Equal Credit Opportunity 12 CFR 202.14(b) as stated in [http://www.bos.frb.org/commdev/commaff/closingt.pd Closing the Gap: A Guide to Equal Opportunity Lending]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Federal Reserve System]] of Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a more open policy of giving loans (sometimes subprime) by banks, guaranteed in most cases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 1977, the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] was enacted to address historical discrimination in lending, such as '[[redlining]]'. The Act encouraged commercial banks and savings associations (Savings and loan banks) to meet the needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods (who might earlier have been thought of as too risky for home loans).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-2515.html Text of Housing and Community Development Act of 1977—title Viii (Community Reinvestment)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916032800/http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-2515.html |date=2008-09-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/dcca/cra/|title=Community Reinvestment Act|publisher=Federal Reserve|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the investment bank [[Salomon Brothers]] created a  "private label" MBS (mortgage backed security) - one that did not involve GSE mortgages. However, it failed in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;McClean, Nocera, p 12&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Lewis Ranieri]] ([[Salomon Brothers|Salomon]]) and [[Laurence D. Fink|Larry Fink]] ([[First Boston]]) invented the idea of [[securitization]]; different mortgages were pooled together and this pool was then sliced into [[tranche]]s, each of which was then sold separately to different investors.&lt;ref&gt;McClean, Nocera, p 5&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these tranches were in turn bundled together, earning them the name CDO (Collateralised debt obligation).&lt;ref&gt;Liar's Poker, Michael Lewis&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first CDOs to be issued by a private bank were seen in 1987 by the bankers at the now-defunct [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] Inc. for the also now-defunct Imperial Savings Association.&lt;ref name=Cresci&gt;{{cite web|last=Cresci|first=Gregory|title=Merrill, Citigroup Record CDO Fees Earned in Top Growth Market|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.FcDwf1.ZG4|work=August 30, 2005|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s the collateral of CDOs was generally [[Corporate bond|corporate]] and [[Emerging market debt|emerging market bonds]] and bank loans.&lt;ref name=FCIR-129&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; After 1998 "multi-sector" CDOs were developed by Prudential Securities,&lt;ref name=FCIR-129-30&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.129-30&lt;/ref&gt; but CDOs remained fairly obscure until after 2000.&lt;ref name="Nocera, p.120"&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 p.120&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 and 2003 CDOs had a setback when rating agencies "were forced to downgrade hundreds" of the securities,&lt;ref name="Nocera, p.121"&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 p.121&lt;/ref&gt; but sales of CDOs grew—from $69 billion in 2000 to around $500 billion in 2006.&lt;ref name=mclean-p123/&gt; From 2004 through 2007, $1.4 trillion worth of CDOs were issued.&lt;ref name=Endangerment-283&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|title=Reckless Endangerment : How Outsized ambition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon|year=2011|publisher=Times Books, Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FwUW2yuJzW0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Morgenson+and+Rosner+%27%27Reckless+Endangerment%27%27,+2010&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GHXhUdSjKJTYyQGc6oGABA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Morgenson%20and%20Rosner%20%27%27Reckless%20Endangerment%27%27%2C%202010&amp;f=false|author2=Joshua Rosner|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early CDOs were diversified, and might include everything from aircraft lease-equipment debt, manufactured housing loans, to student loans and credit card debt. The diversification of borrowers in these "multisector CDOs" was a selling point, as it meant that if there was a downturn in one industry like aircraft manufacturing and their loans defaulted, other industries like manufactured housing might be unaffected.&lt;ref name="reckless-279"&gt;Morgenson and Rosner ''Reckless Endangerment'', 2010 pp.279-280&lt;/ref&gt; Another selling point was that CDOs offered returns that were sometimes 2-3 percentage points higher than corporate bonds with the same credit rating.&lt;ref name="reckless-279"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 p.189&lt;/ref&gt;

====Explanations for growth====
* '''Advantages of securitization''' – Depository banks had incentive to "[[Securitization|securitize]]" loans they originated—often in the form of CDO securities—because this removes the loans from their books. The transfer of these loans (along with related risk) to security-buying investors in return for cash replenishes the banks' capital. This enabled them to remain in compliance with [[capital requirement]] laws while lending again and generating additional origination fees.
* '''Global demand for fixed income investments''' – From 2000 to 2007, worldwide fixed income investment (i.e. investments in bonds and other conservative securities) roughly doubled in size to $70 trillion, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast, which bid up bond prices and drove down interest rates.&lt;ref name="giantpoolpeabody"&gt;Public Radio International.

* '''Low interest rates''' – Fears of deflation, the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]], a U.S. recession, and the U.S. trade deficit kept interest rates low globally from 2000 to 2004-5, according to Economist [[Mark Zandi]].&lt;ref&gt;of [[Moody's Analytics]]&lt;/ref&gt; The low yield of the safe [[United States Treasury security|US Treasury bonds]] created demand by global investors for subprime mortgage-backed CDOs with their relatively high-yields but credit ratings as high as the Treasuries.

Around 2005, as the CDO market continued to grow, subprime mortgages began to replace the diversified consumer loans as collateral. By 2004, mortgage-backed securities accounted for more than half of the collateral in CDOs.&lt;ref name=FCIR-130/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One study based on a sample of 735 CDO deals originated between 1999 and 2007, found the percentage of CDO assets made up of lower level tranches from non-prime mortgage-backed securities (nonprime means subprime and other less-than-prime mortgages, mainly [[Alt-A]] mortgages) grew from 5% to 36% (source: [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/students/dunlop/2009-CDOmeltdown.pdf Anna Katherine Barnett-Hart The Story of the CDO Market Meltdown: An Empirical Analysis-March 2009]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other sources give an even higher proportion. In the fall of 2005 Gene Park, an executive at AIG Financial Products division found, "The percentage of subprime securities in the CDOs wasn't 10 percent – it was 85 percent!" (source: McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 (p.201)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An email by Park to his superior is also quoted in the ''Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'' p.201: "The CDO of the ABS market ... is currently at a state where deals are almost totally reliant on subprime/nonprime mortgage residential mortgage collateral."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Still another source (''[[The Big Short]]'', [[Michael Lewis]], p.71) says:&lt;br&gt;"The 'consumer loans' piles that Wall Street firms, led by Goldman Sachs, asked AIG FP to insure went from being 2% subprime mortgages to being 95% subprime mortgages. In a matter of months, AIG-FP, in effect, bought $50 billion in triple-B-rated subprime mortgage bonds by insuring them against default. And yet no one said anything about it ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 2007, 47% of CDOs were backed by structured products, such as mortgages; 45% of CDOs were backed by loans, and only less than 10% of CDOs were backed by fixed income securities.

CDOs, like mortgage-backed securities, were financed with debt, enhancing their profits but also enhancing losses if the market reversed course.&lt;ref name=FCIR-134&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.134, section="Leverage is inherent in CDOs"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Explanations for growth====
Subprime mortgages had been financed by [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS). Like CDOs, MBSs were structured into tranches, but issuers of the securities had difficulty selling the more lower level/lower-rated "mezzanine" tranches—the tranches rated somewhere from AA to BB.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Because most traditional mortgage investors are risk-averse, either because of the restrictions of their investment charters or business practices, they are interested in buying the higher-rated segments of the loan stack; as a result, those slices are easiest to sell. The more challenging task is finding buyers for the riskier pieces of at the bottom of the pile. The way mortgage securities are structured, if you cannot find buyers for the lower-rated slices, the rest of the pool cannot be sold.&lt;ref name=reckless-278&gt;Morgenson and Rosner ''Reckless Endangerment'', 2010 p.278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also ''Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', p.127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To deal with the problem investment bankers "recycled" the mezzanine tranches, selling them to underwriters making more structured securities—CDOs. Though the pool that made up the CDO collateral might be overwhelmingly mezzanine tranches, most of the tranches (70&lt;ref&gt;70%. "Firms bought mortgage-backed bonds with the very highest yields they could find and reassembled them into new CDOs. The original bonds ... could be lower-rated securities that once reassembled into a new CDO would wind up with as much as 70% of the tranches rated triple-A. Ratings arbitrage, Wall Street called this practice. A more accurate term would have been ratings laundering." (source: McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 p.122)&lt;/ref&gt; to 80%&lt;ref&gt;80%. "Approximately 80% of these CDO tranches would be rated triple-A despite the fact that they generally comprised the lower-rated tranches of mortgage-backed securities. (source: ''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;80%. "In a CDO you gathered a 100 different mortgage bonds—usually the riskiest lower floors of the original tower ... They bear a lower credit rating triple-B. ... if you could somehow get them rerated as triple-A, thereby lowering their perceived risk, however dishonestly and artificially. This is what Goldman Sachs had cleverly done. It was absurd. The 100 buildings occupied the same floodplain; in the event of flood, the ground floors of all of them were equally exposed. But never mind: the rating agencies, who were paid fat fees by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms for each deal they rated, pronounced 80% of the new tower of debt triple-A." (source: Michael Lewis, ''The Big Short : Inside the Doomsday Machine'' WW Norton and Co, 2010, p.73)&lt;/ref&gt;)
of the CDO were rated not BBB, A-, etc., but triple A. The minority of the tranches that were mezzanine were often bought up by other CDOs, concentrating the lower rated tranches still further. (See the chart on "The Theory of How the Financial System Created AAA-rated Assets out of Subprime Mortgages".)

As one journalist ([[Gretchen Morgenson]]) put it, CDOs became "the perfect dumping ground for the low-rated slices Wall Street couldn't sell on its own."&lt;ref name=reckless-278/&gt;

Other factors explaining the popularity of CDOs include:
* Growing demand for fixed income investments that started earlier in the decade continued.&lt;ref name="giantpoolpeabody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="giantpool"/&gt; A "global savings glut"&lt;ref&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; leading to "large capital inflows" from abroad helped finance the housing boom, keeping down US mortgage rates, even after the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] had raised interest rates to cool off the economy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Supply (economics)|Supply]] generated by "hefty" fees the CDO industry earned. According to "one hedge fund manager who became a big investor in CDOs", as much "as 40 to 50 percent" of the cash flow generated by the assets in a CDO went to "pay the bankers, the CDO manager, the rating agencies, and others who took out fees."&lt;ref name="Nocera, p.121"/&gt; Rating agencies in particular—whose high ratings of the CDO tranches were crucial to the industry and who were paid by CDO issuers—earned extraordinary profits. [[Moody's Investors Service]], one of the two biggest rating agencies, could earn "as much as $250,000 to rate a mortgage pool with $350 million in assets, versus the $50,000 in fees generated when rating a municipal bond of a similar size." In 2006, revenues from Moody's structured finance division "accounted for fully 44%" of all Moody's sales.&lt;ref name=reckless-280&gt;Morgenson and Rosner ''Reckless Endangerment'', 2010 p.280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also: [https://archive.is/20120716084801/http://noir.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a6NdKd8CfR2A Bloomberg-Flawed Credit Ratings Reap Profits as Regulators Fail Investors-April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Moody's [[operating margin]]s were "consistently over 50%, making it one of the most profitable companies in existence"—more profitable in terms of margins than [[Exxon Mobil]] or [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name=McLean-124/&gt; Between the time Moody's was spun off as a public company and February 2007, its stock rose 340%.&lt;ref name=McLean-124&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', p.124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/446/index.html PBS-Credit and Credibility-December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trust in rating agencies. CDO managers "didn't always have to disclose what the securities contained" because the contents of the CDO were subject to change. But this lack of transparency did not affect demand for the securities. Investors "weren't so much buying a security. They were buying a triple-A rating," according to business journalists [[Bethany McLean]] and [[Joe Nocera]].&lt;ref name="Nocera, p.121"/&gt;
* [[Financial innovation]]s, such as [[credit default swap]]s and [[synthetic CDO]]. Credit default swaps provided insurance to investors against the possibility of losses in the value of tranches from default in exchange for premium-like payments, making CDOs appear "to be virtually risk-free" to investors.&lt;ref name=FCIR-132&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic CDOs were cheaper and easier to create than original "cash" CDOs. Synthetics "referenced" cash CDOs, replacing interest payments from MBS tranches with premium-like payments from credit default swaps. Rather than providing funding for housing, synthetic CDO-buying investors were in effect providing insurance against mortgage default.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the traditional cash CDO, synthetic CDOs contained no actual tranches of mortgage-backed securities ... in the place of real mortgage assets, these CDOs contained credit default swaps and did not finance a single home purchase." (source: ''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.142)&lt;/ref&gt; If the CDO did not perform per contractual requirements, one counterparty (typically a large [[investment bank]] or [[hedge fund]]) had to pay another.&lt;ref name="propublica.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.propublica.org/feature/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble |title=The Magnetar Trade: How One Hedge Fund Helped Keep the Bubble Going (Single Page)-April 2010 |access-date=2017-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410084812/http://www.propublica.org/feature/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble |archive-date=2010-04-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As underwriting standards deteriorated and the housing market became saturated, subprime mortgages became less abundant. Synthetic CDOs began to fill in for the original cash CDOs. Because more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the same original, the amount of money that moved among market participants increased dramatically.

While non-prime mortgage defaults affected all securities backed by mortgages, CDOs were especially hard hit. More than half—$300 billion worth—of tranches issued in 2005, 2006, and 2007 rated most safe (triple-A) by rating agencies, were either downgraded to junk status or lost principal by 2009.&lt;ref name=impaired/&gt; In comparison, only small fractions of triple-A tranches of Alt-A or subprime mortgage-backed securities suffered the same fate. (See the Impaired Securities chart.)

Collateralized debt obligations also made up over half ($542 billion) of the nearly trillion dollars in losses suffered by financial institutions from 2007 to early 2009.&lt;ref name=hart/&gt;

===Criticism===
Prior to the crisis, a few academics, analysts and investors such as [[Warren Buffett]] (who famously disparaged CDOs and other derivatives as "financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warren Buffet on Derivatives|url=http://www.fintools.com/docs/Warren%20Buffet%20on%20Derivatives.pdf|work=Following are edited excerpts from the Berkshire Hathaway annual report for 2002.|publisher=fintools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]'s former chief economist [[Raghuram Rajan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/2008/01/22/raghu-rajan-analyses-subprime-crisis/ Raghu Rajan analyses subprime crisis]| Mostly Economics| (from a speech given on December 17, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; warned that rather than reducing risk through diversification, CDOs and other derivatives spread risk and uncertainty about the value of the underlying assets more widely.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

During and after the crisis, criticism of the CDO market was more vocal. According to the radio documentary "Giant Pool of Money", it was the strong demand for MBS and CDO, that drove down home lending standards. Mortgages were needed for collateral and by approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted.&lt;ref name=giantpool/&gt;

The head of banking supervision and regulation at the Federal Reserve, Patrick Parkinson, termed "the whole concept of ABS CDOs", an "abomination".&lt;ref name="FCIR-129"/&gt;

In December 2007, journalists Carrick Mollenkamp and Serena Ng wrote of a CDO called Norma created by Merrill Lynch at the behest of Illinois hedge fund, Magnetar. It was a tailor-made bet on subprime mortgages that went "too far." Janet Tavakoli, a Chicago consultant who specializes in CDOs, said Norma "is a tangled hairball of risk." When it came to market in March 2007, "any savvy investor would have thrown this...in the trash bin."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB119871820846351717 Wall Street Wizardry Amplified Risk], ''Wall Street Journal'', December 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Serena, and Mollenkamp, Carrick.

According to journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, no securities became "more pervasive -- or [did] more damage than collateralized debt obligations" to create the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref name="Nocera, p.120"/&gt;

Gretchen Morgenson described the securities as "a sort of secret refuse heap for toxic mortgages [that] created even more demand for bad loans from wanton lenders."
&lt;blockquote&gt;CDOs prolonged the mania, vastly amplifying the losses that investors would suffer and ballooning the amounts of taxpayer money that would be required to rescue companies like Citigroup and the American International Group." ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|title=Reckless Endangerment : How Outsized ambition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon|year=2011|publisher=Times Books, Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FwUW2yuJzW0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Morgenson+and+Rosner+%27%27Reckless+Endangerment%27%27,+2010&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GHXhUdSjKJTYyQGc6oGABA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Morgenson%20and%20Rosner%20%27%27Reckless%20Endangerment%27%27%2C%202010&amp;f=false|author2=Joshua Rosner|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the first quarter of 2008 alone, [[Credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]] announced 4,485 downgrades of CDOs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/marketsNewsUS/idUKN0947372020080409 | work=Reuters | title=CDO deals resurface but down 90 pct in Q1-report | date=2008-04-09 | first=Dena | last=Aubin}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least some analysts complained the agencies over-relied on computer models with imprecise inputs, failed to account adequately for large risks (like a nationwide collapse of housing values), and assumed the risk of the low rated tranches that made up CDOs would be diluted when in fact the mortgage risks were highly correlated, and when one mortgage defaulted, many did, affected by the same financial events.&lt;ref name=hart/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.118-121&lt;/ref&gt;

They were strongly criticized by economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]], among others. Stiglitz considered the agencies "one of the key culprits" of the crisis that "performed that alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the ratings agencies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=ah839IWTLP9s Bloomberg-Smith-Bringing Down Ratings Let Loose Subprime Scourge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=ax3vfya_Vtdo Bloomberg-Smith-Race to Bottom at Rating Agencies Secured Subprime Boom, Bust]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morgenson, the agencies had pretended to transform "dross into gold."&lt;ref name=reckless-280/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As usual, the ratings agencies were chronically behind on developments in the financial markets and they could barely keep up with the new instruments springing from the brains of Wall Street's rocket scientists. Fitch, Moody's, and S&amp;P paid their analysts far less than the big brokerage firms did and, not surprisingly wound up employing people who were often looking to befriend, accommodate, and impress the Wall Street clients in hopes of getting hired by them for a multiple increase in pay. ... Their [the rating agencies] failure to recognize that mortgage underwriting standards had decayed or to account for the possibility that real estate prices could decline completely undermined the ratings agencies' models and undercut their ability to estimate losses that these securities might generate."&lt;ref&gt;Morgenson and Rosner, ''Reckless Endangerment'', 2010 p.280-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Michael Lewis also pronounced the transformation of BBB tranches into 80% triple A CDOs as "dishonest", "artificial" and the result of "fat fees" paid to rating agencies by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms.&lt;ref name=big&gt;{{cite book

Synthetic CDOs were criticized in particular, because of the difficulties to judge (and price) the risk inherent in that kind of securities correctly. That adverse effect roots in the pooling and tranching activities on every level of the derivation.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

Others pointed out the risk of undoing the connection between borrowers and lenders—removing the lender's incentive to only pick borrowers who were creditworthy—inherent in all securitization.&lt;ref&gt;''All the Devils Are Here'', MacLean and Nocera, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortgage lending using securitization is sometimes referred to as the ''originate-to-distribute'' approach, in contrast to the traditional ''originate-to-hold'' approach. (''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.89)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal=Working Paper|pages=42|ssrn=2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to economist [[Mark Zandi]]: "As shaky mortgages were combined, diluting any problems into a larger pool, the [[moral hazard|incentive for responsibility]] was undermined."&lt;ref name="Zandi 2009"/&gt;

Zandi and others also criticized lack of regulation. "Finance companies weren't subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks. Taxpayers weren't on the hook if they went belly up [pre-crisis], only their shareholders and other creditors were. Finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible, even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards."&lt;ref name="Zandi 2009"/&gt;

==Concept, structures, varieties==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}

===Concept===
CDOs vary in structure and underlying assets, but the basic principle is the same. A CDO is a type of [[asset-backed security]]. To create a CDO, a [[corporation|corporate entity]] is constructed to hold assets as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] backing packages of [[cash flow]]s which are sold to investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal=Working Paper|pages=12–13|ssrn=2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequence in constructing a CDO is:
* A [[special purpose entity]] (SPE) is designed/constructed to acquire a [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of underlying assets. Common underlying [[assets]] held may include [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]], commercial real estate bonds and corporate loans.
* The SPE issues [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to investors in exchange for cash, which are used to purchase the portfolio of underlying assets. Like other ABS private label securities, the bonds are not uniform but issued in layers called tranches, each with different risk characteristics. Senior tranches are paid from the cash flows from the underlying assets before the junior tranches and equity tranches. Losses are first borne by the equity tranches, next by the junior tranches, and finally by the senior tranches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal=Working Paper|pages=13|ssrn=2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common analogy compares the cash flow from the CDO's portfolio of securities (say mortgage payments from mortgage-backed bonds) to water flowing into cups of the investors where senior tranches were filled first and overflowing cash flowed to junior tranches, then equity tranches. If a large portion of the mortgages enter default, there is insufficient cash flow to fill all these cups and equity tranche investors face the losses first.

The risk and return for a CDO investor depends both on how the tranches are defined, and on the underlying assets. In particular, the investment depends on the assumptions and methods used to define the risk and return of the tranches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal=Working Paper|pages=19|ssrn=2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDOs, like all [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]], enable the originators of the underlying assets to pass credit risk to another institution or to individual investors. Thus investors must understand how the risk for CDOs is calculated.

The issuer of the CDO, typically an investment bank, earns a commission at the time of issue and earns management fees during the life of the CDO. The ability to earn substantial fees from originating CDOs, coupled with the absence of any residual liability, skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality.

In some cases, the assets held by one CDO consisted entirely of equity layer tranches issued by other CDOs. This explains why some CDOs became entirely worthless, as the equity layer tranches were paid last in the sequence and there wasn't sufficient cash flow from the underlying subprime mortgages (many of which defaulted) to trickle down to the equity layers.

Ultimately the challenge is in accurately quantifying the risk and return characteristics of these constructs. Since the introduction of David Li's 2001 model, there have been material advances in techniques that more accurately model dynamics for these complex securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Amnon|last2=Yahalom|first2=Tomer|last3=Kaplin|first3=Andrew|date=2010|title=Modeling Correlation of Structured Instruments in a Portfolio Setting|url=|journal=Encyclopedia of Quantitative Finance, John Wiley &amp; Sons|volume=|pages=1220-1226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structures===
CDO refers to several different types of products. The primary classifications are as follows:

;Source of funds—cash flow vs. market value
* ''Cash flow CDOs'' pay interest and principal to tranche holders using the cash flows produced by the CDO's assets. Cash flow CDOs focus primarily on managing the credit quality of the underlying portfolio.
* ''Market value CDOs'' attempt to enhance investor returns through the more frequent trading and profitable sale of collateral assets. The CDO asset manager seeks to realize capital gains on the assets in the CDO's portfolio. There is greater focus on the changes in market value of the CDO's assets. Market value CDOs are longer-established, but less common than cash flow CDOs.

;Motivation—arbitrage vs. balance sheet
* ''Arbitrage transactions'' (cash flow and market value) attempt to capture for equity investors the spread between the relatively high yielding assets and the lower yielding liabilities represented by the rated bonds. The majority, 86%, of CDOs are arbitrage-motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives1.sifma.org/assets/files/SIFMA_CDOIssuanceData2007q1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072530/http://archives1.sifma.org/assets/files/SIFMA_CDOIssuanceData2007q1.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Balance sheet transactions'', by contrast, are primarily motivated by the issuing institutions' desire to remove loans and other assets from their balance sheets, to reduce their regulatory [[capital requirements]] and improve their return on risk capital. A bank may wish to offload the credit risk to reduce its balance sheet's credit risk.

;Funding—cash vs. synthetic
* ''Cash CDOs'' involve a portfolio of cash assets, such as loans, [[corporate bond]]s, [[asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] or [[mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]]. Ownership of the assets is transferred to the legal entity (known as a special purpose vehicle) issuing the CDO's tranches. The risk of loss on the assets is divided among tranches in reverse order of seniority. Cash CDO issuance exceeded $400 billion in 2006.
* ''Synthetic CDOs'' do not own cash assets like bonds or loans. Instead, [[synthetic CDO]]s gain credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of [[credit default swap]]s, a derivatives instrument. (Under such a swap, the credit protection seller, the CDO, receives periodic cash payments, called premiums, in exchange for agreeing to assume the risk of loss on a specific asset in the event that asset experiences a default or other [[credit event]].) Like a cash CDO, the risk of loss on the CDO's portfolio is divided into tranches. Losses will first affect the equity tranche, next the junior tranches, and finally the senior tranche. Each tranche receives a periodic payment (the swap premium), with the junior tranches offering higher premiums.
** A synthetic CDO tranche may be either funded or unfunded. Under the swap agreements, the CDO could have to pay up to a certain amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the CDO's reference portfolio. Some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches. Typically, the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing. Until a credit event occurs, the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in high-quality, liquid assets or placed in a GIC ([[Guaranteed Investment Contract]]) account that offers a return that is a few basis points below [[LIBOR]]. The return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches. When a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required, the required payment is made from the GIC or reserve account that holds the liquid investments. In contrast, senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower. Unlike a cash CDO, investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the CDO when entering into the investment. Instead, the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the CDO in the event the portfolio's losses reach the senior tranche. Funded synthetic issuance exceeded $80 billion in 2006. From an issuance perspective, synthetic CDOs take less time to create. Cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed, and the CDO's tranches can be precisely structured.
* ''Hybrid CDOs'' have a portfolio including both cash assets—like cash CDOs—and swaps that give the CDO credit exposure to additional assets—like a synthetic CDO. A portion of the proceeds from the funded tranches is invested in cash assets and the remainder is held in reserve to cover payments that may be required under the credit default swaps. The CDO receives payments from three sources: the return from the cash assets, the GIC or reserve account investments, and the CDO premiums.

;Single-tranche CDOs
:The flexibility of credit default swaps is used to construct Single Tranche CDOs (bespoke tranche CDOs) where the entire CDO is structured specifically for a single or small group of investors, and the remaining tranches are never sold but held by the dealer based on valuations from internal models. Residual risk is [[Delta neutral#Creating the position|delta-hedged]] by the dealer.

;Structured Operating Companies
:Unlike CDOs, which are terminating structures that typically wind-down or refinance at the end of their financing term, Structured Operating Companies are permanently capitalized variants of CDOs, with an active management team and infrastructure. They often issue term notes, [[commercial paper]], and/or [[auction rate security|auction rate securities]], depending upon the structural and portfolio characteristics of the company. [[Credit Derivative Products Company|Credit Derivative Products Companies]] (CDPC) and [[Structured investment vehicle|Structured Investment Vehicles]] (SIV) are examples, with CDPC taking risk synthetically and SIV with predominantly 'cash' exposure.

===Taxation===
The issuer of a CDO—usually a special purpose entity—is typically a corporation established outside the United States to avoid being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its global income. These corporations must restrict their activities to avoid U.S. tax liabilities; corporations that are deemed to engage in trade or business in the U.S. will be subject to federal taxation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Peaslee, James M. &amp; David Z. Nirenberg. ''Federal Income Taxation of Securitization Transactions and Related Topics''.&lt;/span&gt; Frank J. Fabozzi Associates (2011, with periodic supplements, www.securitizationtax.com): 1018.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign corporations that only invest in and hold portfolios of U.S. stock and debt securities are not. Investing, unlike trading or dealing, is not considered to be a trade or business, regardless of its volume or frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Peaslee &amp; Nirenberg. ''Federal Income Taxation of Securitization Transactions'', 1023.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a safe harbor protects CDO issuers that do trade actively in securities, even though trading in securities technically is a business, provided the issuer's activities do not cause it to be viewed as a dealer in securities or engaged in a banking, lending or similar businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Peaslee &amp; Nirenberg. ''Federal Income Taxation of Securitization Transactions'', 1026.&lt;/ref&gt;

CDOs are generally taxable as debt instruments except for the most junior class of CDOs which are treated as equity and are subject to special rules (such as PFIC and CFC reporting). The PFIC and CFC reporting is very complex and requires a specialized accountant to perform these calculations and manage the tax reporting obligations.

===Types===
'''A) Based on the underlying asset:'''
* [[Collateralized loan obligation]]s (CLOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged bank loans.
* [[Collateralized bond obligation]]s (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged [[fixed income]] securities.
* Collateralized synthetic obligations (CSOs): CDOs backed primarily by [[credit derivative]]s.
* Structured finance CDOs (SFCDOs): CDOs backed primarily by structured products (such as [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] and mortgage-backed securities).&lt;ref name="marketplace1"&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''B) Other types of CDOs by assets/collateral include:'''
* Commercial Real Estate CDOs (CRE CDOs): backed primarily by commercial real estate assets
* [[Collateralized Bond Obligation|Collateralized bond obligations]] (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by corporate bonds
* Collateralized Insurance Obligations (CIOs): backed by insurance or, more usually, reinsurance contracts
* [[CDO-Squared]]: CDOs backed primarily by the tranches issued by other CDOs.&lt;ref name="marketplace1"/&gt;
* [[CDO^n]]: Generic term for CDO&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ([[CDO cubed]]) and higher, where the CDO is backed by other CDOs/CDO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/CDO&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. These are particularly difficult vehicles to model because of the possible repetition of exposures in the underlying CDO.

===Types of collateral===
The collateral for cash CDOs include:
* [[Structured finance]] securities ([[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]], home equity [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]], [[Commercial mortgage-backed security|commercial mortgage-backed securities]])
* [[Leverage (finance)|Leveraged loans]]
* [[Corporate bond]]s
* [[Real estate investment trust]] (REIT) debt
* Commercial real estate mortgage debt (including whole loans, B notes, and Mezzanine debt)
* [[Emerging market debt|Emerging-market sovereign debt]]
* Project finance debt
* Trust Preferred securities

===Transaction participants===
Participants in a CDO transaction include investors, the underwriter, the asset manager, the trustee and collateral administrator, accountants and attorneys. Beginning in 1999, the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] allowed banks to also participate.

====Investors====
Investors—buyers of CDO—include [[insurance company|insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]] companies, [[unit trust]]s, [[investment trust]]s, [[commercial bank]]s, [[investment bank]]s, [[pension fund]] managers, [[private banking]] organizations, other CDOs and [[structured investment vehicle]]s. Investors have different motivations for purchasing CDO securities depending on which tranche they select. At the more senior levels of debt, investors are able to obtain better yields than those that are available on more traditional securities (e.g., corporate bonds) of a similar rating. In some cases, investors utilize leverage and hope to profit from the excess of the spread offered by the senior tranche and their cost of borrowing. This is true because senior tranches pay a spread above LIBOR despite their AAA-ratings. Investors also benefit from the diversification of the CDO portfolio, the expertise of the asset manager, and the credit support built into the transaction. Investors include banks and insurance companies as well as investment funds.

Junior tranche investors achieve a leveraged, non-recourse investment in the underlying diversified collateral portfolio. Mezzanine notes and equity notes offer yields that are not available in most other fixed income securities. Investors include hedge funds, banks, and wealthy individuals.

====Underwriter====
The [[underwriting|underwriter]] of a CDO is typically an [[investment bank]], and acts as the structurer and arranger. Working with the asset management firm that selects the CDO's portfolio, the underwriter structures debt and equity tranches. This includes selecting the debt-to-equity ratio, sizing each tranche, establishing coverage and collateral quality tests, and working with the credit rating agencies to gain the desired ratings for each debt tranche.

The key economic consideration for an underwriter that is considering bringing a new deal to market is whether the transaction can offer a sufficient return to the equity noteholders. Such a determination requires estimating the after-default return offered by the portfolio of debt securities and comparing it to the cost of funding the CDO's rated notes. The excess spread must be large enough to offer the potential of attractive IRRs to the equityholders.

Other underwriter responsibilities include working with a law firm and creating the special purpose legal vehicle (typically a trust incorporated in the [[Cayman Islands]]) that will purchase the assets and issue the CDO's tranches. In addition, the underwriter will work with the asset manager to determine the post-closing trading restrictions that will be included in the CDO's transaction documents and other files.

The final step is to price the CDO (i.e., set the coupons for each debt tranche) and place the tranches with investors. The priority in placement is finding investors for the risky equity tranche and junior debt tranches (A, BBB, etc.) of the CDO. It is common for the asset manager to retain a piece of the equity tranche. In addition, the underwriter was generally expected to provide some type of secondary market liquidity for the CDO, especially its more senior tranches.

According to [[Thomson Financial]], the top underwriters before September 2008 were [[Bear Stearns]], [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Wachovia]], [[Citigroup]], [[Deutsche Bank]], and [[Bank of America|Bank of America Securities]].&lt;ref name=dealbook&gt;{{cite web|last=Dealbook|title=Citi and Merrill Top Underwriting League Tables|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/citi-and-merrill-top-underwriting-league-tables/|work=January 2, 2008,|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDOs are more profitable for underwriters than conventional bond underwriting because of the complexity involved. The underwriter is paid a fee when the CDO is issued.

====The asset manager====
The asset manager plays a key role in each CDO transaction, even after the CDO is issued. An experienced manager is critical in both the construction and maintenance of the CDO's portfolio. The manager can maintain the credit quality of a CDO's portfolio through trades as well as maximize recovery rates when defaults on the underlying assets occur.

In theory, the asset manager should add value in the manner outlined below, although in practice, this did not occur during the credit bubble of the mid-2000s (decade). In addition, it is now understood that the structural flaw in all asset-backed securities (originators profit from loan volume not loan quality) make the roles of subsequent participants peripheral to the quality of the investment.

The asset manager's role begins in the months before a CDO is issued, a bank usually provides financing to the manager to purchase some of the collateral assets for the forthcoming CDO. This process is called warehousing.

Even by the issuance date, the asset manager often will not have completed the construction of the CDO's portfolio. A "ramp-up" period following issuance during which the remaining assets are purchased can extend for several months after the CDO is issued. For this reason, some senior CDO notes are structured as delayed drawdown notes, allowing the asset manager to draw down cash from investors as collateral purchases are made. When a transaction is fully ramped, its initial portfolio of credits has been selected by the asset manager.

However, the asset manager's role continues even after the ramp-up period ends, albeit in a less active role. During the CDO's "reinvestment period", which usually extends several years past the issuance date of the CDO, the asset manager is authorized to reinvest principal proceeds by purchasing additional debt securities. Within the confines of the trading restrictions specified in the CDO's transaction documents, the asset manager can also make trades to maintain the credit quality of the CDO's portfolio. The manager also has a role in the redemption of a CDO's notes by auction call.

There are approximately 300 asset managers in the marketplace. CDO Asset Managers, as with other Asset Managers, can be more or less active depending on the personality and prospectus of the CDO. Asset Managers make money by virtue of the senior fee (which is paid before any of the CDO investors are paid) and subordinated fee as well as any equity investment the manager has in the CDO, making CDOs a lucrative business for asset managers. These fees, together with underwriting fees, administration—approx 1.5 - 2% -- by virtue of capital structure are provided by the equity investment, by virtue of reduced cashflow.

{{See also|List of CDO Managers}}

====The trustee and collateral administrator====
The trustee holds title to the assets of the CDO for the benefit of the "noteholders" (i.e., the investors). In the CDO market, the trustee also typically serves as collateral administrator. In this role, the collateral administrator produces and distributes noteholder reports, performs various compliance tests regarding the composition and liquidity of the asset portfolios in addition to constructing and executing the priority of payment waterfall models.&lt;ref&gt;Two notable exceptions to this are Virtus Partners and Wilmington Trust Conduit Services, a subsidiary of [[Wilmington Trust]], which offer collateral administration services, but are not trustee banks.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the asset manager, there are relatively few trustees in the marketplace. The following institutions offer trustee services in the CDO marketplace:
* [[Bank of New York Mellon]] (note: the Bank of New York Mellon acquired the corporate trust unit of [[JP Morgan]]),
* [[BNP Paribas]] Securities Services (note: currently serves the European market only)
* [[Citibank]]
* [[Deutsche Bank]]
* [[Equity Trust]]
* [[Intertrust Group]] (note: until mid-2009 was known as Fortis Intertrust; Acquired ATC Capital Markets in 2013)
* [[HSBC]]
* [[Sanne Trust]]
* [[State Street Corporation]]
* [[US Bank]] (note: US Bank acquired the corporate trust unit of [[Wachovia]] in 2008 and Bank of America in September 2011, which had previously acquired LaSalle Bank in 2010, and is the current market share leader)
* [[Wells Fargo]]
* [[Wilmington Trust]]: Wilmington shut down their business in early 2009.

====Accountants====
The underwriter typically will hire an accounting firm to perform due diligence on the CDO's portfolio of debt securities. This entails verifying certain attributes, such as credit rating and coupon/spread, of each collateral security. Source documents or public sources will typically be used to tie-out the collateral pool information. In addition, the accountants typically calculate certain collateral tests and determine whether the portfolio is in compliance with such tests.

The firm may also perform a cash flow tie-out in which the transaction's waterfall is modeled per the priority of payments set forth in the transaction documents. The yield and weighted average life of the bonds or equity notes being issued is then calculated based on the modeling assumptions provided by the underwriter. On each payment date, an accounting firm may work with the trustee to verify the distributions that are scheduled to be made to the noteholders.

====Attorneys====
Attorneys ensure compliance with applicable securities law and negotiate and draft the transaction documents. Attorneys will also draft an offering document or prospectus the purpose of which is to satisfy statutory requirements to disclose certain information to investors. This will be circulated to investors. It is common for multiple counsels to be involved in a single deal because of the number of parties to a single CDO from asset management firms to underwriters.

==In popular media==
In the 2015 biographical film [[The Big Short (film)|''The Big Short'']], CDOs are described metaphorically as "dog shit wrapped in cat shit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Adam McKay (Director) |date=November 12, 2015 |title=The Big Short |medium=Motion picture |minutes=33 |location=United States |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] (distributor) |quote="So mortgage bonds are dog shit.

===Speaker of the House===
In September 2007, a committee questioned Speaker [[Patricia Etteh]] about her spending of ₦628 million ($4.8m) on home renovation and automobiles. She denied wrongdoing, but many representatives were unhappy with her attempts to defend herself, blows were traded on the floor of the House, and Etteh had to be escorted from the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Nigerian MPs brawl over speaker |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7005402.stm |work= |publisher=BBC News |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=4 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] and many top PDP members continued to back her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Philip |last=Nyam |title=Etteh: Countdown To October 16 |url=http://www.leadershipnigeria.com/product_info.php?products_id=15208 |work=Leadership |publisher=Leadership Newspapers Group |accessdate=14 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713192609/http://www.leadershipnigeria.com/product_info.php?products_id=15208 |archivedate=13 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but a large segment of the party, led by Lawan and including Bankole, called for her resignation.&lt;ref name=v2&gt;{{cite news |title= After Etteh, PDP's our next target—Integrity group's Farouk Lawan |url= http://www.vanguardngr.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1410&amp;Itemid=0 |work=Vanguard Online Edition |publisher=Vanguard Media |date=3 November 2007 |accessdate=3 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Bankole, among multiple other contenders, hoped to succeed her as early as 5 October 2007.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;{{cite news |first=Olusola |last=Sanni |title= N628m: Who Blinks First?|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/06102007/nation.html |work=Nigerian Tribune online |publisher= African Newspapers of Nigeria|date=5 October 1007 |accessdate=3 November 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Etteh's resignation from the post on 30 October (along with her deputy, who was also caught up in the scandal),&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news |title= Nigeria speaker goes in graft row |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7069654.stm|work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=3 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Integrity Group]] (anti-Etteh) member Terngu Tsegba became interim speaker.&lt;ref name=dt&gt;{{cite news|first=Mohammed S |last=Shehu |author2=Nasiru L.

====Nomination====
On 1 November, he was elected to succeed Etteh.&lt;ref name=v2/&gt;  The election began at 10.30am.  The House was short of the statutory 360 members because three (Moses Segun Oladimeji, Joe Anota and Aminu Shuaibu Safana) died. Two constituencies were yet to elect their representatives. 328 of the 355 members voted.&lt;ref name=thenation&gt;{{cite news |first=Lateef |last=Ibrahim |title=PDP loses battle to choose Speaker |url=http://www.thenationonlineng.net/archive2/tblnews_Detail.php?id=36043 |work=The Nation Archive |publisher=Vintage Press Limited |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220064235/http://www.thenationonlineng.net/archive2/tblnews_Detail.php?id=36043 |archivedate=20 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Samson Osagie]] of [[Edo State]] nominated Bankole for the post of Speaker, and [[Lynda Ikpeazu]] of [[Anambra State]] seconded the proposal. His challenger was [[Osun State]] Representative [[George Jolaoye]], whom he beat by 304 votes to 20 (and 4 abstentions). Etteh was among those who voted against Bankole.&lt;ref name=sun2&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Ojo |title=Reps get 37-year-old bachelor as speaker |url= http://www.sunnewsonline.com/national-02-11-2007-001.htm |work=The Sun News On-line |publisher= The Sun Publishing|date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=3 November 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new deputy speaker was [[Usman Bayero Nafada]].&lt;ref name=v/&gt;  Bankole was declared speaker at 1.30pm.&lt;ref name=thenation/&gt;

In his acceptance speech, entitled "We Stand Upon The Threshold of History",&lt;ref name=thenation/&gt; Bankole said "I am taking over the mantle of leadership at a very difficult time. But these are hard times, we need to build confidence again and assure the populace that we are still their representatives. I want an independent house that Nigerians will be proud of, this is my first task."&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;

====Tenure====
One week after his election, political opponents claimed that Bankole had not completed his [[National Youth Service Corps]] (N.Y.S.C) service, which is mandatory for all Nigerian university graduates under thirty years of age when they graduate, and called for his resignation over the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Clottey |title=Nigeria Opponents Accuse New Parliament Speaker of Dodging Youth Service |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/Africa/2007-11-08-voa9.cfm |work=[[Voice of America]] news |publisher=[[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] |date=8 November 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115210928/http://voanews.com/english/Africa/2007-11-08-voa9.cfm |archivedate=15 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankole provided his N.Y.S.C discharge certificate, ending the rumour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Nigeria's Reps Speaker Reacts on NYSC Saga |url=http://www.leadershipnigeria.com/product_info.php?products_id=17889&amp;osCsid=970b00041f95995bf21f40599ecefb76 |work=Leadership online |publisher=Leadership Newspapers Group |accessdate=17 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109202217/http://www.leadershipnigeria.com/product_info.php?products_id=17889&amp;osCsid=4b74185abd257a322da2d23a5bf6a475 |archivedate=9 January 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 22 June 2010 Bankole suspended 11 members of parliament indefinitely for disorderliness and fighting in the house.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian newspaper, Thursday, 24 June 2010, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return of Unspent Funds by Government Ministries====
During his tenure, the House of Representatives as a result of performance of its oversight function ensured that Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA's) returned unspent budgeted funds amounting to about 450 billion naira to the government treasury in 2007 while about 350 billion naira was again recovered in 2008.&lt;ref name=democracyguard&gt;{{cite news|last=PONG|first=JOAL|title=Analysis of the 2007-2011 session of the National Assembly|url=http://democracyguard.com/speical-report/analysis-of-the-2007-2011-session-of-the-national-assembly/|accessdate=20 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220070355/http://democracyguard.com/speical-report/analysis-of-the-2007-2011-session-of-the-national-assembly/|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In total, the House of Representatives ensured the return of about 1 trillion naira unspent funds by MDA's as part of the annual budgetary process under Bankole's speakership.  These were unprecedented in the history of oversight in Nigeria’s legislature. Up until then, MDA's did not return unspent funds. Also, the House of Representatives discovered that about 5 trillion naira generated revenue were never remitted by MDA's for the past 5 years before investigation.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news |title= Stewardship: How Bankole stands at point of exit |url= http://tribune.com.ng/index.php/politics/22450-stewardship-how-bankole-stands-at-point-of-exit- |work= Nigerian Tribune On-line |publisher= The Nigerian Tribune |date= 25 May 2011 |accessdate= 4 March 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130222210843/http://tribune.com.ng/index.php/politics/22450-stewardship-how-bankole-stands-at-point-of-exit- |archivedate= 22 February 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Termination of Inflated Abuja Runway Contract====
Under Bankole, the 64 billion naira contract for the second runway for the Nnamdi Azikwe Airport in Abuja was investigated and found to be grossly inflated.  The contract was thus terminated by the Federal Government of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=dailytrust&gt;{{cite news|title=Three years of Bankole’s highs, lows|url=http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/weekly/index.php/politics/7940-three-years-of-bankoles-highs-lows|accessdate=6 February 2015|work=Weekly Trust|date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bills====
Under him, the House of Representatives accepted 328 motions, approved 282 resolutions and passed 136 bills. These bills include the Freedom of Information(FOI) Act and Fiscal Responsibility Act which ensured that all revenue-generating agencies of government present their budgets for scrutiny every year. The agencies, which include the CBN, NNPC and Customs spent trillions of naira yearly without appropriation by the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=tribune /&gt;

====Trial====
In 2011, Bankole was tried by Nigeria's anti-corruption agency &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bankole to appear in court today |url=http://www.nigeriannewsservice.com/nns-news-archive/lead-stories/bankole-to-appear-in-court-today |work= |publisher=Nigerian News Service Online Edition |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=29 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123211335/http://nigeriannewsservice.com/nns-news-archive/lead-stories/bankole-to-appear-in-court-today |archivedate=23 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grd&gt;{{cite news |title= Taking loans cannot amount to illegal means (1) |url= http://ngrguardiannews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=76305:-taking-loans-cannot-amount-to-illegal-means-1-&amp;catid=42:law&amp;Itemid=600|work= |publisher=The Guardian Online Edition |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was cleared of all charges. 

The judge while clearing Bankole stated that the House of Representatives incurred a loan from a bank to run its expenses, the loan was paid back fully to the bank and Bankole was not a beneficiary of the loan in any capacity therefore no crime was committed. &lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite news |title= Nigerian ex-speaker Dimeji Bankole cleared of fraud |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16821097|work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown Wichita''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]], [[United States]]. The political and financial hub of the city, it is home to several of the area’s major landmarks and event venues including the [[Epic Center]], [[Century II Performing Arts &amp; Convention Center]], [[Intrust Bank Arena]], and the Old Town entertainment district.&lt;ref name=Dev/&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Wichita, Kansas}}
[[File:Sedgwick co historical museum.jpg|left|thumb|Wichita's Old City Hall, now the Sedgwick County Historical Museum (2008)]]
In 1872, the community of Wichita opened a toll bridge on Douglas Avenue to [[Delano, Wichita, Kansas|Delano]] across the [[Arkansas River]], and the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] opened a line through the city, triggering an economic boom. Local industries in banking, meat packing, and real estate emerged. A large warehouse district developed along the rail lines south from Central Avenue.&lt;ref name=OldTownHistory&gt;{{cite web | title = Oldtown History | publisher = OldtownWichita.com | url = http://www.oldtownwichita.com/oldtown-history | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1870s, the intersection of Douglas Avenue and Main Street had become the downtown hub of local commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Jews in Wichita | publisher = Mid-Kansas Jewish Federation | url = http://mkjf.org/joomla/index.php/about-us/16-history-of-jews-in-wichita | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued economic growth through the 1880s spurred further downtown development, including the completion of the Wichita City Building in 1892.  The building housed all city government offices, both the police and fire departments, and the city’s first public library.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Museum and its Building: Old City Hall | publisher = The Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum | url = http://wichitahistory.org/our_building/ | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the subsequent decades, a number of manufacturers constructed plants downtown, including the [[Coleman Company]] in 1901.&lt;ref name=OldTownHistory/&gt;

The Forum, Wichita’s convention center and primary event venue, opened downtown in 1911. It was built on the site of city co-founder Dutch Bill Greiffenstein’s homestead.&lt;ref name=CenturyII&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Century II | publisher = City of Wichita | url = http://www.century2.org/Pages/History.aspx | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orpheum Theatre (Wichita, Kansas)|Orpheum Theatre]] opened downtown in 1922 and became a popular venue on the [[vaudeville]] circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Buchanan-Spachek | first = Johny | last2 = Salley | first2 = Paul | title = Orpheum Theatre | publisher = Cinema Treasures | url = http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/381 | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, sections of downtown had entered a period of decline. To commemorate the centennial of Wichita’s founding, the city razed The Forum and in its place built the [[Century II Performing Arts &amp; Convention Center]] which opened in 1969.&lt;ref name=CenturyII/&gt; The city government relocated to a new City Hall in 1975. In 1981, the former City Building reopened as the [[Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum]].&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; In 1987, construction finished downtown on the [[Epic Center]] office tower, the tallest building in the city and in the state of Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epic Center | publisher = Emporis | url = https://www.emporis.com/buildings/125730/epic-center-wichita-ks-usa | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the city initiated a redevelopment plan to revitalize Downtown Wichita.&lt;ref name=Redev&gt;{{cite web | title = Project Downtown History | publisher = Wichita Downtown Development Corporation | url = http://downtownwichita.org/development/project-downtown | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the plan’s results was the redevelopment of the old warehouse district into Old Town, an entertainment district home to numerous restaurants and night clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Project Downtown: The Master Plan for Wichita | publisher = Wichita Downtown Development Corporation | date = November 2010 | page = 2.2 | url = http://downtownwichita.org/user/file/Project%20Downtown%20Adopted%20Plan.pdf | accessdate = 2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city implemented further development plans, including the construction of [[Intrust Bank Arena]], a new multi-purpose indoor arena which opened in 2010.&lt;ref name=Redev/&gt;

''For the application of engineering economics in the practice of [[civil engineering]] please see this [[Engineering economics (Civil Engineering)|article]].''

'''Engineering Economics''', previously known as '''engineering economy''', is a subset of [[economics]] concerned with the use and "...application of economic principles" &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009"&gt;Dharmaraj, E.. Engineering Economics. Mumbai, IN: Himalaya Publishing House, 2009. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 9 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in the analysis of engineering decisions.&lt;ref name="Morris1960"&gt; Morris, W. Thomas. (1960). Engineering economy: the analysis of management decisions. Homewood, Ill.: R. D. Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt; As a discipline, it is focused on the branch of economics known as [[microeconomics]] in that it studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;Copied content from [[Microeconomics]]; see that page's history for attribution ...&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it focuses on the decision making process, its context and environment.&lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; It is pragmatic by nature, integrating economic theory with engineering practice. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; But, it is also a simplified application of microeconomic theory in that it avoids a number of microeconomic concepts such as price determination, competition and demand/supply. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt;  As a discipline though, it is closely related to others such as [[statistics]], [[mathematics]] and [[cost accounting]]. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; It draws upon the logical framework of economics but adds to that the analytical power of mathematics and statistics. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; 

[[Engineer]]s seek solutions to problems, and the economic viability of each potential solution is normally considered along with the technical aspects.
Fundamentally, engineering economics involves formulating, estimating, and evaluating the economic outcomes when alternatives to accomplish a defined purpose are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Optimal Switching Times for Season and Single Tickets''|url=http://ocw.metu.edu.tr/pluginfile.php/2193/mod_resource/content/0/LecturePresentation1.pdf|publisher=[[Middle East Technical University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some U.S. undergraduate [[civil engineering]] curricula, engineering economics is a required course.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/departments-research/civil/undergraduate Undergraduate Programs Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering]. Retrieved 6 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a topic on the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]ination, and questions might also be asked on the Principles and Practice of Engineering examination; both are part of the [[Professional Engineering]] registration process.

Considering the [[time value of money]] is central to most engineering economic analyses.  [[Cash flow]]s are [[Discounting|''discounted'']] using an [[interest rate]], except in the most basic economic studies.

For each problem, there are usually many possible ''alternatives''. One option that must be considered in each analysis, and is often the ''choice'', is the ''do nothing alternative''.  The ''opportunity cost'' of making one choice over another must also be considered.  There are also non-economic factors to be considered, like color, style, public image, etc.; such factors are termed ''attributes''.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Economy'', 11th Ed., Sullivan, Bontadelli, and Wicks, Prentice-Hall, New York, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

''Costs'' as well as ''revenues'' are considered, for each alternative, for an ''analysis period'' that is either a fixed number of years or the estimated life of the project.  The ''salvage value'' is often forgotten, but is important, and is either the net cost or revenue for decommissioning the project.

Some other topics that may be addressed in engineering economics are [[inflation]], [[uncertainty]], replacements, [[depreciation]], [[resource depletion]], [[taxes]], [[tax credits]], [[accounting]], cost estimations, or [[Capital (economics)|capital financing]]. All these topics are primary skills and knowledge areas in the field of [[cost engineering]].

Since engineering is an important part of the [[manufacturing]] sector of the [[economy]], engineering industrial economics is an important part of industrial or business economics. Major topics in engineering industrial economics are:

* The economics of the management, operation, and growth and profitability of engineering firms;
* Macro-level engineering economic trends and issues;
* Engineering product markets and demand influences; and
* The development, marketing, and financing of new engineering technologies and products.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BE1v91Qlj64C&amp;dq=isbn:090632128X Engineering Firms: A Survey Of Factors Affecting Their Growth &amp; Performance]'', Industrial Systems Research Publications, Manchester (UK), 2nd. Revised edition 2003, page 1. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Benefit–cost ratio]]

== Examples of Usage ==
Some examples of engineering economic problems range from value analysis to economic studies. Each of these is relevant in different situations, and most often used by engineers or project managers. For example, engineering economic analysis helps a company not only determine the difference between fixed and incremental costs of certain operations, but also calculates that cost, depending upon a number of variables. Further uses of engineering economics include:

* Value Analysis
* [[Linear programming|Linear Programming]]
* Critical Path Economy
* Interest and Money - Time Relationships
* Depreciation and Valuation
* Capital Budgeting
* Risk, Uncertainty, and Sensitivity Analysis
* Fixed, Incremental, and Sunk Costs
* Replacement Studies
* Minimum Cost Formulas
* Various Economic Studies in relation to both Public and Private Ventures

Each of the previous components of engineering economics is critical at certain junctures, depending on the situation, scale, and objective of the project at hand. Critical path economy, as an example, is necessary in most situations as it is the coordination and planning of material, labor, and capital movements in a specific project. The most critical of these "paths" are determined to be those that have affect upon the outcome both in time and cost. Therefore, the critical paths must be determined and closely monitored by engineers and managers alike. Engineering economics helps provide the Gantt charts and activity-event networks to ascertain the correct use of time and resources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;DeGarmo E., Canada J., Engineering Economy, fifth edition, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value Analysis ===
Proper value analysis finds its roots in the need for industrial engineers and managers to not only simplify and improve processes and systems, but also the logical simplification of the designs of those products and systems. Though not directly related to engineering economy, value analysis is nonetheless important, and allows engineers to properly manage new and existing systems/processes to make them more simple and save money and time. Further, value analysis helps combat common "roadblock excuses" that may trip up managers or engineers. Sayings such as "The customer wants it this way" are retorted by questions such as; has the customer been told of cheaper alternatives or methods? "If the product is changed, machines will be idle for lack of work" can be combated by; can management not find new and profitable uses for these machines? Questions like these are part of engineering economy, as they preface any real studies or analyses.  

=== Linear Programming ===
[[Linear programming]] is the use of mathematical methods to find optimized solutions, whether they be minimized or maximized in nature. This method uses a series of lines to create a polygon then to determine the largest, or smallest, point on that shape. Manufacturing operations often use linear programming to help mitigate costs and maximize profits or production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

=== Interest and Money - Time Relationships ===
Considering the prevalence of capital to be lent for a certain period of time, with the understanding that it will be returned to the investor, money-time relationships analyze the costs associated with these types of actions. Capital itself must be divided into two different categories, ''equity capital'' and ''debt capital''. Equity capital is money already at the disposal of the business, and mainly derived from profit, and therefore is not of much concern, as it has no owners that demand its return with interest. Debt capital does indeed have owners, and they require that its usage be returned with "profit", otherwise known as interest. The interest to be paid by the business is going to be an expense, while the capital lenders will take interest as a profit, which may confuse the situation. To add to this, each will change the income tax position of the participants. 

Interest and Money - Time Relationships comes into play when the capital required to complete a project must be either borrowed or derived from reserves. To borrow brings about the question of interest and value created by the completion of the project. While taking capital from reserves also denies its usage on other projects that may yield more results. [[Interest]] in the simplest terms is defined by the multiplication of the principle, the units of time, and the [[interest rate]]. The complexity of interest calculations, however, becomes much higher as factors such as compounding interest or [[Annuity|annuities]] come into play. 

=== Depreciation and Valuation ===
The fact that assets and material in the real world eventually wear down, and thence break, is a situation that must be accounted for. [[Depreciation]] itself is defined by the decreasing of value of any given asset, though some exceptions do exist. [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] can be considered the basis for depreciation in a basic sense, as any decrease in ''value'' would be based on an ''original value''. The idea and existence of depreciation becomes especially relevant to engineering and project management is the fact that capital equipment and assets used in operations will slowly decrease in worth, which will also coincide with an increase in the likelihood of machine failure. Hence the recording and calculation of depreciation is important for two major reasons. 

# To give an estimate of "recovery capital" that has been put back into the property.
# To enable depreciation to be charged against profits that, like other costs, can be used for income taxation purposes. 

Both of these reasons, however, cannot make up for the "fleeting" nature of depreciation, which make direct analysis somewhat difficult. To further add to the issues associated with depreciation, it must be broken down into three separate types, each having intricate calculations and implications. 

* Normal Depreciation, due to physical or functional losses.
* Price Depreciation, due to changes in market value.
* Depletion, due to the use of all available resources.

Calculation of depreciation also comes in a number of forms; ''straight line, declining balance, sum-of-the-year's,'' and ''service output''. The first method being perhaps the easiest to calculate, while the remaining have varying levels of difficulty and utility. Most situations faced by managers in regards to depreciation can be solved using any of these formulas, however, company policy or preference of individual may affect the choice of model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Capital Budgeting ===
[[Capital budgeting]], in relation to engineering economics, is the proper usage and utilization of capital to achieve project objectives. It can be fully defined by the statement; "... as the series of decisions by individuals and firms concerning how much and where resources will be obtained and expended to meet future objectives."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This definition almost perfectly explains capital and its general relation to engineering, though some special cases may not lend themselves to such a concise explanation. The actual acquisition of that capital has many different routes, from equity to bonds to retained profits, each having unique strengths and weakness, especially when in relation to income taxation. Factors such as risk of capital loss, along with possible or expected returns must also be considered when capital budgeting is underway. For example, if a company has $20,000 to invest in a number of high, moderate, and low risk projects, the decision would depend upon how much risk the company is willing to take on, and if the returns offered by each category offset this perceived risk. Continuing with this example, if the high risk offered only 20% return, while the moderate offered 19% return, engineers and managers would most likely choose the moderate risk project, as its return is far more favorable for its category. The high risk project failed to offer proper returns to warrant its risk status. A more difficult decision may be between a moderate risk offering 15% while a low risk offering 11% return. The decision here would be much more subject to factors such as company policy, extra available capital, and possible investors. &lt;blockquote&gt;"In general, the firm should estimate the project opportunities, including investment requirements and prospective rates of return for each, expected to be available for the coming period. Then the available capital should be tentatively allocated to the most favorable projects. The lowest prospective rate of return within the capital available then becomes the minimum acceptable rate of return for analyses of any projects during that period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Economy|last=DeGarmo|first=E. Paul|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc.|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=209-210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Minimum Cost Formulas ===
Being one of the most important and integral operations in the engineering economic field is the minimization of cost in systems and processes. Time, resources, labor, and capital must all be minimized when placed into any system, so that revenue, product, and profit can be maximized. Hence, the general equation;

&lt;math&gt;C=ax +b/x+k&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is total cost, ''a b'' and ''k'' are constants, and ''x'' is the variable number of units produced.  

There are a great number of cost analysis formulas, each for particular situations and are warranted by the policies of the company in question, or the preferences of the engineer at hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Economic Studies, both Private and Public in Nature ===
Economic studies, which are much more common outside of engineering economics, are still used from time to time to determine feasibility and utility of certain projects. They do not, however, truly reflect the "common notion" of economic studies, which is fixated upon macroeconomics, something engineers have little interaction with. Therefore, the studies conducted in engineering economics are for specific companies and limited projects inside those companies. At most one may expect to find some feasibility studies done by private firms for the government or another business, but these again are in stark contrast to the overarching nature of true economic studies. Studies have a number of major steps that can be applied to almost every type of situation, those being as follows;

* Planning and Screening - Mainly reviewing objectives and issues that may be encountered.
* Reference to Standard Economic Studies - Consultation of standard forms.
* Estimating - Speculating as to the magnitude of costs and other variables.
* Reliability - The ability to properly estimate.
* Comparison between Actual and Projected Performance - Verify savings, review failures, to ensure that proposals were valid, and to add to future studies.
* Objectivity of the Analyst - To ensure the individual that advanced proposals or conducted analysis was not biased toward certain outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Plot==
Naomi Bishop ([[Anna Gunn]]) is a senior [[investment bank]]er who deals with [[IPO]]s. After her latest project is undervalued she faces professional setbacks including clients losing confidence in her work. To bounce back she is hired to handle the IPO for Cachet, a privacy company with a social networking platform. 

Around the same time Naomi bumps into Samantha Ryan ([[Alysia Reiner]]), an old college classmate who now works as a public attorney. Unbeknownst to Naomi, Samantha is investigating Naomi's on-again, off-again boyfriend Michael Connor ([[James Purefoy]]), a broker at the same firm as Naomi who Samantha suspects is involved in [[insider trading]]. Michael tries to get information from Naomi about Cachet but fails. 

While doing due diligence, Naomi learns from Marin, one of the coders, that Cachet is hackable. Despite having a nagging feeling that something is wrong, the numbers check out and Naomi continues to try to sell the shares of the company to investors. Michael, who has had no new insider trading tips to pass on to his friends at investment firm Titanite, tries unsuccessfully to hack into Naomi's phone.

Vice President Erin Manning (Sarah Megan Thomas), Naomi's assistant on the IPO, learns that Marin has been fired. To warn Naomi of this, she goes to Michael's home after not being able to reach Naomi and ends up leaking the information to him in the hope that he will be able to get her a promotion, something Naomi has been unable to do for her. Michael leaks the tips to his friends at Titanite and then sends the story to an old college roommate who is a tech journalist.

Naomi figures out that it was Erin who betrayed her, based on her having a green pen, the same type of pen that Michael uses. When the shares open, confidence is lost and the company loses a third of its value on the first day of trading. 

Michael changes jobs to Titanite, neglecting to take Erin with him. Naomi is fired, while Erin assumes her position. Unable to crack the case from the outside, Samantha interviews for a high-paying corporate position, saying that she is in it for the money using words from a speech she heard Naomi give at an alumni event.

The site's critical consensus reads, {{-"}}''Equity'' brings a welcome change of perspective to the financial thriller genre, along with a nuanced story and a terrific cast led by a powerful effort from Anna Gunn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Equity'' (2016) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/equity/ |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted average]] rating to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Equity'' Reviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/equity |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]] of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote: "''Equity'' may not be the fanciest or flashiest of financial thrillers—more like off-brand [[David Fincher]] or [[Steven Soderbergh]]—but it gets the job done. Its major players are all women trying to make careers in boys’ club professions [...]; that's all the motivation the movie offers and perhaps all that it really needs. It skips past the usual handwringing over the temptations of capitalist wealth and just gets right to the risk-taking and double-crossing, assuming (rightly) that viewers don't need a character to have a backstory, a tragic secret, and a dead spouse, best friend, or parent to understand why they'd do anything to hold on to a career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vishnevetsky|first1=Ignatiy|title=A woman fights to hold on to her career on Wall Street in Equity |url=http://www.avclub.com/review/woman-fights-hold-her-career-wall-street-equity-240164 |website=[[The A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4977">'''Four Corners Rule''' is the meaning of a written document such as a [[contract]], [[Will (law)|will]], or [[deed]] as represented solely by its textual content. This term may also be applicable to other legal instruments.

==Contract interpretation==
In [[contract]] interpretation, the Four Corners Rule refers to a [[common law]] doctrine dating back to old English courts that requires the court to resolve contractual disputes based on the words contained in the disputed contract.  The four corners doctrine is similar to the [[parole evidence rule|Parole Evidence Rule]], which prohibits a contracting party from introducing evidence separate from the contract that would change fundamentally the intended understanding as written in the contract. However, the Four Corners Doctrine prohibits a party from introducing evidence to interpret an unambiguous term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thelawdictionary.org/four-corners/ Four Corners Rule definition]&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine also requires a court to discern what the contracting parties intended by using the whole document; no cherry picking.  Most commercial contracts contain a clause entitled either "Merger", "Integration", or "Entire Agreement". In this clause, there would usually be language indicating that the parties' understanding of the other provisions of the contract are contained within the four corners of the same.  Many modern contracts have taken it further to state that the entire agreement is contained within the agreement and that the agreement supersedes all prior understandings.  

==Examples==
* "There are no extraneous agreements or other understandings between the parties.  The entire agreement is contained within the four corners of this document and any dispute to the meaning contained therein will be governed by this document."
* "The parties intend that this Agreement, together with all attachments, schedules, exhibits, and other documents that both are referenced in this Agreement and refer to this Agreement, represent the final expression of the parties' intent relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, contain all the terms the parties agreed to relating to the subject matter, and replace all of the parties' previous discussions, understandings, negotiations, representations and agreements relating to the subject matter of this Agreement regardless whether written or oral."
* "This Agreement contains the entire and integrated agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral."

==Case law==
The following is an incomplete list of examples where courts used the Four Corners Doctrine while interpreting the disputed-document:
# ''From the four corners of the document'': as derived from the text of the agreement itself, without relying upon other resources or witnesses.
#* "Absent ambiguity, the parties’ intentions must be discerned ''from the four corners of the document'', and extrinsic evidence may not be considered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://162.114.92.72/COA/2007-CA-000498.pdf KY Supreme Court 2007-CA-000498]&lt;/ref&gt;
#* "Construction of a deed is a matter of law, and the intention of the parties is to be gathered ''from the four corners of the instrument''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://162.114.92.72/COA/1995-CA-001813.pdf KY Supreme Court 1995-CA-001813]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Looking at the four corners of the will'': examining and analyzing the will.
#* "It is evident to us, from ''looking at the four corners of the will'', ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://162.114.92.72/COA/1996-CA-000833.pdf KY Supreme Court 1996-CA-000833]&lt;/ref&gt;
#  Determining whether to suppress evidence recovered and whether it was covered in the warrant.
#* "This Court has interpreted the above constitutional and statutory provisions of this State to mean just what they clearly state, and by doing so has characterized its interpretation by calling it the "four corners" rule or doctrine of law."&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/1986/1064-84-4.html ''Adkins v. State'', 717 S.W.2d 363 (1986) Texas]&lt;/ref&gt;
#* "We granted defendant's application for certiorari, 600 So. 2d 617 (La.1992), primarily to consider the rulings of the lower courts in the light of the "four corners" doctrine pronounced by this court in ''State v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3735">'''Gary Coull''' (April 14, 1954&amp;ndash;October 26, 2006) was a co-founder and chairman of [[CLSA]], a [[brokerage house]] specializing in [[Asia-Pacific]] stock markets. 

Born in Canada, Coull graduated in 1976 from the [[University of British Columbia]] with a bachelor of arts. From 1977 to 1983, he working as a business journalist for the [[South China Morning Post]] and the [[Far Eastern Economic Review]].

In 1983, Coull left journalism and started a small China investment and trading company. Several years later, he joined a [[Hong Kong]] brokerage firm, Winfull Laing et Cruickshank. The French bank, [[Crédit Lyonnais]] subsequently took over Laing, bought out Winfull, and created the platform for what became CLSA. In 2003, Crédit Lyonnais merged with [[Crédit Agricole]].

Coull and a fellow journalist, Australian Jim Walker (d. 2004), co-founded CLSA in 1986. Coull was influential in attracting international investors to Asia via, for example, CLSA's annual investors' forum in [[Hong Kong]]. The annual forums in May, and since 2003 in September, included mid-week parties that featured well-known, but ageing pop stars (such as [[Elton John]], [[Duran Duran]] or [[Mariah Carey]]), as well as sessions by former and current heads of state.

In September 2006, the magazine ''[[FinanceAsia]]'' named Coull as one of the top 50 most influential people in shaping Asia's financial landscape over the previous decade.

He mentored the careers of several prominent Asian analysts including [[Jing Ulrich]], [[Douglas Clayton]], and Scottish economist Jim Walker (who is not the same person as the now deceased, other co-founder of CLSA). 

Coull also chaired CLSA's asset-management group, CLSA Capital Partners, whose investors include General Electric Pension Trust, Sony Life, [[Verizon]], the German insurance group [[Allianz]] and [[Crédit Agricole]]. He was also one of the governors of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in [[Hong Kong]] and director of the Asian Corporate Governance Association.

==Obituaries==
On October 30, 2006, the online edition of ''[[The Times]]'' of London published a detailed biography of Coull four days after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article617186.ece |title=Gary Coull -Times Online |work=[[The Times]] |date=2006-10-30 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1,200-word obituary concludes with the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;"From Wall Street to Hong Kong, there is no dearth of brokers and economists claiming to have foreseen the economic explosion of China decades ago. Coull was among a tiny handful of those with a document to prove it: a detailed prediction of Chinese economic success long before the mainstream political or financial community had envisioned it."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In an obituary of its online edition, ''[[FinanceAsia]]'' magazine described Coull as "the charismatic 52-year-old head of Asia's only remaining true international brokerage firm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.financeasia.com/print.aspx?CIID=67275 |title=Gary Coull 1954-2006 |work=[[FinanceAsia]] |date=2006-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928024504/http://www.financeasia.com/print.aspx?CIID=67275 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Financial Times]]'' called Coull "a fixture of Hong Kong's financial and journalism communities for 30 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/b794499a-6547-11db-90fd-0000779e2340.html |title=CLSA co-founder dies after cancer battle |author=Tom Mitchell |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4205">The '''NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index''' is a modified equal dollar weighted index of companies involved in gold mining. BUGS stands for Basket of Unhedged Gold Stocks. It is also referred to by its ticker symbol "HUI". The HUI Index and [[Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index]] (XAU) are the two most watched gold indices on the market. The main difference between them is that the HUI Index takes into account only gold mining stocks whereas the XAU Index includes both gold and silver producers.&lt;ref name="Sunshine Profits"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/hui/ |title= Dictionary: HUI Index |author= Przemyslaw Radomski, CFA |publisher= Sunshine Profits |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gold BUGS Index was designed to provide significant exposure to near term movements in gold prices by including companies that do not hedge their gold production beyond 1.5 years. The HUI Index was developed with a base value of 200.00 as of March 15, 1996.

'''Hany M. Sala'am''' ({{lang-ar|هاني سلام}}) is the current chairman and CEO of [[Gulf Resources Corporation]] (GRC) an international group of companies specialising in the exploration and development of energy, mining and smelting of related natural resources. Sala'am graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science in Engineering|Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering]]. Sala'am became a successful entrepreneur from the outset of his career establishing a network of companies throughout the Middle East, Europe, North America and Africa and has acted as Chairman to GRC since its inception.

== Family Background ==
Sala'am born in Lebanon was raised in a successful business and politically orientated family which presumably formed the basis of his future entrepreneurial and diplomatic activities. His father Muhammad Salaam in partnership with his paternal uncle Saeb Sala'am founded [[Middle East Airlines]] (Lebanon’s national airline) in 1948. Saeb Sala'am also served as Prime Minister of Lebanon as did another of Sala'am’s paternal uncles [[Rashid Karami]]. On Sala'am’s maternal side his uncle Dr. Hussein Fakri Khalidi served as Prime Minister of Jordan.

Sala'am's eldest daughter [[Princess Ghida al-Talal|Ghida]] married HRH [[Prince Talal bin Muhammad|Prince Talal Bin Muhammad]] a Jordanian Royal in Amman July, 1991. They have two sons and one daughter: Prince Hussein, Prince Muhammad &amp; Princess Raaja. Princess Ghida acts as chairperson to the [[King Hussein Cancer Center]] in Jordan.

== Political Endeavours ==
Sala'am served his country as a Presidential Envoy under the governments of Presidents [[Suleiman Franjieh]], [[Elias Sarkis]] and [[Amin Gemayel]]. He achieved success as Head of the Lebanese delegation and with his partner [[Mahdi Al Tajir]] negotiated with the late President [[Hafez al-Assad]], securing the peace accords (known as Taif) which ended the [[Lebanese Civil War]].

== Gulf Resources Corporation “GRC” ==
GRC was formed in the late 1979 by its current Chairman (Sala'am), and began operations as a civil engineering contractor. Shortly after, an association with the [[Kaiser Aluminium and Chemical Corporation|Kaiser Aluminium Company]] led to the success of Alba, the first aluminium smelting company in Bahrain. GRC then embarked on a grand smelter scheme with [[Kaiser Aluminium]] to launch a massive joint venture including oil refining and aluminium smelting in Qatar, UAE &amp; Saudi Arabia. This development set the course for the emergence of gas and oil based process industries that expanded on a global scale. GRC also owned and operated a manganese mine in Western Australia under the leadership of Simon Farrell. The group since has diversified into a wide field of operations. These include engineering, industrial management, project management, real estate development, finance and investment, representation and trading. The successful development of GRC owes much to the contributions of key individuals who served for periods as board members. These include Timothy Ready (Chairman &amp; CEO of [[Kaiser Aluminium]] and President of Primary Producers of Aluminium), Jean Ping &amp; [[Lord Hanson]].

In 1996 Sala'am and “GRC” was involved in a commercial dispute with [[Dubal|Dubal Aluminium]]. The dispute was later amicably settled out of court in 1998.

== Educational Activities ==
Sala'am supports various charitable and educational ventures. One of his most notable educational ventures was the establishment of [http://msfs.georgetown.edu/admissions/salaamcenter/ Sala'am Intercultural Resource Centre] in [[Georgetown University]], Washington DC. The Sala'am Centre was established by a grant from the Sala'am Family and dedicated by former president [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1989. The Sala'am Centre houses the [[Master of Science in Foreign Service|MSFS]] (Master of Science in Foreign Services) programme. The centre provides its students with exclusive educational tools/materials and organises high-profile seminars aimed at the promotion of a better international and cultural understanding. Sala'am has also been known to personally sponsor the University education of many deserving student.

== Honours ==
HM King [[Ja'afar of Negeri Sembilan|Ja'afar of Malaysia]] bestowed on Sala'am the prestigious title of [[Dato' Seri]] and was also awarded with the [[Congressional Medal of Honour|Congressional Medal of Honour of the Philippines]].

:''For his nephew Hugh Robert Dixson (1865–1940), also a businessman and philanthropist, see [[Hugh Denison]]''

'''Sir Hugh Dixson''' (29 January 1841 – 11 May 1926) was an [[Australia]]n business man and [[philanthropist]]. Dixson was born in [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]], [[Sydney]], the son of Hugh Dixson and his wife Helen, ''née'' Craig.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080331b.htm |title=Dixson, Sir Hugh (1841 - 1926) |accessdate=2008-09-28 |author=B. Cook |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 8 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1981 |pages=308–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was educated at the Elfred House Private School kept by [[William Timothy Cape]] at [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]]. At 14 years of age, Dixson went to work at a timber yard for Phillip McMahon.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; In 1856, he joined the [[tobacco]] business founded by his father, becoming a partner in 1864. The business grew steadily and, after his father's death in 1880, expanded rapidly under the management of Hugh Dixson and his brother [[Robert Dixson]]. It was subsequently merged in the British-Australian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited, probably the largest business of its kind in Australia at the time.

==Later life==
Dixson then retired, but with his wife, Dame Emma Elizabeth Dixson, continued his interest in the [[Baptist Church]] and in various [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] institutions. In 1900 Dame Emma founded the Sydney Medical Mission, a service run by women for women of the poorer areas of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14362590 |title=Sydney Medical Mission |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=19,560 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=20 November 1900 |accessdate=10 May 2016 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An early substantial gift was £5000 as the beginning of a fund to present a battleship to Britain. This fund was not successful and his gift was devoted to educating British boys at Australian agricultural colleges. A gift of £10,000 helped the establishment of an aged and infirm ministers' fund in the Baptist Church, and much assistance was given to the building of churches in various parts of the state. A sum of £20,000 was used to build a cancer wing at the Ryde home for incurables but the gifts of Dixson and his wife were both many and varied. Dame Dixson became the patron of the 1st Dulwich Hill Scout Group, donating the land and paying for the construction of the Scout hall.  Both worked on committees, and Dixson, at various times, served as president of the Baptist Union, of the Baptist Home Mission Society, and of the [[Young Men's Christian Association]]. Dixson was a noted [[horticulturist]], becoming a member of the [[Linnean Society of New South Wales]] in 1887, and the [[Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1898. Dixson died at [[Colombo]] on 11 May 1926. He was knighted in the [[1921 Birthday Honours]]. He married in 1866 Emma Elizabeth (died 1922) daughter of William Edward Shaw, and was survived by two sons and four daughters.

Dixson's elder son, Sir [[William Dixson]] (born 1870) made a remarkable collection of pictures, books, manuscripts, prints, maps and charts, relating to Australia, all destined to become the property of the state of New South Wales. A large collection of pictures was presented in 1929 and housed in the William Dixson gallery at the [[State Library of New South Wales|Mitchell library, Sydney]]. Dixson was knighted in 1939.

In addition to seeking to fund a battleship for Britain, Dixson supported other patriotic causes.  One such cause was the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]], a patriotic, paramilitary organisation formed in Britain in 1905 by Roger Pocock, a former Constable with the North West Mounted Police and Boer War veteran, to bolster the defensive capacity of the British Empire.

'''Implied Authority of Contract''' is a [[legal]] term. In [[Contract|contract law]], it is the implied ability of an individual to make a legally binding contract on behalf of an organization, by way of uniform or interaction with the public on behalf of that organization. When a person is wearing a uniform or nametag bearing the [[logo]] or trademark of a business or organization; or if that person is functioning in an obviously authorized capacity on behalf of a business or organization, that person carries an Implied Authority of Contract. Implied Authority is authority that is not express or written into the contract, but which the agent is assumed to have in order to transact the business of insurance for the principal. Implied authority is incidental to express authority since not every single detail of an agent's authority can be spelled out in the written contract. 

For example, if you are at a restaurant and your waitress tells you that she can give you a free beverage if you pay for an entree, she has made a contract with you on behalf of the business by which she is employed. It is '''''implied''''' that she is given the '''''authority''''' to do so by the fact that she is the sole employee of the business who has been designated to complete a transaction with you. (Whether or not other employees ultimately get involved in your transaction is irrelevant, because it is expected that ideally she is the only person required to complete your business.) 

Continuing the scenario, suppose that a manager were to come to your table and inform you that your waitress has made a mistake; that the "free beverage w/ paid entree" offer has expired and that you will be expected to pay for your beverage. At this point the business is in direct violation of a legally enforceable contract made between you, the client, and their employee.

They may penalize the employee for the mistake, but Implied Authority of Contract places them under a legal obligation to honor the terms of the agreement.

The same principle applies to more complex or extreme legal circumstances.

A design professional’s implied authority gives the designer the means to act in ways that are incidental to the exercise of actual authority. It is authority that isn’t written down, but needs to be understood to make the construction process a success.  

Besides Implied Authority, look into [[Apparent authority|Apparent Authority]] and [[Express Authority]] as well.  In relation to [[company (law)|companies]], apparent authority is usually referred to as "[[ostensible authority]]".&lt;br&gt;
-These three are known as the Agency Relationship

The '''International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations''' (or '''FIATA''',  {{lang-fr|Fédération Internationale des Associations de Transitaires et Assimilés}}) is a [[non-governmental organization]] representing 40,000 forwarding and logistics companies, employing 8 to 10 million people in 150 countries.

==History and organization==
It was founded in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], on 31 May 1926.

FIATA has consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) (''inter alia'' [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]], [[ESCAP]], [[ESCWA]]), the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), and the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] (UNCITRAL).

It is recognised as representing the [[freight forwarding|freight-forwarding]] industry by many other governmental organisations, governmental authorities, private international organisations in the field of transport such as the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC), the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA), the [[International Union of Railways]] (UIC), the [[International Road and Transport Union]] (IRU), the [[World Customs Organization]] (WCO), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), etc.

==FIATA Foundation==
Just before the World Congress 2001 in [[Cancún]], [[Quintana Roo]], [[Mexico]], and on the occasion of FIATA's 75th anniversary, the presidency of FIATA decided to mark this particular event with the creation of the FIATA Foundation Vocational Training, an institution which aims to assist associations in less-privileged countries to build up and enhance professional skill in the industry.

The management committee of the foundation coordinates the fundraising activities, evaluates the applications for funds and helps the associations on the implementation of Training projects.

==Documents==
FIATA has created several documents and forms to establish a uniform standard for use by freight forwarders worldwide. The documents are easily distinguishable as each has a distinctive colour and carries the FIATA logo which can be seen at the head of this page.

A '''[[Master's degree]] in [[Finance]]''' is a [[postgraduate degree|postgraduate program]] preparing graduates for [[career]]s in Finance. The degree is often titled '''Master of Finance''' or '''Master in Finance''' (abbreviated '''M.Fin.''', '''MiF'''), or '''Master of Science in Finance''' ('''MSF''' in North America and [[MSc]] in Finance in the UK and Europe).  In the U.S. and Canada the program may be positioned as a [[professional degree]].  Particularly in [[Australia]], the degree may be offered as a '''Master of Applied Finance''' ('''MAppFin'''). In some cases, the degree is offered as a [[Master of Management|Master of Management in Finance]] (MMF).

==Structure==
MSF and M.Fin / MSc programs differ as to intended career preparation and hence degree focus — with the former centered on [[Managerial finance|financial management]] and [[investment management]], and the latter on more technical roles&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2009-04-06/masters-of-the-financial-universebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice ''Master's of the Financial Universe''], [[businessweek.com]], April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
(although, see below for further discussion as to this distinction). Both degree types, though, emphasize [[quantitative property|quantitative]] topics, and may also offer some non-quantitative elective coursework, such as [[corporate governance]], [[business ethics]] and [[business strategy]].&lt;ref name="mbavmsf"/&gt; Programs generally require one to two years of study, and are often offered as a non-[[thesis]] degree.

The MSF program, typically, prepares graduates for careers&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/articles/2015/02/09/determine-if-a-masters-in-finance-is-the-right-move ''Determine If a Master's in Finance Is the Right Move''], [[usnews.com]], Feb. 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; in [[corporate finance]], [[investment banking]] and investment management.&lt;ref name="businessweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://carey.jhu.edu/academics/master-of-science/ms-in-finance/ Johns Hopkins - Carey's MS in Finance]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[core curriculum]] is thus focused on [[managerial finance]], corporate finance and [[investment analysis]]. These topics are generally preceded by more fundamental coursework in [[economics]], ([[managerial accounting|managerial]]) [[accounting]], and [[Business_mathematics#Postgraduate|"quantitative methods"]] (usually [[time value of money]] and [[business statistics]]). In many programs, these fundamental topics are a prerequisite for admission or assumed as known, and if part of the curriculum, students with appropriate background may be exempt from these. &lt;ref name ="Lerner"&gt;[https://lerner.udel.edu/programs/specialized-graduate-programs/finance-ms/ Delaware-Lerner] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case"/&gt; The program usually concludes with [[coursework]] in advanced topics — where several areas are integrated or applied — such as [[Investment management|portfolio management]], [[financial modeling]], [[mergers and acquisitions]] and [[real options]]; [[managerial economics]] and various [[quantitative finance]] topics may also be offered as advanced courses.

The M.Fin / MSc prepares graduates for more technical roles,&lt;ref name="businessweek"/&gt;  and thus "focuses on the theory and practice of finance" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/master-of-finance-mfin/ Cambridge's Master of Finance]&lt;/ref&gt; with a "strong emphasis on [[financial economics]] in addition to [[financial engineering]] and [[quantitative finance|computational methods]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/bcf/graduate/ Princeton's Master in Finance]&lt;/ref&gt; The MSF core topics are (often) also covered, although in (substantially) less detail. Elective work includes specific topics in [[quantitative finance]] and [[computational finance]], but also in [[corporate finance]], [[private equity]] and the like; several of the MSF advanced topics — such as real options and managerial economics — will thus also be offered, here differing as to a more technical orientation. As regards coverage of quantitative finance as compared to more specialized degrees, see below.

The MSF-M.Fin distinction is not absolute: some MSF programs, although general in coverage, are "quantitatively rigorous"&lt;ref name="PLU"&gt;[https://www.plu.edu/msf/ Pacific Lutheran University MSF]&lt;/ref&gt; or offer a "quantitative track"&lt;ref&gt;For example: [http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/schools/csom/graduate/msf/academics/msfenrollmentoptions/QuantitativeTrackCurriculum.html Boston College - Carroll's MSF]; [https://www.brandeis.edu/global/current-students/academic/msf/index.html Brandeis IBS' MSF]; [http://manderson.cba.ua.edu/academics/departments/masters_program/master_of_science_in_finance#SPECIALIZATIONS Alabama's MSF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buffalo"/&gt; (and may be [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics#Immigration policy|STEM-designated]] &lt;ref name="Buffalo"&gt;[https://mgt.buffalo.edu/degree-programs/master-of-science-ms/finance.html SUNY Buffalo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PLU"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/degrees/master-science-in-finance Carlson-Minnesota  Master of Science in Finance]&lt;/ref&gt;); while others are specifically technically oriented,&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://www.clarku.edu/gsom/graduate/msf/courses.cfm Clark University] and [http://stuart.iit.edu/programs/ms-finance IIT-Stuart]&lt;/ref&gt; or, in some cases, even offer a finance and mathematics [[dual degree]].&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;For example, [https://business.utulsa.edu/departments-schools/finance-operations-management/finance-graduate-programs/ Tulsa-Collins]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, although the "MSc in Finance" generally corresponds to the M.Fin, many schools&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://business-school.exeter.ac.uk/programmes/postgraduate/finance/ Exeter] and [http://www.essex.ac.uk/ebs/current/pgt/courses.aspx#finance Essex]&lt;/ref&gt; offer a range of MSc programs where finance may be combined with accountancy and/or management, and these then correspond to the MSF; note also that many MSc programs are further specialized, with the degree as a whole focused on, for example, [[Behavioral economics|Behavioral finance]], [[Islamic finance]] or [[Wealth management]].&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-degrees-in-finance Henley-ICMA] and [http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/courses/masters# City University London - Cass]&lt;/ref&gt; MMF programs may, similarly, offer either broad- or specialized finance coverage.&lt;ref name="MMF"&gt;For example: [https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/programs/mmf McGill]; [https://www.wits.ac.za/course-finder/postgraduate/clm/mm-finance-and-investment-management/ Witwatersrand]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The MAppFin spans the MSF-M.Fin spectrum in terms of available specializations and corresponding coursework;&lt;ref name ="Macquarie"/&gt; it differs in that it is "for and by practitioners" &lt;ref name ="Macquarie"&gt;[http://www.mafc.mq.edu.au/our-programs/master-of-applied-finance/ Master of Applied Finance]: [[Macquarie University]].&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore "blends... finance theory with industry practice",&lt;ref name=״csu״&gt;[http://www.csu.edu.au/courses/master-of-applied-finance Master of Applied Finance]: [[Charles Sturt University]].&lt;/ref&gt; as appropriate to the specialization. Similar to the MSc, programs are sometimes specifically focused on Financial Planning or Banking,&lt;ref name=״csu״/&gt; for example, as opposed to more general coverage of finance. Some universities offer both the MAppFin and the MFin, with the latter requiring additional semester-time and coursework (and exclusively offering doctoral access). These programs may also differ as to entrance requirements.&lt;ref&gt;See for example:  [[Australian National University]] [http://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/7421XMAPFN#introduction]; [[University of Western Sydney]] [http://www.uws.edu.au/future-students/postgraduate/postgraduate/postgraduate_courses/business_courses/finance/applied_finance]; [[Curtin University]], [http://business.curtin.edu.au/courses/economics_finance/postgraduate/].&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs require a [[bachelor's degree]] for admission, but many do not require that the undergraduate [[Academic major|major]] be in finance, economics, or even general business.&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mbavmsf"/&gt; The usual requirement is a sufficient level of numeracy, often including exposure to [[probability]] / [[statistics]] and [[calculus]]. The M.Fin and MSc will often require more advanced topics such as [[multivariate calculus]], [[linear algebra]] and [[differential equations]]; these may also require a greater background in Finance or Economics than the MSF.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.fordham.edu/info/20482/academic_programs Fordham's MSF and MSQF]&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs may require work experience (sometimes at the managerial level), particularly if the candidate lacks a relevant undergraduate degree.

==Comparison with other qualifications==
Although there is some overlap with an [[Master in Business Administration|M.B.A.]],&lt;ref name="usnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mbavmsf"&gt;[http://mbapodcaster.com/podcast/mbavmsf/ ''Getting an MBA vs. a Master’s in Finance or Economics''], mbapodcaster.com&lt;/ref&gt; the finance Master's provides a broader and deeper exposure to finance, but more limited exposure to [[management|general management]] topics. Thus, the program focuses on [[finance]] and [[financial market]]s, while an M.B.A., by contrast, is more diverse, covering general aspects of [[business]], such as [[human resource management]] and [[operations management]]. Note that an M.B.A. without a [[Master of Business Administration#Content|specialization]] in finance will not have covered many of the topics dealt with in the MSF (breadth), and, often even where there is specialization, those areas that are covered may be in less depth (certainly as regards the M.Fin). M.B.A. candidates will sometimes "dual major" with an M.B.A./MSF — certain universities also offer this combination as a [[dual degree|joint degree]]&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suffolk.edu/business/graduate/64785.php Suffolk-Sawyer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lazaridismba.ca/degree/mba-with-master-of-finance-toronto/ MBA with Master of Finance] [[Lazaridis School of Business and Economics|Lazaridis]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lerner"/&gt; — or later pursue an M.Fin degree to gain specialized finance knowledge;&lt;ref name="mbavmsf"/&gt; some universities offer an advanced certificate in finance appended to the MBA, allowing students to complete coursework beyond the standard finance specialization.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/student_resources/academics/certificates/  Duke-Fuqua], [http://www.business.pitt.edu/katz/mba/academics/certificates Pittsburgh-Katz] , [http://www.missouristate.edu/fgb/mba/ Missouri State].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Master of Science in Management|MSM]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://lallyschool.rpi.edu/graduate-programs/ms-management MSM - Lally, RPI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;[https://weatherhead.case.edu/degrees/masters/ms-management/finance/ Case-Weatherhead]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Master of Commerce|M.Com]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/plans/2018/FINSCS8404.html   MComm - UNSW], [http://www.commerce.uct.ac.za/FinanceAndTax/CourseInfo/MCOM%20IN%20FINANCIAL%20MANAGEMENT MCom - UCT]&lt;/ref&gt; finance (or financial management &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.up.ac.za/en/financial-management/article/2077065/postgraduate MCom in Financial Management Sciences - Pretoria]&lt;/ref&gt;) closely correspond to the MSF.  Note though, that these degrees typically place more emphasis on [[theory]] and (sometimes) less on practice.

As above, some MSF and all M.Fin programs overlap with degrees in [[financial engineering]], [[computational finance]] and [[mathematical finance]]: see [[Master of Quantitative Finance]] (MQF). Note, however, that the treatment of any common topics — usually [[financial modeling]], [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[financial risk management|risk management]] — will differ as to level of detail and approach. The MSF deals with these topics conceptually, as opposed to technically, and the overlap is therefore slight: although practical, these topics are too technical for a generalist finance degree, and the exposure will be limited to the generalist level. The M.Fin / MSc, on the other hand, cover these topics in a substantially mathematical fashion, and the treatment is often identical. The distinction here though, is that these place relatively more emphasis on financial theory than the MQF, and also allow for electives outside of quantitative finance; at the same time, the range of quantitative electives is often smaller. Entrance requirements to the MQF are significantly more mathematical than for the MSF, while for the M.Fin / MSc the requirements may be identical.

A [[Master of Financial Economics]] focuses on [[theoretical]] finance, and on developing models and theory. The overlap with the M.Fin / MSc, then, as with the MQF, is often substantial. As regards the MSF, on the other hand, although the two programs do differ in the weight assigned to theory, there is some overlap: firstly, some MSF curricula do include a formal study of [[Financial Economics]];&lt;ref&gt;For example: [http://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/business/graduate/specializedprograms/msf/program_info/curriculum.html MSF Curriculum], [[Villanova University]]; [http://www.owen.vanderbilt.edu/programs/ms-finance/curriculum.cfm Curriculum]; [[Owen Graduate School of Management|Owen GSM]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; secondly, even where the theory is not studied formally, MSF programs do cover the assumptions underpinning the models studied (at least in overview); thirdly, many financial economics programs include coverage of individual financial instruments, corporate finance and portfolio management, although this treatment is usually less practical. (As regards managerial economics, similar comments apply. The course is taught to strengthen the theoretical underpin of the degree; however, since the emphasis is application, it is not developed.)

The [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) designation is sometimes compared to a Master's in Finance.&lt;ref&gt;Recognized by UK [[NARIC]] ([http://ecctis.co.uk/naric/Newsletters/December%202009.pdf December 2009]) as comparable to [[Qualifications and Credit Framework|QCF Level 7]].&lt;/ref&gt;  
In fact, several universities&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://online.sxu.edu/programs/masters-in-finance Saint Xavier University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;[http://fisher.osu.edu/smf Specialized Masters - Finance]: [[Fisher College of Business]] - [[Ohio State]]&lt;/ref&gt;  have embedded a significant percentage of the CFA Program "Candidate Body of Knowledge" into their degree programs;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfainstitute.org/community/university/Pages/cfa_program_partners_overview.aspx CFA Program Partners Overview], cfainstitute.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the degree title may reflect this: "Master in Financial Analysis" or similar.&lt;ref&gt;For example [https://www.usfca.edu/management/graduate-programs/financial-analysis USF], [http://www.exeter.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/finance/fafm/ Exeter], [http://www.business.rutgers.edu/financial-analysis Rutgers]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In general though, the CFA program is focused on [[Investment management|Portfolio management]] and [[Investment analysis]], and provides more depth in these areas than the standard Finance Master's, whereas for [[List of finance topics|other areas of finance]] the CFA coverage is in less depth.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/db7a4838-1352-11e5-ad26-00144feabdc0.html#ft-article-comments ''The MiF can offer an edge over the CFA''] [[Financial Times]], June 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  
(Likewise, several programs have curricula aligned with the [[Financial risk management#Financial Risk Manager|FRM]] / [[professional risk manager |PRM]],&lt;ref&gt;eg: [http://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/programs/graduate/ms/ms-programs/degrees/finance Baruch-Zicklin]; [http://www.suffolk.edu/business/graduate/62683.php Suffolk-Sawyer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; or the [[Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst|CAIA]]; &lt;ref&gt;[https://smith.queensu.ca/grad_studies/mfin/the_queens_experience/index.php Queen's MFin]&lt;/ref&gt; note that the so-called "[[Indian C.F.A.]]" is, in fact, a master's degree.) 
A further distinction&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; — as regards all such designations — is that (most) Masters programs include [[Practice (learning method)|practice]] on, for example, the [[Bloomberg Terminal]], or in building advanced [[financial modeling|financial models]], while [[Training#On_job_training|"hands on" training]] of this sort will not (typically) be included in a [[Professional certification in financial services|professional certification program]].

'''Morris Herman DeGroot''' (June 8, 1931 – November 2, 1989) was an American statistician.

==Biography==
Born in [[Scranton]], [[Pennsylvania]], DeGroot graduated from [[Roosevelt University]] and earned master's and doctor's degrees from the [[University of Chicago]]. DeGroot joined [[Carnegie Mellon]] in 1957 and became a University Professor, the school's highest faculty position.

He was the founding editor of the [[review journal]] ''[[Statistical Science]]''.

==Academic works==
He wrote six books, edited four volumes and authored over one hundred papers.  Most of his research was on the theory of rational decision-making under uncertainty.  His ''Optimal Statistical Decisions'', published in 1970, is still recognized as one of the great books in the field. His courses on statistical decision theory taught at Carnegie-Mellon influenced [[Edward C. Prescott]] and [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Torsten |last=Persson |title=Economic Sciences, 1991–1995 |location= |publisher=World Scientific |year=1997 |isbn=981-02-3060-5 |pages=237–245 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hl3nkE1ZV8YC&amp;pg=PA237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; influential figures in the development of [[new classical macroeconomics]] and [[real business-cycle theory]]. DeGroot's undergraduate text, ''Probability and Statistics'', published in 1975, is widely recognized as a classic textbook.

'''Motor vehicle type approval''' is the method by which [[motor vehicle]]s, [[trailer (vehicle)|vehicle trailer]]s and systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles achieve [[Type approval]] in Europe.

==History==
This is outlined in [[Framework Directive (disambiguation)|framework directive]] [[Directive 2007/46/EC]]&lt;ref name="Framework Directive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive) Text with EEA relevance|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007L0046:EN:NOT|work=eur-lex.europa.eu - Access to European Union law|date=9 October 2007|publisher=publications.europa.eu - Publications Office of the European Union|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; rules approval schemes of the new [[motor vehicle]]s and their [[trailer (vehicle)|trailer]]s in the [[European Union]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motor Vehicle Approval Schemes |url=http://www.nsai.ie/index.cfm/area/page/information/motorvehicleapproval |work=Ireland: [[National Standards Authority of Ireland]] |publisher=NSAI.ie |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617234922/http://www.nsai.ie/index.cfm/area/page/information/motorvehicleapproval |archivedate=June 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval]] (ECWVTA), currently this applies to [[automobile|passenger cars]]. On 29 October 2012, ECWVTA was extended to cover all new road vehicles and their trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EC Whole Vehicle Type Approval - Introduction|url=http://www.vca.gov.uk/vehicletype/ecwvta-framework-directive.asp|work=UK [[Vehicle Certification Agency]], [[Department for Transport]]|publisher=VCA.gov.uk|date=24 September 2009|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) regulations.
*[[National Small Series Type Approval]] (NSSTA) - the key advantages of this scheme are that some technical requirements may be reduced in comparison with ECWVTA; however, the number of vehicles that can be manufactured are limited.
*[[Individual Vehicle Approval]] (IVA)

The [[European Commission]] shall adopt amendments to this Directive which are necessary to [[wikt:lay down|lay down]] technical requirements for small series vehicles, vehicles approved under the individual approval procedure and 'special purpose vehicles'.&lt;ref name="Framework Directive"/&gt;

[[World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations|ECE Regulation]]s to which the Community has acceded and which are listed in Part I of Annex IV and in Annex XI of the frame Directive are part of the EC type-approval of a vehicle in the same way as the separate directives or regulations. They shall apply to the categories of vehicles listed in this Annexes. When the Community has decided to apply on a compulsory basis a UNECE Regulation for the purpose of EC vehicle type-approval in accordance with Article 4(4) of [[Decision 97/836/EC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997D0836:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 31997D0836 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; the annexes to the Frame Directive shall be amended as appropriate in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 40(2) .The UNECE Regulations listed in Part II of Annex IV are recognised as being equivalent to the corresponding separate directives or regulations in as much as they share the same scope and [[:wikt:subject|subject matter]]. Where the Community has decided to applya new UNECE Regulation or a UNECE Regulation as amended, Part II of Annex IV shall be amended as appropriate.&lt;ref name="Framework Directive"/&gt;

Automotive EC Directives and [[ECE Regulation]]s require third party approval - testing, [[certification]] and [[production conformity assessment]] by an [[independent body]]. Each member state is required to appoint an [[Approval Authority]] to issue the approvals, and a [[Technical Service]] to carry out the testing to the Directives and Regulations.

An approval issued by one Authority will be accepted in all the Member States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vca.gov.uk/vehicletype/type-approval-for-ca.asp|title=Type Approval for Cars|website=www.vca.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a vehicle is produced in a very small quantity (e.g. M1 maximum 75 per year), single EU Member States can grant
exception on a discretionary basis, however the validity of the Type Approval is limited to the boundaries of those Nations which concede to it.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/automotive/speeches_presentations/brussels_15052009.pdf]{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornerstones of the Type Approval process are:&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt;
*Application by the vehicle or component manufacturer
*Testing by a technical service
*[[Granting]] of the approval by an Approval Authority
*[[Conformity of Production]] by the manufacturer in agreement with the Approval Authority
*[[Certificate of Conformity]] by the manufacturer for the end-user

A particular country’s Type Approval may consist of one or more of the following forms:
*Component Type Approval ─ approval of a component that may be fitted to any vehicle (e.g., seat belts, tires, lamps)
*System Type Approval ─ approval of a set of components or a performance feature of a vehicle that can only be tested and certified in an installed condition (e.g., restraint system, brake system, lighting system)
*Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA) ─ approval of a vehicle in its entirety&lt;ref&gt;Resaffa Nogueira Martins, Henrique. Overview of Type Approval Homologation and Self Certification. DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.31708.39041
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311949142_Overview_of_Type_Approval_Homologation_and_Self-Certification&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple methods of type-approval:&lt;ref name="Framework Directive"/&gt;
*multi-stage Type Approval: a procedure whereby one or more Member States certify that, depending on the state of completion, an incomplete or completed type of vehicle satisfies the relevant administrative provisions and technical requirements of this Directive
*step-by-step Type Approval: a vehicle approval procedure consisting in the step-by-step collection of the whole set of EC type-approval certificates for the systems, components and separate technical units relating to the vehicle, and which leads, at the final stage, to the approval of the whole vehicle
**mixed Type Approval: means a step-by-step Type Approval procedure for which one or more system approvals are achieved during the final stage of the approval of the whole vehicle, without it being necessary to issue the EC Type Approval certificates for those systems
*single-step Type Approval: a procedure consisting in the approval of a vehicle as a whole by means of a single operation

EC Whole Vehicle Type Approval (also called Pan European Type Approval) is to prevent [[trade barrier]]s, and at the same time guarantee the level of safety and restricted environmental influence of a vehicle. Thanks to that, the car can be registered in each European member state without additional national tests or approval. This [[harmonisation of law|harmonisation]] results in reduced costs and lead time for the manufacturer, importer as well as the consumer. Mandatory compliance date for ECWVTA for [[Passenger car (rail)|M1 vehicle]]s was 2009-04-29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa.ie/SERVICES/upload/File/ECWVTA/implementation+dates+for+ECWVTA.pdf|title=RSA.ie - Home|website=www.rsa.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; However cars that already have an ECWVTA but are imported from non EC countries often need to be re-approved when entering the EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.containersharing.org/en/homologation|title=Homologation - International Container Shipping|website=www.containersharing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], this function is performed by the [[Vehicle Certification Agency]] (VCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vca.gov.uk|title=Vehicle Type Approval through VCA worldwide|website=www.vca.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This body has the power to issue [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) certifications.

[[File:Production Possibilities Frontier Curve.svg|thumb|250px|right|An example PPF: points B, C and D are all productively efficient, but an economy at A would not be, because D involves more production of both goods. Point X cannot be achieved.]]
[[File:Productive efficiency.svg|thumb|250px|right|Productive efficiency occurs under competitive equilibrium at the minimum of average total cost for each good, such as the one shown here.]]

'''Productive efficiency''' is a situation in which the [[economy]] could not produce any more of one good without sacrificing production of another good. In other words, productive efficiency occurs when a good or a service is produced at the lowest possible cost. The concept is illustrated on a [[production possibility frontier]] (PPF), where all points on the curve are points of productive efficiency.&lt;ref name="standish"&gt;{{Cite book |first= Barry|last=Standish | title = Economics: Principles and Practice | date =  | publisher = Pearson Education| location =South Africa  | isbn = 978-1-86891-069-4 | pages = 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equilibrium may be productively efficient without being [[allocative efficiency|allocatively efficient]]&amp;mdash; i.e. it may result in a distribution of goods where [[social welfare]] is not maximized. It is one type of [[economic efficiency]].

Productive efficiency requires that all firms operate using best-practice technological and managerial processes. By improving these processes, an [[economy]] or business can extend its [[production possibility frontier]] outward, so that efficient production yields more output than previously.

Productive inefficiency, with the economy operating below its production possibilities frontier, can occur because the productive inputs [[physical capital]] and labor are underutilized—that is, some capital or labor is left sitting idle—or because these inputs are allocated in inappropriate combinations to the different industries that use them.

In [[long-run equilibrium]] for perfectly competitive markets, productive efficiency occurs at [[perfect competition#Results|the base]] of the [[Average cost|average total cost curve]]&amp;mdash;i.e. where marginal cost equals average total cost&amp;mdash;for each good.

Due to the nature and culture of monopolistic companies, they may not be productively efficient because of [[X-inefficiency]], whereby companies operating in a monopoly have less of an incentive to maximize output due to lack of competition. However, due to economies of scale it can be possible for the profit-maximizing level of output of monopolistic companies to occur with a lower price to the consumer than perfectly competitive companies.

'''Raymond L. Ocampo, Jr.''' (born February 10, 1953)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/oc/raymund-ocampo-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a retired [[Filipino-American]] luger. He represented the Philippines at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]]. He participated at the Winter Olympics' [[Luge at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Men's singles|men's singles event]] where he ranked 35 out of 38 overall. His Winter Olympic stint was almost put in jeopardy due to some issues with the kind of passport he should be holding to represent the Philippines at the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Janofsky |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/29/sports/olympic-profile-raymond-ocampo-one-man-luge-team-with-tale-of-2-flags.html |title=OLYMPIC PROFILE: RAYMOND OCAMPO; One-Man Luge Team With Tale of 2 Flags - New York Times |location=Philippines, Republic Of The; Calgary (Alberta) |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1987-11-29 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to the New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/04/sports/luge-racer-at-center-of-controversy.html |title=Luge Racer at Center of Controversy - New York Times |location=Philippines, Republic Of The |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1988-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippine Olympic Committee]] eventually allowed him to compete under the Philippine flag without a [[Philippine passport]] despite previously requiring Ocampo the said type of passport. Ocampo previously insisted that under the rules by the [[IOC]] that he as a Filipino-American dual citizen is eligible to represent the Philippines as he did not competed for another country as a luger prior to the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Janofsky|first=Michael|title=Calgary Olympics festivities begin with the opening of villages|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19880206&amp;id=28xRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5G0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2379,1823054|accessdate=18 February 2014|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=6 February 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lift for Calgary Pinoy|newspaper=Manila Standard|date=5 February 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ocampo first competed at the [[Empire State Games|1986 Empire State Games]].

'''''Restaurant Empire II''''' is the sequel to ''[[Restaurant Empire]]''.

The game has also been ported to Mac OS X by Virtual Programming, Ltd.

==Gameplay==

The player controls the kind of cuisine the restaurant serves ([[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[French cuisine|French]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[German cuisine|German]]). Along with Munich, other cities include [[Los Angeles]], [[Paris]], and [[Rome]].

As a new feature, the player can also own various kinds of restaurants, including a [[coffeehouse|coffee shop]] and a dessert house. In the campaign mode, many new features have been added, such as organizing performance in your restaurant and changing the colors of the uniforms on your staff. Returning characters are Armand and Michel LeBoeuf, Delia Delecoeur, and Don Corleone. The campaign mode features a remade version of the campaign in the original Restaurant Empire. The game also focuses more on the managerial aspects of running a restaurant empire.

==Critical reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}

Reviews have been mixed, with praise for adding new content and keeping the game alive, but complaints about micromanagement and the recycled graphics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/articles/993/993228p1.html IGN: Restaurant Empire 2 Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Metacritic rates it as "Mixed or average reviews."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/restaurantempire2?q=restaurant%20empire%202 Metacritic: Restaurant Empire 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Alwin Schlumberger, Edler von Goldeck''' (September 12, 1814 - July 13, 1879) was an entrepreneur and the first producer of [[sparkling wine]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Sekt}}) in [[Austrian Empire|Austria]].

== Life ==
Schlumberger was born in [[Stuttgart]] in the German [[Kingdom of Württemberg]]. Upon the early death of his father, he began a commercial apprenticeship. As director of [[Ruinart (Champagne)|Ruinart]], one of the leading champagne houses in [[Reims]], France, he was experienced with the ''[[Sparkling wine production|méthode champenoise]]'' when he on an 1841 boat trip met his future wife Sophie Kirchner from [[Vienna]], the daughter of a wealthy factory owner. He had the idea to produce champagne-like wine (''Schaumwein'') in Austria using the French method but Austrian grapes.

In 1842, Schlumberger founded his company renting several vineyards in [[Bad Vöslau|Vöslau]], a small [[Lower Austria]]n town south of Vienna situated in the present-day ''[[Austrian wine|Thermenregion]]'' wine-growing area of the eastern [[Vienna Woods]]. His  alliance which Sophie Kirchner, whom he married in the following year, helped him finance his business venture. Schlumberger presented his first sparkling wine in 1846 under the name ''Vöslauer weißer Schaumwein'' (White sparkling wine of Vöslau), from 1859 under ''Vöslauer Goldeck'', the first protected wine trademark in Austria. It was produced from red [[Blauer Portugieser]] grapes growing in the Goldeck vineyards in Vöslau, which Schlumberger bought in 1843, and the sparkling wine was an immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wein-plus.eu/en/Schlumberger_3.0.2673.html Wein-Plus Glossar: Schlumberger], accessed on January 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlumberger wines were on board of the [[SMS Novara (1850)|SMS Novara]] on its around-the-world mission 1857-59. The company opened branch stores in Berlin and after the [[1862 International Exhibition]] also in London, where the wine was sold under the brand name "Vöslauer Sparkling". Robert Schlumberger also served as Vöslau mayor from 1864 to 1870. In 1878, one year before his death, he was ennobled by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] as "[[Edler]] von Goldeck". He died in Vöslau, aged 64.

== Schlumberger Sekt company ==
Robert Schlumberger's son and heir Otto received the title of a ''[[Royal Warrant of Appointment|K.u.k. Hoflieferant]]'' in 1895. The company survived the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] in 1918 and up to today, Schlumberger Wein- und Sektkellerei [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] with its seat at Vienna-[[Döbling]] is one of the leading producers of sparkling wine in [[Austria]]. In 1973, it was taken over by the German [[Underberg]] company.

* Grape Varieties:  [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] (Red), [[Merlot]] (Red), [[Cabernet Franc]] (Red)
* Specific Vineyards:  Goldeck, Hupfenberg, Oberkirchen

==Quotes==
[[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] (1832–1910) in a letter to his daughter Bergliot from [[Schwaz]] in Tyrol, 29 May 1894: {{cquote|We drank ''Vöslauer Schaumwein'', and maybe it was time place and mood that made a difference, but the best Champagne does not suit me like this one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/litteratur/bjoernson/bbaulestad.txt {{no icon}} Documentation project of the Oslo University]&lt;/ref&gt;}}Vöslauer wine is also mentioned by [[John Galsworthy]] (1867–1933) in his 1926 play ''Escape'' as well as in the 1957 volume of novellas ''Fin de siècle'' by [[Paul Morand]] (1888–1976).

[[File:Shibusawa Eiichi, 1st Viscount Shibusawa in New Yor City in 1915.jpg|thumb|Shibusawa Eiichi, 1st Viscount Shibusawa in [[New York City]] in 1915]]

{{nihongo|'''Shibusawa Eiichi''', 1st Viscount Shibusawa|渋沢 栄一|extra=March 16, 1840 &amp;ndash; November 11, 1931}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[industrialist]] widely known today as the "father of Japanese [[capitalism]]". He spearheaded the introduction of Western capitalism to Japan after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. He introduced many economic reforms including use of [[double-entry accounting]], [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock corporation]]s and modern note-issuing banks.&lt;ref name="Odagiri &amp; Goto"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Odagiri
 | first = Hiroyuki
 | title = Technology and Industrial Development in Japan
 | publisher = Oxford University Press
 | year = 1996
 | isbn = 0-19-828802-6
 | pages = 72–73
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He founded the first modern bank based on joint stock ownership in Japan. The bank was aptly named The First National Bank (''Dai Ichi Kokuritsu Ginkō'', now merged into [[Mizuho Bank]]) and had the power to issue its own notes. Through this bank, he founded hundreds of other joint stock corporations in Japan. Many of these companies still survive to this day as quoted companies in the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], which Shibusawa also founded. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry was founded by him as well. He was also involved in the foundation of many hospitals, schools, universities (including the first women's university), the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo and charitable organizations including the [[Japan Red Cross]].&lt;ref name="Odagiri &amp; Goto"/&gt;

Another notable aspect of Shibusawa's career is that, despite being the founder of hundreds of corporations, he refused to maintain a controlling stake in these corporations, effectively preventing himself from forming a ''[[zaibatsu]]''. What is known as the ''Shibusawa zaibatsu'' was a holding company to look after his estate for his family. The ''Shibusawa Zaibatsu'' did not hold any controlling stake in any companies. Despite his lowly origin as a farmer, he was granted the title of [[Kazoku|Viscount]], while all other ''zaibatsu'' founders were awarded the title of Baron. He was also awarded ''Shōnii'', Second Honour under the ''[[ritsuryō]]'' rank system, which is usually given to high-ranking nobility and prime ministers.

==Life==
Shibusawa was born on March 16, 1840 in a farmhouse in Chiaraijima (located in the present-day city of [[Fukaya, Saitama|Fukaya]] in [[Saitama Prefecture]]). As a boy, he learned reading and writing from his father. He grew up helping with the family business of dry field farming, indigo production and sale, and silk raising and later studied the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] classics and the [[history of Japan]] under Odaka Junchu, a scholar who was his cousin.

Under the influence of ''[[sonnō jōi]]'' (expel the barbarians; revere the emperor) sentiment, he formulated a plan along with cousins and friends to capture Takasaki Castle and set fires in the foreign settlement in [[Yokohama]]. Ultimately, however, this plan was canceled and he moved on to [[Kyoto]].

Shibusawa left his hometown at the age of twenty-three, and entered the service of [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu|Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu]] (then in line for the position of ''[[shōgun]]''). He distinguished himself by his work in strengthening the household finances of the Hitotsubashi family.

When he was twenty-seven years old, he visited [[France]] and other [[Europe]]an countries as a member of [[Tokugawa Akitake]]'s delegation to the [[Paris World Exposition, 1867]]. On this trip Shibusawa observed modern European societies and cultures for the first time, and realized the importance of industrial and economic development.

After returning from Europe at the news of the change of governments now known as the [[Meiji Restoration]], he established the ''Shōhō Kaishō'', one of the first [[joint-stock companies]] in Japan, in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. Afterwards, he was invited by the Meiji government to become a member of the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Ministry of Finance]], where he became a driving force in the building of a modern Japan as head of the ''Kaisei Kakari'', or office of the Ministry of Finance in charge of reform.

In 1873 Shibusawa resigned from the Ministry of Finance and became the president of the [[Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank]] (First National Bank). This was Japan's first modern bank, established under his own guidance while still employed by the Ministry of Finance. With this bank as a base, Shibusawa devoted himself to founding and encouraging businesses of all sorts.

Shibusawa was an advocate throughout his life of the idea that good ethics and business should be in harmony. The number of enterprises in which he was involved as founder or supporter is said to exceed five hundred, and includes [[Mizuho Financial Group]], [[The 77 Bank]], [[Tokio Marine &amp; Nichido Fire Insurance Co.]], [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]], [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], [[Tokyo Gas]], [[Toyobo]], [[Keihan Electric Railway]], [[Taiheiyo Cement]], [[Oji Paper Company]], [[Sapporo Breweries]], [[NYK Line]], and the [[Gyeongin Railway]] and the [[Gyeongbu Railway]] in [[Korea]]. He was president of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce. Moreover, he spearheaded many works for the betterment of society, and was an enthusiastic supporter of education, especially higher education in the field of business such as current [[Hitotsubashi University]] and current [[Tokyo Keizai University]], higher education for women, and [[private schools]]. Shibusawa involved himself in some 600 projects related to education, [[social welfare provision|social welfare]] and others.

In addition, Shibusawa made efforts to promote the exchange of goods and good will across national boundaries through private-sector diplomacy. In 1902 he visited Germany, France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence Japan|day_of_week=Tuesday |date=2 September 1902 |page_number=3 |issue=36862| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence - France|day_of_week=Thursday |date=11 September 1902 |page_number=3 |issue=36870| }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915 he was in the United States. Numerous guests from overseas visited the Shibusawa residence in Asukayama, where they talked candidly with him.

Shibusawa died at the age of ninety-one on November 11, 1931.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2211">'''Sport management''' is the field of [[business]] dealing with [[sports]] and [[recreation]]. Some examples of sport managers include the [[front office]] system in [[professional sports]], [[college sports]] managers, recreational sport managers, [[sports marketing]], [[event management]], [[facility management]], sports economics, sport finance, and sports information.

Bachelor's and master's degrees in sport management are offered by many colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://johancruyffinstitute.com/en/sport-management/|title=Sport Management Academic Programs - Johan Cruyff Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Johan Cruyff Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nassm.com/Programs/AcademicPrograms|title=Academic Programs|publisher=North American Society for Sport Management|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of classes outside sport management may be relevant to the field, including; classes in management, marketing, business administration, economics, and accounting. Internships may also open opportunities within the field.

In America, jobs in sport management include working for professional programs like the [[NFL]], [[NBA]], [[MLB]], [[NHL]], [[MLS]], and other professional or non-professional sport leagues in terms of marketing, health, and promotions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4568">'''Tere A. Zubizarreta''', (1937 – 2007) of [[Miami]], USA  worked in advertising, and was a community activist.
She died of [[cancer]] on July 26, 2007.
== Early life ==
Tere A Zubizarreta was born in [[Cuba]], and in the early 1960s emigrated to the [[United States]]. 

Herself a product of change, Tere was displaced from her country by the Castro revolution in Cuba in 1959, arriving in the U.S. just in time to experience the Civil Rights and Women’s movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Leaving behind a life and lifestyle that could never be replicated, she was undaunted by the realities of political exile, reinventing her roles as wife and mother, and embarking on a career that not only became a passion and successful business venture, but a catalyst for her future impact on the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advertisinghall.org/members/member_bio.php?memid=2757|title=Members|website=advertisinghall.org|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising career==
Zubizarreta began as a [[Cuban-American]] woman with no college degree in 1970s America. Tere’s career in advertising started at McCann/Marshalk Advertising, where she started as a secretary and worked her way thru the agency’s many departments. In 1976, she started  [[Zubi Advertising Services]]
in a rented office in [[Miami]] with one phone and a borrowed typewriter. In addition to a borrowed desk, a phone and a $465 retainer from her first client, she was armed with the vision that the Hispanic consumer segment would grow to help redefine American culture, and with a mission to help remove what she believed was the greatest barrier preventing minorities from participating in the American Dream: the blinding power of stereotypes. The agency eventually came to have over 122 employees, billings in excess of [[US$]]195 million, won many awards, and had a number of Blue Chip clients including [[American Airlines]], [[Ford Motor Company]], Lincoln Mercury, [[Winn-Dixie]], [[JP Morgan Chase]] and [[SC Johnson]]. She had an interest in and understanding of the [[Hispanic]] market

==Family==
Zubizarreta is survived by her husband Octavio, son Joe, daughter Michelle, grandchildren Charlotte and Michael, sister Annie Slatkoff, nephew Joshua Slatkoff and niece Jessica Slatkoff.

==Honors==
Zubizarreta was the first Hispanic woman to be elected to the Board of Governors and Committee Chair of the [[United Way of America]], and also served on the board of directors for the [[Orange Bowl]] Committee, Beacon Council and Miami Children’s Hospital.  She was a co-founder and former chairperson of FACE, Facts About Cuban Exiles. Zubizarreta received several awards for her contributions to the U.S. Hispanic advertising industry, the last being the Eduardo Caballero Lifetime Achievement Award - the industry’s highest - from the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies.  Other organizations that honored her include the Latin Business Association, the National Association of Hispanic Publications, the Women’s Automotive Association International and Latin Business Magazine.

==Death==
After a hard-fought battle with cancer, Tere passed away peacefully on July 26, 2007. Her legacy is rich on many levels... But it is the impact she had on family and friends, and the hundreds of employees, clients, and people whose lives she touched along the way – the ones who lovingly still refer to her as “Mama Zubi” – that serves as the most appropriate testimony to her kindness, compassion, and gift for honoring each and every individual. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advertisinghall.org/members/member_bio.php?memid=2757|title=Members|website=advertisinghall.org|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This book is notable as an inside look at a biotechnology company, and the stresses and marketing pressures on funding research into drug design. This book is a mixture of finance and technology.

'''''Trans World''''' is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] computer game for the [[Commodore 64]] published by [[Starbyte Software]] in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]].

==Summary==
The player takes control of a new [[trucking company]] and competes against up to either three other human or computer players to make the most money. The game has two modes to choose from, a continuous play mode that plays indefinitely or a [[game mode|timed mode]] that runs a select number of turns. Players control all aspects of the company from purchasing new trucks to hiring [[mechanic]]s to building new [[office]]s. Each round of the game controls one day of game time with each player taking a turn. Periodically, a random event will happen which can either help or hinder the player's company. Some events are offers to have goods delivered while others are [[sick day]]s that skip the player's turn. The game ends when a player chooses to end it or when the selected number of rounds have been completed. The winner is the player with the most money at the game's end.

{{UKtaxation}}
In the '''United Kingdom, corporation tax''' is a [[corporate tax]] levied in the United Kingdom on the [[Profit (economics)|profit]]s made by UK-resident [[Company (law)|companies]] and on the profits of entities registered overseas with [[permanent establishment]]s in the UK. 

Until 1 April 1965, companies were taxed at the same [[Taxation in the United Kingdom#Income tax|income tax rates]] as individual taxpayers, with an additional [[profits tax]] levied on companies. [[Finance Act 1965]]&lt;ref name="FA 65"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Finance+Act+1965&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1171400&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1171400&amp;filesize=108865 | title = Finance Act 1965 (c. 25), from UK Statute Law Database | accessdate =9 May 2007 | publisher = UK Statutory Publications Office, [[Ministry of Justice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced this structure for companies and associations with a single corporate tax, which took its basic structure and rules from the income tax system. Since 1997, the UK's [[Tax Law Rewrite Project]]&lt;ref name="rewrite"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rewrite/index.htm Tax Law Rewrite] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418073148/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rewrite/index.htm |date=18 April 2006 }}, [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC). Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; has been modernising the UK's tax legislation, starting with income tax, while the legislation imposing corporation tax has itself been amended, the rules governing income tax and corporation tax have thus diverged. Corporation tax was governed by the [[Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]] (as amended) prior to the rewrite project.&lt;ref name="ICTA 88"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/1][[Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]] (c. 1), [[Office of Public Sector Information]], responsible for the operation of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO), {{ISBN|0-10-540188-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most income tax rules have been rewritten in the [[Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003]], [[Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005]], and [[Income Tax Act 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally introduced as a classical tax system, in which companies were subject to tax on their profits and companies' [[shareholder]]s were also liable to income tax on the [[dividend]]s that they received, the first major amendment to corporation tax saw it move to a [[dividend imputation]] system in 1973, under which an individual receiving a dividend became entitled to an income tax credit representing the corporation tax already paid by the company paying the dividend. The classical system was reintroduced in 1999, with the abolition of [[advance corporation tax]] and of repayable dividend tax credits. Another change saw the single main rate of tax split into three. [[Tax competition]] between jurisdictions reduced the main corporate tax rate from 28% in 2008-2010 to a flat rate of 20% as of April 2015.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Corporation Tax rates and reliefs - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/corporation-tax-rates/rates|website = www.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UK government]] faced problems with its corporate tax structure, including [[European Court of Justice]] judgements that aspects of it are incompatible with EU treaties.&lt;ref name="Hoechst"/&gt; [[Tax avoidance]] schemes marketed by the financial sector have also proven an irritant, and been countered by complicated anti-avoidance legislation.

The complexity of the corporation tax system is a recognised issue.  The Labour government, supported by the Opposition parties, carried through wide-scale reform from the Tax Law Rewrite project, resulting in the [[Corporation Tax Act 2010]]. The tax has slowly been integrating [[generally accepted accounting practice]], with the corporation tax system in various specific areas based directly on the accounting treatment.

Total net corporation tax receipts were a record high of £56 billion in 2016-17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ca3e5bd2-2a7e-11e7-9ec8-168383da43b7 |title=Riddle of UK’s rising corporation tax receipts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:James Callaghan.JPG|thumb|170px|right|[[James Callaghan|Jim Callaghan]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] who introduced corporation tax in 1965.]]
Until 1965, companies were subject to income tax on their profits&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140109143644/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/corporate_tax/introduction.pdf Corporate Tax (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; at the same rates as was levied on individual taxpayers. A [[dividend imputation]] system existed, whereby the income tax paid by a company was offset against the income tax liability of a shareholder who received dividends from the company. The standard rate of income tax in 1949 was 50%.&lt;ref name="Just Taxes"&gt;{{cite book | last = Daunton | first = Martin | title = Just Taxes: The Politics of Taxation in Britain, 1914–1979|year = 2002| url = http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/14003/sample/9780521814003ws.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate =9 April 2007| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 0-521-81400-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the company paid a £100 dividend, the recipient would be treated as if he had earned £200 and had paid £100 in income tax on it – the tax paid by the company fully covered the tax due from the individual on the dividend paid. If, however, the individual was subject to tax at a higher rate (known as "surtax"), he (not the company) would be liable to pay the additional tax.

In addition to income tax, companies were also subject to a profits tax,&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; which was deducted from company profits when determining the income tax liability. It was a differential tax, with a higher tax rate on [[dividend]]s (profits distributed to shareholders) than on profits retained within the company. By penalising the distribution of profits, it was hoped companies would retain profits for investment, which was considered a priority after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="E&amp;I"/&gt; The tax did not have the desired effect, so the distributed profits tax was increased by 20%&lt;ref name="newark adv."&gt;"[http://www.newarkadvertiser.net/newtiser/history/51apr.htm 50 years ago] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150309182007/http://www.newarkadvertiser.net/newtiser/history/51apr.htm |date=9 March 2015 }}", ''Newark Advertiser''. Retrieved 8 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]] to encourage companies to retain more of their profits. At the time of [[Hugh Gaitskell]]'s 1951 budget, the profits tax was 50% for distributed profits and 10% for undistributed profits.

A series of reductions in the profits tax were brought in from 1951 onwards by the new Conservative government. The tax rates fell to 22.5% on distributed profits and 2.5% on undistributed profits by 1957, but the profits tax was no longer income tax-deductible. [[Derick Heathcoat-Amory]]'s Budget of March 1958 replaced the differential profits tax with a single profits tax measure, applicable to both retained and distributed profits. This gradual decrease, and final abolition, of taxes on capital distributions reflected ideological differences between the Conservative and Labour parties: the Conservative approach was to distribute profits to capital holders for investment elsewhere, while Labour sought to force companies to retain profits for reinvestment in the company in the hope this would benefit the company's workforce.&lt;ref name="E&amp;I"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.historyandpolicy.org/archive/policy-paper-06.html |title= Equality and incentive: fiscal politics from Gladstone to Brown |author = Daunton, Martin |date=May 2002 |publisher= History &amp; Policy |accessdate =9 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance Act 1965===
Finance Act 1965&lt;ref name="FA 65"/&gt; replaced the system of income tax and profits tax from 1 April 1965 with the Corporation Tax, which re-introduced aspects of the old system. Corporation Tax was charged at a uniform rate on all profits, but additional tax was then payable if profits were distributed as a dividend to shareholders. In effect, dividends suffered double taxation. This method of corporation tax is known as the classical system and is similar to that used in the United States. The effect of the tax was to revert to the distribution tax in operation from 1949 to 1959: dividend payments were subject to higher tax than profits retained within the company.

Finance Act 1965&lt;ref name="FA 65"/&gt; also introduced a [[capital gains tax]], at a rate of 30%, charged on the gains arising on the disposal of capital assets by individuals. While companies were exempted from capital gains tax, they were liable to corporation tax on their "chargeable gains", which were calculated in substantially the same way as capital gains for individuals. The tax applied to company shares as well as other assets. Before 1965, capital gains were not taxed, and it was advantageous for taxpayers to argue that a receipt was non-taxable "capital" rather than taxable "revenue".

===Advance Corporation Tax===
{{main article|Advance corporation tax}}
The basic structure of the tax, where company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income, remained unchanged until 1973, when a partial imputation system was introduced for dividend payments.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; Unlike the previous imputation system, the tax credit to the shareholder was less than the corporation tax paid (corporation tax was higher than the standard rate of income tax, but the imputation, or set-off, was only of standard rate tax). When companies made distributions, they also paid the advance corporation tax (known as ACT), which could be set off against the main corporation tax charge, subject to certain limits (the full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed).&lt;ref name="CTM20105"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm20105.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM20105 — ACT: set-off against CT on profits: introduction], HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals and companies who received a dividend from a UK company received a [[tax credit]] representing the ACT paid.&lt;ref name="CTM16120"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm16120.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM16120 — Distributions: impact on CT: franked investment income: general], HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals could set off the tax credit against their income tax liability.&lt;ref name="CTM15150"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM15150.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM15150 — Distributions: general: tax consequences], HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On introduction, ACT was set at 30% of the gross dividend (the actual amount paid plus the tax credit). If a company made a £70 dividend payment to an individual, the company would pay £30 of advance corporation tax. The shareholder would receive the £70 cash payment, plus a tax credit of £30; thus, the individual would be deemed to have earned £100, and to have already paid tax of £30 on it. The ACT paid by the company would be deductible against its final "mainstream" corporation tax bill. To the extent that the individual's tax on the dividend was less than the tax credit – for example, if his income was too low to pay tax (below £595 in 1973–1974&lt;ref name="Personal allowances"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/tax_structure/incometax_pa-and-reliefs_1974to1990.pdf Income Tax Personal Allowances and Reliefs 1973–74 to 1989–90 (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206074009/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/tax_structure/incometax_pa-and-reliefs_1974to1990.pdf |date=6 February 2007 }}, HMRC. Retrieved 9 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) – he would be able to reclaim some or all of the £30 tax paid by the company. The set-off was only partial, since the company would pay 52% tax (small companies had lower rates, but still higher than the ACT rate),&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; and thus the £70 received by the individual actually represented pre-tax profits of £145.83. Accordingly, only part of the double taxation was relieved.

ACT was not payable on dividends from one UK company to another (unless the payor company elected to pay it).&lt;ref name="CTM20070"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM20070.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM20070 — ACT: general: qualifying and non-qualifying distributions], HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the recipient company was not taxed on that dividend receipt, except for dealers in shares and [[life assurance]] companies in respect of some of their profits.&lt;ref name="CTM20070"/&gt; As the payor company would have suffered tax on the payments it made, the company that received the dividend also received a credit that it could use to reduce the amount of ACT it itself paid, or, in certain cases, apply to have the tax credit repaid to them.&lt;ref name="CTM16120"/&gt;
[[File:Gordon Brown Photo.jpg|thumb|[[Gordon Brown]], the Chancellor of the Exchequer who abolished ACT and introduced the quarterly instalment regime in 1999.]]

The level of ACT was linked to the basic rate of income tax between 1973 and 1993. The March 1993 Budget of [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]] cut the ACT rate and tax credit to 22.5% from April 1993, and 20% from April 1994.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; These changes were accompanied with a cut of income tax on dividends to 20%, while the basic rate of income tax remained at 25%. Persons liable for tax were lightly affected by the change, because income tax liability was still balanced by the tax credit received, although higher rate tax payers paid an additional 25% tax on the amount of the dividend actually received (net), as against 20% before the change.

The change had bigger effects on pensions and non-taxpayers. A pension fund receiving a £1.2&amp;nbsp;m dividend income prior to the change would have been able to reclaim £400,000 in tax, giving a total income of £1.6&amp;nbsp;m. After the change, only £300,000 was reclaimable, reducing income to £1.5&amp;nbsp;m, a fall of 6.25%.

[[Gordon Brown]]'s summer Budget of 1997&lt;ref name="Budget 1997"&gt;[http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/budget/1997/report/budget97.htm Budget 1997] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320164122/http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/budget/1997/report/budget97.htm |date=20 March 2007 }}, HM Treasury. Retrieved 25 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ended the ability of pension funds and other tax-exempt companies to reclaim tax credits with immediate effect, and for individuals from April 1999.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; This tax change has been blamed for the poor state of British pension provision, while usually ignoring the more significant effect of the dot-com shareprice crash of 2000 onwards when the FTSE-100 lost half its value to fall from 6930 at the beginning of 2000 to just 3490 by March 2003. Despite this, critics such as [[Member of Parliament]] [[Frank Field (UK politician)|Frank Field]] described it as a "hammer blow" and the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' described it as a swindle,&lt;ref name="Pension Swindle"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Field | first = Frank | title = The great pension swindle | publisher = Sunday Times | date = 1 April 2007 | url = http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Features/Focus/article62480.ece | accessdate =9 May 2007}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the hypothetical £1.5&amp;nbsp;m income described above falling to £1.2&amp;nbsp;m, a fall in income of 20%, because no tax would be reclaimable.

====Abolition of Advance Corporation Tax====
From 6 April 1999 ACT was abolished,&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; and the tax credit on dividends was reduced to 10%.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; There was a matching reduction in the basic income tax rate on dividends to 10%, while a new higher-rate of 32.5% was introduced which led to an overall effective 25% tax rate for higher rate taxpayers on dividends (after setting this "notional" tax credit against the tax liability).While non-taxpayers were no longer able to claim this amount from the treasury (as opposed to taxpayers who could deduct it from their tax bill), the 20% ACT (which would have previously been deducted from the dividend before payment) was no longer levied.

The abolition of ACT was actually one of the biggest tax grabs ever by a Chancellor, as pension companies could no longer recover the tax paid on dividends (along with pensioners and other reliant on the income).  This now costs over £10bn a year and was one of the factors that lead to the death of the final salary pension scheme. (ref:https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/10798785/True-cost-of-Labours-pension-tax-raid-and-others-since-Seventies.html).  It is one of the biggest tax grabs ever, sold as 'the abolition of a tax'.

ACT that had been incurred prior to 1999 could still be set off against a company's tax liability, provided it would have been able to set it off under the old imputation system.&lt;ref name="CTM18250"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM18250.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM18250 — Shadow ACT: outline of the scheme], HMRC. Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In order to keep the stream of payments associated with advance corporation tax payment, 'large' companies (comprising the majority of corporation tax receipts) were subjected to a quarterly instalments scheme for tax payment.&lt;ref name="CTM92505"/&gt;

===Rates===
On its introduction in 1965, corporation tax was charged at 40%, rising to 45% in the 1969 [[Budget]]. The rate then fell to 42.5% in the second Budget of 1970 and 40% in 1971. In 1973, alongside the introduction of [[advance corporation tax]] (ACT), Conservative chancellor [[Anthony Barber]] created a main rate of 52%, together with a smaller companies' rate of 42%.&lt;ref name="Rates"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/corporate_tax/rates-of-tax.pdf Rates of Corporation Tax (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609150401/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/corporate_tax/rates-of-tax.pdf |date=9 June 2007 }}, HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This apparent increase was negated by the fact that under the ACT scheme, dividends were no longer subject to income tax.

The 1979 Conservative Budget of [[Geoffrey Howe]] cut the small companies' rate to 40%, followed by a further cut in the 1982 Budget to 38%.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; The Budgets of 1983–1988 saw sharp cuts in both main and small companies' rates, falling to 35% and 25% respectively.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; Budgets between 1988 and 2001 brought further falls to a 30% main rate and 19% small companies' rates.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; From April 1983 to March 1997 the small companies' rate was pegged to the basic rate of [[income tax]].&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; During the 1980s there was briefly a higher rate of tax imposed for capital profits.

Chancellor [[Gordon Brown]]'s 1999 Budget&lt;ref name="Budget 1999"&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_99/bud_bud99_index.cfm Budget 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606203629/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_99/bud_bud99_index.cfm |date=6 June 2007 }}, HM Treasury.

===Taxable profits and accounting profits===
The starting point for computing taxable profits is profits before tax (except for a [[life assurance]] company). The rules for calculating corporation tax generally ran in parallel with income tax until 1993, when the first statutory rule to move profit reporting into line with [[generally accepted accounting practice]] was introduced, although the courts were already moving towards requiring trading profits to be computed using general [[accountancy]] rules.&lt;ref name="CTM01130"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM01130.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM01130 — Corporation Tax: introduction: computation of profits], HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Finance Act 1993&lt;ref name="FA 93"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/acts/ukpga/1993/34 Finance Act 1993 (c. 34)]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-543493-0}} Retrieved on 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; introduced rules to make tax on exchange gains and losses mimic their treatment in a company's [[financial statements]] in most instances. Finance Act 1994&lt;ref name="FA 94"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/9 Finance Act 1994], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-540994-4}} Retrieved on 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; saw similar rules for financial instruments, and in Finance Act 1996&lt;ref name="FA 96"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/8 Finance Act 1996], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-540896-4}} Retrieved on 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the treatment of most loan relationships was also brought into line with the accounting treatment.

A year later, Finance Act 1998&lt;ref name="FA 98"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/36 Finance Act 1998], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-543698-4}} Retrieved on 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; went even further, making it clear that taxable trading profits (apart from those accruing to a [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd's]] corporate name&lt;ref name="CTM40750"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM40750.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM40750 — Particular bodies: Lloyd's underwriting agents], HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; or to a [[life assurance]] company) and profits from a rental business are equal to profits calculated under [[UK generally accepted accounting principles|generally accepted accounting practice]] ("GAAP") unless there is a specific statutory or case law rule to the contrary. This was followed up by Finance Act 2004,&lt;ref name="FA 2004"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/12 Finance Act 2004], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-541204-X}} Retrieved on 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which provided that where a company with investment business could make deductions for management expenses, they were calculated by reference to figures in the [[financial statements]].&lt;ref name="CTM08005"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM08005.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM08005 — Corporation Tax: management expenses: introduction], HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====International Financial Reporting Standards====
From 2005, all [[European Union]] [[listed company|listed companies]] have to prepare their financial statements using the "[[International Financial Reporting Standards]]" ("IFRS"), as modified by the EU.&lt;ref name="IAS"&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/financial_services_general_framework/l26040_en.htm International accounting standards (IAS)], www.europa.eu. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other UK companies may choose to adopt IFRS. Corporation tax law is changing so that, in the future, IFRS accounting profits are largely respected. The exception is for certain financial instruments and certain other measures to prevent tax [[arbitrage]] between companies applying IFRS and companies applying UK GAAP.

===Avoidance===
[[Tax avoidance]] is the legitimate reduction of tax through tax planning and/or usage of legal provisions. Unlike most other countries, most UK tax professionals are accountants rather than lawyers by training.

Until 2013, the UK had no [[tax avoidance|general anti-avoidance rule]] ("GAAR") for corporation tax. However, it inherited an anti-avoidance rule from income tax relating to transactions in securities,&lt;ref name="CTM36805"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM36805.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM36805 — Particular topics: transactions in securities: tax advantage from: introduction], HMRC. Retrieved 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and since then has had various "mini-GAARs" added to it. The best known "mini-GAAR" prevents a deduction for interest paid when the loan to which it relates is made for an "unallowable purpose".&lt;ref name="CTM56705"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM56705.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM56705 — Loan relationships: miscellaneous: for unallowable purposes: general] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111113054/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM56705.htm |date=11 January 2007 }}, HMRC. Retrieved 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the government introduced a General Anti-Avoidance Rule to manage the risk of tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-avoidance-general-anti-abuse-rules |title=Tax avoidance: General Anti-Abuse Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finance Act 2004&lt;ref name="FA 2004"/&gt; introduced disclosure rules requiring promoters of certain tax avoidance schemes that are financing- or employment-related to disclose the scheme. Taxpayers who use these schemes must also disclose their use when they submit their tax returns.&lt;ref name="Tax Avoid"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/aiu/index.htm Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes], HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first provision of its kind in the UK, and Finance Act 2005&lt;ref name="FA 2005"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/7.htm Finance Act 2005]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-540805-0}} Retrieved on 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; has shown a number of tax avoidance schemes being blocked earlier than would have been expected prior to the disclosure rules.

===Need for greater revenues===
In the early twenty-first century the government sought to raise more revenues from corporation tax. In 2002 it introduced a separate 10% supplementary charge on profits from oil and gas extraction businesses,&lt;ref name="OT00190"/&gt; and Finance Act 2005&lt;ref name="FA 2005"/&gt; contained measures to accelerate when oil and gas extraction business have to pay tax. Instead of paying their tax in four equal instalments in the seventh, tenth, thirteenth and sixteenth month after the accounting period starts, they will be required to consolidate their third and fourth payments and pay them in the thirteenth month, creating a [[cash flow]] advantage for the government.Finance (No.2) Act 2005&lt;ref name="FA (No2) 2005"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/22 Finance (No.2) Act 2005], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-542205-3}} Retrieved on 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; continued measures specifically relating to [[life assurance]] companies. When originally announced (as Finance (No.3) Bill 2005) [[Legal &amp; General]] told the Stock Exchange that £300&amp;nbsp;m had been wiped off its value, and Aviva (Norwich Union) announced that the tax changes would cost its policy holders £150&amp;nbsp;m.

==Method of charge==
Powers to collect corporation tax must be passed annually by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]], otherwise there is no authority to collect it. The charge for the [[Fiscal year|financial year]] (beginning 1 April each year) is imposed by successive finance acts. The tax is charged in respect of the company's [[accounting period]], which is normally the 12-month period for which the company prepares its [[financial statements|accounts]].&lt;ref name="CTM01105"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM01105.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM01105 — Corporation Tax: introduction: basis of charge to CT], HMRC. Retrieved 14 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Corporation tax is administered by [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC).

===Assessment===
Corporation tax is levied on the net profits of a company.&lt;ref name="CTM01105"/&gt; Except for certain [[life assurance]] companies,&lt;ref name="CTM40325"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM40325.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM40325 — Particular bodies: friendly societies: exemption for life or endowment business], HMRC. Retrieved 14 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; it is borne by the company as a [[direct tax]].

Up until 1999 no corporation tax was due unless HMRC raised an assessment on a company. Companies were, however, obliged to report certain details to HMRC so that the right amount could be assessed. This changed for accounting periods ending on or after 1 July 1999, when self-assessment was introduced.&lt;ref name="FA 98"/&gt; Self-assessment means that companies are required to assess themselves ''and take full responsibility for that assessment''. If the self-assessment is wrong through negligence or recklessness, the company can be liable to penalties.&lt;ref name="CTM93260"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM93260.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM93260 — CTSA: the filing obligation: unsatisfactory return], HMRC. Retrieved 14 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The self-assessment tax return needs to be delivered to HMRC 12 months after the end of the period of account in which the accounting period falls&lt;ref name="CTM93030"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM93030.htm Corporation Tax Manual CTM93030 — CTSA: the filing obligation: filing date: definition], HMRC. Retrieved 14 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (although the tax must be paid before this date). If a company fails to submit a return by then, it is liable to penalties.&lt;ref name="CTM93260"/&gt; HMRC may then issue a determination of the tax payable,&lt;ref name="CTM95305"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM95305.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM95305 — CTSA: Revenue determination: power to make], HMRC. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which cannot be appealed – however, in practice they wait until a further six months have elapsed. Also, the most common claims and elections that may be made by a company have to be part of its tax return, with a time limit of two years after the end of the accounting period.&lt;ref name="CTM90602"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM90602.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM90602 — CTSA: claims and elections: introduction], HMRC. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a company submitting its return more than one year late suffers not only from the late filing penalties, but also from the inability to make these claims and elections.

From 2004 there has been a requirement for new companies to notify HM Revenue &amp; Customs of their [[Company Formation|formation]], although HMRC receives notifications of new company registrations from [[Companies House]].&lt;ref name="FA 2004"/&gt; Companies will then receive an annual notice CT603, approximately 1–2 months after the end of the company's financial period, notifying it to complete an annual return. This must also include the company's annual accounts, and possibly other documents, such as [[auditor]]s' reports, that are required for certain companies.&lt;ref name="CTM93090"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM93090.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM93090 — CTSA: the filing obligation: delivery of return: content], HMRC. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schedular system===
{{Main|Schedular system of taxation}}

In the United Kingdom the ''source rule'' applies. This means that something is taxed only if there is a specific provision bringing it within the charge to tax. Accordingly, profits are only charged to corporation tax if they fall within one of the following, and are not otherwise exempted by an explicit provision of the Taxes Acts:&lt;ref name="CTM01105"/&gt;

Notes:

#In practice companies do not get taxed under Schedule F. Most companies are exempted from Schedule F and there is a provision for those companies which are taxed on UK dividends (i.e. dealers in shares ([[stock]])) that removes the charge from Schedule F to Schedule D.

Notes:
#Cases II and IV only apply to income tax and not corporation tax.

Strictly speaking, Corporation Tax Act 2010 replaces the historic terminology "Schedule A", "Schedule D Case I" etc. with more descriptive terms but this does not affect the substantive application of the schedular system so that, for example, different rules apply for utilising tax losses depending upon the nature of the income under which the losses arises.

====Relief for expenses====
Most direct expenses are deductible when calculating taxable income and chargeable gains. Notable exceptions include any costs of entertaining clients. Companies with investment business may deduct certain indirect expenses known as "expenses of management" when calculating their taxable profits. A similar relief is available for expenses of a [[life assurance]] company taxed on the [[I minus E basis]] which relate to the company's [[basic life assurance and general annuity business]].&lt;ref name="CTM08005"/&gt; Donations made to charities are also normally deducted in calculating taxable income if made under [[Gift Aid]].&lt;ref name="CTM09060"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM09060.htm Corporate Taxation Manual CTM09060 — Corporation Tax: charges on income: Gift Aid], HMRC.

The rate of corporation tax is determined by the financial year,&lt;ref name="CTM010405"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM01405.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM01405 — Corporation Tax: accounting periods: apportionment], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which runs from 1 April to the following 31 March. Financial year FY17 started on 1 April 2017 and ends on 31 March 2018. Where a company's [[accounting period]] straddles a financial year in which the corporation tax rate has changed, the company's profits for that period are split.&lt;ref name="CTM010405"/&gt; For example, a company paying small companies' rate with its accounting period running from 1 January to 31 December, and making £100,000 of profit in 2007, would be deemed to have made 90/365*£100,000 = £24,657.53 in FY06 (there are 90 days between 1 January and 31 March), and 275/365*£100,000=£75,34.47 in FY07, and would pay 19% on the FY06 portion, and 20% on the FY07 portion.

From 1 April 2010 HM Revenue &amp; Customs updated their terminology and the former Small Companies' Rate is now called Small Profits Rate.&lt;ref name="rates2" /&gt;

===HM Revenue and Customs powers of enquiry===
HMRC has one year from the normal filing date, which is itself one year after the end of the [[period of account]], to open an enquiry into the return. This period is extended if the return is filed late. The enquiry continues until all issues that HMRC wish to enquire about a return are dealt with. However, a company can appeal to the Commissioners of Income Tax to close an enquiry if they feel there is undue delay.&lt;ref name="CTM90150"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM90150.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM90150 — CTSA: introduction: key features], HMRC. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

If either side disputes the amount of tax that is payable, they may appeal to either the General or Special Commissioners of Income Tax.&lt;ref name="CTM95130"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM95130.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM95130 — CTSA: assessments: appeals] which is now known as the First Tier Tax Tribunal, HMRC. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals on points of law may be made to the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]] ([[Court of Session]] in [[Scotland]]), then the [[Court of Appeals|Court of Appeal]], and finally, with leave, to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]. However, decisions of fact are binding and can only be appealed if no reasonable Commissioner could have made that decision.&lt;ref name="Tax Appeals"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/leaflets/tax-appeals.pdf Tax Appeals: A guide to appealing against decisions of the Inland Revenue on tax and other matters (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310003135/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/leaflets/tax-appeals.pdf |date=10 March 2007 }}, Department for Constitutional Affairs. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an enquiry is closed, or the time for opening an enquiry has passed, HMRC can only re-open a prior year if they become aware of an issue which they could not reasonably have known about at the time, or in instances of fraud or negligence. In fraud or negligence cases, they can re-open cases from up to 20 years ago.&lt;ref name="CTM95100"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM95100.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM95100 — CTSA: assessments: time limit], HMRC. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After an HMRC enquiry closes, or after final determination of an issue by the courts, the taxpayer has 30 days to amend their return, and make additional claims and elections, if appropriate, before the assessment becomes final and conclusive. If there is no enquiry, the assessment becomes final and conclusive once the period in which the Revenue may open an enquiry passes.

==Relief from double taxation==
There is a risk of [[double taxation]] whenever a company receives income that has already been taxed. This could be [[dividend]] income, which will have been paid out of the post-tax [[Profit (economics)|profit]]s of another company and which may have suffered [[withholding tax]]. Or it could be because the company itself has suffered foreign tax, perhaps because it conducts part of its trade through an overseas [[permanent establishment]], or because it receives other types of foreign income.

Double taxation is avoided for UK dividends by exempting them from tax for most companies: only dealers in shares suffer tax on them.&lt;ref name="CTM02060"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm02060.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM02060 — Corporation Tax: computation of income: dividends and other distributions received], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Where double taxation arises because of overseas tax suffered, relief is available either in the form of expense or credit relief.&lt;ref name="IM151040"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/intm151040.htm International Manual INTM151040 — Double taxation: concept and principles], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Expense relief allows the overseas tax to be treated as a deductible expense in the tax computation. Credit relief is given as a deduction from the UK tax liability, but is restricted to the amount of UK tax suffered on the foreign income. There is a system of onshore pooling, so that overseas tax suffered in high tax territories may be set off against taxable income arising from low tax territories. From 1 July 2009, new rules were introduced to exempt most non-UK dividends from corporation tax so these double taxation rules in respect of non-UK dividends will be of less common application in practice after that date.

==Loss relief==
Detailed and separate rules apply to how all the different types of losses may be set off within the computations of a company.&lt;ref name="CTM04050"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM04050.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM04050 — Corporation Tax: trading losses: general: reliefs available] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207005612/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM04050.htm |date=7 February 2007 }}, HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed explanation of these can be found in: ''[[United Kingdom corporation tax loss relief]]''.

===Group relief===
The UK does not permit [[tax consolidation]], where companies in a group are treated as though they are a single entity for tax purposes. One of the main benefits of tax consolidation is that tax losses in one entity in a group are automatically relievable against the tax profits of another. Instead, the UK permits a form of loss relief called "group relief".&lt;ref name="CTM80105"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM80105.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM80105 — Groups: group relief: outline], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a company has losses arising in an accounting period (other than capital losses, or losses arising under Case V or VI of Schedule D) in excess of its other taxable profits for the period, it may surrender these losses to a group member with sufficient taxable profits in the same accounting period.&lt;ref name="CTM80110"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM80110.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM80110 — Groups: group relief: reliefs which may be claimed], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The company receiving the losses may offset them against their own taxable profits. Exceptions include that a company in the oil and gas extraction industry may not accept group relief against the profits arising on its [[oil drilling|oil and gas extraction business]],&lt;ref name="OT00190"/&gt; and a life assurance company may only accept group relief against its profits chargeable to tax at the standard shareholder rate applicable to that company.&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; Separate rules apply for dual resident companies.

Full group relief is permitted between companies subject to UK corporation tax that are in the same 75% group, where companies have a common ultimate parent, and at least 75% of the shares in each company (other than the ultimate parent) are owned by other companies in the group. The companies making up a 75% group do not all need to be UK-resident or subject to UK corporation tax relief. An [[open-ended investment company]] cannot form part of a group.&lt;ref name="CTM80155"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM80155.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM80155 — Groups: group relief: qualifying tests]. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Consortium relief is permitted where a company subject to UK corporation tax is owned by a [[consortium]] of companies that each own at least 5% of the shares and together own at least 75% of the shares. A consortium company can only surrender or accept losses in proportion to how much of that company is owned by each consortium group.&lt;ref name="CTM80530"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM80530.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM80530 — Consortia: group relief: meaning of consortium members and consortium company], HMRC.

Notes:
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; UK trading losses brought forward from previous accounting periods must be relieved as fully as possible against any trading profits in the current accounting period. They cannot be relieved against non-trading profits.
* ² Brought forward [[non-trading debit]]s can be utilised against non-trading profits; they cannot reduce the trading profits
* ³ The management expense deduction is in relation to expenses incurred on managing the company's investments.
* &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The marginal relief computation is as follows:
:Marginal relief fraction × (Upper limit ÷ (Number of associates + 1) – Profit)
:= 1/40 × (1,500,000 ÷ (1+1) – 580,000)
* &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; The £30,000 overseas tax has been included in the taxable Schedule D Case V figure. Double tax relief is available on the lower of overseas tax suffered and UK corporation tax suffered on the overseas income.

==Interaction with European law==
Although there are no [[European Union]] [[European Union directive|directives]] dealing with direct taxes, UK laws must comply with European legislation. In particular, legislation should not be discriminatory under the EC treaty.

A number of cases where UK tax laws are believed to be discriminatory have been brought to the [[European Court of Justice]], usually with respect to freedom of establishment and freedom of movement of capital. Key cases which have been decided include:

However, in the final judgment, a compromise agreement was reached in which the national interest to prevent excessive loss of tax was held to outweigh in most circumstances the restriction on the freedom of movement of capital.

There are also a number of other cases making their way, slowly, up to the European Court. In particular:

*A [[Group Litigation Order]] arguing that dividends received from overseas companies should be exempt from tax in the same way as dividends received from UK companies are exempted from tax;&lt;ref name="GLO"&gt;[http://hamiltonbradbury.co.uk/umbrella-company/tax/group-litigation-order/ Hoechst Group Litigation Order (PDF)], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*Claims that the UK CFC legislation is contrary to EU law (notably Vodafone).

==Recent developments==

===Corporation tax reform===
There have been a number of proposals for corporation tax reform, although only a few have been enacted. In March 2001, the government published a technical note ''A Review of Small Business Taxation'', which considered simplification of corporation tax for small companies through the closer alignment of their profits for tax purposes with those reported in their accounts.&lt;ref name="Review SBT"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/sbtn.pdf A Review of Small Business Taxation (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609214908/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/sbtn.pdf |date=9 June 2007 }}, HMRC. Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In July of that year, the government also published a consultation document, ''Large Business Taxation: the Government's strategy and corporate tax reforms''. It set out the strategy for modernising corporate taxes and proposals for relief for [[capital gain]]s on substantial shareholdings held by companies.

In August 2002, ''Reform of corporation tax – A consultation document'' was published, outlining initial proposals for the abolition of the Schedular system.&lt;ref name="Refrom CT"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/taxreform_final.pdf Reform of corporation tax — A consultation document (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206123957/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/taxreform_final.pdf |date=6 February 2007 }}, HMRC, 2002. Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up in August 2003 by ''Corporation tax reform – A consultation document'', which further discussed the possible abolition of the Schedular system, and also whether the capital allowances (tax depreciation) system should be abolished.&lt;ref name="CT reform"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/corp-tax-reform.pdf Corporation tax reform — A consultation document (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412163948/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/corp-tax-reform.pdf |date=12 April 2007 }}, HMRC, 2003. Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It also made proposals that were ultimately enacted in Finance Act 2004.&lt;ref name="FA 2004"/&gt; (The first two of these listed below were in response to threats to the UK tax base arising from recent [[European Court of Justice]] judgments.) The changes were to:
*Introduction of transfer pricing rules for UK-to-UK transactions. Transfer pricing rules require certain transactions to be deemed to have taken place at arm's length prices for tax purposes where they did not in fact take place as such.
*Merging thin capitalisation rules with the [[transfer pricing]] rules. [[Thin capitalisation]] rules limit the amount a company can claim as a tax deduction on interest when it receives loans at non-commercial rates (from connected parties, for example).
*Extension of the deduction for management expenses to all companies with an investment business. Previously a company had to be wholly or mainly engaged in an investment business to qualify.

In December 2004, ''Corporation tax reform – a technical note'' was published. It outlined the government's decision to abolish the schedular system, replacing the numerous schedules and cases with two pools: a trading and letting pool; and an "everything else" pool. The Government had decided that capital allowances would remain, though there would be some reforms, mostly affecting the leasing industry.&lt;ref name="CT reform tech"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2004/sup_ct-reform-tech-note.pdf Corporation tax reform — a technical note (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221175440/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2004/sup_ct-reform-tech-note.pdf |date=21 February 2007 }}, HMRC, 2004. Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other enactments===
Other main reforms enacted, include:

*Relief from tax on chargeable gains on disposals of substantial shareholdings in trading companies and groups (enacted by Finance Act 2002).&lt;ref name="FA 2002"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/23 Finance Act 2002], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-542302-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Introduction of UK to UK transfer pricing rules, coupled with the merging of the thin capitalisation rules with the transfer pricing rules (enacted by Finance Act 2004).&lt;ref name="FA 2004"/&gt;
*Extension of management expenses rules so that companies do not need to be investment companies to receive them, coupled with a specific rule preventing capital items being deductible as management expenses (enacted by Finance Act 2004).&lt;ref name="FA 2004"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">The '''United States Oil &amp; Gas Association''', formerly the '''Mid-Continent Oil &amp; Gas Association,''' is a [[trade association]] which [[petroleum lobbying|promotes]] the well-being of the [[oil and gas industry|oil and natural gas industries]] in the [[United States]]. Primarily, the organization focuses on the production of these resources. Other organizations exist to deal with concerns of transportation, refining and processing, and other discrete functions of the fossil fuel industry.

==Early history==
The predecessor organization, '''Mid-Continent Oil &amp; Gas Association,''' was founded on October 13, 1917, after the entry of the United States into [[World War I]], in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]], which called itself "The Oil Capital of the World".&lt;ref name=texas/&gt;&lt;ref name=okla/&gt; At its creation, the association worked to provide [[petroleum]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces. In the decades since its establishment, the association is recognized as a leading advocate for producers of domestic oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usoga.org/en/about_us/history/|title=A Brief History|publisher=usoga.org|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State-level affiliates==
Beginning in 1919, local divisions of the association were created in several states.&lt;ref name=texas/&gt;The Oklahoma-[[Kansas]] Division was established that year under the leadership of [[Frank Phillips (oil industrialist)|Frank Phillips]], a founder of [[Phillips Petroleum Company]], as well as oil company entrepreneurs [[William Skelly|William G. Skelly]] of Tulsa and [[H. H. Champlin]] of [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]], Oklahoma. [[E. W. Marland]], whose company became [[Conoco|Conoco, Inc.]], was later the [[governor of Oklahoma]] from 1935-1939. [[Alfred M. Landon]], later the [[governor of Kansas]] from 1935-1939 and the [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[U.S. president|presidential]] [[Candidate|nominee]], was also instrumental in the establishment of the Oklahoma-Kansas division.&lt;ref name=okla&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okmoga.com/html/history.php|title=Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association of Oklahoma|publisher=okmoga.com|accessdate=May 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228040415/http://www.okmoga.com/html/history.php|archive-date=February 28, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of June 2018, Bloomberg, LP, lists Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association of Oklahoma, Inc. located at 6701 North Broadway, Suite 300 Oklahoma City, OK 73116, and states that its business is to, "... support legislation for the energy industry at the Oklahoma State Capitol and to provide education programs and seminars.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0374169Z:US-mid-continent-oil-&amp;-gas-association-of-oklahoma-inc Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association of Oklahoma, Inc.-Private Company." Bloomberg LP.] Accessed June 21, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;


The Louisiana Oil and Gas Association was founded in 1923, with emphasis in Louisiana and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]. Headed by its president, former [[U.S. Representative]] [[Chris John]] of [[Louisiana's 7th congressional district]], since disbanded, LMOGA represents companies involved in exploration and production, refining, transportation, and marketing as well as other firms in the fields of engineering, environment, finance, law, and government relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/louisiana-mid-continent-oil-and-gas-association|title=Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association|publisher=linkedin.com|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Texas association was also established in 1923 and renamed the Texas Oil &amp; Gas Association in 1997.&lt;ref name=texas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/01371/cah-01371.html|title= Guide to the Texas Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association Records, 1965-1968, 1970-1971, 1975-1977, 1979|publisher=lib.utexas.edu|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996-2000 he was an economic adviser to the Chairman of the Federation Council of the RF Federal Assembly.

In 1997, Viatcheslav Kantor was named Honorary Citizen of Veliky Novgorod for his major contribution to development and strengthening of economy, science and cultural heritage of the old city of Novgorod, and improvement of social and living conditions for its residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adm.nov.ru/adm/pg_detail.xhtml?uid=D1F3C9AEE6B4FEB6C3256A8400257A9A |title=Honorary Citizens of Veliky Novgorod at the City Administration website - Viatcheslav Kantor - 08.09.1953 |access-date=2017-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410214425/http://www.adm.nov.ru/adm/pg_detail.xhtml?uid=D1F3C9AEE6B4FEB6C3256A8400257A9A |archive-date=2017-04-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000 Kantor has served as President of the National Institute of Corporate Reform (NICR), a non-profit organization uniting top political leaders, business leaders and scholars. The NICR focuses on improving the investment climate in Russia and enhancing the global image of Russian companies.

===Family===
Kantor is married to Anna Kantor and has four sons and a daughter.

==Career==
Kantor, who is president of the [[European Jewish Congress]] (EJC), is well known worldwide for his fight against anti-Semitism, promotion of reconciliation of peoples, and has greatly contributed to revitalizing Jewish life in Europe and beyond. He serves as the President of the [[European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation]] (ECTR) and is known for his extensive involvement in the promotion of [[Toleration|tolerance]] in the modern world. He is also president of the [[International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe]] and is engaged in discussing and elaborating ways to stop nuclear proliferation and prevent nuclear catastrophe.&lt;ref name=his-bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor - biography|url=http://www.moshekantor.com/en/bio/|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kantor is associated with and serves on the boards of many communal and [[civic organizations]] and has made significant contributions to the development of essential European concepts including Model National Statute for the Promotion of Tolerance and “Secure Tolerance,”&lt;ref&gt;[http://securetolerance.com/  'Manifesto on Secure Tolerance', by Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor]&lt;/ref&gt; whereby tolerance as an objective can only be assured with personal security for the individual and the repression of intolerance as a society. This can be best achieved through early education, model legislation and enforcement. To promote this concept, Kantor has initiated the establishment of a European academic center dedicated to researching and studying tolerance.&lt;ref name=his-bio/&gt;

Kantor’s work promoting tolerance and reconciliation of peoples and nations, [[human rights]] and interfaith dialogue, and his struggle against [[anti-Semitism]] and racism earned him numerous awards in recent years from European heads of state, including the Italian [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Knight’s Grand Cross of the Order of Merit]] (2013), the highest decoration given to a non-Italian and France’s [[Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honour]] (2014).

According to Kantor, the purpose of MAGMA is to “to bring back to Russia all the names that have been ‘appropriated’ by other countries. For many people it would probably be a revelation to find out that many famous artists that rose to prominence in Europe and America, whose works are the envy of any museum in the world, were in fact our compatriots. At the same time, people in other countries are surprised to discover that their ‘local heroes’ happen to be Jews, and originally from Russia: Chagall, Zadkine, Lipschitz, Delaunay. The elite of the School of Paris.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.ru/stil-zhizni/hobbi/39468-formula-muzeya Forbes, January 26, 2014, “You cannot buy what you really want without paying too much”]&lt;/ref&gt;
