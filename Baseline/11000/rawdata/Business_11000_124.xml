'''Additional funds needed''' (AFN) is a [[Financial accounting|financial]] concept used when a business looks to expand its operations. Since a business that seeks to increase its sales level will require more assets to meet that goal, some provision must be made to accommodate the change in assets. To phrase it another way, the business must have some plan to actually finance the new [[assets]] that will be needed to increase sales.

==Calculation==
AFN is a way of calculating how much new [[funding]] will be required, so that the firm can realistically look at whether or not they will be able to generate the additional funding and therefore be able to achieve the higher sales level. Determining the amount of external funding needed is a key part of calculating AFN. 

A simplified version of the AFN equation is as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;code&gt;AFN = Projected increase in assets – spontaneous increase in liabilities – any increase in retained earnings&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

When calculating AFN, consideration must be given to whether the company is already operating at full capacity; if not, they can expand sales some without having to invest in new equipment.

If a negative value is found for AFN, that means that the action would generate extra [[income]] that could be invested elsewhere. 

The AFN equation is as follows: 

AFN = (A*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)ΔS – (L*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)ΔS – MS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(RR)&lt;ref&gt;Brigham, E.F., and M. Ehrhardt. 2008. ''Financial Management: Theory and Practice'', 12th ed. Thomson South-Western, Mason, OH. {{ISBN|978-0-324-42269-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:

A* = Assets tied directly to sales and will increase

L* = Spontaneous liabilities that will be affected by sales. (NOTE: Not all liabilities will be affected by sales such as long-term debt)

S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Sales during the last year

S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Total sales projected for next year (the new level of sales).

ΔS = The increase in sales between S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

M = Profit margin, or the profit per unit of sales

MS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Projected [[Net Income]]

RR = The retention ratio from Net Income and is also calculated as (1 – payout ratio)

The relevant ratios within the formula are:

(A*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;): Called the capital intensity ratio

(L*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;): Called the spontaneous liabilities ratio

'''Alberto Lim''' was a former  Philippine Secretary of Tourism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/330423/palace-accepts-lims-resignation&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, 2010, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] picked him as his Secretary of Tourism.&lt;ref name=yahoo_news_20100629&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/gma/20100629/tph-noynoy-names-cabinet-execs-senior-go-d6cd5cf.html |title=Noynoy names Cabinet execs, senior government officials |date=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729171644/http://ph.news.yahoo.com/gma/20100629/tph-noynoy-names-cabinet-execs-senior-go-d6cd5cf.html |archivedate=2010-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He, however, quit his post on August 12, 2011 due to personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2011/08/12/tourism-chief-quits-post-172546,|title=Local News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Before being appointed by [[Benigno Aquino III]] to the Tourism secretary post, Lim was the president of the [[Makati Business Club]], a group known to support Aquino even before the latter's campaign started.&lt;ref name=sunstar&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/profile-aquino-s-cabinet-members |title=Profile of Aquino’s Cabinet members |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202115852/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/profile-aquino-s-cabinet-members |archivedate=2014-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism Secretary==
He took over the helm of the Tourism Department from [[Joseph Ace Durano]]. Early speculations also pointed to showbiz talk host [[Boy Abunda]] as the new head of the Department of Tourism (DOT) but Abunda declined the post.&lt;ref name=sunstar /&gt; In appointing Lim, Aquino said: Tourism is seen as one of the key venues for increasing jobs in the country. We need someone who has proven competence in this field".&lt;ref name=sunstar /&gt;

After [[2010 Manila hostage crisis]] ended in blood, Lim was appointed with Soliman by the president "to provide everything necessary for the recovery and return home of the survivors".&lt;ref name=president_statement&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gov.ph/2010/08/24/statement-of-president-aquino-on-the-august-23-2010-hostage-taking-incident-at-the-quirino-grandstand/ |title=Statement of President Aquino on the August 23, 2010 hostage-taking incident at the Quirino Grandstand |author=[[Benigno Aquino III]] |date=2010-08-23 |accessdate=2010-08-23 |publisher=President Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the first challenge faced by Lim after his appointment.

Lim was criticized for the tourism slogan ''[[Pilipinas Kay Ganda]]'' on the basis that foreigners did not understand clearly what it meant even though these people were the supposed object of the campaign message. Many notable people asked for his resignation until he finally decided to resign in August 2011.&lt;ref name=twsM33&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Anti-capitalism color— Restored.png|thumb|"[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]", a 1911 [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster]]

'''Anti-capitalism''' encompasses a wide variety of movements, ideas and attitudes that oppose [[capitalism]]. Anti-capitalists, in the strict sense of the word, are those who wish to replace capitalism with another type of [[economic system]].

==Socialism==
{{Main|Socialism}}

Socialism advocates public or direct worker ownership and administration of the [[means of production]] and allocation of resources, and a society characterized by equal access to resources for all individuals, with an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] method of compensation.&lt;ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"&gt;''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Socialism". Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]], one of the "founding fathers" of anti-capitalist thought]]
# A theory or policy of social organisation which aims at or advocates the ownership and democratic control of the means of production, by workers or the community as a whole, and their administration or distribution in the interests of all.
# Socialists argue for a [[Worker Cooperative|cooperative/community]] economy, or the [[commanding heights of the economy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/socialism |title=Socialism |date=2008 |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with democratic control by the people over the state, although there have been some undemocratic philosophies. "State" or "worker cooperative" ownership is in fundamental opposition to "private" ownership of [[means of production]], which is a defining feature of capitalism. Most socialists argue that capitalism unfairly concentrates power, wealth and profit, among a small segment of society that controls [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and derives its wealth through [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]].

Socialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalizations that require costly corrective regulatory measures. They also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products to be sold at a profit (such as high-pressure advertisement); thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |date=July 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Magdoff and Michael D. Yates |url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/091109magdoff-yates.php |title=What Needs To Be Done: A Socialist View |publisher=Monthly Review |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates, rather than for consumption, even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need; they argue that ''making money'', or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand.&lt;ref&gt;''Let's produce for use, not profit''. Retrieved August 7, 2010, from worldsocialism.org: {{cite web|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |archivedate=2010-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private ownership imposes constraints on planning, leading to inaccessible economic decisions that result in immoral production, unemployment and a tremendous waste of material resources during crisis of [[overproduction]]. According to socialists, private property in the means of production becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralized, socialized institutions based on private appropriation of revenue (but based on cooperative work and internal planning in allocation of inputs) until the role of the capitalist becomes redundant.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Fredrich. ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific''. Retrieved October 30, 2010, from Marxists.org: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm, "The bourgeoisie demonstrated to be a superfluous class. All its social functions are now performed by salaried employees."&lt;/ref&gt; With no need for [[capital accumulation]] and a class of owners, private property in the means of production is perceived as being an outdated form of economic organization that should be replaced by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]] of individuals based on public or [[common ownership]] of these socialized assets.&lt;ref&gt;''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. Chapter 1: Capitalism, The General Pattern of Capitalist Development (pp. 15–20)&lt;/ref&gt; Socialists view [[private property]] relations as limiting the potential of [[productive forces]] in the economy.&lt;ref name="Engels Selected Works 1968, p. 40"&gt;Marx and Engels Selected Works, Lawrence and Wishart, 1968, p. 40. Capitalist property relations put a "fetter" on the productive forces.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early socialists ([[Utopian socialist]]s and [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]]) criticized capitalism for concentrating [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[wealth]] within a small segment of society,&lt;ref&gt;in Encyclopædia Britannica (2009). Retrieved October 14, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551569/socialism, "Main" summary: "Socialists complain that capitalism necessarily leads to unfair and exploitative concentrations of wealth and power in the hands of the relative few who emerge victorious from free-market competition—people who then use their wealth and power to reinforce their dominance in society."&lt;/ref&gt; and does not utilise available [[technology]] and resources to their maximum potential in the interests of the public.&lt;ref name="Engels Selected Works 1968, p. 40"/&gt;

===Anarchist and libertarian socialist criticisms===
{{Main|Anarchist economics|Libertarian socialism}}

[[File:Portrait Emma Goldman.jpg|thumb|right|[[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves."&lt;ref name="Goldman2003p283"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldman|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IF7CusxuMcC&amp;pg=PA283 283]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

For the influential [[German people|German]] [[individualist anarchist]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]], "[[private property]] is a spook which "lives by the grace of law" and it "becomes 'mine' only by effect of the law". In other words, private property exists purely "through the protection of the State, through the State's grace." Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner argued that "[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always 'love'? Not that of labour", rather it is "interest-bearing possession ... labouring capital, therefore ... labour certainly, yet little or none at all of one's own, but labour of capital and of the—subject labourers"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin |url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |title=G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner? in An Anarchist FAQ |publisher=Infoshop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123154932/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; French anarchist [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]] opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. The Spanish [[individualist anarchist]] [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] saw "capitalism [as] an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it State capitalism or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State.".&lt;ref&gt;"el capitalismo es sólo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente...Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo único que se cultiva es la ganancia, bien o mal habida. Luchar, pues, contra el capitalismo es tarea inútil, porque sea Capitalismo de Estado o Capitalismo de Empresa, mientras el Gobierno exista, existirá el capital que explota. La lucha, pero de conciencias, es contra el Estado."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[anarchism]] there emerged a critique of [[wage slavery]] which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person. The term ''wage slavery'' has been used to criticize [[economic exploitation]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages,  e.g. in [[sweatshops]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandel|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA184 184]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as a lack of [[workers' self-management]], fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky |page=2|publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spunk.org"&gt;{{cite web |title= The Bolsheviks and Workers Control, 1917–1921: The State and Counter-revolution |url= http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |publisher= [[Spunk Library]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian socialists believe if freedom is valued, then society must work towards a system in which individuals have the power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with [[direct democracy]], voluntary federation, and popular autonomy in all aspects of life,&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Austin, et al. ''Encyclopedia of Social Theory'' Routledge (2006) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; including physical communities and economic enterprises. With the advent of the [[industrial revolution]], thinkers such as [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Proudhon|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 c7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1969|loc=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch07.htm Chapter VII]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luddite]]s emphasized the [[dehumanization]] brought about by machines while later [[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves.".&lt;ref name="Goldman2003p283" /&gt; American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] believed that the economic system of [[capitalism]] was incompatible with human liberty. "The only demand that property recognizes," she wrote in ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', "is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade."&lt;ref name="Goldman1917p54"&gt;Goldman, Emma. ''Anarchism and Other Essays''. 3rd ed. 1917. New York: Dover Publications Inc., 1969., p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, "turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron."&lt;ref name="Goldman1917p54"/&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] contends that there is little moral difference between chattel slavery and renting one's self to an owner or "[[wage slavery]]". He feels that it is an attack on personal integrity that undermines individual freedom. He holds that workers should own and control their workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky, p. 2 of 5 |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many libertarian socialists argue that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial manufacture, while workers retain rights to the individual products of their labor.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, Albert S. ''A History of European Socialism'' Yale University Press (1983) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they see a distinction between the concepts of "private property" and "[[Personal property|personal possession]]". Whereas "private property" grants an individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not, and regardless of its productive capacity, "possession" grants no rights to things that are not in use.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, Richard et al. ''Property and Contract in Their Relations to the Distribution of Wealth''. The Macmillan Company (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to individualist anarchist [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s "big four" monopolies (land, money, tariffs, and patents), [[Kevin Carson]] argues that the [[Sovereign state|state]] has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization, in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. He believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions, whereas Carson also focuses on organizational issues. Carson holds that “[[Capitalism]], arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the [[Middle Ages]], was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier [[Feudalism|feudal]] conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable.”&lt;ref name=Richman&gt;[[Sheldon Richman|Richman, Sheldon]], [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/libertarian-left/ Libertarian Left], ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Carson coined the [[pejorative]] term "vulgar libertarianism," a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of [[corporate capitalism]] and [[economic inequality]]. According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase "vulgar political economy," which [[Karl Marx]] described as an economic order that "deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life]."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Theories of Surplus Value, III,'' p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxism===
[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich Das Kapital Marx 1867.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Das Capital|Capital: Critique of Political Economy]], by [[Karl Marx]], is a critical analysis of political economy, meant to reveal the economic laws of the capitalist mode of production]]

{{Main|Marxism}}
{{quote|If we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually at work, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people..|Karl Marx, 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marx|first1=Karl|title=Letter from Marx To his Father In Trier|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1837-pre/letters/37_11_10.htm|website=Marxist.org|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Karl Marx]] saw capitalism as a historical stage, once progressive but which would eventually stagnate due to internal contradictions and would eventually be followed by socialism. Marx claimed that capitalism was nothing more than a necessary stepping stone for the progression of man, which would then face a political revolution before embracing the [[communism|classless society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Immanuel|first=Wallerstein|title=The Rise and Future Demise of the World Capitalist System: Concepts for Comparative Analysis|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=September 1974|volume=16|issue=4|pages=387–415|url=http://bev.berkeley.edu/ipe/readings/Wallerstein.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marxists define [[capital (economics)|capital]] as "a social, economic relation" between people (rather than between people and things). In this sense they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers ("the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]] the workerforce. In Karl Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class, and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.

==Fascism==
{{Main|Fascist economics}}
Fascists opposed both [[Socialism|international socialism]] and [[Free market|free market capitalism]], arguing that their views represented a [[Third Position|third position]]. They claimed to provide a realistic economic alternative that was neither ''laissez-faire'' capitalism nor [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Morgan, ''Fascism in Europe, 1919-1945", New York, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; They favored [[corporatism]] and [[class collaboration]], believing that the existence of inequality and social hierarchy was beneficial (contrary to the views of socialists),&lt;ref name = "Mussolini"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1932|title=The Doctrine of Fascism| encyclopedia = [[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|publisher=''Istituto Giovanni Treccani''|location=[[Rome]]}} "[Fascism] affirms the irremediable, fruitful and beneficent inequality of men"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Weiss, ''"The Fascist Tradition"'', Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1967. pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt; while also arguing that the state had a role in mediating relations between classes (contrary to the views of liberal capitalists).&lt;ref&gt;Calvin B. Hoover, ''The Paths of Economic Change: Contrasting Tendencies in the Modern World'', The American Economic Review, Vol. 25, No. 1, Supplement, Papers and Proceedings of the Forty-seventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association. (March, 1935), pp. 13-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barter==
Barter is a system of exchange where [[good (economics)|goods]] or [[service (economics)|services]] are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a [[medium of exchange]], such as [[money]]. It is distinguishable from [[gift economies]] in many ways; one of them is that the [[reciprocal exchange]] is immediate and not delayed in time. It is usually [[bilateralism|bilateral]], but may be [[multilateralism|multilateral]] (i.e., mediated through barter organizations) and, in most developed countries, usually only exists parallel to monetary systems to a very limited extent. Barter, as a replacement for money as the method of exchange, is used in times of monetary crisis, such as when the currency may be either unstable (e.g., [[hyperinflation]] or [[deflationary spiral]]) or simply unavailable for conducting [[commerce]].
Bartering could be considered a social starting point towards an anti-capitalist system, by negating the need for a medium of exchange.

==Wage slavery==
{{Main|Wage slavery}}

[[Wage slavery]] refers to a situation where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wages]] or a [[salary]], especially when the dependence is total and immediate. It is a [[pejorative]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and renting a person.

The term wage slavery has been used to criticize [[exploitation of labour]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in [[sweatshops]]), and the latter as a lack of [[workers' self-management]], fulfilling job choices, and leisure in an economy. The criticism of social stratification covers a wider range of employment choices bound by the pressures of a [[hierarchical]] society to perform otherwise unfulfilling work that deprives humans of their "species character" not only under threat of [[starvation]] or [[poverty]], but also of [[social stigma]] and [[social status|status]] [[diminution]]. It has been argued by some centre-left and left leaning activists that the economy of the contemporary United States constitutes a softer form of wage slavery, in which conditions are not grinding, but nonetheless not conducive to individual economic progress.

'''Arthur Rylands Lowe''' (22 June 1873 – 31 May 1924) was a British accountant and the first full-time professional accountant in Hong Kong.

==Biography==
Lowe was born on 22 June 1873 in [[Manchester]]. He was educated at the [[Hulme Grammar School]] and later joined Parkinson, Mather &amp; Co., chartered accountants of Manchester and London.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news|title=DEATH OF HON. MR. A. R. LOWE.|newspaper=The Hong Kong Telegraph|date=31 May 1924|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Hong Kong to join [[Butterfield &amp; Swire]] in 1898. He resigned in 1902 to start up his own business.&lt;ref name="pwc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chamber.org.hk/en/membership/profile_detail.aspx?profile_id=68|title=PricewaterhouseCoopers|work=The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 1902, he became Hong Kong's first full-time professional accountant, and started the accountant firm that is today the Hong Kong office of [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. In 1903 he took fellow accountant J. E. Bingham as a partner. They established an office in Shanghai in 1906. When F. N. Matthews in Shanghai joined the partnership in 1908, the firm became known as Lowe, Bingham &amp; Matthews.&lt;ref name="pwc"/&gt; Under his leadership, its clients included the [[China Light and Power Co.]], [[Hongkong and Shanghai Bank]], [[Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock]], [[Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]] and the [[Hong Kong and China Gas Co.]].&lt;ref name="pwc"/&gt; Lowe was also a director of [[Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels|Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Ltc.]] and secretary of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]] for many years.&lt;ref name="pwc"/&gt; 

Lowe contested the [[Justice of the Peace]] election in 1920 for a seat in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] against T. F. Hough during the absence of [[Henry Edward Pollock|H. E. Pollock]]. He was again appointed to the Legislative Council in July 1922 while [[Herbert William Bird|H. W. Bird]] was on leave. Lowe was especially acquainted with financial matters in the Legislative Council and was involved in the discussions between the government and the [[Hong Kong Telephone Company]] over the renewal of the company's licence. He was also member of the Licensing Board and was made Justice of the Peace in March 1906.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

Lowe was one of the leading members of the [[Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club]] and was the president of the Lawn Bowls Association of Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; He was also interested in pony racing. Lowe died from [[typhoid]] at 4:00 a.m. on 31 May 1924 at the Peak Hospital, aged 50.&lt;ref name="pwc"/&gt;

BRI is the oldest bank in Indonesia, tracing back since 1896. It is currently 70% [[Government-owned corporation|government owned operating company]] (Persero) and has been government-owned for the entire period since the war of independence (1945 to 1949) to November 2003, when 30% of its shares were sold through an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]].

==History==
BRI was founded in 1895, during the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] colonial period as ''De Poerwokertosche Hulp en Spaarbank der Inlandsche Hoofden'' (Help and Savings Bank for Purwokerto's Aristocrats) by Raden Bei Aria Wirjaatmadja in [[Purwokerto]], [[Central Java]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ir-bri.com/ Investor Relations: Corporate Profile], Bank Rakyat Indonesia's investor relations site. Retrieved 24 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It then underwent its first (of many) name changes to ''Hulp en Spaarbank der Inlandsche Bestuurs Ambtenaren'' (Help and Savings Bank for Local Civil Servants).

Going through several name changes, its final name during the colonial period was ''Algemene Volkscredietbank'' (People's General Credit Bank, AVB) in 1934. This translates loosely into Indonesian as ''Bank Rakyat Serikat''. At this point it was one of the largest institutions in the (then) colony.

The bank's operations were affected by the Japanese occupation during the 1942 to 1945 period of [[World War II]], including a further name change to ''Shomin Ginkou'' (People's Bank). After the Indonesian declaration of independence, on 17 August 1945 the bank was officially [[nationalise]]d by the new government and then renamed ''Bank Rakyat Indonesia Serikat''. BRI gained its current name and status in 1992.

BRI was nearly unique in Indonesia in the [[East Asian financial crisis]] of 1997, in that its operations were largely unaffected. This was because it had very little, if any, lending in foreign currencies or to the large corporations that had been borrowing heavily overseas, as most of the other large Indonesian banks had.

Since then BRI has been concentrating on increasing its core business and improving its [[risk management]] practices. As part of the [[Reformation (Indonesia)|reformasi]] (reform) process in Indonesia since 1998, the government has been steadily reducing its influence on the Bank's day-to-day operations, culminating in its IPO.
It is also seeking to comply with the [[Basel II]] accords, as mandated by [[Bank Indonesia]], by 2008.

During period of 2006–2011, its assets jumped almost 62%. The bank topped the list of the nation's most profitable banks for six years, recording assets of Rp 249.56&amp;nbsp;trillion (US$28.6&amp;nbsp;billion) in 2010, up from Rp 154.72&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | url =  http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/14/bris-assets-jump-62-5-years.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, BRI contracted with [[Space Systems/Loral]] and [[Arianespace]] to, respectively, build and launch their first [[satellite]], a {{convert|3500|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[C band (IEEE)|C-]] and [[Ku band|Ku-band]] spacecraft dubbed BRIsat, and on 18 June 2016, [[Ariane 5]] has successfully launched BRIsat as the first satellite owned and operated by a bank in the world to link the bank's geographically isolated branches.&lt;ref name="sn"&gt;{{cite web | last = de Selding  | first = Peter B. | title = Indonesia Taps SS/L, Arianespace To Build, Launch 3,500-kilogram Satellite | work = [[SpaceNews (publication)|SpaceNews]] | date = 28 April 2014 | url = http://www.spacenews.com/article/satellite-telecom/40358indonesia-taps-ssl-arianespace-to-build-launch-3500-kilogram }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2016/06/19/310781184/Ariane-5-Launched-into-Space-with-BRIsat |title=Ariane 5 Launched into Space with BRIsat |date=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bloodsucking Bastards''''' is a 2015 American [[comedy horror|comedy horror film]]&lt;ref&gt;http://bloody-disgusting.com/indie/3289705/bloodsucking-bastards-turns-cast-into-vamps/&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Brian James O'Connell, written by Ryan Mitts and Dr. God, O'Connell's comedy group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewrap.com/dr-god-comedy-group-sets-up-axs-tv-show-wraps-first-film/&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[Fran Kranz]], [[Pedro Pascal]], Emma Fitzpatrick, and [[Joey Kern]]. The film was [[limited release]]d September 4, 2015, and through [[video on demand]] by [[Scream Factory]].

==Plot==
At the office where they work together, acting sales manager Evan Sanders talks to his slacker friend and coworker Tim about an upcoming presentation for the Phallucite account. After an awkward moment between Evan and head of HR Amanda in the break room, Tim explains to coworkers Andrew and Mike that Amanda said “I love you” to Evan and Evan’s response was, “no.”

After encounters with the janitor and Frank the security guard, intern Jack is killed while taking trash to the dumpster.

Branch president Ted Plunkett passes over Evan for a promotion and instead hires Max Phillips as the new sales manager. Max went to college with Evan and Tim, but Evan had him kicked out after Max slept with his girlfriend. Max moves into Evan’s office and starts hitting on Amanda.

In the office alone playing video games after hours, Mike is killed in one of the bathroom stalls. Evan finds Mike’s body in the morning, but it is gone by the time he alerts everyone.

Max secretly turns office employee Dave into a vampire. Formerly passive Dave becomes aggressive in demanding that everyone pay what is owed to the office sports betting pool.

Anxious to complete his Phallucite presentation, Evan uses Zabeth, who harbors a crush on him, to retrieve files from the basement. Zabeth is attacked and turned into a vampire.

Evan convinces Andrew to work late with him. Andrew goes to the basement and is attacked by Zabeth. Meanwhile, Evan searches Max’s office, finding photos of Amanda and personnel files where each employee photograph is marked with an x, circle, or check.

Andrew returns upstairs and seemingly drops dead in front of Evan. Evan hides in a supply closet. Determining that Max is behind the murders, Evan calls Amanda with a warning, but Max answers her phone and taunts him. Evan eventually passes out.

Ted, Tim, and Max find Evan in the morning. Andrew returns as a vampire and presents the completed Phallucite presentation to the bosses. Ted admonishes Evan for not finishing it himself. However, Max strangely defends Evan to protect Evan’s job.

Evan tries convincing Tim that vampires have overtaken the office. Tim reveals several odd events he witnessed that corroborate Evan’s wild claim, including watching Max turn administrative assistant Elaine into a vampire. Amanda still refuses to believe that anything supernatural is going on. Evan worries that Max will turn her into a vampire like the other employees.

Evan and Tim go to Frank for help. Frank reveals that he was with Tim when they witnessed the ongoing vampire activity. The three men go to Frank’s car for weapons and discover that Frank’s vehicle was robbed. The janitor reveals he is a vampire by attacking Frank. Frank recovers and stakes the Janitor through his heart, killing him.

Evan, Tim, and Frank return to the office and discover that all of the employees are now productive vampires. The men arm themselves with office supplies before confronting Ted, Max, and Andrew in Ted’s office. Amanda is also present. Ted reveals that he knew Max was turning employees into vampires and that he sanctioned it so that employee performance would improve. Evan reveals that the files he found in Max’s office prove that Max planned to kill Ted. Before Ted can act, Max snaps Ted’s neck.

Max and Andrew allow the three men to leave Ted’s office with Amanda, but they are surrounded by the vampire employees. After a long battle, all of the vampires are killed. Max calls in the legal team, also turned into vampires, as reinforcements. He then compels Amanda back into Ted’s office and leaves the three men to continue fighting.

Andrew kills vampire Dave because he never liked him and ends up in a confrontation with Tim during which they debate how their faceoff should end. Frank dies combating the vampires from Legal. Evan returns to Ted’s office where he and Amanda ultimately kill Max.

Afterwards, Tim finds Evan and Amanda making out amidst the carnage. The three of them calmly leave the building as day breaks. A cleaning woman arrives at the grisly scene and is attacked by Andrew.

'''Business chess''' is  a [[Chess variant|variant of chess]] played in teams. It was invented in 1992 by Dr. Grachya Ovakimyan of [[Moscow]] with the aim of making [[chess]] more entertaining and spectacular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|

== Key ideas ==

* '''Branch'''  – version of a chess game having own rating, that is played on one demonstration chessboard ([[#Photo 2|Photo 2]]).
* '''Branch rating''' – a number indicating how important the branch, which is a marks (colored chips), located in the upper part of the demonstration chessboard ([[#Photo 2|Photo 2]]). The score of each branch is equal to its chess result, multiplied by the rating of the given branch.
* '''Branching'''&amp;nbsp;– splitting a branch of a single move by splitting one of the existing branches (the "[[Parent node|parent]]") into two and distributing the ratings between the two "[[Child node|child]]" branches. Different moves will subsequently be made in each branch. This can only be done if there is a free demonstration chessboard.
* '''Selection'''&amp;nbsp;– removing a branch in a single move in recognition of defeat from a position on that branch, and redistribution of its branch rating between those of its remaining siblings. The opponent team gets points equal to the lost branch rating.
* '''Passing''' &amp;nbsp;– transferring one unit (colored chip) in a single move from one branch rating to a sibling, with no gain nor loss of points.

== Description {{anchor|Figure 1}} ==
[[File:Business chess Scheme 1 - Eng.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 1. Room setup|alt=A room plan showing the placement of tables, boards, and other game paraphernalia]]

The board, pieces, their positions and rules of movement are the same as for standard [[chess]]. But several parallel branches (versions of the same game) can be played at the same time on the several boards, with the help of rating (importance) indicators of a certain branch (red marks on top of the board, see [[#Photo 2|Photo 2]]). The game is for two teams, recommended each to have five members. During the game members of one team may discuss it, as well as actively move, and then form the alternative (parallel) branches. They also can change the rating of each branch by transferring its marks. With the possibility of changing the number of simultaneously played branches  and their ratings, qualitatively new, tactical and strategic methods of competition appear which are inherent only in this version of chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://business-chess.com/english/news/m2005.php
|title=On Business Chess, Economy, Politics, and School Education.

|accessdate=21 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Interactive Cognitive Scenario the following mechanisms are envisaged: ([[#Photo 1|Photo 1]] and [[#Figure 1|Figure 1]]):

# Official moves in business chess are made on demonstration chessboards. Up to five such boards may be displayed side-by-side each with a branch arising during one game. Each demonstration board involved in a game has its rating ([[#Photo 2|Photo 2]]). The basic mechanisms of the scenario&amp;nbsp;– ''Branching'', ''Selection'' and ''Passing'' of chess positions&amp;nbsp;–  are shown on the demonstration boards. These mechanisms affect the current and final score in a game and require members of both teams to coordinate their actions and carry out their decisions.
# To discuss positions and calculate variants, each of the teams is provided with five ordinary chessboards with full sets of pieces.
# To limit the time of a game there is only one [[Game clock|chess clock]], however many branches are played in parallel. It is started after the team makes a move in all branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AQKI0eZpW0|title=a video clip of Business Chess|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of each team is limited to one hour. If one branch remains in the [[Chess endgame|endgame]], an additional five minutes is given.

[[File:Business chess Picture 2.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Photo 2. Branches. The red colored chips at the top of each display board indicate the rating of each branch.|alt=A man looks at three large chessboards on a wall with different positions]]

=== Demonstration boards ===
Parallel variants of a game ('''branches''') can be played on five nearby demonstration boards, numbered 1 to 5, each of which has its own '''rating''' (See [[#Photo 2|Photo 2]]).  Teams can decide to change the number of branches and their ratings. The score of each branch (on a particular board) is equal to its chess result, multiplied by the rating of the given branch. The final score of the game is equal to the sum of results of all branches.

The game begins on one demonstration board only, representing branch 1 (see [[#Figure 1|Figure 1]]) with rating 10. '''Branching''' is used (see [[#Figure 2|Figure 2]]) to increase the number of branches.

{{anchor|Figure 2}}[[File:Business chess Scheme 2 - Eng.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Figure 2. Branching|alt=A diagram with one box above, labelled "before", and two below, labelled "after". The boxes are labelled with chess moves outside and a score inside (10 above, 7 and 3 below), and the box above has arrows to those below]]

To carry out a Branching the team on its move copies the position from board 1 to a free demonstration board, apply differing continuations (for example, on a demonstration board 1 move '''e4''', and on a board 2 – '''g3'''). In this case, the rating of the original (maternal) branch is distributed between the child branches according to the decision made by the team making the branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AQKI0eZpW0|title=video about branching|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the subsequent branching there will appear branches 3, 4, and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7PFe_nz8M4|title=video about branches|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If in the course of a game one of the teams gets a branch with a lost position (e.g. branch 1 in [[#Figure 3|Figure 3]]), then the team may resign the game in that branch and transfer all the chips of its rating to the demonstration board of another (parallel) branch, where the team has an undefeated position (e.g. branch 2). This represents the so-called '''Selection''', which offers a team a possibility of winning back what has been lost.

{{anchor|Figure 3}}[[File:Business chess Scheme 3R - Eng.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Figure 3. Selection.|alt=A diagram with three boxes showing the branches before, labelled as for the previous schemes, and two showing the branches after. One box "after" is thus eliminated. The total of the ratings in the boxes above equals the total for those in the branches below.]]

As a result of such a redistribution, the rating of the lost branch is added to the rating of the remaining one and the opponent gets points equal to the lost branch rating (in the given case, three points).

A Business chess game [[tree structure]] resulting from operations of Branching and Selection is shown in [[#Figure 4|Figure 4]].

{{anchor|Figure 4}}[[File:Business chess Scheme 4 - Eng.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Figure 4. A business chess game tree without chess passing. The rectangles denote branches (1 to 5) and their respective ratings (1 to 10)|alt=A complex diagram made up of several branches and selections, growing downwards to show the development of variant games as different moves are made. A points tally at each stage is given on the left.]]

On [[#Figure 4|Figure 4]] the increasing number of branches is shown (after move 7, there are already two branches, after move 11, three, after the move 12, four, and after move 18, five branches). Then, as a result of the selection and drawing (on moves 24, 25, 29 and 37, respectively) the number of branches gradually decreases. After move 37 and until the end of the game there remains only one branch, with a rating of eight.

A very important tactical element of the business chess scenario is chess '''Passing'''. Such a pass enables one to transfer, in a single move, one unit of rating from one branch to another without loss of points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffeh1oNxYRM|title=video of chess Passing|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a way of adjusting branch ratings as the team reassesses their positions. The game tree with Passing has a more complicated form (see [[#Figure 5|Figure 5]]).

{{anchor|Figure 5}}[[File:Business chess Scheme 5 - Eng.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Figure 5. A business chess game tree with chess passing. The rectangles denote branches (1 to 5) and their respective ratings (1 to 10)]]

Only one member of the team may move pieces and ratings on the demonstration board after the team decides collectively. This stops players crowding in front of the demonstration boards. For this purpose the zone before the rows of demonstration boards is separated from the zone of team location by red lines which only one team member may cross.

=== Discussion {{anchor|Photo 3}} ===
[[File:Business chess Picture 4.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Photo 3. The Black team discussing one of the branches. In the background can be seen the White team in discussion.|alt=A picture of four men looking over a chessboard and gesticulating. In the background are other chess boards on tables, set up differently.]]
Each team is provided five ordinary chess boards to freely discuss positions and calculate variants ([[#Figure 1|Figure 1]]). At each board the team (or part of it) discusses the position arising in one of the branches of a game ([[#Photo 3|Photo 3]] and Video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i9YHaSotkw|title=White|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWGIxS-YZvE|title=Black|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfHuPU0G2ro|title=One move in Business Chess : Black and White|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The team itself determines how it organizes discussions and makes decisions. Interactive Cognitive Scenario only suggests the possibility of alternative actions of each team member (using branching) in combination with the possibility of subsequent rejection from them when it becomes clear for team that these actions were erroneous (using selection).

==Game parameters==
There is a huge number of possible ways the Interactive Cognitive Scenario can be realized. Therefore, before a game is played some parameters should be agreed:
* Initial game rating
* The number of demonstration boards (the maximum allowed number of branches)
* The number of players in each team and the rules for their replacement during the game
* The rules of branching, selection, distribution, redistribution and passing
* The time allowed for thinking over the moves and the form of time control.

==Spectators==

=== Focus on chess ===
During the game, spectators are able to hear and see team discussions: what information and in what scope the players analyze, how much and what options are offered for continuation, at what depth they are calculated, how the evaluations of positions changes during the passing and what final decisions are taken as a result. For the first time this becomes available for spectators' assessment directly, rather than via expert analysis.

The demonstration boards show several [[competition|competing]] versions of the game (branches). Their number and ratings change throughout the game and directly affect the current and final score of the game.

=== Focus on people ===
Business chess creates a team spirit and socio-psychological atmosphere that is not specific to chess. It may be of interest even for spectators who do not care much for chess.

Playing business chess brings out familiar social problems for the teams such as [[leadership]] and [[interpersonal compatibility|psychological compatibility]], a [[division of labor]] and specialization, choosing effective ways of [[management]] (authoritarian, democratic, etc.) and [[problem solving]], generating new ideas, their discussion, implementation and development in a competitive environment, and so on.

Spectators can also watch almost all varieties of situations typical in group [[competition]], and their continuous change, depending on the availability or shortage of advantages, time, alternative ways of development, and so on.

== Tournaments ==
Tournaments have been held regularly since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Apart from being a sport, Business Chess can also be used for [[scientific modelling]] of mental activity,&lt;ref name="МП1"&gt;{{cite journal

|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; method of [[psychological evaluation]], psychological [[training]] and [[play therapy]].&lt;ref name="Book BC" /&gt; Such opportunity is conditioned by team active discussion and a multistage process of group decision-making based on [[sociocultural evolution]] depending on changing conditions ([[game]]). It can be seen that the main mechanisms of Interactive Cognitive Scenario (branching and selection) resemble biological mechanisms of [[evolution]] ([[genetic mutation]] and [[natural selection]]).

=== Scientific model ===
Business chess as a scientific model can be effectively used for researches in following areas:  [[game theory]], [[bifurcation theory]], [[information theory]], [[control theory]] and [[decision theory]], the theory of innovation diffusion, [[management science]], [[sociocultural evolution]], [[cognitive psychology]] and [[social psychology]], research into [[intelligence|natural intelligence]] and [[artificial intelligence]], and so on. Thus as an [[expert system]] the application of existing [[chess engine|chess computer programs]] is possible.

=== In school ===
Experts in the field of child psychology agree that the system of national school education must first [[socialization|socialize]] pupils, that is, accustom and adapt them for the life in [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|year=2009
|isbn=978-5-09-019851-6
|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this purpose it is reasonable to use Business Chess as a general educational business game. The primary goal of similar lessons is to carry out intellectual and socially-psychological trainings for the pupils to make them skilled in constructive [[communication]], [[Competence (human resources)|communicative competence]], efficient [[Human resource management|management]], social [[self-organization]], psychological strength and adaptation in group. It is supposed,&lt;ref name="МП3"/&gt; that it promotes effective socialization and harmonious development of cogitative ([[Cognition|cognitive]]), behavioral ([[Interactivity|interactive]]) and emotional ([[motivation]]al) components of pupils' [[person]]ality studying at [[comprehensive school]]s.

It is also reasonable to use Business Chess for carrying out [[psychological evaluation]] at schools. The opportunity to register a lot of individual and group psychological parameters at the same time so as to observe their changes in dynamics, allows a complex estimation of [[intelligence]], [[aptitude]], level of achievement, personal situational correlations and mental development. Available [[expert systems]] in the form of modern [[Chess engine|chess computer programs]] enhance reliability of such researches.

A section of the "Business Chess" book is devoted to this subject,&lt;ref name="Book BC" /&gt; and also a lot of popular articles are included in the collection entitled "Sports business games: Business Chess, Go, Renju and others", 2007.&lt;ref name="Книга СДИ"&gt;{{cite book

'''CMD Group''', formerly Reed Construction Data and Construction Market Data, is a provider of [[business information]] for the [[North America]]n construction industry. CMD is owned by [[Warburg Pincus]] (51%) and [[Reed Business Information]] (49%). Its historical roots lie in Construction Market Data, founded in 1982 to publish construction leads and market data. In 2000, London-based [[Reed Elsevier]] purchased this original CMD Group, transitioning the company to Reed Construction Data.

In October 2014 [[private equity firm]] Warburg Pincus in New York purchased a majority stake in the company, and Reed Construction Data changed its name to CMD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hconews.com/articles/2014/10/8/reed-construction-data-rebrands-cmd&lt;/ref&gt; The Norcross, Ga.-based provider of North American construction data said the new name is a nod to the company’s original name: Construction Market Data. The new brand includes an updated logo and website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2014/10/01/reed-construction-data-rebrands-itself-as-cmd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The company tracks data on hundreds of thousands of projects per year, providing coverage of construction projects in both the United States and Canada. The company provides monthly analysis and data for all aspects of the construction industry. CMD also provides a detailed view of construction activity, including historical data, current-year projections and a five-year forecast. Their research helps customers forecast to find those market segments experiencing the greatest growth and plan tactical marketing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hconews.com/articles/2014/10/8/reed-construction-data-rebrands-cmd&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
In October 2009, Reed Construction Data (which is now Construction Market Data a division of ConstructCONNECT) filed suit in [[United States district court|federal court]] against [[McGraw-Hill Construction]], charging that the company's Dodge Report had unlawfully accessed confidential and trade secret information from Reed since 2002 by using a series of fake companies to pose as Reed customers.
The lawsuit, filed in the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], seeks an unspecified amount in lost profits and punitive damages, trial by jury, and injunctive relief as a result of Dodge’s misuse of proprietary construction project information, and that Dodge allegedly manipulated the information to create misleading comparisons between Dodge’s and Reed’s products and services in an effort to mislead the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reedconstructiondata.com/corporate/press-releases/2009/10/reed-construction-data-files-corporate-espionage-lawsuit-against-mcgraw-hil |title=Reed Construction Data Files Corporate Espionage Lawsuit Against McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge |publisher=Reedconstructiondata.com |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=March 2013}}

The '''City of London''' is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[counties of England|county]] that contains the historic centre and the primary [[central business district]] (CBD) of [[London]]. It constituted most of London from its [[Londinium|settlement]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century AD to the [[Middle Ages]], but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders.&lt;ref name="beckett"&gt;{{cite book |title=City status in the British Isles, 1830–2002 |series=Historical urban studies |author=Beckett, J V |year=2005 |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot |isbn=978-0-7546-5067-6 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of London Place Names|year=2010|last=Mills|first= AD|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UWKcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 152] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |quote=Of course until relatively recent times the name London referred only to the City of London with even ''Westminster'' remaining a separate entity. But when the County of London was created in 1888, the name often came to be rather loosely used for this much larger area, which was also sometimes referred to as ''Greater London'' from about this date. However, in 1965 '''Greater London''' was newly defined as a much enlarged area. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The City is now only a tiny part of the [[Greater London Built-up Area|metropolis of London]], though it remains a notable part of [[central London]]. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 [[districts of England|local authority districts]] of [[Greater London]]; however, the City of London is not a [[London borough]], a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the [[City of Westminster]]). It is also a separate county of England, being an [[enclave]] surrounded by Greater London. It is the smallest county in the [[United Kingdom]].

The City of London is widely referred to simply as '''the City''' (differentiated from the phrase "the city of London" by capitalising ''City'') and is also colloquially known as the '''Square Mile''', as it is {{convert|1.12|sqmi|acre km2|2|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/nr/rdonlyres/10feeb0b-3ded-4c2d-93d1-8534fcb28cc5/0/Census%202001.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=10 April 2009 | title=City of London Resident Population Census 2001 | publisher=Corporation of London |date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in area.

''London'' most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis, or the 32 London boroughs, in addition to the City of London itself. This wider usage of ''London'' is documented as far back as 1888, when the [[County of London]] was created.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt;

The [[local government in England|local authority]] for the City, namely the [[City of London Corporation]], is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council, such as being the police authority. It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries. The Corporation is headed by the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor of the City of London]], an office separate from (and much older than) the [[Mayor of London]]. The current Lord Mayor, as of November 2018, is [[Peter Estlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/the-lord-mayor/Pages/working-with-mayor-of-london.aspx|title=Working with the Mayor of London – City of London|website=www.cityoflondon.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City is a major business and [[financial centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zyen.com/PDF/GFC%207.pdf#page=30 |title=Global Financial Centres 7 |publisher=[[Z/Yen]] |year=2010 |accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 19th century, the City was the world's primary business centre, and it continues to be a major meeting point for businesses.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunton|first=Larkin|title=The World and Its People|publisher=Silver, Burdett |year=1896|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; London came top in the [[Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index]], published in 2008. The insurance industry is focused around the eastern side of the City, around [[Lloyd's building]]. A secondary financial district exists outside the City, at [[Canary Wharf]], {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} to the east.

The City has a resident population of 9,401 ([[Office of National Statistics|ONS]] estimate, mid-2016) but over 300,000 people commute to and work there. About three quarters of the jobs in the City of London are in the financial, professional, and associated business services sectors.&lt;ref name="citylondon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/Documents/city-statistics-briefing.pdf|title=City of London Jobs|publisher=The City of London|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal profession forms a major component of the northern and western sides of the City, especially in the [[Temple, London|Temple]] and [[Chancery Lane]] areas where the [[Inns of Court]] are located, of which two—[[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]]—fall within the City of London boundary.

== History ==
{{Main|History of London}}

=== Origins ===
{{Main|Roman London}}
[[File:Horned helmet.jpg|thumb|The [[Waterloo Helmet]], c. 150–50 BC, found in the [[River Thames]]]]
[[File:London Wall fragment.jpg|thumb|A surviving fragment of the [[London Wall]], built around 200 AD, close to [[Tower Hill]]]]

Known as "Londinium",  the Roman legions established on the current site of the City of London around {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;43. Its bridge over the [[River Thames]] turned the city into a [[#Roads|road nexus]] and major [[#Port|port]], serving as a major commercial centre in [[Roman Britain]] until its abandonment during [[#5th century|the 5th century]]. Archaeologist Leslie Wallace notes that "Because no [[Prehistoric Britain#Late pre-Roman Iron Age (LPRIA)|LPRIA]] settlements or significant domestic refuse have been found in London, despite extensive archaeological excavation, arguments for a purely Roman foundation of London are now common and uncontroversial."&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallace|first1=Leslie|title=Late pre-Roman Iron Age (LPRIA)|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04757-0|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbMkBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=pre-roman+london#v=onepage&amp;q=pre-roman%20london&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height, the Roman city had a population of approximately 45,000–60,000 inhabitants. Londinium was an ethnically diverse city, with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including natives of Britannia, [[continental Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34809804 DNA study finds London was ethnically diverse from start], [[BBC]], 23 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built the [[London Wall]] some time between 190 and 225 AD. The boundaries of the Roman city were similar to those of the City of London today, though Londinium did not extend further west than [[Ludgate]] or the [[River Fleet|Fleet]], and the mid-estuary Thames was undredged and wider than it is today thus, the City's shoreline was north of its present position. The Romans built a bridge across the river, as early as 50 AD, near to today's [[London Bridge]].

=== Decline ===
By the time the London Wall was constructed, the City's fortunes were in decline, and it faced problems of plague and fire. The Roman Empire entered a long period of [[Decline of the Roman Empire|instability and decline]], including the [[Carausian Revolt]] in Britain. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the city was under attack from [[Picts]], Scots, and [[Saxons|Saxon]] raiders. The decline continued, both for Londinium and the Empire, and in 410 AD the Romans withdrew entirely from Britain. Many of the Roman public buildings in Londinium by this time had fallen into decay and disuse, and gradually after the formal withdrawal the city became almost (if not, at times, entirely) uninhabited. The centre of trade and population moved away from the walled Londinium to [[Lundenwic]] ("London market"), a settlement to the west, roughly in the modern day [[Strand, London|Strand]]/[[Aldwych]]/[[Covent Garden]] area.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== Anglo-Saxon restoration ===

{{Main|Anglo-Saxon London}}
During the Anglo-Saxon [[Heptarchy]], the London area came in turn under the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Mercia]], and later [[Wessex]], though from the mid 8th century it was frequently under the control or threat of the [[Vikings]].
[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|left|thumb|Plaque near [[Southwark Bridge]] noting the activities around the time of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]].]]

[[Bede]] records that in 604 AD [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] consecrated [[Mellitus]] as the first bishop to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of the [[East Saxons]] and their king, [[Sæberht of Essex|Sæberht]]. Sæberht's uncle and overlord, [[Æthelberht of Kent|Æthelberht]], king of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], built a church dedicated to St Paul in London, as the seat of the new bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bede |authorlink=Bede |title=Ecclesiastical History of the English People |place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon |year=1969 |editor-last=Colgrave |editor-first=Bertram |editor2-last=Mynors |editor2-first=R. A. B. |pages=142–3|title-link=Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed, although unproven, that this first Anglo-Saxon cathedral stood on the same site as the later medieval and the present cathedrals.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[Alfred the Great]], [[King of Wessex]] and arguably the first king of the "English", occupied and began the resettlement of the old [[Roman Empire|Roman]] walled area, in 886, and appointed his son-in-law [[Earl Aethelred of Mercia|Earl Æthelred of Mercia]] over it as part of their reconquest of the Viking occupied parts of England. The refortified Anglo-Saxon settlement was known as [[Lundenburh]] ("London Fort", a [[borough]]). The historian Asser said that "Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, restored the city of London splendidly&amp;nbsp;... and made it habitable once more."&lt;ref&gt;Asser's ''Life of King Alfred'', ch. 83, trans. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred &amp; Other Contemporary Sources'' (Penguin Classics) (1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;97–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred's "restoration" entailed reoccupying and refurbishing the nearly deserted Roman walled city, building quays along the Thames, and laying a new city street plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Vince|Vince, Alan]], ''Saxon London: An Archaeological Investigation'', The Archaeology of London series (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred's taking of London and the rebuilding of the old Roman city was a turning point in history, not only as the permanent establishment of the City of London, but also as part of a unifying moment in early England, with Wessex becoming the dominant English kingdom and the repelling (to some degree) of the Viking occupation and raids. While London, and indeed England, were afterwards subjected to further periods of Viking and Danish raids and occupation, the establishment of the City of London and the [[Kingdom of England]] prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;''London: The Biography'', 2000, [[Peter Ackroyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;33–35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, [[Athelstan]] permitted eight [[royal mint|mints]] to be established, compared with six in his capital, [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]], indicating the wealth of the city. [[London Bridge]], which had fallen into ruin following the Roman evacuation and abandonment of Londinium, was rebuilt by the Saxons, but was periodically destroyed by Viking raids and storms.

As the focus of trade and population was moved back to within the old Roman walls, the older Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was largely abandoned and gained the name of ''Ealdwic'' (the "old settlement"). The name survives today as [[Aldwych]] (the "old market-place"), a name of a street and an area of the [[City of Westminster]] between [[Westminster]] and the City of London.

=== Medieval era ===

[[File:DeathWatTyler.jpg|thumb|right|A pivotal event during the [[Peasants' Revolt]], 1381: their leader [[Wat Tyler]] is stabbed by [[William Walworth]], Lord Mayor]]
{{See also|Norman and Medieval London}}
Following the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]] marched on London ''(reaching as far as [[Southwark]])'', but failed to get across London Bridge or to defeat the Londoners. He eventually crossed the River Thames at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], pillaging the land as he went. Rather than continuing the war, [[Edgar the Ætheling]], [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]] and [[Morcar]] of Northumbria surrendered at [[Berkhamsted]]. William granted the citizens of London a charter in 1075; the City was one of a few examples of the English retaining some authority. The City was not covered by the [[Domesday Book]].

William built three castles nearby, to keep Londoners subdued:

* [[Tower of London]]
* [[Baynard's Castle]]
* [[Montfichet's Tower]]

About 1130, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted a [[Shrievalty of London|sheriff]] to the people of London, along with control of the county of [[Middlesex]]: this meant that the two entities were regarded as one administratively (not that the county was a dependency of the City) until the [[Local Government Act 1888]].&lt;ref name=vch_middlesex&gt;[[Victoria County History]]: A history of the County of Middlesex: Vol 2 pp&amp;nbsp;15–60 paragraph 12, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153]. Retrieved 2 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By 1141 the whole body of the citizenry was considered to constitute a single community. This 'commune' was the origin of the [[City of London Corporation]] and the citizens gained the right to appoint, with the king's consent, a Mayor in 1189—and to directly elect the Mayor from 1215.

From medieval times, the City has been composed of [[Wards of the City of London|25 ancient wards]], each headed by an [[Alderman]], who chairs [[Wardmote]]s, which still take place at least annually. A [[Folkmoot]], for the whole of the City held at the outdoor cross of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was formerly also held. Many of the medieval offices and traditions continue to the present day, demonstrating the unique nature of the City and its [[Corporation of London|Corporation]].

In 1381, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] affected London. The rebels took the City and the Tower of London, but the rebellion ended after its leader, Wat Tyler, was killed during a confrontation that included Lord Mayor [[William Walworth]].

[[File:Great fire of london map.png|thumb|right|Map showing the extent of the [[Great Fire of London]], which destroyed nearly 80% of the City]]
[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|right|The 1666 Great Fire as depicted in a 17th-century painting: it depicts Old London Bridge, churches, houses, and the Tower of London as seen from a boat near Tower Wharf]]

The City was burnt severely on a number of occasions, the worst being in 1123 and (more famously) in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Both of these fires were referred to as ''the'' Great Fire. After the fire of 1666, a number of plans were drawn up to remodel the City and its street pattern into a [[renaissance]]-style city with planned urban blocks, squares and boulevards. These plans were almost entirely not taken up, and the medieval street pattern re-emerged almost intact.

=== Early modern period ===
By the late 16th century, London increasingly became a major centre for banking, international trade and commerce. The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded in 1565 by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]] as a centre of commerce for London's merchants, and gained Royal patronage in 1571. Although no longer used for its original purpose, its location at the corner of [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Threadneedle Street]] continues to be the geographical centre of the City's core of banking and financial services, with the [[Bank of England]] moving to its present site in 1734, opposite the Royal Exchange on Threadneedle Street. Immediately to the south of Cornhill, [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] was the location from 1691 of [[Lloyd's Coffee House]], which became the world-leading insurance market. London's insurance sector continues to be based in the area, particularly in [[Lime Street (ward)|Lime Street]].

In 1708, [[Christopher Wren]]'s masterpiece, [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was completed on his birthday. The first service had been held on 2 December 1697, more than 10 years earlier. It replaced the original St Paul's, which had been completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and is considered to be one of the finest cathedrals in Britain and a fine example of [[Baroque architecture]].

=== Growth of London ===

The 18th century was a period of rapid growth for London, reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and London's role at the centre of the evolving [[British Empire]]. The urban area expanded beyond the borders of the City of London, most notably during this period towards the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Westminster]].

Expansion continued and became more rapid by the beginning of the 19th century, with London growing in all directions. To the [[East End of London|East]] the [[Port of London]] grew rapidly during the century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of trade. The arrival of the railways and the [[London Underground|Tube]] meant that London could expand over a much greater area. By the mid-19th century, with London still rapidly expanding in population and area, the City had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
An attempt was made in 1894 with the [[Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London]] to end the distinction between the City and the surrounding County of London, but a change of government at Westminster meant the option was not taken up. The City as a distinct [[polity]] survived despite its position within the London conurbation and [[History of local government in London|numerous local government reforms]]. Supporting this status, the City was a special [[parliamentary borough]] that elected four members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], who were retained after the [[Reform Act 1832]]; reduced to two under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]; and ceased to be a separate constituency under the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]. Since then the City is a minority (in terms of population and area) of the [[Cities of London and Westminster]].
[[File:St Pauls Cathedral in 1896.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], 1896.]]

The City's population fell rapidly in the 19th century and through most of the 20th century, as people moved outwards in all directions to London's vast [[Metro-land|suburbs]], and many residential buildings were demolished to make way for office blocks. Like many areas of London and other British cities, the City fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during [[World War II]], especially in [[the Blitz]]. Whilst St Paul's Cathedral survived the onslaught, large swathes of the area did not and the particularly heavy raids of late December 1940 led to a [[firestorm]] called the [[Second Great Fire of London]].

There was a major rebuilding programme in the decades following the war, in some parts (such as at the Barbican) dramatically altering the urban landscape. But the destruction of the older historic fabric allowed the construction of modern and larger-scale developments, whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage the City retains its older character of smaller buildings. The street pattern, which is still largely medieval, was altered slightly in places, although there is a more recent trend of reversing some of the post-war modernist changes made, such as at [[Paternoster Square]].

The City suffered terrorist attacks including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]]  ([[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]) and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] ([[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]]). In response to the 1993 bombing, a system of road barriers, checkpoints and surveillance cameras referred to as the "[[ring of steel (London)|ring of steel]]" has been maintained to control entry points to the City.

The 1970s saw the construction of tall office buildings including the 600-foot (183&amp;nbsp;m), 47-storey [[Natwest Tower]], the first skyscraper in the UK. Office space development has intensified especially in the central, northern and eastern parts, with skyscrapers including [[30 St Mary Axe|30 St. Mary Axe]] ("the Gherkin"'), [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] ("the Cheesegrater"), [[20 Fenchurch Street]] ("the Walkie-Talkie"), the [[Broadgate Tower]] and the [[Heron Tower]], the tallest in the City. Another skyscraper, [[22 Bishopsgate]], is under construction.

The main residential section of the City today is the [[Barbican Estate]], constructed between 1965 and 1976. The [[Museum of London]] is based there, as are a number of other services provided by the Corporation.

{{See also|City of London Corporation|History of local government in England#The City of London}}
The City has a unique political status, a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon period]] and its singular relationship with the [[British monarchy|Crown]]. Historically its system of government was not unusual, but it was not reformed by the [[Municipal Reform Act 1835]] and little changed by later reforms.

It is administered by the [[City of London Corporation]], headed by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] (''not the same as the more recent [[Mayor of London]]''), which is responsible for a number of functions and has interests in land beyond the City's boundaries. Unlike other English local authorities, the Corporation has two council bodies: the (now largely ceremonial) [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]]. The Court of Aldermen represents the wards, with each ward (irrespective of size) returning one Alderman. The chief executive of the Corporation holds the ancient office of [[Town Clerk of London]].

The City is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] which has a Commission of Lieutenancy headed by the Lord Mayor instead of a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] and has [[Sheriffs of the City of London|two Sheriffs]] instead of a [[High Sheriff]] (see [[list of Sheriffs of London]]), quasi-judicial offices appointed by the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]], an ancient political system based on the representation and [[Guild|protection of trades (Guilds)]]. Senior members of the Livery Companies are known as [[Liveryman|Liverymen]] and form the Common Hall, which chooses the Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs and certain other officers.

=== Wards ===
{{Main|Wards of the City of London}}
The City is made up of [[:Category:Wards of the City of London|25 wards]].

[[File:City of London UK labelled ward map 2003.svg|thumb|A map of the wards since 2003]]

Following boundary changes in 1994, and later reform of the business vote in the City, there was a major boundary and electoral representation revision of the wards in 2003, and they were reviewed again in 2010 for change in 2013, though not to such a dramatic extent. The review was conducted by senior officers of the Corporation and senior judges of the [[Old Bailey]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundary_review.htm Corporation of London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041508/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundary_review.htm |date=14 January 2010 }} Ward Boundary Review (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; the wards are reviewed by this process to avoid [[malapportionment]]. The procedure of review is unique in the United Kingdom as it is not conducted by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] or a local government boundary commission every 8 to 12 years, which is the case for all other [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|wards in Great Britain]]. Particular churches, [[livery company]] halls and other historic buildings and structures are associated with a ward, such as St Paul's Cathedral with [[Castle Baynard]], and London Bridge with Bridge; boundary changes in 2003 removed some of these historic connections.

Each ward elects an [[Alderman]] to the [[Court of Aldermen]], and [[Commoners]] (the City equivalent of a [[Councillor]]) to the [[Court of Common Council]] of the Corporation. Only electors who are [[Freeman of the City of London|Freemen of the City of London]] are eligible to stand. The number of Commoners a ward sends to the Common Council varies from two to ten, depending on the number of electors in each ward. Since the 2003 review it has been agreed that the four more residential wards: [[Portsoken]], [[Queenhithe]], [[Aldersgate]] and [[Cripplegate]] together elect 20 of the 100 Commoners, whereas the business-dominated remainder elect the remaining 80 Commoners. 2003 and 2013 boundary changes have increased the residential emphasis of the mentioned four wards.

Census data provides eight nominal rather than 25 real wards, all of varying size and population. Being subject to renaming and definition at any time, these census 'wards' are notable in that four of the eight wards accounted for 67% of the 'square mile' and held 86% of the population, and these were in fact similar to and named after four City of London wards:

=== Elections ===
The City has a unique electoral system. Most of its voters are representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City. Its ancient wards have very unequal numbers of voters. In elections, both the businesses based in the City and the residents of the City vote.

The City of London Corporation was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], because it had a more extensive electoral franchise than any other borough or city; in fact, it widened this further with its own equivalent legislation allowing one to become a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] without being a [[liveryman]]. In 1801, the City had a population of about 130,000, but increasing development of the City as a central business district led to this falling to below 5,000 after the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It has risen slightly to around 9,000 since, largely due to the development of the [[Barbican Estate]]. In 2009, the business vote was about 24,000, greatly exceeding residential voters.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2009/02/12/labour-runs-in-city-of-london-poll-against-%E2%80%98get-rich%E2%80%99-bankers/|title=Labour runs in City of London poll against 'get-rich' bankers|date=12 February 2009|author=René Lavanchy|work=[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the City of London Corporation has not been affected by other municipal legislation over the period of time since then, its electoral practice has become increasingly anomalous. Uniquely for city or borough elections, its elections remain independent-dominated.

The business or "[[non-residential vote]]" was abolished in other UK local council elections by the [[Representation of the People Act 1969]], but was preserved in the City of London. The principal reason given by successive UK governments for retaining this mechanism for giving businesses representation, is that the City is "primarily a place for doing business".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=City of London (Ward Elections) Bill (By Order) – Second Reading|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990224/debtext/90224-48.htm |date=24 February 1999 |column_start=482 |column_end=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 330,000 non-residents constitute the day-time population and use most of its services, far outnumbering residents, who number around 7,000 (2011). By contrast, opponents of the retention of the business vote argue that it is a cause of institutional inertia.&lt;ref&gt;Shaxson, N. (2011). Treasure islands: Tax havens and the men who stole the world. London: The Bodley Head.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002]], a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/locact02/20020006.htm |title=HMSO '&amp;#39;City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002 (2002 Chapter vi)'&amp;#39; |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; reformed the voting system and greatly increased the business franchise, allowing many more businesses to be represented. Under the new system, the number of non-resident voters has doubled from 16,000 to 32,000. Previously disenfranchised firms (and other organisations) are entitled to nominate voters, in addition to those already represented, and all such bodies are now required to choose their voters in a representative fashion. Bodies employing fewer than ten people may appoint one voter; those employing ten to 50 people one voter for every five employees; those employing more than 50 people ten voters and one additional voter for each 50 employees beyond the first 50. The Act also removed other anomalies which had been unchanged since the 1850s.

=== The Temple ===
[[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]] (which neighbour each other) are two of the few remaining [[Liberty (division)|liberties]], an old name for a geographic division. They are independent [[extra-parochial area]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090915091838/http://www.agi.org.uk/SITE/UPLOAD/DOCUMENT/Events/AGI2009/papers/MartinLaker.pdf Association for Geographic Information] What place is that then?

They are within the boundaries and liberties of the City, but can be thought of as independent [[enclave]]s. They are both part of [[Farringdon Without]].

=== Other functions ===
[[File:Leadenhall Market In London - Feb 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leadenhall Market]] is a historic market nestled between [[Gracechurch Street]] and [[Lime Street, London|Lime Street]].]]
Within the City, the Corporation owns and runs both [[Smithfield Market]] and [[Leadenhall Market]]. It owns land beyond its boundaries, including [[Corporation of London open spaces|open spaces]] (parks, forests and commons) in and around Greater London, including most of [[Epping Forest]], [[Hampstead Heath]]. [[The Honourable The Irish Society]], a body closely linked with the Corporation, also owns many public spaces in [[Northern Ireland]]. The Corporation owns [[Old Spitalfields Market]] and [[Billingsgate Fish Market]], in the neighbouring [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]]. It owns and helps fund the [[Old Bailey]], the Central Criminal Court for [[England and Wales]], as a gift to the nation, having begun as the City and Middlesex Sessions.

The City has its own independent police force, the [[City of London Police]]—the Common Council (the main body of the Corporation) is the [[police authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/13/contents/enacted/data.htm |title=Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of Greater London is policed by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], based at [[Scotland Yard|New Scotland Yard]].

The City has one hospital, [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], also known as 'Barts'. Founded in 1123, it is located at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], and is undergoing a long-awaited regeneration after doubts as to its continuing use during the 1990s.

The City is the third largest UK patron of the arts. It oversees the [[Barbican Centre]] and subsidises several important performing arts companies.

The London Port Health Authority, which is the responsibility of the Corporation, is responsible for all port health functions on the [[Port of London|tidal part of the Thames]], including various seaports and [[London City Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/port-health-and-animal-health/port-health/Pages/default.aspx|title=London Port Health Authority|publisher=|access-date=16 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416211509/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/port-health-and-animal-health/port-health/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=16 April 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corporation oversees the running of the [[Bridge House Trust]], which maintains [[London Bridge]], [[Blackfriars Bridge]], [[Southwark Bridge]], [[Tower Bridge]] and the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]].

=== The boundary of the City ===
[[File:City of London Sign - geograph.org.uk - 1304788.jpg|thumb|200px|City of London welcome sign]]
The size of the City was constrained by a defensive perimeter wall, known as [[London Wall]], which was built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the late 2nd century to protect their strategic port city. However the boundaries of the City of London no longer coincide with the old city wall, as the City expanded its jurisdiction slightly over time. During the [[medieval]] era, the City's jurisdiction expanded westwards, crossing the historic western border of the original settlement—the [[River Fleet]]—along [[Fleet Street]] to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. The City also took in the other "City bars" which were situated just beyond the old walled area, such as at Holborn, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. These were the important entrances to the City and their control was vital in maintaining the City's special privileges over certain trades.
[[File:Temple-bar-griffin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Dragon statue on the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] monument, which marks the boundary between the City of London and [[City of Westminster]].]]

Most of the wall has disappeared, but several sections remain visible. A section near the [[Museum of London]] was revealed after the devastation of an air raid on 29 December 1940 at the height of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Other visible sections are at [[St Alphage London Wall|St Alphage]], and there are two sections near the [[Tower of London]]. The River Fleet was [[canal]]ised after the Great Fire of 1666 and then in stages was bricked up and has been since the 18th century one of London's "[[Subterranean rivers of London|lost rivers or streams]]", today underground as a [[storm drain]].

The boundary of the City was unchanged until minor boundary changes on 1 April 1994, when it expanded slightly to the west, north and east, taking small parcels of land from the London Boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The main purpose of these changes was to tidy up the boundary where it had been rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape. In this process the City also lost small parcels of land, though there was an overall net gain (the City grew from 1.05 to 1.12 square miles). Most notably, the changes placed the (then recently developed) [[Broadgate]] estate entirely in the City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620210431/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |archivedate=20 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Southwark]], to the south of the City on the other side of the [[River Thames|Thames]], was within the City between 1550 and 1899 as the ''Ward of [[Bridge Without]]'', a situation connected with the [[Guildable Manor]]. The City's administrative responsibility there had in practice disappeared by the mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] period as various aspects of metropolitan government were extended into the neighbouring areas. Today it is part of the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. The [[Tower of London]] has always been outside the City and comes under the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]].

=== Arms, motto and flag ===
{{Main|Coat of arms of the City of London}}
[[File:Arms of the City of London on an horse blanket 2011.jpg|thumb|City of London arms on a saddle blanket, as seen outside the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] during the [[Lord Mayor's Show]], 2011.]]
The Corporation of the City of London has a full [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] of armorial bearings consisting of a shield on which the arms are displayed, a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] displayed on a helm above the shield, [[supporters]] on either side and a motto displayed on a scroll beneath the arms.&lt;ref name=briggs&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first= Geoffrey |title=Civic and Corporate Heraldry: A Dictionary of Impersonal Arms of England, Wales and Northern Ireland |year=1971 |publisher=Heraldry Today |location=London |isbn=978-0-900455-21-6 |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bening&gt;{{cite book|last=Beningfield|first=Thomas James|title=London, 1900–1964: Armorial bearings and regalia of the London County Council, the Corporation of London and the Metropolitan Boroughs|year=1964|publisher=J Burrow &amp; Co Ltd|location=Cheltenham and London|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arms /&gt;

The [[coat of arms]] is "[[time immemorial|anciently recorded]]" at the [[College of Arms]]. The arms consist of a silver shield bearing a red cross with a red upright sword in the first quarter.

The [[Latin]] motto of the City is "''Domine dirige nos''", which translates as "''Lord, direct (guide) us''". It appears to have been adopted in the 17th century, as the earliest record of it is in 1633.&lt;ref name="arms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/65DC8039-12C4-4AC4-8DAD-16F1608E99B7/0/cityarms.PDF |title=The City Arms |publisher=Corporation of London Records Office |accessdate=17 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927154602/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/65DC8039-12C4-4AC4-8DAD-16F1608E99B7/0/cityarms.PDF |archivedate=27 September 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foxdavies&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox-Davies |first=A C |authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |title=The Book of Public Arms |edition=2 |year=1915 |publisher=T C &amp; E C Jack |location=London |pages=456–458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[banner of arms|banner of the arms]] (the design on the shield) is flown as a [[flag of the City of London|flag]].

== Geography ==
The City is England's [[List of ceremonial counties of England|smallest ceremonial county]] by area and population, and the fourth most densely populated. Of the [[Districts of England|326 English districts]], it is the second smallest [[List of English districts by population|by population]], after the [[Isles of Scilly]], and the smallest [[List of English districts by area|by area]]. It is also [[List of cities in the United Kingdom#England|the smallest English]] [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] by population (and in Britain, only two cities in Wales are smaller), and the [[List of smallest cities in the United Kingdom|smallest in the UK by area]].

The elevation of the City ranges from sea level at the Thames to {{convert|21.6|m|ft}} at the junction of High Holborn and Chancery Lane.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ordnance Survey]] data&lt;/ref&gt; Two small but notable hills are within the historic core, [[Ludgate Hill]] to the west and [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] to the east. Between them ran the [[Walbrook]], one of the many [[Subterranean rivers of London|"lost" rivers or streams of London]] (another is the [[River Fleet|Fleet]]).

=== Boundary ===
[[File:City of London map 01.svg|thumb|right|Borders of the City of London, showing surrounding [[London borough]]s and the pre-1994 boundary (where changed) in red. The area covered by the [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple]] is marked.]]
[http://www.mapping.cityoflondon.gov.uk/geocortex/mapping/?viewer=compass Official boundary map, with wards.]

Beginning in the west, where the City borders Westminster, the boundary crosses the [[Victoria Embankment]] from the Thames, passes to the west of [[Middle Temple]], then turns for a short distance along [[Strand, London|Strand]] and then north up [[Chancery Lane]], where it borders Camden. It turns east along [[Holborn]] to Holborn Circus, and then goes north east to [[Charterhouse Street]]. As it crosses [[Farringdon Road]] it becomes the boundary with Islington. It continues to [[Aldersgate]], goes north, and turns east into some back streets soon after Aldersgate becomes [[Goswell Road]], since 1994 embracing all of the Corporation's Golden Lane Estate. Here, at Baltic Street West, is the most northerly extent. The boundary includes all of the [[Barbican Estate]] and continues east along Ropemaker Street and its continuation on the other side of [[Moorgate]], becomes South Place. It goes north, reaching the border with Hackney, then east, north, east on back streets, with Worship Street forming a northern boundary, so as to include the [[Broadgate]] estate. The boundary then turns south at [[Norton Folgate]] and becomes the border with [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. It continues south into [[Bishopsgate]], and takes some backstreets to Middlesex Street ([[Petticoat Lane]]) where it continues south-east then south. It then turns south-west, crossing the [[Minories]] so as to exclude the [[Tower of London]], and then reaches the river. It then runs up the centre of the Thames, with the exception that [[Blackfriars Bridge]] falls within the City; the City controls [[London Bridge]] (as part of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward) but only half of the river underneath it, a feature which is unique in British local administration.

The boundaries are marked by black bollards bearing the City's emblem, and by [[dragon boundary mark]]s at major entrances, such as Holborn. A more substantial monument marks the boundary at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] on Fleet Street.

In some places the financial district extends slightly beyond the boundaries, notably to the north and east, into the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Islington, and informally these locations are seen as part of the "Square Mile". Since the 1990s the eastern fringe, extending into Hackney and Tower Hamlets, has increasingly been a focus for large office developments due to the availability of large sites compared to within the City.

=== Gardens and public art ===
{{See also|List of public art in the City of London}}
[[File:Finsbury Circus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Finsbury Circus]], the largest public open space, seen from [[Tower 42]]]]
The City has no sizeable parks within its boundary, but does have a network of a large number of gardens and small open spaces, many of them maintained by the Corporation. These range from formal gardens such as the one in [[Finsbury Circus]], containing a [[bowling green]] and [[bandstand]], to churchyards such as [[St Olave Hart Street]], to water features and artwork in courtyards and pedestrianised lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardensofthecityoflondon.co.uk |title=Gardens of the City of London |publisher=Gardens of the City of London |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardens include:

* Whittington Gardens, College Street

There are a number of private gardens and open spaces, often within courtyards of the larger commercial developments. Two of the largest are those of the [[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]] Inns of Court, in the far southwest.

The Thames and its riverside walks are increasingly being valued as open space and in recent years efforts have been made to increase the ability for pedestrians to access and walk along the river.

=== Climate ===
The nearest weather station has historically been the London Weather Centre at [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]]/ [[Holborn]], although observations ceased in 2010. Now St. James Park provides the nearest official readings.

The City has an [[Maritime Climate|oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] "Cfb") modified by the [[Urban Heat Island]] in the centre of London. This generally causes higher night-time minima than outlying areas. For example, the August mean minimum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[YR.NO]] |url=http://www.yr.no/place/United_Kingdom/England/Old_Bailey/statistics.html |title=Aug Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; of {{convert|14.7|C|F}} compares to a figure of {{convert|13.3|C|F}} for Greenwich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[MetOffice]] |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/greenwich.html |title=Aug Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heathrow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[MetOffice]] |url=http://www.yr.no/place/United_Kingdom/England/Heathrow/statistics.html |title=Aug Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas is {{convert|11.6|C|F}} at Wisley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[MetOffice]] |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/wisley.html |title=Aug Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the middle of several square miles of [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. All figures refer to the observation period 1971–2000.

Accordingly, the weather station holds the record for the UK's warmest overnight minimum temperature, {{convert|24.0|C|F}}, recorded on 4 August 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo |url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/LONDON_WEA_CENTER/04-08-1990/37780.htm |title=Aug 1990 Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum is {{convert|37.6|C|F}}, set on 10 August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo |url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/London_Weather_Centre/10-08-2003/37790.htm |title=Aug 2003 Max}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absolute minimum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo |url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/LONDON_WEA_CENTER/12-01-1987/37780.htm |title=Jan 1987 Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the weather station is a mere {{convert|−8.2|C|F}}, compared to readings around {{convert|−15.0|C|F}} towards the edges of London. Unusually, this temperature was during a windy and snowy cold spell (mid-January 1987), rather than a cold clear night—cold air drainage is arrested due to the vast urban area surrounding the city.

The station holds the record for the highest British mean monthly temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo|url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/London_Weather_Centre/07-2006/37790.htm |title=Jul 2006 Mean}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|24.5|C|F}} (mean maximum {{convert|29.2|C|F}}, mean minimum {{convert|19.7|C|F}} during July 2006).

=== Police and security ===
[[File:City of London Police Mitsubishi.jpg|thumb|200px|A City of London Police vehicle on [[Blackfriars Bridge]]]]
The City is a [[police area]] and has its own [[territorial police force|police force]], the [[City of London Police]], separate from the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] covering the remainder of Greater London. The City Police have three police stations, at Snow Hill, [[Wood Street, London|Wood Street]] and [[Bishopsgate]], and an administrative headquarters at Guildhall Yard East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/about-us/Pages/how-to-find-us.aspx|title=How to find us – City of London|website=www.cityoflondon.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force comprises 813 police officers, 85 [[Special Constables]] and 48 [[Police Community Support Officer|PCSOs]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} It is the smallest territorial police force in [[England and Wales]], in both geographic area and the number of police officers.

Where the majority of British police forces have silver-coloured badges, those of the City of London Police are black and gold featuring the City crest. The force has unique red and white chequered cap bands and red and white striped duty arm bands on the sleeve of the tunics of constables and sergeants (red and white being the colours of the City), which in most other British police forces are black and white. City police sergeants and constables wear crested [[Custodian helmet|helmets]] whilst on foot patrol. These helmets do not feature either [[St Edward's Crown]] or the [[Brunswick Star]], which are used on most other police helmets in [[England and Wales]].

The City's position as the United Kingdom's financial centre and a critical part of the country's economy, contributing about 2.5% of the UK's [[gross national product]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/media_centre/keyfacts.htm |title=Key facts |publisher=Cityoflondon.gov.uk |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023000216/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/media_centre/keyfacts.htm |archivedate=23 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in it becoming a target for political violence. The [[Provisional IRA]] exploded several [[bomb]]s in the early 1990s, including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]].

The area is also spoken of as a possible target for [[al-Qaeda]]. For instance, when in May 2004 the BBC's ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme examined the preparedness of Britain's emergency services for a terrorist attack on the scale of [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], they simulated a chemical explosion on [[Bishopsgate]] in the east of the City.

The [[Ring of steel (London)|"Ring of Steel"]] is a particularly notable measure, established in the wake of the IRA bombings, that has been taken against terrorist threats.

=== Fire brigade ===
{{Main|London Fire Brigade}}
The City has fire risks in many historic buildings, including [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Old Bailey]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]], [[Smithfield Market]], the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and also in numerous high-rise buildings. There is one London Fire Brigade station in the City, at [[Dowgate]], with one [[Fire appliances in the United Kingdom|pumping appliance]].&lt;ref name="zlqtbi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/media/City_of_London.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005231358/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/media/City_of_London.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 October 2007 |title=London Fire Brigade – City of London Profile |publisher=London-fire.gov.uk |accessdate=30 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The City relies upon stations in the surrounding London boroughs to support it at some incidents. The first fire engine is in attendance in roughly five minutes on average, the second when required in a little over five and a half minutes.&lt;ref name="zlqtbi" /&gt; There were 1,814 incidents attended in the City in 2006/2007—the lowest in Greater London. No-one died in an event arising from a fire in the four years prior to 2007.&lt;ref name="zlqtbi" /&gt;

===Power===
There is [[power station]] located in [[Charterhouse Street]] that also provides heat to some of the surrounding buildings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/28/londons-hidden-gas-plant-which-could-heat-and-power-the-future|title=London's hidden gas plant which could heat and power the future|last=Vaughan|first=Adam|date=2017-07-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Office for National Statistics]] recorded the population in 2011 as 7,375;&lt;ref name="2010pop"&gt;{{English district population citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly higher than in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|last census]], 2001,&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00aa.asp|title=City of London Census 2001 profile|accessdate=23 October 2010|website=[[United Kingdom Census 2001|Census 2001]]|publisher=The [[Office for National Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and estimates the population as at mid-2016 to be 9,401. At the 2001 census the ethnic composition was 84.6% [[White people|White]], 6.8% [[British Asian|South Asian]], 2.6% [[Black British|Black]], 2.3% [[British Mixed-Race|Mixed]], 2.0% [[British Chinese|Chinese]] and 1.7% were listed as "[[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|other]]".&lt;ref name="census" /&gt; To the right is a table showing the change in population since 1801, based on [[Census in the United Kingdom|decadal censuses]]. The first half of the 19th century shows a population of between 120,000–140,000, decreasing dramatically from 1851 to 1991, with a small increase between 1991 and 2001. The only notable boundary change since the first census in 1801 occurred in 1994.

The City's full-time working residents have much higher gross weekly pay than in London and Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): £773.30 compared to £598.60 and £491.00 respectively.&lt;ref name="nomis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/report.aspx?town=city%20of%20london#tabrespop|title=Labour Market Profile: City of London|website=nomis|publisher=The [[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=24 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615052536/https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/report.aspx?town=city%20of%20london#tabrespop|archive-date=15 June 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large inequality of income between genders (£1,085.90 in men compared to £653.50 in women), though this can be explained by job type and length of employment respectively.&lt;ref name=nomis /&gt; The 2001 Census showed the City as a unique district amongst 376 districts surveyed in [[List of English districts|England]] and [[Districts of Wales|Wales]].&lt;ref name=census /&gt; The City had the highest proportional population increase, one-person households, people with qualifications at degree level or higher and the highest indications of overcrowding.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; It recorded the lowest proportion of households with cars or vans, people who travel to work by car, married couple households and the lowest average household size: just 1.58 people.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; It also ranked highest within the Greater London area for the percentage of people with no religion and people who are employed.&lt;ref name=census /&gt;

== Economy ==
{{See also|Economy of London}}
[[File:Banco de Inglaterra, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 141.JPG|thumb|The [[Bank of England]], on [[Threadneedle Street]], is the central bank of the United Kingdom.]]
The City vies with [[New York City]]'s [[Lower Manhattan|Downtown Manhattan]] as the [[financial centre|financial capital]] of the world; many banking and insurance institutions have their headquarters there. The [[London Stock Exchange]] ([[Stock|shares]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]), [[Lloyd's of London]] (insurance) and the [[Bank of England]] are all based in the City. Over 500 banks have offices in the City, and the City is an established leader in trading in [[Eurobond]]s, [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], energy [[Futures contract|futures]] and global insurance. The [[Alternative Investment Market]], a market for trades in [[Stock|equities]] of smaller firms, is a recent development. In 2009, the City of London accounted for 2.4% of UK GDP.&lt;ref name=citylondon /&gt;

London is the world's greatest [[foreign exchange market]], with much of the trade conducted in the City of London. Of the $3.98&amp;nbsp;trillion daily global turnover, as measured in 2009, trading in London accounted for around $1.85&amp;nbsp;trillion, or 46.7% of the total.&lt;ref name=citylondon /&gt; The [[pound sterling]], the currency of the United Kingdom, is globally the fourth most traded currency and the third most held [[reserve currency]].

Since 1991 [[Canary Wharf]], a few miles east of the City in Tower Hamlets, has become another centre for London's financial services industry which houses many banks and other institutions formerly located in the Square Mile. Although growth has continued in both locations, and there have been relocations in both directions, the Corporation has come to realise that its planning policies may have been causing financial firms to choose Canary Wharf as a location.

=== Headquarters ===
[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|[[Paternoster Square]], since 2004 the home of the [[London Stock Exchange]]]]
Many major global companies have their headquarters in the City, including [[Aviva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviva.com/about-us/contact-us/|title=Contact us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Aviva}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BT Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/contactbt/index.cfm|title=Contact BT|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=BT Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lloyds Banking Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310191913/http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 March 2009|title=Company Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Lloyds Banking Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Mutual]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmutual.com/ir/contacts.jsp|title=Investor Relations Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Old Mutual}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prudential plc|Prudential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106183040/http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 January 2006|title=Contact|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Prudential}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schroders plc|Schroders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schroders.com/en/contact-us/worldwide-locations/uk/|title=Contact us|accessdate=3 November 2016|publisher=Schroders}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard Chartered Bank|Standard Chartered]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standardchartered.com/uk/contact-us/en/|title=Contact Us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Standard Chartered}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Unilever PLC|Unilever]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx Unilever registered offices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830072007/http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx |date=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the world's largest law firms are headquartered in the City, including four of the "[[Magic Circle (law firms)|Magic Circle]]" law firms ([[Allen &amp; Overy]], [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]], [[Linklaters]] and [[Slaughter &amp; May]]), as well as other firms such as [[DLA Piper]], [[Eversheds Sutherland]], [[Herbert Smith Freehills]] and [[Hogan Lovells]].

=== Other sectors ===
[[File:Barbican Centre City of London.jpg|thumb|right|Barbican Centre]]
Whilst the financial sector, and related businesses and institutions, continue to dominate, the economy is not limited to that sector. The legal profession has a strong presence, especially in the west and north (i.e., towards the [[Inns of Court]]). Retail businesses were once important, but have gradually moved to the [[West End of London]], though it is now Corporation policy to encourage retailing in some locations, for example at [[Cheapside]] near St Paul's. The City has a number of visitor attractions, mainly based on its historic heritage as well as the [[Barbican Centre]] and adjacent [[Museum of London]], though tourism is not at present a major contributor to the City's economy or character. The City has many pubs, bars and restaurants, and the "night-time" economy does feature in the [[Bishopsgate]] area, towards [[Shoreditch]]. The meat market [[Smithfield Market|at Smithfield]], wholly within the City, continues to be one of London's main markets (the only one remaining in central London) and the country's largest [[butcher|meat market]]. In the east is [[Leadenhall Market]], a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.

=== Retail and residential ===
The trend for purely office development is beginning to reverse as the Corporation encourages residential use, albeit with development occurring when it arises on windfall sites. The City has a target of 90 additional dwellings per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm City of London Corporation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512135507/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm |date=12 May 2010 }} Core Strategy&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the extra accommodation is in small pre-[[World War II]] [[listed building]]s, which are not suitable for occupation by the large companies which now provide much of the City's employment. Recent residential developments include "the Heron", a high-rise residential building on the Milton Court site adjacent to the Barbican, and the [[Heron Tower#Heron Plaza|Heron Plaza]] development on Bishopsgate is also expected to include residential parts.

Since the 1990s, the City has diversified away from near exclusive office use in other ways. For example, several hotels and the first [[department store]] opened in the 2000s. A shopping centre was more recently opened at [[One New Change]], [[Cheapside]] (near St Paul's Cathedral) in October 2010, which is open seven days a week. However, large sections remain quiet at weekends, especially in the eastern section, and it is quite common to find shops, [[Public house|pubs]] and cafes closed on these days.

== Landmarks ==

=== Historical buildings ===
Fire, bombing and post-[[World War II]] redevelopment has meant that the City, despite its history, has relatively few intact notable historic structures. They include the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]] ("the Monument"), [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Guildhall, London|the Guildhall]], the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], [[Dr. Johnson's House]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and a [[:Category:Churches in the City of London|great many churches]], many designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]], who also designed St Paul's. [[2 King's Bench Walk]] and [[Prince Henry's Room]] are notable historic survivors of heavy bombing of [[Temple, London|the Temple]] area, which has largely been rebuilt to its historic form. Another example of a bomb-damaged place having been restored is [[Staple Inn]] on Holborn. A few small sections of the Roman [[London Wall]] exist, for example near the Tower of London and in the Barbican area. Among the twentieth-century [[listed buildings]] are [[Bracken House, London|Bracken House]], the first post World War II buildings in the country to be given statutory protection, and the whole of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] and [[Golden Lane Estate]].

The [[Tower of London]] is not in the City, but is a notable visitor attraction which brings tourists to the southeast of the City. Other landmark buildings with historical significance include the [[Bank of England]], the [[Old Bailey]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], [[Leadenhall Market]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. Noteworthy contemporary buildings include a number of modern high-rise buildings (see section below) as well as the [[Lloyd's building]].

[[File:Royal Exchange Panorama.jpg|centre|thumb|upright=2.25|The Bank of England (left) and the Royal Exchange (centre) are two of the many significant buildings in the City of London.]]

=== Skyscrapers and tall buildings ===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings and structures in London}}

[[File:2016-02 City of London.jpg|thumb|The City skyline in February 2016, including [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (left), the [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (centre) and [[30 St Mary Axe]] (right)]]

;Completed

A growing number of tall buildings and skyscrapers are principally used by the financial sector. Almost all are situated in the eastern side around [[Bishopsgate]], [[Leadenhall Street]] and [[Fenchurch Street]], in the financial core of the City. In the north there is a smaller cluster comprising the [[Barbican Estate]]'s three tall residential towers and the commercial [[CityPoint]] tower. In 2007, the {{convert|100|m|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} tall [[Drapers' Gardens]] building was demolished and replaced by a shorter tower.

The City's buildings of more than {{convert|100|m|0|abbr=on}} in height are:

=== Rail ===
Seven of the eleven [[London Underground]] lines run through the City, serving eleven [[List of London Underground stations|stations]].

The [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR) has two [[List of Docklands Light Railway stations|stations]] within the City: [[Bank Underground station|Bank]] and [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]].

Three longer-distance rail termini are in the City: [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] (services primarily to Essex and East Anglia including [[Southend Airport]]), [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] (services to East London and South Essex) and [[Cannon Street station|Cannon Street]] (services to the South).

Moorgate is the terminus for suburban services from [[Hertfordshire]], and two through-routes operate mostly underground along the main axes:
*''North to South:'' [[City Thameslink railway station|City Thameslink]] (north) and [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]] (south) are both on the [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink line]] with trains running from [[Bedford]] to [[Brighton]], serving [[St Pancras International]] [[Eurostar]] terminus, [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Luton Airport|Luton]] airports.
*''East to West:'' [[Crossrail]] is under construction, but upon completion will serve [[Farringdon station|Farringdon]], [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]], and [[Liverpool Street station]]s.

The [[Northern line]] connects to two other main railway termini, [[London Euston station|Euston]]) and ([[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]])); the latter has a direct connection to the City via the [[Waterloo and City Line]].

The City is in [[Travelcard Zone 1]].

=== Road ===
[[File:Space taken vs numbers in City of London (transport).png|thumb|Space taken vs numbers in City of London (transport)&lt;ref&gt;http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/documents/s91800/Appendix+1+-+Traffic+in+the+City+2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The national [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], [[A10 road (England)|A10]] [[A3 road|A3]], [[A4 road (England)|A4]], and [[A40 road]] routes begin in the City. The City is in the [[London congestion charge]] zone, with the small exception on the eastern boundary of the sections of the A1210/A1211 that are part of the [[Inner Ring Road, London|inner ring road]]. The following bridges, listed west to east (downstream), cross the [[River Thames]]: [[Blackfriars Bridge]], [[Blackfriars Railway Bridge]], [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] (footbridge), [[Southwark Bridge]], [[Cannon Street Railway Bridge]] and [[London Bridge]]; [[Tower Bridge]] is not in the City. The City, like most of central London, is well [[Buses in London|served by buses]], including night buses. Two bus stations are in the City, at [[Aldgate bus station|Aldgate]] on the eastern boundary with Tower Hamlets, and at [[Liverpool Street bus station|Liverpool Street]] by the railway station. There are approximately 28 [[Barclays Cycle Hire]] docking stations in the City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110411092139/https://web.barclayscyclehire.tfl.gov.uk/maps Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme] map of docking station locations&lt;/ref&gt; A number of existing and proposed cycle routes criss-cross the City, as part of the [[London Cycle Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londoncyclenetwork.org.uk/uploaded_files/library/documents/A0_City_v7.pdf London Cycle Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902142354/http://www.londoncyclenetwork.org.uk/uploaded_files/library/documents/A0_City_v7.pdf |date=2 September 2011 }} City of London cycle map&lt;/ref&gt;

=== River ===
One [[London River Services]] pier is on the Thames in the City, [[Blackfriars Millennium Pier]], though the [[Tower Millennium Pier]] lies adjacent to the boundary near the Tower of London. One of the [[Port of London]]'s 25 [[safeguarded wharf|safeguarded wharves]], [[Walbrook Wharf]], is adjacent to Cannon Street station, and is used by the Corporation to transfer waste via the river. Swan Lane Pier, just upstream of London Bridge, is proposed to be replaced and upgraded for regular passenger services, planned to take place in 2012–2015. Before then, Tower Pier is to be extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/pdf/River_Thames_Pier_Plan_Diagram_9_1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615021648/http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/pdf/River_Thames_Pier_Plan_Diagram_9_1.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2011 |title=River Thames Pier Plan |publisher=Lda.gov.uk |accessdate=30 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a public riverside walk along the river bank, opened in stages over recent years. The only section not running along the river is a short stretch at [[Queenhithe]]. The walk along Walbrook Wharf is closed to pedestrians when waste is being transferred onto barges.

=== Travel to work (by residents) ===
According to a survey conducted in March 2011, the methods by which employed residents 16-74 get to work varied widely: 48.4% go on foot; 19.5% via light rail, (i.e. [[London Underground|the Underground]], [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]], etc.); 9.2% work mainly from home; 5.8% take the train; 5.6% travel by bus, minibus, or coach; and 5.3% go by bicycle; with just 3.4% commuting by car or van, as driver or passenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Census: QS701EW Method of travel to work, local authorities in England and Wales|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rft-qs701ew.xls|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=23 November 2013}} Percentages are of all residents aged 16–74 including those not in employment. Respondents could only pick one mode, specified as the journey's longest part by distance.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
[[File:KCLMaughanLibrary2.jpg|thumb|The [[Maughan Library]], [[King's College London]], located on [[Chancery Lane]]]]
The City has only one directly maintained primary school, Sir John Cass's Foundation Primary School at [[Aldgate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirjohncassprimary.org/|title=The homepage of Sir John Cass's Foundation Primary School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ages 4 to 11). It is a Voluntary-Aided (VA) [[Church of England]] school, maintained by the Education Service of the City of London.

City residents send their children to schools in neighbouring [[Local Education Authority|Local Education Authorities]], such as [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]].

The City controls three independent schools, [[City of London School]] (a boys' school) and [[City of London School for Girls]] in the City, and the [[City of London Freemen's School]] (co-educational day and boarding) in [[Ashtead]], Surrey. The City of London School for Girls has its own preparatory department for entrance at age seven. It is the principal sponsor of The [[City Academy, Hackney]], [[City of London Academy, Islington]], and [[City of London Academy, Southwark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/our_services/Education/schools/schools.htm#muscat_highlighter_first_match City Schools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905022232/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/our_services/Education/schools/schools.htm#muscat_highlighter_first_match |date=5 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City is home to the [[Cass Business School]], [[The London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance]], the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] and parts of three of the [[universities in London]]: the [[Maughan Library]] of [[King's College London]] on [[Chancery Lane]], the business school of [[London Metropolitan University]], and a campus of the [[University of Chicago Graduate School of Business]]. [[University of Law|The College of Law]] has its London campus in [[Moorgate]]. Part of [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]] is on the Barts hospital site at West Smithfield.

=== Public libraries ===
Libraries operated by the Corporation include three lending libraries; Barbican Library, Shoe Lane Library and Artizan Street Library and Community Centre. Membership is open to all – with one official proof of address required to join.

Guildhall Library, and City Business Library are also public reference libraries, specialising in the history of London and business reference resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Libraries/City_of_London_libraries/index.htm|title=City of London libraries|publisher=|access-date=14 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218012827/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Libraries/City_of_London_libraries/index.htm|archive-date=18 December 2008|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Author and journalist [[Nicholas Shaxson]] argued that, in return for the financial institutions  based in the City raising loans and finance for the British government, the City "has extracted privileges and freedoms from rules and laws to which the rest of Britain must submit". He further claims that the assistance provided to the institutions based within it, many of which help their rich clients with offshore tax arrangements, mean that the City is "a [[tax haven]] in its own right".&lt;ref name=Shaxson&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaxson|first=Nicholas|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2011/02/london-corporation-city|title=The tax haven in the heart of Britain |accessdate=13 January 2013|newspaper=New Statesman|date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary [[The Spider's Web: Britain's Second Empire]] asserts the tax haven status that the City provides.

'''Commercial aviation''' is the part of [[civil aviation]] (both [[general aviation]] and [[airline|scheduled airline services]]) that involves operating [[aircraft]] for hire to transport passengers or multiple loads of  [[cargo]].

==History==
===Origins===
{{globalize/us|section|date=December 2018}} 
The [[Air Commerce Act of 1926]] began to regularize commercial aviation by establishing standards, facilitation, and promotion. An Aeronautical Branch was established in the Department of Commerce with [[William P. MacCracken, Jr.]] as director. To promote commercial aviation, he told town fathers that "Communities without airports would be communities without airmail."

Writing for ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1929, he noted "Commercial aviation is the first industry inspired by hero-worship and built upon heros". He cited the promotion in South America by [[Herbert Dargue]] in early 1927.
After his trans-Atlantic flight, [[Charles Lindbergh]] made a tour of the 48 States paid for by the [[Guggenheim Foundation for the Promotion of Aeronautics]]. From that point commercial aviation took off:
:Roads were chocked on Sundays for weeks afterward, by motorists trying to get to [[Lambert Field]], Lindbergh’s home port in Saint Louis, to buy their first air hop. Hundreds of thousands of you went aloft for the first time that summer.”&lt;ref&gt;[[William P. MacCracken, Jr.]] (December 21, 1929) "Its Hard to get You Up", [[Collier's]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aeronautical Branch was charged with issuing [[commercial pilot license]]s, [[airworthiness certificate]]s, and with investigating [[air accident]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/about/history/milestones/media/The_First_Federal_Regulator_for_Aviation.pdf The First Federal Regulator for Aviation] from [[Federal Aviation Administration]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war aviation===

After World War II, commercial aviation grew rapidly, using mostly ex-military aircraft to transport people and cargo. The experience used in designing heavy bombers such as the [[B-29]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] could be used for designing heavy commercial aircraft. The [[DC-3]] also made for easier and longer commercial flights. The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British [[de Havilland Comet]]. By 1952, the British state airline BOAC had introduced the Comet into scheduled service. While a technical achievement, the plane suffered a series of highly public failures, as the shape of the windows led to cracks due to [[fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]]. The fatigue was caused by cycles of pressurization and depressurization of the cabin, and eventually led to catastrophic failure of the plane's fuselage. By the time the problems were overcome, other jet airliner designs had already taken to the skies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15404">[[File:1964, Portrait of Dad.jpg|thumb|'''D. Dudley Bloom''' just prior to Asia trip, early 1964]]
'''David Dudley Bloom''' (September 20, 1922 – August 20, 2015) was an American [[businessman]] who made notable contributions to the [[consumer products]] industry as a conceptual [[inventor]] and [[marketing]] [[Executive (management)|executive]] during the 1950s and 1960s, including proposing and designing the first conventional travel [[luggage]] built on wheels; [[marketing]] the first "magic milk bottle" for [[doll]]s; and designing and marketing a continuous-play [[tape recorder]]. 
==Early years==

Dudley Bloom was raised in [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], son of [[Lithuania]]n immigrants Harry and Cecile Gaffin Bloom. His father was vice-president and sales manager of [[Bloom Brothers Department Stores]] in Franklin County, Pennsylvania,&lt;ref&gt;''Chambersburg Public Opinion'', January 13, 1969, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, raised in [[New York City]], had been a bookkeeper for [[Macy's]] department stores there before her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''Chambersburg Public Opinion'', September 24, 1973, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom graduated from [[Dickinson College]] and [[Dickinson School of Law]] (now a division of [[Pennsylvania State University]]) in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]], and during [[World War II]] was reputedly the youngest commanding officer in the [[United States Navy]], having taken the helm of the supply ship [[USS Liberty (PY 278)]] in December 1944 during the [[Papua New Guinea|New Guinea]] campaign at the age of 22.&lt;ref&gt;''Chambersburg Public Opinion'', October 9, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Harrisburg Patriot'', August 1, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reality-based toys==

After clerking for Millard Ullman, a [[Waynesboro, Pennsylvania]], lawyer, Bloom moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], where he became assistant buyer of men's clothing at [[Lit Brothers]]'s flagship [[department store]] at 701 Market Street.&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Daily News Record'', January 6, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; While working at Lit's, he met his future wife, Nancy Blum, and the couple married in June 1953.&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Evening Bulletin'', May 2, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Inquirer'', July 5, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Harrisburg (PA) Patriot'', August 1, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom then joined the [[New York, New York|New York City]] [[market research]] firm of A. J. Wood, Inc. Immersion in the then-new field of computerized [[mass marketing]] research at the Wood company prepared Bloom in the spring of 1954 to become director of product research and promotion at the American Metals Specialties Corporation (AMSCO), a then-struggling [[toy]] manufacturer located in [[Hatboro, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;''EJots'', April 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick, Filis. ''Design and sell toys, games, &amp; crafts.'' Chilton Book Company, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

At AMSCO, Bloom expanded the company's line of [[reality]]-based toys that eschewed traditional military themes for boys and encouraged children of both genders to imitate constructive adult roles.&lt;ref&gt;''Doylestown Daily Intelligencer'', December 20, 1958, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; "If we teach our children war and crime," he was quoted by [[Newsday]] in 1959, "we haven't much of a future to look forward to."&lt;ref&gt;"New Toys Are Just Plain Fun," ''Newsday'', March 11, 1959, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The children and media violence yearbook.'' UNESCO International Clearinghouse on Children and Violence on the Screen at Nordicom, 1998-2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught the industry that children learn how to be consumers long before they earn money.

The incorporation of consumer products of the major manufacturers into Amsco reality-based play sets&lt;ref&gt;''Playthings'', May 1961, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; enabled children to imitate cooks with products manufactured by [[General Foods]], [[Procter and Gamble]], and [[Kellogg's]]; to feed dolls with [[Gerber Products Company|Gerber]]'s baby food and [[Pet, Inc.|Pet Milk]] from a "magic bottle" that disappeared as "Dollee" drank it; and to care for those dolls with real [[Johnson and Johnson]]'s baby [[shampoo]], [[baby oil]] and [[baby powder]]. Children played [[Physician|doctor]] and [[Registered nurse|nurse]] with toy [[stethoscopes]] and reflex hammers; [[playwright]], [[actor]], and [[stage director]] with magnetic [[puppet]] theaters; and astronaut with [[rockets]].&lt;ref&gt;''Newsday''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Juvenile Marketing'', September 1960, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, consumer product manufacturers were initiating [[reality]]-based campaigns of their own, such as [[General Foods]] for its AMSCO-manufactured [[Maxwell House]] Coffee Time Set, which was advertised on children's television programs concurrently with the company's "Tastes as Good as it Smells" television advertising campaign for adults,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|C_HN_3ulO9M|Maxwell House Coffee Time jingle}} Retrieved December 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; blurring the merchandising line between the toy industry and the food industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Playthings''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Richard. ''The story of American toys : from the puritans to the present.'' Abbeville Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Gary. ''Kids' stuff: the changing world of American childhood.'' Harvard University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Battersby, Gregory J. and Grimes, Charles W. ''The toy &amp; game inventor’s guide.'' Kent Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levey, Richard C., and Weingartner, Ronald O. ''The toy and game inventor’s handbook.'' Alpha, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom packaged virtually everything in see-through [[acetate]] rather than the cardboard [[paper]] to which much of the industry had previously been accustomed.&lt;ref&gt;''Juvenile Marketing''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, Jerry. ''Shelf space : modern package design, 1945-1965.'' Photography by Grant Kessler. Chronicle Books, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luggage on wheels==
{{ main | luggage on wheels }}

In between stints at AMSCO (1954–57 and 1959–62), Bloom worked in marketing and product management at Atlantic Products Corporation (now Atlantic Luggage Company of Elwood City, Pennsylvania) in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. Atlantic had been manufacturing the plaid hatboxes for Amsco's popular Betsy McCall Pretty Pac, a child-sized hatbox with an [[acetate]] insert that contained plastic miniatures of baby needs for dolls—one of the many "tie-ins" that resulted from cooperation between Amsco and other consumer product manufacturers. Atlantic offered Bloom, the Pretty Pac's product manager, the position of director of product development for its increasingly ubiquitous line of [[Scotland|Scotch]]-plaid travel luggage, an icon of the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] years.&lt;ref&gt;Interviews with D. Dudley Bloom since 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Bloom, who'd long suffered from [[back pain]], proposed that Atlantic manufacture travel luggage that could be pulled on wheels, rather than carried, through airports, bus terminals, and train stations, so he built a model—called in the trade a "mock-up"—of a suitcase attached to a platform with castors and a handle. The company's chairman scoffed at the idea, calling it "impractical". "Who'd want to buy luggage on wheels?" he asked. Although at [[Christmas]], 1949, [[Bloomingdale's]] had sold a novelty device that attached to ordinary luggage&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', December 8, 1949, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and camp trunks had been manufactured on wheels since at least the 1880s,&lt;ref&gt;Bloom since 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; no company had ever manufactured rolling travel luggage. A model of rolling luggage was finally developed by Bernard D. Sadow, president of United States Luggage Corporation (now Briggs &amp; Riley Travelware), after he had returned from a grueling business trip, and his company secured a patent for it on April 4, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Telephone conversation with Bernard Sadow, retired president and chairman of U. S. Luggage, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macarthur, Douglas. "Forty Years of Luggage on Wheels." Toronto: ''The Globe and Mail'', August 23, 2012. [http://m.theglobeandmail.com/life/travel/40-years-of-luggage-with-wheels/article1380732/?service=mobile] Retrieved December 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.briggs-riley.com/inventor-of-wheeled-luggage/ Briggs &amp; Riley Travelware website]&lt;/ref&gt; The potential of his invention untapped, Bloom soon left Atlantic to return to AMSCO. By the 1980s, virtually all luggage, including book bags for the world's billion schoolchildren, had wheels.&lt;ref&gt;''Showcase''. The Luggage and Leather Goods Manufacturers of America, 1975-present.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Market for leather accessories and travel ware : past performance, current trends, and strategies for the future : a business information report.''

Abrams, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The continuous-play tape recorder==

After Amsco changed ownership in 1962, Bloom left the company a second time. With the help of [[Asia]]n [[electrical engineering|engineers]], in early 1964 he began working on the design of a [[tape recorder]] that would play continuously—i.e., without rewinding—and founded International Audio Corporation in Philadelphia to [[marketing|market]] the device, mainly to [[department stores|department]] and [[specialty store]]s.

The recorder employed miniature [[reel-to-reel]] [[technology]] adapted from standard [[tape recorder]]s and used by small, portable [[dictation machine]]s since the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Recording History [http://www.recording-history.org] Retrieved December 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom foresaw utilizing the machine to [[broadcast]] marketing messages to passing shoppers, with or without a mechanical or laser triggering mechanism, presaging today's store [[public address system]]s, audio boxes linked to museum exhibits, and ultimately the audio [[cassette player]] introduced by [[Philips Electronics|Philips]] in Europe in August 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videointerchange.com/audio_history.htm Vintage Audio History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recording-history.org Recording History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he'd had no training in [[electrical engineering]], Bloom had spent time in [[Asia]], having participated in the liberation of Japan in [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Philippine Islands|Philippines]] during [[World War II]]. He returned there in April 1964 to discuss the tape recorder's design with [[Hong Kong]] [[engineer]]s and oversee its manufacture by the [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer Electronics Corporation]] in [[Kobe, Japan]]. But when the finished recorders were delivered that November, few of them worked. Pre-installed [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] had leaked [[acid]] into interior compartments of some of the recorders; others' tapes wouldn't record, their iron oxides having presumably been electrochemically altered during storage and shipping.

Other international [[electronics]] [[corporation]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recording-history.org Recording History]&lt;/ref&gt; soon manufactured continuous-loop devices of their own, some of these employing reels, others cassettes; some of them dictation machines, others tape recorders. By the 1970s the continuous-play-capable [[compact cassette|cassette]] tape recorder-player had become the predominant consumer [[Sound|audio]] [[technology]], displacing [[vinyl records]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Alfred D. ''Inventing the electronic century : the epic story of the consumer electronics and computer industry.'' Harvard University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom since 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residential real estate==

Bloom retired from the [[consumer products]] [[industry]] in 1965, and in 1966, after having earned the highest score ever recorded on the Pennsylvania real estate brokers exam, spent the rest of his active [[business]] career as a residential and commercial [[real estate]] broker, representing developments such as [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport/Lucaya]]&lt;ref&gt;Hannau, Hans W. ''Freeport/Lucaya, Grand Bahama Island.'' Doubleday, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Grand Bahama Island]] and [[Palm Coast, Florida]], in southeastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, and northern Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;McGoun, William E. ''Southeast Florida Pioneers: the Palm and Treasure Coasts''. Historical Society of Palm Beach County, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; built by the ITT Community Development Corporation (formerly [[Levitt &amp; Sons]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Duck Key Beachcomber'', August–September 1965, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Palm Beach Gazette'', February 1966, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Herbert J. ''The Levittowners''. Columbia University Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergsman, Steve. ''Growing Up Levittown: In a Time of Conformity, Controversy, and Crisis''. Dancing Traveler Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1970, he and his wife founded D. Dudley Bloom and Associates of [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania|Ardmore]] and, later, [[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania]], and for the remainder of his career, he marketed residential properties along Philadelphia's [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Mark E. ''The Hidden History of the Main Line: From Philadelphia to Malvern.'' The History Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Main Line Times'', Ardmore, Pennsylvania, around 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Palm Beach Gazette'', February 1966, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passing==

Bloom died in his sleep early in the morning of August 20, 2015, a month short of his 93rd birthday, at Bryn Mawr (PA) Terrace Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] and factors relating to [[diabetes mellitus]]. He was buried the following day with full military honors befitting a former commanding officer of the United States Navy at Roosevelt Memorial Cemetery, Trevose, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=D.

== History ==
[[Image:SyracuseSalinaHistoric.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Syracuse during its golden years. This photo is of South Salina Street around 1915.]]
Downtown Syracuse, as the rest of the city, grew as a result of the city's [[Salt industry in Syracuse, New York|salt industry]] and its location on the [[Erie Canal]].

For over a century, it was also the retail and entertainment center of [[Central New York]], with large department stores such as [[Chappell's]], The Addis Co., Flah's, E.W. Edwards, [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]'s, Grant's, Lincoln Stores, The Mohican, David's, Kresge's, Clark Music Co., Dey Brothers, and Sibley's. This attribute began to fade with development of large [[suburb]]an malls, with the final blow in 1992 when the combined Addis &amp; Dey's department store became the last major store to leave downtown.

===South Salina Street===
South Salina Street between Erie Boulevard and West Onondaga Street was the main north-south artery of Downtown [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and was among the busiest streets in the city.&lt;ref name="chartered"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yestercuse.com/salina.htm |title=Salina Street |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |first= |last= |publisher=Yestercuse, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718141213/http://www.yestercuse.com/salina.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area has seen a great deal of revitalization in recent years with projects such as the conversion of the historic Syracuse Trust Building into luxury condos, a project engineered by local developer [[Peter Muserlian]]. More development projects are planned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/07/centro_receives_millions_from.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cobblestone streets===
In 1835, the "nature of the soil and the flat surface of the ground" in the village rendered the construction of stone pavements necessary. An ordinance was passed authorizing the paving with [[cobblestone]] of Salina Street from Fayette to Church Streets and Genesee Street from the west line of [[Clinton Square]] to ''[[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Hanover Square]]''. Additionally, sections of Water, Warren and Franklin Streets were paved.&lt;ref name="cobblestone"&gt;{{cite news |title=Street Paving |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald]] |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]] January 16, 1881| accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paving of these streets also made it necessary to pave the public squares, or the work would be "incomplete." A sum of $4,500 was raised with general tax. During the same year, sidewalks of brick were ordered to be constructed along all paved streets and squares where they had not already been laid including Salina Street from Washington Street to Onondaga Avenue.&lt;ref name="cobblestone"/&gt;

===Armory Square===
{{Main|Armory Square}}

''Armory Square'' is a small neighborhood on the west side of Downtown [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. It began life as a busy commercial and industrial area just to the west of the central city. Named after the historic armory building that still inhabits the district's center, Armory Square is now home to luxury condos, restaurants, cafes, and high-end office space.

===Forman Park===
{{Main|Forman Park}}

''Forman Park'' was first established on June 16, 1839, and was known as ''Forman Square''. The main attraction is a bronze memorial of early civic leaders Joshua Forman and Lewis H. Redfield. The park is 1.3 acres and is located at East Genesee and Almond Streets.&lt;ref name="square"&gt;{{cite news |title=Forman Square |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald]] |location=Syracuse, New York |first= |last=|date=February 6, 1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinton Square===
[[Image:Syracuse 1909 clinton-square.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Clinton Square looking west in Syracuse, New York in 1909 with Erie Canal in forefront - Bastable Block in rear and old County Courthouse to right]]
{{Main|Clinton Square}}

''Clinton Square'' first came into existence in the early 19th century when roadways from north and south joined in downtown Syracuse. By the mid-19th century, the construction of [[Erie Canal]] further transformed the busy intersection into the center of commerce and trade in [[Central New York]].&lt;ref name="today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonsquare.com/ |title=Clinton Square |accessdate=November 25, 2010 |first=Steve |last=Johnson |publisher=ClintonSquare.com, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hanover-square 1900 veterans-park.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Veteran's Park in Syracuse, New York about 1900 - Later renamed Hanover Square]]

===Hanover Square===
{{Main|Hanover Square, Syracuse}}

''Hanover Square'' is actually a triangle at the intersection of Warren, Water, and East Genesee Streets. The name may also refer to the larger ''Hanover Square Historic District'', which includes seventeen historic buildings in the area that was the first commercial district in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="nrhptext"&gt;{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Dennis|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Hanover Square Historic District|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=6313 |date=December 1975 |accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public square was originally named ''Veteran's Park''. It was renamed to [[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Hanover Square]] after the ''Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument'' in [[Clinton Square]] was dedicated in 1910 and the function of commemorating [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse's]] war dead was shifted there. The larger [[Clinton Square]] had already developed as the city's center to the west, but following the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, commercial and retail activity spread along Genesee Street to [[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Hanover Square]].&lt;ref name="then"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syracusethenandnow.org/Dwntwn/HanoverSq/HanoverSquare.htm |title=Hanover Square |accessdate=December 5, 2010 |first= |last= |publisher=Syracuse Then and Now, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, downtown Syracuse is an economic center, with many insurance companies, banks, and law firms having a large presence there.

Since the late 1980s, downtown Syracuse has also increasingly become a [[nightlife (activity)|nightlife]] center, with many bars, clubs, restaurants, and pubs located in the ''[[Armory Square]]'' area.

Most of Syracuse's cultural festivals, such as [[Oktoberfest celebrations|Oktoberfest]] and Festa Italiana, also take place downtown.

The ''Downtown Committee of Syracuse'' has taken a great deal of effort to revitalize the area. Most sidewalks and streetlights have been restored since 1995, with maps and other information posted on many street corners.

All of downtown is lively on weekdays, but on nights and weekends most activity centers around the ''[[Armory Square]]'', ''[[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Hanover Square]]'', and ''[[Clinton Square, Syracuse|Clinton Square]]'' areas. With the reopening of the historic ''[[Marriott Syracuse Downtown]]'' in 2016, there are currently three hotels downtown.

===National Register of Historic Places===
The following are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and located in Downtown Syracuse: [[Amos Block]], [[Armory Square Historic District]], [[Central New York Telephone and Telegraph Building]], [[Central Technical High School]], [[Gere Bank Building]], [[Gridley Building]], [[Hanover Square (Syracuse)|Hanover Square Historic District]], [[Hotel Syracuse]], [[Landmark Theatre (Syracuse, New York)|Loew's State Theater]], [[Montgomery Street-Columbus Circle Historic District]], [[New York Central Railroad Passenger and Freight Station]], [[Niagara Hudson Building]], [[Onondaga County Savings Bank Building]], [[Onondaga County War Memorial]], [[Plymouth Congregational Church (Syracuse, New York)|Plymouth Congregational Church]], [[Saint Paul's Episcopal Cathedral (Syracuse, New York)|St. Paul's Cathedral and Parish House]], [[C.W.

== Recent years ==
In December 2005, [[Syracuse University]] announced it had purchased eleven buildings downtown, and leased another. Hundreds of faculty, staff, and students began using the buildings in the spring of 2006. Former [[Syracuse University]] chancellor [[Nancy Cantor]]'s motto for the venture was "Exploring the Soul of Syracuse." At the same time, the university and the city were working on a project called the "Connective Corridor," a special path from the university area to [[Armory Square]]. The main building of [[Syracuse University]] downtown is [[The Warehouse (Syracuse)|The Warehouse]].

[[File:DICCPP Logo.png|right|thumb|220px]]
'''Durban Industry Climate Change Partnership Project''' (DICCPP) is a project aimed at facilitating industry response to climate change in the [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality|eThekwini]] Municipality ([[Durban]]), [[South Africa]][http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/energy/climate]. The project is being implemented through a partnership between the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), the Durban Investment Promotion Agency (DIPA),&lt;ref name="DIPA"&gt;Durban Investment Promotion Agency, http://www.dipa.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt; the eThekwini Municipality and the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI).&lt;ref name="DCCI"&gt;Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry, http://www.durbanchamber.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the project is to sensitise industry in Durban to the risks and opportunities associated with [[climate change]] by creating a platform through which learning and communication between industry and government can take place.&lt;ref name="UNIDO"&gt;Unido South Africa, UNIDO Website, http://www.unido.org/index.php?id=1000128&lt;/ref&gt; The project aims to establish a sustained partnership between the various industries organisations in Durban and the eThekwini Municipality. The partnership is seen as fundamental to responding to climate change and effectively contributing towards climate change mitigation and adaptation within the Durban metropolitan area.&lt;ref name="Durban Portal"&gt;Climate Change, Durban Portal Website, http://durbanportal.net/ClimateChange/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core areas==
The partnership covers three core areas. These are: industry specific interventions; institutional support and; outreach.&lt;ref name="Durban Portal" /&gt; Specific actions within these core areas assist the partnership in fulfilling its assigned purpose.

===Industry specific interventions===
As part of the first core area, industry specific interventions, engagement with three main existing structures within Durban's industries is seen as critical to the success of the project. These existing industry structures or groupings are: the Durban Automotive Cluster; the Durban Chemical Cluster (DCC) and; the eThekwini Maritime and Logistics Cluster (EMLC).&lt;ref name="Durban Portal" /&gt;

These industries are brought together and a process of learning, through the conducting of a number of forums by the DICCPP is realised. These forums&lt;ref name="DAC"&gt;Durban Automotive Cluster Website, http://www.dbnautocluster.org.za/dac/index/news/id/41&lt;/ref&gt; designed specifically for the local industry cover issues such as [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) assessments (which include carbon footprint calculations, life cycle and supply chain analysis and emission target development); financial implications or opportunities (which include information on carbon taxes, the carbon market, funding streams and investment opportunities); new technologies in renewable energy; waste management and finally; climate change response strategies.,&lt;ref name="Durban Portal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DCC"&gt;Durban Chemical Cluster Website, http://www.durbanchemicalscluster.org.za/dcc/tmp/DCC%20Newsletter%20(November%202009).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional support===
The second core area of the DICCPP is providing an institutional support mechanism for actively driving and monitoring industry climate change response activities in Durban. In this regard, the DICCPP is working closely with the eThekwini Energy Office to develop a climate change mitigation competency in the municipal structure.&lt;ref name="Durban Energy Office"&gt;Durban Energy Office,  http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/energy/saving&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outreach===
The third core area of the DICCPP is called outreach and this is seen as an important part of the project in that it seeks to creates an awareness about climate change issues.&lt;ref name="Durban Portal" /&gt; A 'carbon footprint video' is being developed within the eThekwini communications department and serves to assist industry to quantify their [[carbon footprint]]. The DICCPP is also working with the Imagine Durban team running an Electricity Saving Competition within business in the city.&lt;ref name="Imagine Durban"&gt;Imagine Durban, http://www.imaginedurban.org/index.php/BusinessElectricity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
The project's ultimate strategy is to establish a forum for industry to meet regularly to discuss climate change mitigation and adaptation activities.&lt;ref name="UNIDO" /&gt; In doing so, this will facilitate investment and technology transfer between Durban and a similar project in China (also implemented by UNIDO).&lt;ref name="UNIDO" /&gt; Once this has been established, it is envisaged that regular meetings with the government and other stakeholders will take place.

The ''' Faculty of Management at the Warsaw University of Technology ''' (pl.: ''' Wydział Zarządzania Politechniki Warszawskiej ''', '''WZ''') is a business school in [[Warsaw]]. Its facilities are located on the southern side of the [[Warsaw University of Technology]] campus on ul. Narbutta 85.

== History ==

The Faculty of Management was established on 26 March 2008, by resolution of the Senate of Warsaw University of Technology (No. 296/XLVI/2008). The faculty was formed from the structure of the Institute of Organization of Production Systems, which operated within the Faculty of Production Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.pw.edu.pl/News/News/The-Faculty-of-Management-at-Warsaw-University-of-Technology The Faculty of Management at Warsaw University of Technology News], retrieved on 2009-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;   Operations of the new college structure began on 1 September 2008. However, the Faculty of Management can trace its origin back to 1922, when Warsaw Tech introduced management education as the first university in [[Poland]], and also one of the first in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wz.pw.edu.pl/s36/english-brief Brief description in English to the Wydział Zarządzania Politechniki Warszawskiej, 2008-10-15], retrieved on 2009-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hoyle Casino Empire''''' is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] developed and published by [[Sierra Entertainment]] on Windows computers, in which the player must run a casino and try to make profit, attract customers and get good ratings.

==Gameplay==
The goal of ''Hoyle Casino Empire'' is to create a thriving casino. There are two modes in the game; Empire Mode and Sandbox Mode. Empire Mode sends the player to one of eight casinos starting with a small one and working up to the biggest casino. In each casino the player will have specific objectives to meet in a limited time in order turn the casino into a successful place. Not meeting the objectives in time will end the game. Sandbox mode allows the player to build whatever casino desired without any objectives to follow or limited time. In this mode, the player is limited to one kind of casino, but can unlock more upon winning them from the Empire Mode.

The player starts in a specific kind of building with a limited amount of starting money, certain areas of space to build, and starting at a First Level Status. A Level Status determines what kind of casino games and services can be built in the casino. Increasing a Level Status requires a sum of cash, a number of customers in the casino and a number of good ratings. The Level Status can go as high as four. The number of customers can be increased by introducing more games and services and the good ratings can be increased by introducing variety, room decor, building extensions, cash donations, deluxe services and satisfying customers' general requirements.

General requirements for customers include cash desks (and ATMs) to withdraw money for gambling, bathrooms, eating establishments, drinking establishments and hotel accommodations. If those general requirements are not met, customers may decide to leave the casino and give bad reviews. Cash donations can only keep dissatisfied customers happy temporarily. Customers come in different classes, ranging from Tourists who carry little cash to VIPs who have lots of money. When building games and services in the casino, maintenance is needed to keep the casino running. Service men are needed to maintain the slot machines, custodians keep the casino and bathrooms clean, waitresses serve drinks and security guards keep unwanted offenders out.

Earning money legally is done by establishing sufficient services to the number of customers and accepting commercial stunt deals with agreements met. However money can be earned illegitimately by increasing the House Edge to Cheating Mode, accepting crooked deals such as money laundering. Such illegalities can lead to financial losses and degrading of ratings if found out by city authorities. While attempting to earn profit, the player must keep in mind the maintenance and employee wage expenses that present in the gameplay. If money goes below zero, then the player is in debt and cannot spend on anymore services or building until sufficient cash is earned.

An '''inclusion rider''' or '''equity rider''' is a provision in a actor's or [[filmmaker]]'s contract that provides for a certain level of [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] in casting and production staff. For example, the rider might require a certain proportion of actors or staff to be women, [[people of color]], [[LGBT]] people or people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/what-is-an-inclusion-rider-frances-mcdormand-oscars-2018|title=Woman behind 'inclusion rider' explains Frances McDormand's Oscar speech|last=Belam|first=Martin|last2=Levin|first2=Sam|date=5 March 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent actors or filmmakers may use their negotiating power to insist on such provisions. The term is derived from the "[[Rider (theater)|rider]]", a provision in the contract of performing actors to ensure certain aspects of a performance such as personal amenities or technical infrastructure.

'''International Financial Services, London''', usually shortened to just '''IFSL''', was a [[private-sector]] organisation which promoted British [[financial services]].  It was merged into a new promotional organisation, [[TheCityUK]], in 2010.  It was formerly known as '''British Invisibles'''.&lt;ref&gt;Litterick, David. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4480694/British-Invisibles-given-makeover.html  "British Invisibles given makeover,"] ''The Telegraph'' (London). 5 February 2001; Beder, Sharon. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=y8k7swjAYSAC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=ifsl&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=ifsl&amp;f=false ''Suiting Themselves :How Corporations Drive the Global Agenda,'' p. 138.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
British Invisibles itself originated in the '''Committee on Invisible Exports''', set up in April 1968 by the [[Bank of England]] and then became the '''British Invisible Exports Council'''. It was largely the idea of [[Cyril Kleinwort]] who realised that the government was paying much attention to the UK's balance of trade in goods, but little to the UK's [[Invisible balance|invisible earnings]] from services. In 1984 [[Patrick Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick]] had become Chairman of the organisation by which time invisible earnings were accounting for a third of the UK's earnings. He stayed until 1991. On 19 October 1990 the organisation (registered as a company) became '''British Invisibles'''. In January 1998 it merged with CEENET, a company set up by the Corporation of London to promote financial services to Eastern Europe, and re-branded itself as BI.  It acquired a new Chief Executive, Jeremy Seddon, and a new Deputy Chief Executive, Henrietta Royle.  Charlie Haswell joined the executive team, and later the Board, on secondment from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to develop links with British Embassies and High Commissions around the world.  The company was a membership organisation and focused on running promotional events abroad for its members (primarily in the emerging markets), undertaking research on the performance of the financial services industry and providing the secretariat for financial services lobbying in the WTO.  BI became known as IFSL on 1 February 2001. Invisibles historically have consisted of services (financial and legal), investment income and transfers. The organisation has in the past published ''The City Table'', giving the order of financial services companies.

With effect from 1 June 2010 IFSL, the independent organisation representing the UK financial services industry internationally, has merged its activities, staff and business membership into [[TheCityUK]], the new promotional body for the UK-based industry. TheCityUK is continuing IFSL's work of promoting the industry around the world, influencing trade policy and regulation, and publishing definitive research on the sector.

==Membership==
IFSL had a membership drawn from across the spectrum of the UK's financial and related business services, including trade and professional associations, exchanges, the [[Bank of England]], the [[City of London Corporation]] and leading international financial service companies that based in London. IFSL also worked closely with Government departments, including [[UK Trade &amp; Investment]], the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]], HM Treasury, and the [[Office for National Statistics]].

==Aims==
IFSL promoted the international activities of UK-based financial institutions, through business events in the UK and worldwide.  Through its Liberalisation of Trade In Services ([http://www.ifsl.org.uk/output/LOTISCommitte.aspx LOTIS]) Committee, IFSL brought together government and the industry in working for the removal of barriers to trade in financial services. It also promoted [[public-private partnership]]s (PPPs), which involve large quantities of private finance.

==Structure==
Its last chairman was [[Peter Keith Levene|Lord Levene of Portsoken]], and its last president was [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|HRH The Duke of Kent]].

'''James Leslie Perchard''' (born 1957 in [[Jersey]]) is a former politician who was elected as Senator in the [[States of Jersey]] in the [[Jersey general election, 2005|2005 election]].

Perchard was educated at Trinity Primary School, [[Trinity, Jersey|Trinity]] and [[De La Salle College, Jersey|De La Salle College]].
In 2005 he retired from his farming business before entering politics.
He is married to Susan and has three children James, Holly and Charles.

Before entering politics he held the positions of Chairman of the Jersey Young Farmers' Club, President of the Countrymen's Club, and Vice President of the Jersey Farmers' Union.

He served as Assistant Minister and Minister for Health and Social Services from 2008 - 2009.

In 2003, Perchard built a cricket field on his farm in St Martin. The Farmers Field is now the home to the Farmers Cricket Club &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmerscricketjersey.net|title=Farmers Cricket Club, Jersey|website=Farmerscricketjersey.net|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral history==
In October 2005 Perchard finished 6th of 15 candidates achieving 8,998 votes and was duly elected to the [[States of Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/jersey/my_island/election_2005/live/candidates/james_perchard.shtml |title=Jersey - About Jersey - James Perchard |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Assistant Minister for Health and Social Services before being elected Minister in December 2008. The Senator resigned in April 2009.

In August 2011, he announced he would not stand for re-election for "personal and business reasons." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-14634388 |title=Senator Jim Perchard to leave the States of Jersey |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent==
He stood for the States as an independent candidate, summarising his politics as follows:

"I believe in the freedom of the individual and the equality of opportunity. If elected I will promote and support low tax, small,
unobtrusive government that seeks to create a favourable business and social environment."

A '''legal person''' (in legal contexts often simply '''person''', less ambiguously '''legal entity''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/legal-entity/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/entity]&lt;/ref&gt; is any human or non-human entity, in other words, any human being, firm, or government agency that is recognized as having privileges and obligations, such as having the ability to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contracts between Legal Persons|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w16049|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=7 June 2013|author=Lewis A.

The term "legal person" is however ambiguous because it is also used in contradistinction to "natural person", i.e. as a synonym of terms used to refer only to non-human legal entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/juridical-person/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_person]&lt;/ref&gt;

So there are of two kinds of legal entities, human and non-human: [[natural person]]s (also called ''physical persons'') and [[juridical person]]s (also called ''juridic'', ''juristic'', ''artificial'', ''legal'', or ''fictitious persons'', {{lang-la|persona ficta}}), which are other entities (such as corporations) that are treated in law as if they were persons.&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deiser|first=George F.|title=The Juristic Person.

While human beings acquire legal [[personhood]]  [[birth certificate|when they are born]] (or even before in [[Personhood#Beginning_of_personhood|some]] jurisdictions), juridical persons do so when they are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in accordance with law.

Legal personhood is a prerequisite to [[legal capacity]], the ability of any legal person to amend (enter into, transfer, etc.) rights and [[Law of obligations|obligations]].

In [[international law]], consequently, legal personality is a prerequisite for an [[international organization]] to be able to sign [[international treaties]] in its own [[Legal name|name]].

== Juridical persons ==
{{Main article|Juridical person}}

'''Artificial personality''', '''juridical personality''', or '''juristic personality''' is the characteristic of a non-living [[entity]] regarded by law to have the status of [[personhood]].

A '''juridical''' or '''artificial''' person ({{lang-la|'''persona ficta'''}}; also juristic person) has a [[Legal name (business)|legal name]] and has certain rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability|liabilities]] in law, similar to those of a [[natural person]]. The concept of a juridical person is a fundamental [[legal fiction]]. It is pertinent to the [[philosophy of law]], as it is essential to laws affecting a corporation ([[Corporate law|corporations law]]).

Juridical personhood allows one or more natural persons (''universitas personarum'') to act as a single entity (body corporate) for legal purposes. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, artificial personality allows that entity to be considered under law separately from its individual members (for example in a company limited by shares, its [[shareholder]]s). They may [[Lawsuit|sue and be sued]], enter contracts, incur [[debt]], and own [[property]]. Entities with legal personality may also be subjected to certain legal obligations, such as the payment of taxes. An entity with legal personality may [[Limited liability|shield its members]] from [[legal liability|personal liability]].

In some [[common law jurisdictions]] a distinction is drawn between ''corporation aggregate'' (such as a company, which has a number of members) and a ''[[corporation sole]]'' (which is where a person's public office is deemed to have a separate personality from them as an individual). Both have separate legal personality.  Historically most corporations sole were ecclesiastical in nature (for example, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is a corporation sole), but a [[Corporation sole#Corporations sole in the United Kingdom|number of other public offices]] are now formed as corporations sole.

The concept of juridical personality is not absolute. "[[Piercing the corporate veil]]" refers to looking at the individual natural persons acting as [[Law of agency|agents]] involved in a [[corporate action|company action]] or decision; this may result in a legal decision in which the rights or duties of a corporation or [[public limited company]] are treated as the rights or liabilities of that corporation's members or [[Board of directors#Directors|director]]s.

The concept of a juridical person is now central to [[Western law]] in both [[common law|common-law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] countries, but it is also found in virtually every legal system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3313312 The Juristic Person. I], George F. Deiser, University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register, Vol. 57, No. 3, Volume 48 New Series. (Dec., 1908), pp. 131-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
Some examples of juridical persons include:

*[[Cooperative]]s (co-ops), business organization owned and [[Democracy|democratically]] operated by a group of individuals for their mutual benefit
*[[Corporation]]s are bodies corporate created by statute or charter. A [[corporation sole]] is a corporation constituted by a single member, in a particular capacity, and that person's successors in the same capacity, in order to give them some [[legal benefit]] or advantage, particularly that of perpetuity, which a natural person could not have had. Examples are a religious officiant in that capacity, or [[The Crown]] in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. A corporation aggregate is a corporation constituted by more than one member.
**[[Municipality|Municipal corporations]] (municipalities) are "creatures of [[statute]]". Other organizations may be created by statute as legal persons, including [[European economic interest grouping]]s (EEIGs).
*[[Voluntary association|Unincorporated associations]], that is aggregates of two or more persons, are treated as juridical persons in some jurisdictions but not others.
*[[Partnership]]s, an aggregate of two or more persons to carry on a business in common for profit and created by agreement. Traditionally, partnerships did not have continuing legal personality, but many jurisdictions now treat them as having an independent legal personality.
*[[Company|Companies]], a form of [[Companies law|business association]] that carries on an industrial enterprise, are often corporations, although companies may take other forms, such as [[trade union]]s, [[Unlimited company|unlimited companies]], [[Investment trust|trusts]], and [[Mutual fund|funds]]. [[Limited liability company|Limited liability companies]]—be they a [[private company limited by guarantee]], [[private company limited by shares]], or [[public limited company]]—are entities having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Different types have a complex variety of advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name=Complexity&gt;Frisch D. (2011). [http://www.georgemasonlawreview.org/doc/Frisch_18-2_2011.pdf Commercial Law's Complexity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203195016/http://www.georgemasonlawreview.org/doc/Frisch_18-2_2011.pdf |date=February 3, 2014 }}. ''George Mason Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sovereign state]]s are legal persons.
*In the [[international legal system]], various organizations possess legal personality. These include [[intergovernmental organizations]] (the United Nations, the [[Council of Europe]]) and some other [[international organization]]s (including the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], a [[religious order]]).
*The [[European Union]] (EU) has legal personality since the [[Lisbon Treaty]] entered into force on 1 December 2009. That the EU has legal personality is a prerequisite for [[Relationship between the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights#EU accession to ECHR|the EU to join the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)]]. However, in 2014, the EU decided not to be bound by the rulings of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Opinion 2/13 [2014], nyr [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?doclang=EN&amp;text=&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;part=1&amp;mode=DOC&amp;docid=160882&amp;occ=first&amp;dir=&amp;cid=240894]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Also, in March 2017, the [[Uttarakhand High Court|High Court of Uttarakhand]] declared the [[Ganges|Ganges River]] a  legal "person" in a move that according to one newspaper, "could help in efforts to clean the pollution-choked rivers". As of 6 April 2017, the ruling has been commented on in [[India]]n newspapers to be hard to enforce, with assertions that experts{{who|date=July 2017}} do not anticipate immediate benefits, that the ruling is "hardly game changing", that experts{{who|date=July 2017}} believe "any follow-up action is unlikely", and that the "judgment is deficient to the extent it acted without hearing others (in states outside [[Uttarakhand]]) who have stakes in the matter".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Not all organizations have legal personality. For example, the board of directors of a corporation, legislature, or governmental agency typically are not legal persons in that they have no ability to exercise legal rights independent of the corporation or political body which they are a part of.

== History ==
The concept of legal personhood for organizations of people is at least as old as [[Ancient Rome]]: a variety of  [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegial institutions]] enjoyed the benefit under [[Roman law]].

The doctrine has been attributed to [[Pope Innocent IV]], who seems at least to have helped spread the idea of ''persona ficta'' as it is called in Latin. In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], the doctrine of ''persona ficta'' allowed monasteries to have a legal existence that was apart from the monks, simplifying the difficulty in balancing the need for such groups to have infrastructure though the monks took vows of personal poverty.  Another effect of this was that as a fictional person, a monastery could not be held guilty of [[delict]] due to not having a soul, helping to protect the organization from non-contractual obligations to surrounding communities.  This effectively moved such liability to individuals acting within the organization while protecting the structure itself, since individuals were considered to have a soul and therefore capable of being guilty of negligence and excommunicated.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, “The Historic Background of Corporate Legal Personality,” Yale Law Journal, Vol. XXXV, April 1926, pages 655-673&lt;/ref&gt;

In the common law tradition, only a person could sue or be sued. This was not a problem in the era before the [[Industrial Revolution]], when the typical business venture was either a [[sole proprietorship]] or [[partnership]]—the owners were simply liable for the debts of the business. A feature of the corporation, however, is that the owners/shareholders enjoyed [[limited liability]]—the owners were ''not'' liable for the debts of the company. Thus, when a corporation breached a contract or broke a law, there was no remedy, because limited liability protected the owners and the corporation wasn't a legal person subject to the law. There was no accountability for corporate wrongdoing.

To resolve the issue, the legal personality of a corporation was established to include five legal rights—the right to a common treasury or chest (including the right to own property), the right to a corporate seal (i.e., the right to make and sign contracts), the right to sue and be sued (to enforce contracts), the right to hire agents (employees) and the right to make by-laws (self-governance).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/892043129|title=Textbook on legal methods, legal systems and research|last=Kanti.|first=Saha, Tushar|isbn=9788175348936|oclc=892043129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, legal personhood has been further construed to make it a citizen, resident, or domiciliary of a state (usually for purposes of [[personal jurisdiction]]). In ''Louisville, C. &amp; C.R. Co. v. Letson'', 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), the U.S. Supreme Court held that for the purposes of the case at hand, a corporation is "capable of being treated as a citizen of [the State which created it], as much as a natural person." Ten years later, they reaffirmed the result of Letson, though on the somewhat different theory that "those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it," should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation's State of incorporation. Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314, 329, 14 L.Ed. 953 (1854). These concepts have been codified by statute, as U.S. jurisdictional statutes specifically address the domicile of corporations.

== Sample cases using the doctrine ==
* In ''U.S. v. The Cooper Corp.'', (1941) the court held that the United States government, as a juristic person, could sue under the [[Sherman Act]]. Section 7 of the act granted the right to sue only to persons. The corporate defendant, which was accused of illegally conspiring and colluding to raise prices on [[tire]]s, argued that the U.S. government didn't have power to enforce the act because the government wasn't a person. The court held that the term "person" includes the U.S. Government, and allowed the action against the collusive corporations to continue.
* In ''Cook County v. U.S. ex rel Chandler'', (2003) the County was accused of violating a law which forbids "any person" from falsely obtaining research funds from the government. The county received a $5 million grant, but used it to conduct inappropriate tests on human subjects. The county argued that it could not be held liable because it was not a person. The court held that the county could be sued under the law as a legal person.
* In ''Rowland v. California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council'', (1993) the court declined to extend certain rights to legal persons. The association of prisoners sought to proceed ''[[in forma pauperis]].'' The court held that the right to sue ''in forma pauperis'' existed only for natural persons, not legal persons.

== Extension of basic rights to legal persons ==

=== Brazil ===
The term juridical person ("pessoa jurídica" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is used in [[legal science]] for designating an entity with rights and liabilities which also has legal personality. Its regulations are largely based on Brazil's Civil Code, where it is distinctly recognized and defined, among other normative documents.

[[Brazilian law]] recognizes any association or abstract entity as a juridical person, but a registry is required through a Constitutional Document, with specifications depending on the category of Juridical Person and local law of state and city.

=== Germany ===
Article 19(3) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]] sets forth: "Fundamental rights shall also apply to domestic artificial persons insofar as the nature of such rights shall permit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/GG.htm#19|title=Basic Law. Art. 19 Abs. 3 GG|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
In Italy [[trade unions]] have legal personality, as stated in Article 39, Paragraph 4 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]]:

{{quote|Registered trade unions are legal persons. They may, through a unified representation that is proportional to their membership, enter into collective labour agreements that have a mandatory effect for all persons belonging to the categories referred to in the agreement. |source=The Italian Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== New Zealand ===
Section 28 of the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] provides: "... the provisions of this Bill of Rights apply, so far as practicable, for the benefit of all legal persons as well as for the benefit of all natural persons."

=== People's Republic of China ===
For a typical example of the concept of legal person in a civil law jurisdiction, under the [[General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China|General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China]], Chapter III, Article 36., "A legal person shall be an organization that has capacity for civil rights and capacity for civil conduct and independently enjoys civil rights and assumes civil obligations in accordance with the law."&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Dernelle. "DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS IN THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC OF CHINA." DePaul Business Law Journal, Spring/Summer 1994. (6 DePaul Bus. L.J. 331)&lt;/ref&gt; Note however that the term [[civil right]] means something altogether different in civil law jurisdictions than in common law jurisdictions.

=== United States ===
In part based on the principle that legal persons are simply organizations of natural persons, and in part based on the history of statutory interpretation of the word "person", the US Supreme Court has repeatedly held that certain constitutional rights protect legal persons ([[Corporate personhood|such as corporations]] and other organizations). ''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'' is sometimes cited for this finding because the court reporter's comments included a statement the Chief Justice made before oral arguments began, telling the attorneys during pre-trial that "the court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution]], which forbids a State to deny any person within its jurisdiction the [[equal protection]] of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does."

Later opinions interpreted these pre-argument comments as part of the legal decision.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=147&amp;invol=165 Noble v. Union River Logging]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, because of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], Congress may not make a law restricting the free speech of a corporation or a political action group or dictating the coverage of a local newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the [[Due Process Clause]], a state government may not take the property of a corporation without using due process of law and providing just compensation. These protections apply to all legal entities, not just corporations.

A prominent component of relevant case law is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', which ruled unconstitutional certain restrictions on corporate campaign spending during elections.&lt;ref&gt;http://origin.www.supremecourt.gov/docket/08-205.htm {{Dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==

In Act II, Scene 1 of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', Giuseppe Palmieri (who serves, jointly with his brother Marco, as King of Barataria) requests that he and his brother be also recognized individually so that they might each receive individual portions of food as they have "two independent appetites". He is, however, turned down by the Court (made up of fellow Gondolieri) because the joint rule "... is a legal person, and legal person are solemn things."

The [[International Transport Workers' Federation]] maintains a list of countries it considers to be [[flag of convenience]] in regard to [[ship registration]]. There are currently 35 registries on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itfseafarers.org/foc-registries.cfm |title=Current Registries Listed as FOCs |website=ITF Seafarers |publisher=International Transport Workers' Federation |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==
In developing the list, the ITF considers "ability and willingness of the flag state to enforce international minimum social standards on its vessels,"&lt;ref name="wafoc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itfseafarers.org/what_are_focs.cfm |title=What are Flags of Convenience? |author=International Transport Workers' Federation |authorlink=International Transport Workers' Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "degree of ratification and enforcement of ILO Conventions and Recommendations,"&lt;ref name="wafoc"/&gt; and "safety and environmental record."&lt;ref name="wafoc"/&gt; The following registries are on the ITF list (with figures sourced from the [[CIA World Factbook]]):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12338">The '''Lloyd–La Follette Act''' of 1912 began the process of protecting [[civil servants]] in the [[United States]] from unwarranted or abusive removal by codifying "just cause" standards previously embodied in presidential orders.  It defines "just causes" as those that would promote the "efficiency of the service."  August 24, 1912, § 6, {{USStat|37|555}}, {{USC|5|7511}}

The Act further states that "the right of employees... to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof, may not be interfered with or denied." {{USC|5|7211}}

== Legislative history ==

Under the leadership of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napfe.com/mg0701wc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050129201112/http://www.napfe.com/mg0701wc.htm |archivedate=2005-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Congress]] enacted the Act with the intention of conferring job protection rights on federal employees which they had not previously had.  Prior to the enactment of this language, there was no such statutory inhibition on the authority of the government to discharge a federal employee, and an employee could be discharged with or without cause for conduct which was not protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The act was passed after the [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (in 1902) and [[William Howard Taft|Taft]] (in 1909) administrations prohibited federal employees from communicating with Congress without authorization from their superiors. This language was later placed in the [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]] and codified in {{USC|5|7211}}. The purpose of this Act was to allow Congress to obtain uncensored, essential information from federal employees. Congress intended to allow the federal workers direct access to Congress in order to register complaints about conduct by their supervisors and to report corruption or incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&amp;report=sr167&amp;dbname=106&amp; DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT EMPLOYEES ACT OF 1999, Report of the COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS UNITED STATES SENATE, to accompany H.R. 858, TO AMEND CHAPTER 17 OF TITLE 11, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CODE, TO PROVIDE FOR PERSONNEL PROTECTION FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT EMPLOYEES]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Arnett v. Kennedy]]'', 416 U.S. 134 (1974),&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=416&amp;invol=134 FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the United States Supreme Court addressed questions about the Act.  It held that the Act's standard of employment protection, which describes as explicitly as is feasible in view of the wide variety of factual situations where employees' statements might justify dismissal for "cause" the conduct that is ground for removal, is not impermissibly vague or overbroad in regulating federal employees' speech.

One of the primary purposes of the Act was to protect those who criticize of superiors from official retribution. Senator La Follette gave the following example of an abuse sought to be cured by the bill

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cause for [the employee's] dismissal was that he gave publicity to the insanitary conditions existing in some part of the post-office building in Chicago where the clerks were required to perform their services.... [H]e furnished some facts to the press of Chicago, and the publication was made of the conditions. They were simply horrible.... The public health officers of Chicago, as soon as their attention was called to the conditions, condemned the situation as they found it; and yet this young man, one of the brightest fellows I have met, was removed from the service because, he had given publicity to these outrageous conditions. {{USCongRec|48|10731}} (1912).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Act was thus the first federal law enacted specifically to protect [[whistleblower]]s.

The history and scope of the Act was further described by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Bush v. Lucas]]'', 462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404 (1983).&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=462&amp;invol=367 findlaw.com], quoting directly from the decision&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Congressional attention to the problem of {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated removals was again prompted by the issuance of Executive Orders by Presidents Roosevelt and Taft that forbade federal employees to communicate directly with Congress without the permission of their supervisors....  These "gag orders," enforced by dismissal, were cited by several legislators as the reason for enacting the Lloyd–La Follette Act in 1912, {{USStat|37|555}}, § 6.FN20 That statute... explicitly guaranteed that the right of civil servants "to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to any committee or member thereof, shall not be denied or interfered with." FN22 As the House Report explained, this legislation was intended "to protect employees against oppression and in the right of free speech and the right to consult their representatives." FN23 In enacting the Lloyd–La Follette Act, Congress weighed the competing policy considerations and concluded that efficient management of government operations did not preclude the extension of free speech rights to government employees.FN24&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Footnote 20. See 48 Cong.Rec. 4513 (1912) (remarks of Rep. Gregg) ("[I]t is for the purpose of wiping out the existence of this despicable 'gag rule' that this provision is inserted. The rule is unjust, unfair, and against the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, which provides for the right of appeal and the right of free speech to all its citizens.") A number of the bill's proponents asserted that the gag rule violated the First Amendment rights of civil servants. See, e.g., id., at 4653 (remarks of Rep. Calder) (1912); id., at 4738 (remarks of Rep. Blackmon); id., at 5201 (remarks of Rep. Prouty); id., at 5223 (remarks of Rep. O'Shaunessy); id., at 5634 (remarks of Rep. Lloyd); id., at 5637-5638 (remarks of Rep. Wilson); id., at 10671 (remarks of Sen. Ashurst); id., at 10673 (remarks of Sen. Reed); id., at 10793 (remarks of Sen. Smith); id., at 10799 (remarks of Sen. La Follette).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|Footnote 22. This provision was accompanied by a more specific guarantee that membership in any independent association of postal employees seeking improvements in wages, hours, and working conditions, or the presentation to Congress of any grievance, "shall not constitute or be cause for reduction in rank or compensation or removal of such person or groups of persons from said service."

Footnote 23. H.R.Rep. No. 388, 62d Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1912).

Footnote 24. Members of the House, which originated § 6, suggested that it would improve the efficiency and morale of the civil service. "It will do away with the discontent and suspicion which now exists among the employees and will restore that confidence which is necessary to get the best results from the employees." 48 Cong.Rec. 4654 (1912) (remarks of Rep. Calder); see id., at 5635 (remarks of Rep. Lloyd).

The Senate Committee initially took a different position, urging in its report that the relevant language, see id., at 10732 (House version) be omitted entirely:

As to the last clause in section 6, it is the view of the committee that all citizens have a constitutional right as such to present their grievances to Congress or Members thereof. But governmental employees occupy a position relative to the Government different from that of ordinary citizens. Upon questions of interest to them as citizens, governmental employees have a [[right to petition]] Congress direct. A different rule should prevail with regard to their presentation of grievances connected with their relation to the Government as employees. In that respect good discipline and the efficiency of the service requires that they present their grievances through the proper administrative channels." S.Rep. No. 955, 62d Cong.2d Sess. 21 (1912).

As Sen. Bourne explained, "it was believed by the committee that to recognize the right of the individual employee to go over the head of his superior and go to Members of Congress on matters appertaining to his own particular grievances, or for his own selfish interest, would be detrimental to the service itself; that it would absolutely destroy the discipline necessary for good service." 48 Cong.Rec. 10676 (1912).

This view did not prevail. After extended discussion in floor debate concerning the right to organize and the right to present grievances to Congress, id., at 10671-10677, 10728-10733, 10792-10804, the committee offered and the Senate approved a compromise amendment to the House version, guaranteeing both rights at least in part, which was subsequently enacted into law. Id., at 10804; 37 Stat. 555.}}

==Subsequent legislation==

In 1997, the Justice Department argued that Congress does not have a constitutional right to obtain information from civil servants through unauthorized disclosures. Based on its analysis of disclosure laws and its stance on separation of powers, Justice argued that Congress cannot vest "in executive branch employees a right to provide classified information to members of Congress without official authorization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=13371&amp;printerfriendlyVers=1&amp; govexec.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Congress adopted an anti-gag rule.  The government-wide prohibition on the use of appropriated funds to pay the salary of any federal official who prohibits or prevents or threatens to prohibit or prevent a federal employee from contacting Congress first appeared in the [[Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act]], 1998, {{USPL|105|61}}, {{USStat|111|1318}}, (1997). In 1997, the Senate passed a prohibition that applied only to the Postal Service, while the House of Representatives passed a governmentwide prohibition. The conference report adopted the House version, and a government-wide prohibition has been included in every Treasury-Postal appropriations act since fiscal year 1998.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 105-284, at 50, 80 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

This provision has its antecedents in several older pieces of legislation, including the [[Treasury Department Appropriation Act of 1972]], the Lloyd–La Follette Act of 1912, and the [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/302911.htm gao.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Rep. [[John Conyers]] included the Lloyd–La Follette Act in a list of 26 laws that he contends President [[George W. Bush]] violated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzflash.com/articles/alerts/95+ buzzflash.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/judiciary_democrats/iraqrept2.html house.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lujiazui''' ({{zh|s=陆家嘴|t=陸家嘴|p=Lùjiāzuǐ}}, lit. meaning "Lu's mouth"), formerly known as '''Lokatse''' from its pronunciation in [[Shanghainese]], is a locality in [[Shanghai]], a peninsula formed by a bend in the [[Huangpu River]]. Since the early 1990s, Lujiazui has been developed specifically as a new financial district of [[Shanghai]]. The decision to earmark Lujiazui for this purpose reflects its location: it is located on the east side of the [[Huangpu River]] in [[Pudong]], and sits directly across the river from the old financial and business district of [[the Bund]].

Lujiazui is a national-level development zone designated by the government. In 2005, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] reaffirmed the positioning of the {{convert|31.78|km2|abbr=on|adj=on}} Lujiazui area as the only finance and trade zone among the 185 state-level development zones in mainland [[China]].

==Geography==
Lujiazui is located in the Pudong New District on the eastern bank of [[Huangpu River]]. It forms a peninsula on a bend of the Huangpu River, which turns from flowing north to flowing east. The importance of Lujiazui stems from the fact that it lies directly across the river from [[the Bund]], the old financial and business district of Shanghai, and just south of the confluence of the [[Suzhou Creek]] with the [[Huangpu River]]. Until the 1980s, Lujiazui was a relatively low-built area, featuring residential houses, warehouses, and factories. Following the allocation of Lujiazui as a special investment zone in 1992, the development of Lujiazui's skyline begun. This was largely driven by Chinese state owned enterprises investing and developing the property within the area, with the inaugural landmark, the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]], being completed in 1994.

==Economy==
Currently, there are more than 30 buildings over 25 stories high with commerce as their leading function, and over 504 domestic and foreign financial and insurance corporations located in Lujiazui.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knightfrank.com.cn Knight Frank China] Knight Frank China, Shanghai District Overview - Pudong&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of Lujiazui in the past 20 years has fueled tourism and business related travel to Shanghai. Pictures of the Lujiazui skyline dominate Shanghai tourism materials, and there are 5 five-star hotels in the area, providing approximately 2,443 rooms, and three more five-star hotels are expected in the area in the coming years, adding more than 1,200 luxury units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knightfrank.com Knight Frank China] Knight Frank China, Shanghai Annual Commercial Report 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
By water, Lujiazui is linked to the rest of central Shanghai by ferry services from two wharves, located at the northern and southern ends of the area respectively. At the southern end, the Dongchang Road ferry terminal provides river-crossing services across the Huangpu River to central and southern central Shanghai. The most popular ferry service for tourists connects Dongchang Road wharf with Jinling East wharf, located on [[the Bund]]. At the north end, the Xichang Inn wharf provides river-crossing services across the Huangpu River to northern central Shanghai. The former Lujiazui ferry wharf, once part of the most popular river crossing in Shanghai, was closed in 1999, with its wharf structure now used as a waterfront seating area.

By road, Lujiazui is connected to the rest of central Shanghai by the Yan'an East Road Tunnel, linking the southern end of [[the Bund]] with the centre of Lujiazui. Further away from the centre of Lujiazui, the Renmin Road Tunnel and Fuxing East Road Tunnel link southern Lujiazui with southern central Shanghai, while Xinjian Road Tunnel and Dalian Road Tunnel link northern Lujiazui with northern central Shanghai.

By metro, Lujiazui is served by [[Lujiazui (Shanghai Metro)|Lujiazui station]], which is on [[Shanghai Metro Line 2]].

Additionally, the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel is a tourist attraction consisting of slow-moving underground vehicles which move between the Bund and Lujiazui accompanied by light and sound effects in the tunnel.

==Controversy==
===Kidnapping===
On 25 May 2011, Jalil was bundled into a car at gunpoint outside the offices of Channel S in Clifford Road, Walthamstow, London at 1:30 am. He was then driven to an Indian restaurant in West London where he was hooded, bound, beaten, tortured and repeatedly demanded £250,000 ransom. Jalil was eventually released by one of the kidnappers, driven to the edge of London's A406 [[North Circular Road]] and given £30 to get a taxi. Jalil made his way home, called the police, and was taken to hospital for treatment for burns and internal injuries.&lt;ref name="guardian-series"&gt;{{cite news |last=Binns|first=Daniel|url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/9065452.WALTHAMSTOW__Bengali_media_mogul__kidnapped__outside_TV_studio/|title=WALTHAMSTOW: Bengali media mogul 'kidnapped' outside TV studio|work= |location=Walthamstow|publisher=''Guardian Series''|date=3 June 2011|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thisislocallondon"&gt;{{cite news |last=Binns|first=Daniel|url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/9065452.WALTHAMSTOW__Bengali_media_mogul__kidnapped__outside_TV_studio/|title=WALTHAMSTOW: Bengali media mogul 'kidnapped' outside TV studio|work= |location=Walthanstow|publisher=''This Is Local London''|date=3 June 2011|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eastlondonnews1"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.eastlondonnews.co.uk/horror-attack-on-media-mogul/|title=Mahi Jalil abducted and tortured by criminal gang|work= |location=London|publisher=''East London News''|date=27 May 2011|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="express2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jeory|first=Ted|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/295715/TV-boss-kidnapped-and-tortured-rival|title=TV boss 'kidnapped and tortured rival'|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Daily Express]]''|date=15 January 2012|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BTJFUK20081"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HJbO4_g0Fo|title=Channel S Founder Mahi Jalil abducted|work=[[Channel S]]|publisher=BTJFUK2008|date=15 June 2012|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jalil was on bail awaiting trial from the previous fraud when at the time he became involved in the next fraud.&lt;ref name="express3"/&gt; Between 2006 and 2010, he accepted at least £500,000 into bank accounts under his control and laundered some of the profits of a £3 million "crash-for-cash" scam, while knowing the money had been defrauded out of insurance companies. Jalil admitted to playing a background role behind Motor Alliance, an insurance company which made at least £1.17 million during the four-year scam.

'''New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.''' ('''NUMMI''') was an [[automobile]] [[manufacturing]] company in [[Fremont, California]], jointly owned by [[General Motors]] and [[Toyota]] that opened in 1984 and closed in 2010.

==Facility==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
The plant spans the equivalent of about 88 football fields, and is configured into a main building that does the final assembly of vehicles and five other facilities:
*Plastics facility fabricating bumpers, instrument panels, interior panels, and others;
*Stamping facility that fabricates all visible sheet metal parts;
*Welding facility that assembles all metallic parts into one rigid unit; and
*Two paint facilities, one for passenger vehicles and another for truck cabs.

==Employees==
In the initial 20 months of hiring, NUMMI hired 2,200 hourly workers—85% from the old GM-Fremont plant, among them the old union hierarchy. The union also played a role in selecting managers, except for 16 directly assigned by GM and about 30 Toyota managers and production coordinators from Japan, including the CEO, [[Tatsuo Toyoda]], part of the company's founding family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/1993/01/time-and-motion-regained |title=Time-and-Motion Regained |first=Paul |last=Adler |work=Harvard Business Review |location=US |date=January 1993 |access-date=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, the plant had 5,500 employees.&lt;ref name=sim2006&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2006/03/05/nummi-plant-a-model-for-ailing-car-industry/ |title=NUMMI plant a model for ailing car industry |last=Simmers |first=Tim |date=March 5, 2006 |website= |publisher=[[Contra Costa Times]] |access-date=November 5, 2017 |quote=5,500 employees.

Until the facility's closure in April 2010, 4,700 workers were employed.&lt;ref name="kvtu" /&gt; NUMMI employees were represented by [[United Auto Workers|The International, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America]] (UAW) Local 2244.&lt;ref name=sim2006/&gt;

==Models produced==
The first model NUMMI produced was the [[Chevrolet Nova]] (1984–1988).  This was followed by the [[Geo Prizm]] (1989–1997), the [[Chevrolet Prizm]] (1998–2002) and the [[Toyota Hilux#Fifth generation|Hilux]] (1991–1995, predecessor of the Tacoma), as well as the [[Toyota Voltz]], the Japanese [[right-hand drive]] version of the [[Pontiac Vibe]]. Both of the latter are based on the [[Toyota Matrix]].

Production of the [[Pontiac Vibe]] [[hatchback]] was discontinued in August 2009 as GM phased out the Pontiac brand [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008-2009|in the midst of a bailout]].&lt;ref name="GmDiscontinuation"&gt;{{cite web |title=General Motors Statement Regarding Discontinuation of Pontiac Vibe Production at NUMMI Facility |url= http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=30&amp;docid=55133 |accessdate=June 20, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Saturn (automobile)|Saturn]] and [[Hummer]], Pontiac joined [[Oldsmobile]] (which had been discontinued after 2004) among the four GM brands that are no longer in production.

Beginning in September 1986, the NUMMI plant produced the [[Toyota Corolla (E80)|Corolla]].&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nummi.com/timeline.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402121111/http://www.nummi.com/timeline.php |archivedate=April 2, 2010 |title=timeline |publisher=NUMMI |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1995, it began producing the [[Toyota Tacoma]] [[pickup truck]].&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; 

==History==

===Background===

The [[Fremont Assembly]] factory which NUMMI took over was built by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and operated by them from 1962 to 1982,&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; when the Fremont employees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autointell.com/nao_companies/general_motors/gm-manufacturing/gm-nummi/gmnummi.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030009/http://www.autointell.com/nao_companies/general_motors/gm-manufacturing/gm-nummi/gmnummi.htm |title=GM Nummi Plant |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |publisher= |accessdate=November 9, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; were "considered the worst workforce in the automobile industry in the United States", according to the [[United Auto Workers]].&lt;ref name="atc2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr561&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/561/transcript |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619060428/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/561/transcript |title=NUMMI 2015, Transcript |first=Ira |last=Glass |authorlink=Ira Glass |date=July 17, 2015 |archivedate=June 19, 2016 |deadurl=no |publisher= |accessdate=November 9, 2016 |quote=nobody in the GM plant would ever ask to help. They would come and yell at you because you got behind. I can't remember any time in my working life where anybody asked for my ideas to solve the problem. There's nobody to pull you out at General Motors, so you're going to let something go. Hundreds of misassembled cars. Never stop the line. .  One reason car execs were in denial was Detroit's insular culture. Yes, unions and management were always at each other's throats, and yes, GM and its suppliers had a destructive relationship that seemed to almost discourage quality. But everyone had settled into comfortable roles in this dysfunctional system and learned to live with it.  -it took about a decade and a half after NUMMI for change to even begin to take hold at GM. By the year 2000, GM finally started to see a generational transformation. |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Employees drank alcohol on the job, were frequently absent (enough so that the production line couldn't be started), and even committed petty acts of sabotage such as putting "Coke bottles inside the door panels, so they'd rattle and annoy the customer."&lt;ref name="atc2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"/&gt; GM was [[Departmentalization|departmentalized]] as per [[Henry Ford]]'s [[Division of labour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roos |first1=Daniel |last2=Womack |first2=James P. |last3=Jones |first3=Daniel T |title=The Machine That Changed the World : The Story of Lean Production |publisher=Harper Perennial |date=November 1991 |isbn=978-0060974176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/machine.pdf |title=ESD.83 Book Review of The Machine that Changed the World |first=Randy |last=Urbance |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without the necessary communication; management did not consider workers' view of production, and quantity was preferred over quality.&lt;ref name=npr561/&gt;

===Makeover===
The idea of reopening the plant emerged from the need that GM had to build high-quality and profitable small cars and the need Toyota had to start building cars in the United States, a requirement due to the possibility of import restrictions by the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="atc2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=The End Of The Line For GM-Toyota Joint Venture |url=http://ww.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=125229157 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |work=[[All Things Considered]] |first=Robert |last=Siegel |authorlink=Robert Siegel |date=March 26, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423033037/http://ww.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=125229157 |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Episode 403 - NUMMI |url= http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/403/nummi | publisher= [[This American Life]]| date=March 26, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to produce high quality at low cost, but supported by including workers in the process.&lt;ref name=a92-15&gt;Adler 1992, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of the Fremont plant and its workers was unusual because of the previous problems. In spite of the history and reputation, when NUMMI reopened the factory for production in 1984, 85% of the troublesome GM workforce was rehired,&lt;ref name=a92-12&gt;Adler 1992, page 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; with some sent to Japan to learn the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref name="atc2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr561/&gt; Workers who made the transition identified the emphasis on quality and teamwork by Toyota management as what motivated a change in work ethic.&lt;ref name="atc2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"/&gt; Among the cultural changes were the same uniform, parking and cafeterias for all levels of employment in order to promote the team concept,&lt;ref name=a92-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=a92-33/&gt; and a no-[[layoff]] policy.&lt;ref name=a92-16&gt;Adler 1992, page 16. Quote: "no lay-offs .. are absolutely crucial to our success. Team members know that when they contribute ideas for more effective operations they are not jeopardizing anyone's job. And that's fundamental, since they know more than any manager or industrial engineer about how to improve our efficiency and competitiveness."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autonomation|Built-in process quality]] and employee suggestion programs for [[continual improvement process|continual improvement]]&lt;ref name=a92-33&gt;Adler 1992, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; were other changes.&lt;ref name=a92-18&gt;Adler 1992, page 18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consensus decision-making]] reached management level, in contrast with the old [[departmentalization]].&lt;ref name=a92-20&gt;Adler 1992, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1984, the first car, a yellow [[Chevrolet Nova#Fifth generation (1985–1988)|Chevrolet Nova]] rolled off the assembly line. And almost right away, the NUMMI factory was producing cars at the same speed and with as few defects per 100 vehicles as those produced in Japan,&lt;ref name=a92-23&gt;Adler 1992, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atc2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"/&gt; with higher worker satisfaction.&lt;ref name=a92-24&gt;Adler 1992, page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 NUMMI operated at 58.6% capacity, and had not reached [[Break-even (economics)|break-even]] by 1991.&lt;ref name=a92-14&gt;Adler 1992, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the early success at Fremont, by 1998 (15 years later) GM had still not been able to implement [[lean manufacturing]] in the rest of the United States,&lt;ref name=npr561/&gt;&lt;ref name=hbr2009-09&gt;{{cite web|url= https://hbr.org/2009/09/nummi-what-toyota-learned  |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160811152723/https://hbr.org/2009/09/nummi-what-toyota-learned |title=Nummi: What Toyota Learned and GM Didn’t |first=Ben |last=Gomes-Casseres |date=September 1, 2009 |publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]] |accessdate= June 5, 2017 |archivedate= August 11, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; though GM managers trained at NUMMI were successful in introducing the approach to its unionized factories in Brazil.&lt;ref name="brazil98"&gt;{{cite news |title=G.M.'s Plant in Brazil Raises Fears Closer to Home |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/17/business/gm-s-plant-in-brazil-raises-fears-closer-to-home.html?pagewanted=all | publisher=The New York Times | date=June 17, 1998 |accessdate=April 7, 2010 | first=Keith | last=Bradsher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the challenges for the factory were higher costs.&lt;ref name=sim2006/&gt;

On June 29, 2009, General Motors announced that they would discontinue the joint venture with Toyota.&lt;ref name="LaTimesGmEnds"&gt;{{cite news

The announcement was made following GM CEO Fritz Henderson announcing in April that General Motors would discontinue the Pontiac Vibe production at NUMMI. The two automakers were in discussions but could not find a suitable product to be produced at the factory. “After extensive analysis, GM and Toyota could not reach an agreement on a future product plan that made sense for all parties,” GM North America President Troy Clarke said in a statement.
"Toyota’s hope was to continue the venture and we haven’t yet decided any plans at the factory,” said Hideaki Homma, Toyota's Tokyo-based spokesman. “While we respect this decision by GM, the economic and business environment surrounding Toyota is also extremely severe, and so this decision by GM makes the situation even more difficult for Toyota.” Before GM decided to sever its stake in the NUMMI joint venture, Toyota was considering offering a version of its [[Toyota Prius|Prius]] hybrid to GM that would be built at the factory and sold as a GM model but Toyota has indicated that it was seriously considering exiting the venture also.&lt;ref name="reuters20090710"&gt;{{cite news

In November 2009, Toyota's head of U.S. sales took calls from autoworkers, saying that though it has been a difficult decision to shut down the plant, "the economics of having a plant in California so far away from the supplier lines" in the Midwest "just doesn't make business sense" for Toyota to continue running the NUMMI plant.&lt;ref name="KGO20091117"&gt;{{cite web

=== December 2004 ===

December 17 - Bank of America, still being sued for a combined $18B by Parmalat and its investors, is named as one of Parmalat's creditors to the tune of $163M.  This means Bank of America can take part, as all creditors can, in a debt-for-equity swap under Parmalat's restructuring plan.  This makes Bank of America a shareholder in the company when it emerges from bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

January 25 - An Italian court bars Bank of America from claiming damages resulting from Parmalat's bankruptcy.  The bank may still file as a damaged civil party if a future trial occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== July 2005 ===

July 14 - The $8B class-action lawsuit brought in Manhattan federal court on behalf of Parmalat investors is dismissed.  Judge Lewis Kaplan's 74-page decision asserts that Bank of America did not know Parmalat was in financial trouble and thus could not profit off the company's downturn.  The judge did not dismiss claims included in the suit against [[Citigroup]], [[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro]] SpA, or [[Credit Suisse First Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== August 2005 ===

August 2 - Luca Sala is arrested by Italian authorities for his involvement in the bankruptcy when he was head of Bank of America's Italian corporate banking division and after he became a consultant at Parmalat in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;br/&gt;
August 9 - A U.S. judge rules Parmalat can proceed with its $10B suit against Bank of America on charges of aiding &amp; abetting break of fiduciary duty and looting of the company.  The suit was propelled forward despite Bank of America's protest that a company cannot be sued for fraud by the company perpetrating the fraud in question.  Judge Lewis Kaplan dismissed the protest because the precedent called into question was an application of New York law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;br/&gt;
August 18 - After 16 days, Luca Sala is released from pre-trial custody in Italy after it was determined that he could no longer tamper with evidence.  The current charges against him stem from $63.5M in siphoned funds from Parmalat to private accounts.  Sala denies stealing the money, instead claiming he earned some of it in commissions from insurance and private-placement contracts he handled for Parmalat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== November 2005 ===

November 28 - Three [[Cayman Islands]]-based companies sue Bank of America for its role in the collapse of Parmalat.  Charges include financial improprieties including fraud, negligent misrepresentation, &amp; breach of fiduciary duty.  The suit claims Bank of America generated millions of dollars in fees and interest when it orchestrated financial transactions designed to disguise Parmalat's insolvency.  The claim seeks nearly $1B from [[Bank of America]], [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]] &amp; [[Grant Thornton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== December 2005 ===

December 20 - Bank of America is granted the ability to join other plaintiffs in an Italian lawsuit against Parmalat.  This is possible due to the condition that Bank of America is entitled to treatment as a damaged party in any civil suit as set forth on 2005-01-25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== 2006 ==

=== February 2006 ===

February 10 - After amending the lawsuit brought by Parmalat investors against former auditors and banks of the bankrupt company, Judge Lewis Kaplan gives the OK for Bank of America to be sued for its role in helping Parmalat commit securities fraud.  The suit centers around a $300M loan made to Parmalat's Brazilian subsidiary and a 2001 change to an insurance policy for Parmalat Venezuela.  Bank of America states that it "believed it was dealing with a strong, honest, and profitable company and had no knowledge of the fraud perpetrated by Parmalat and its senior management".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== March 2006 ===

March 30 - Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York has ruled Bank of America may seek up to $1B in damages from Parmalat.  The ruling allows Bank of America to claim Parmalat committed fraud, misrepresentation, conspiracy, and other illegal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== March 2007 ===

March 26 - Some of the counterclaims brought by Bank of America against Parmalat, including racketeering and North Carolina deceptive-trade practices laws are dismissed by Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York federal district court.  "Bank of America’s counterclaims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, securities fraud, and civil conspiracy…will go forward, " stated Bank of America spokesman Timothy Gilles, "…and they are significantly more important than the secondary claims that were dismissed." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== June 2007 ===

June 22 - U.S. Federal Bankruptcy Court in New York grants a permanent injunction against claims by creditors, including Bank of America.  It came as a defeat for bondholders and their $868M in claims.  The injunction will not apply outside the U.S. or to any Parmalat affiliates or subsidiaries not restructuring under Italian bankruptcy law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== July 2007 ===

July 6 - An Italian judge ordered [[Bank of America]], [[Citigroup]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Deutsche Bank]], and [[UBS AG]] to stand trial in January 2008.  The specific charges against Bank of America are in connection with an Italian law through which a company can be charged for not having proper governance controls in place to prevent illegal actions by employees.  Specifically, Bank of America's accountability is held to its inability to prevent three former employees from market rigging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;br/&gt;
July 27 - A U.S. Federal bankruptcy judge in New York dismisses claims by foreign investors that the bank knew the Italian company was in financial dire straits and profited from that information.  This decision effectively limits the lawsuits to Parmalat investors who reside in the United States.  This verdict also is extensible to Citigroup Inc., Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Grant Thornton.  The $10B suit brought by former Parmalat CEO Enrico Bondi is still being disputed at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== August 2007 ===

August 10 - U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York dismisses suits against Bank of America, Credit Suisse, and Grant Thornton brought by two U.S. subsidiaries of Parmalat, Parmalat USA Corp and Farmland Dairies.  This extends the former ruling against Parmalat to include its domestic subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

August 12 - U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan subsequently dismisses the lawsuit brought against Bank of America by Parmalat investors.  Kaplan stated that a Supreme Court ruling earlier in the year "made plain that investors must show reliance upon a defendant’s own deceptive conduct before that defendant, otherwise a secondary actor, may be found primarily liable" and the suit failed to meet that standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== 2009 ==

=== January 2009 ===

January 13 - Bank of America is acquitted in an Italian court of all charges drawn from activities prior to April 2002.  There was not a law prior to this time which dictated the administrative responsibilities of a corporation. Charging Bank of America for actions (or lack thereof) prior to enactment of the law would thus be a case of ex post facto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== July 2009 ===

July 28 - Bank of America agrees to pay $100M to settle the original $10B lawsuit brought by Parmalat, its subsidiaries, and its investors.  The settlement contains both a cash and non-cash component.  Bank of America admitted no wrongdoing in settling the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Petr Kraus''' (born 10 November 1966) is a Czech entrepreneur, manager, and founder of Newton group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erudikon.cz/?p=lide_erudikonu-spravni_rada|title=Nadační fond Erudikon|first=solidpixels.|last=http://www.solidpixels.cz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1994, he and Antonín Koláček founded [[Newton Financial Management Group]], a company that focused on trading on the [[financial markets]] and related advisory services. In the 1990s, he took part in the restructuring and management of numerous industrial enterprises and [[financial institutions]], at home and abroad. The most important projects at the time included Všeobecný vzájemný penzijní fond ([[General Mutual Pension Fund]], today [[ING Pension Fund]]), the Otrokovice heat generation plant and the [[Newton Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patria.cz/zpravodajstvi/2456315/svycarsky-soud-exmanazeri-mostecke-uhelne-jsou-vinni-a-pujdou-za-mrize.html|title=Švýcarský soud: Exmanažeři Mostecké uhelné jsou vinni a půjdou za mříže|first=Patria Online,|last=a.s.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraus invested a significant amount of finances in educating and supporting university students. In 2003, he founded [[Newton College (Brno)|Newton College]]. In the framework of such efforts, he then initiated the establishment of the [[Erudikon Endowment Fund]] in 2005 to provide university access to those individuals whose life situation would otherwise make it impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erudikon.cz|title=Nadační fond Erudikon|first=solidpixels.|last=http://www.solidpixels.cz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MUS case ==
He ended close cooperation with [[mostecka uhelna spolecnost|MUS]] already in 2002; nevertheless, the Swiss courts found him guilty (verdict not final) from alleged money laundering. As a result of the Swiss charges and the re-opening of the MUS case by the Czech authorities in 2012, his current accounts were frozen and his assets, including the home in which he was living, were seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.e15.cz/domaci/udalosti/exmanazeri-mus-maji-v-cesku-obstaveny-majetek-za-800-milionu-936671|title=Exmanažeři MUS mají v Česku obstavený majetek za 800 milionů|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the very beginning of the investigation, Kraus has argued that he, like the rest of the sentenced entrepreneurs and managers, saved [[mostecka uhelna spolecnost|MUS]] and thus it was absurd to criminalise their efforts. Even with regard to the fact that MUS is, thanks to the then successful restructuring, a stable and important company employing thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/c1-60034470-mostecka-uhelna-svycarsko-soud|title=Kauza Mostecká uhelná, dějství druhé: Soud si předvolal absentéry Koláčka a Klimeckého|first=|last=ČTK|date=9 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, 20 October 2013, he proclaimed the following about MUS on the [[Czech Television]] programme [[Otázky Václava Moravce]] [Question Time with Václav Moravec]: "This is a dispute about the form that the transformation of the Czech economy took. It is a dispute that should not be relegated to the offices of prosecutors, but aired out in the public domain to allow discussion on whether the process should have taken place as it had."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/246882-kraus-mus-jsme-nevytunelovali-ale-zachranili/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591"> [[File:Kjerringøy.jpg|thumb|Privileged trader [[Erasmus Zahl]]'s trading center in [[Kjerringøy]]]]
A '''privileged trader''' ({{lang-no|nessekonge}}, literally 'peninsular king', also known as a ''væreiere'' 'community owner')&lt;ref&gt;Apostle, Richard A. et al. 1998. ''Community, State, and Market on the North Atlantic Rim: Challenges to Modernity in the Fisheries''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 32, 294.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term that was used for fish merchants or landowners that enjoyed special privileges along the coast of [[Northern Norway]] from the second half of the 1700s onward.&lt;ref&gt; [https://snl.no/nessekonge ''Store norske leksikon'': nessekonge.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Kennedy, John Charles. 2006. ''Island Voices: Fisheries and Community Survival in Northern Norway''. Delft: Eburon, p. 25. &lt;/ref&gt; The term ''nessekonge'' itself goes back centuries earlier, to the Viking era, referring to local chieftains that held power over a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Julia Ann. 1997. ''The Cultural Politics of Fishing: Negotiating Community and Common Property in Northern Norway''. Dissertation. Stanford, CA: Stanford University, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Their privileged status refers to their having received special permission from the king to engage in trade. There are believed to have been 200 to 300 privileged traders' centers or [[fishing village]]s from [[Brønnøysund]] in the south to [[Vardø]] in the north. The privileged traders experienced their peak from the second half of the 1800s to 1910. After this, the development of fishing fleets and public transport by steamship made fishermen less dependent on the local fish buyers, and catches could then be traded wherever the best profit was to be had.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

The privileged traders enjoyed a dominant economic, social, and political position in the local milieu. They controlled the local trade, fresh fish purchases, and fish processing, and they often owned the local estate. They sought to supply the locals with all the goods they needed from elsewhere, and this sales monopoly resulted in no room for competition. They covered needs ranging from food and fuel to boats and finished log houses. Often the sale of goods and purchases of fish happened at the same time, so that trade was more of a barter and the privileged trader profited from both the purchase and sale. Because there was little money in circulation, not only these exchanges were kept in written account books, but also the residents' other expenditures were recorded in the books maintained by the privileged trader; for example, taxes or costs of medical treatment. Fishermen’s dole-fish (the share of the catch they were entitled to)&lt;ref&gt;Palgrave, R. H. Inglis. 1895–1899 (reprinted 1987). ''Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy''. London: MacMillan, p. 625.&lt;/ref&gt; was also often handled by the privileged trader, and so he acted as a bank in many ways. This also applied to loans—both for working capital for fishing, as well as consumer loans for houses and land, equipment, and boats. There was often little chance of the debt being paid off. The privileged traders secured the debts by having the borrowers pledge their property as security. If the people could not repay their debt, this could lead to foreclosure or [[forced sale]] and the loss of their boats, houses, or other property, which was their source of livelihood. Practice varied on how the debt was enforced; some allowed the old owners to remain on the farm as tenants, whereas others evicted them and brought in new residents. Often the privileged traders had not only a trade monopoly, but also political power, such as mayor or other offices, which often undermined the municipal system.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

The best-known privileged trader was [[Erasmus Zahl]] of [[Kjerringøy]],&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, Walter. 1997. ''Knut Hamsun''. Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; who was the model for [[Knut Hamsun]]'s character Mack in his novels.&lt;ref&gt;Combüchen, Sigrid. 2006. ''Livsklättraren: en bok om Knut Hamsun''. Stockholm: Albert Bonniers, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Régis. 2002. ''Knut Hamsun''. Lausanne: Age d'homme, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''Raymond Lakah''', (born c. 1960 as '''Rami Lakah''') (رامي لكح), is a [[French people|French]]-[[Egyptians|Egyptian]], [[Greek Catholic]] [[Christian]] [[Business magnate|magnate]], and former owner of the French [[newspaper]] ''[[France Soir]]''.

Lakah was born to a wealthy Greek Catholic Egyptian family from Syrian roots, and first came to prominence with his brother Michel Lakah in the mid-1990s. They had holdings in construction, healthcare management and aviation. In November 1998, their holdings were floated on the Cairo Stock Exchange with Rami owning 38% and Michel 31%.

==Egyptian Parliament==
In November 2000 Lakah was elected to the [[Parliament of Egypt|Egyptian Parliament]] at the relatively young age of 40. His election raised the question of the legality of dual nationals holding government offices since Lakah was a [[Nationality|national]] of both Egypt and [[France]]. In January 2001, the Minister of Interior officially declared that his election in 2000 was invalid. Discussions about his financial debts, which had started before his election, also intensified.

His indebtedness amounting to 1.2 to 1.4 billion Egyptian Pounds with many government bankloans in Egypt unpaid. When lawsuits were filed against him, he fled Egypt and settled in France. In August 2001, a court verdict in Egypt ruled that he could not be a member of the Egyptian Parliament due to his dual nationality. In October 2004, the Egyptian parliament installed a new rule that dual nationals are not allowed to serve in the parliament.

Lakah was once interviewed on [[AlJazeera]] satellite TV channel, bringing with him what he said is evidence that charges against him were politically motivated. The interview was cut short and Lakah stormed out of the studio [réf. nécessaire].

Lakah maintains that all his debts were paid off.

In France, he took the name Raymond, instead of his [[Arabic]] birth name Rami, and started establishing himself in several business ventures, including [[Star Airlines]], and in October 2004 he bought the ''France Soir'' newspaper.

==Cartoon controversy==
On February 2, 2006, ''France Soir'' published the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoons]] that caused a lot of havoc and anger among Muslims around the world. The cartoons were originally published by the Danish newspaper [[Jyllands-Posten]] on September 30, 2005. ''France Soir'' republished the cartoons under the headline, ''"Yes, One has the Right to Caricature God."''

The same day Raymond Lakah fired the editorial director, [[Jacques Lefranc]].&lt;ref&gt;http://actu-societe.nouvelobs.com/france-soir-prophete-journal-monde-musulman.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported that Lakah issued a statement saying he fired Lefranc as president and director of the newspaper in ''"a strong sign of respect to the intimate convictions and beliefs of each individual."'' The statement continued, ''"We present our regrets to the Muslim community and to all people who have been shocked or made indignant by this publication."''

'''Rexdale''' is a district of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, located north-west of the central core, in the former suburb of [[Etobicoke]]. Rexdale defines an area of several official neighbourhoods north of [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] and east of [[Highway 427 (Ontario)|Highway 427]]. Rexdale was originally a post World War II residential development within Etobicoke, and today is applied to a general area from [[Malton, Ontario|Malton]] and [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] in the City of [[Mississauga]] to the west, Highway 401 to the south, Steeles Avenue to the north, and the Humber River to the east. It is centred on Rexdale Boulevard and Islington Avenue.

==Character==
[[File:Woodbine Racetrack.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Woodbine Racetrack]] is situated in Rexdale.]]
There are a number of neighbourhoods within the area known as Rexdale. They consist of:

* [[The Elms, Toronto|The Elms]]
* [[Humberwood]]
* [[Smithfield, Toronto|Smithfield]]
* [[Thistletown]]
* [[Clairville, Toronto|Clairville]]

The area is home to several major institutions and attractions, including the [[Canadian Standards Association]], [[Woodbine Centre]] shopping mall, and [[Woodbine Racetrack]].

==History==
Rexdale was named for local real estate developer [[Rex Heslop]], who purchased farmland in the area in 1955 for a cost of $110,000, and installed water mains, streets and sewers, as well as houses that listed for sale at either $9,000 or $10,000. The homes sold well, and soon 330 families were living in the development.  In 1956, Heslop opened the Rexdale Plaza (since demolished and replaced by a [[power center (retail)|power centre]]).  By then, 70 industries and 3,600 homes were located in Rexdale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | authorlink = Mike Filey | last = Filey | first = Mike | title = Toronto Sketches 9: "The Way We Were" Columns from the Toronto Sunday Sun | publisher = Dundurn | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8PxmBXTDDFsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rexdale's first residents were mostly [[English people|English]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]], but it evolved into a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] neighbourhood in the following decades. The population of Rexdale, according to the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Census]], is 94,469 living in 30,238 households. The population grows at a rate comparable to surrounding communities.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 2006, [[Christopher Hume]], a journalist with the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', wrote that Rexdale "has become shorthand for suburban blight, social breakdown and gang violence. In 2005 alone, five young men were shot dead in the area, a grey landscape of highways and highrises, shopping malls and churches."  Hume wrote that children who lived in Rexdale had nothing to do, and were "wandering around the anonymous streets of this place".  The vision of Rexdale's planners, Hume wrote, was a patchwork of separate precincts for working, living, shopping and playing, connected by expressways.  However, this single-use zoning, separation, industrial-scale development and reliance on cars contributed to Rexdale's problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hume | first = Christopher | authorlink = Christopher Hume| title = At The Least, Build a Community Centre | publisher = Urbantoronto.ca| date = February 18, 2006 | url = http://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20060218/282514358956990}}&lt;!--original URL http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1140216611236&amp;call_pageid=968350130169&amp;col=969483202845 is dead - was reposted at http://urbantoronto.ca/forum/showthread.php/3791-At-the-least-build-a-community-centre-%28Hume-on-Rexdale%29 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce Lau of the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' stated in 2015 that in Rexdale "other immigrants live in poverty, surrounded by crime."&lt;ref name=LauSCMP&gt;{{cite web|author=Lau, Joyce|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/books/article/2043688/murder-toronto-and-dark-side-asian-immigrant-dream|title=A murder in Toronto and the dark side of the Asian immigrant dream|publisher=''[[South China Morning Post]]''|date=2016-11-09|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Budi Hartono''' ({{zh|first=t|s={{linktext|黄|惠|忠}}|t={{linktext|黃|惠|忠}}|p=Huáng Huìzhōng}}; [[Hokkien]]: Oei Hwie Tjhong;&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; born in 1940) is a [[Chinese Indonesian]] tobacco billionaire with a 2018 net worth of US$12.6 billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt; He owns and runs the privately held [[Djarum]], the world's third largest maker of clove [[cigarettes]]. Djarum has reportedly recently grabbed shares from the number two cigarette firm, [[Sampoerna]]. Budi Hartono also has a stake with his brother, [[Michael Bambang Hartono]] in one of Indonesia's biggest banks, [[Bank Central Asia]], formerly controlled by billionaire [[Liem Sioe Liong]].  In 2009, Budi Hartono's net worth reportedly reached US$4.7 billion and he was nominated as the richest Indonesian while Liem Sioe Liong was in 3rd place.

== Career ==
Starting from Mr. [[Oei Wie Gwan]] bought a small business in the field named Djarum clove gramophon. In 1951 it changed its name to Djarum. Oei began marketing cigarettes under the brand "Djarum" which turned out to be successful in the market. After a fire nearly gutted the company in 1963 (Oei died shortly afterward), Djarum back up and modernize their equipment in the factory. In 1972 Djarum began to export their product abroad. Three years later the brand Djarum Djarum Filter was introduced, the first brand to be produced by machines, followed by the brand Djarum Super, introduced in 1981.

Together with his brother, Michael Hartono, at the age of 22 Robert inherited one of the leading cigarette company today, Djarum. Djarum was previously a small business called Djarum gramophon which was later purchased by his father, Oei Wie Gwan, in 1951 and changed its name to Djarum. Robert and his brother inherited Djarum after his father died. At that time, Djarum's factory burned down and suffered an unstable condition. But in the hands of the two Hartono brothers, Djarum could grow into giants.

In a January 2018 billionaires' personal information, Budi Hartono and his brother Michael Hartono were reported by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as the richest men in Indonesia in 2018 with a combined wealth of $US 25 billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Hartono|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-hartono/|website=Forbes|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Budi Hartono was listed by ''Forbes'' as being worth $US 12.6 billion,&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; while in 2012 was $US 6.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Bagus BT Saragih, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/30/bakrie-out-rich-men-s-club.html Bakrie out of rich men's club'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2092">In the context of [[corporate finance]], the '''tax benefits of debt''' or '''tax advantage of debt''' refers to the fact that from a tax perspective it is cheaper for firms and investors to finance with [[debt]] than with [[ownership equity|equity]]. Under a majority of [[tax|taxation systems]] around the world, and until recently under the [[taxation in the United States|United States tax system]], firms are taxed on their [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and individuals are taxed on their [[personal income]]. 

For example, a firm that earns $100 in profits in the United States would have to pay around $30 in taxes. If it then distributes these profits to its owners as [[dividends]], then the owners in turn pay taxes on this income, say $20 on the $70 of dividends. The $100 of profits turned into $50 of investor income.

If, instead the firm finances with debt, then, assuming the firm owes $100 of interest to investors, its profits are now 0. Investors now pay taxes on their interest income, say $30. This implies for $100 of [[Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization|profits before taxes]], investors got $70.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~jgraham/HowBigFinalJF.pdf Graham, John, "How big are the Tax Benefits of Debt" The Journal of Finance, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This tax-related encouragement of debt financing has not gone uncriticized.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;Richard T. Page, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1724530 "Foolish Revenge or Shrewd Regulation? Financial-Industry Tax Law Reforms Proposed in the Wake of the Financial Crisis?"] 85 [[Tul. L. Rev.]] 191 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, some critics have argued that the cost of equity should also be deductible; which could reduce the [[Internal Revenue Code]]'s influence on [[capital-structure]] decisions, potentially reducing the economic instability attributable to excessive debt financing.&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt;

'''Vladimir Sergeyevich Lisin''' (born 7 May 1956 in [[Ivanovo]]) is a [[Russia]]n steel [[tycoon]]. He is chairman and the majority shareholder of [[Novolipetsk]] or NLMK, one of the four largest steel companies in Russia. He is a leading world authority on metallurgical processes; holding various patents on metallurgical processes and having published over 100 articles on metallurgy and economics which include 15 monographs.

According to Forbes he was the richest man in [[Russia]] and 48th richest in the world in 2013.&lt;ref name="ForbesProfile" /&gt;  As of 2018, his estimated net worth is $20.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Capitalist Wiki contributors, [http://www.russiancapitalistwiki.com/wiki/Vladimir-Lisin "Vladimir Lisin"]. Russian Capitalist Wiki. Retrieved 19 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Vladimir Lisin got his first job in 1975 working as a mechanic in a Soviet coalmine and after studying at the [[Siberian Metallurgic Institute]] got a job working as a welder foreman at Tulachermet Metals Works.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Capitalist Wiki contributors (01-15-2014). [http://www.russiancapitalistwiki.com/wiki/Vladimir-Lisin "Vladimir Lisin"]. Russian Capitalist Wiki. (Retrieved 02-13-2014).&lt;/ref&gt; He rose through the ranks to become section manager, shop manager in 1979 and Deputy Chief Engineer in 1986.

In 1992, he joined a group of tenacious traders (the [[Trans-World Group]]) who won control of Russia’s steel and aluminium industry. When the partners split in 2000, he received 13% of the firm and later even won a controlling share. He had another bit of luck when his former boss was named the Minister for Russian Metallurgy and Lisin became the sole owner of [[Novolipetsk]] Steel in 2000.

Since 1993, he has served as a Board member of several leading Russian metal producers, including NLMK, MMK and Sayansk and Novokuznetsk Aluminium Plants and he has been a member of the Board Directors of [[Novolipetsk Steel]] (NLMK) since 1996 and its chairman since 1998. He previously worked as Deputy Chief Engineer and as Deputy General Director of the Karaganda Steel Plant, one of [[Kazakhstan]]’s four largest steel plants.

Mr. Lisin served as member of the Board of Directors of Zenit Bank.

He has been Chairman and Director of JSC Novolipetsk Iron &amp; Steel Corporation (OJSC Novolipetsk Steel) since June 5, 2007. He has been Director of OJSC United Shipbuilding Corporation since March 3, 2009. He serves as a Trustee of Inst. of Social Dev. Foundation.

His business interests, apart from steel, include transportation and logistics (with stakes in [[St Petersburg Sea Port]], [[Tuapse Commercial Sea Port]], [[North-Western Shipping Company]], [[Volga Shipping Company]]), energy (stakes in [[Chermonorneftegaz]] and [[Severneftegaz]]), and utilities (Russian grid companies [[Federal Grid Company]] and [[Distribution Grid Company of Center]]). These predominantly Russian assets are controlled via [[Fletcher Group Holdings]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fletcher.com.cy/ Fletcher Group Holdings Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlmk.com/ru/investor-relations/shareholder-centre/shareholder-structure NLMK shareholder structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Berndt Wilhelm Schauman''' (8 November 1857 &amp;ndash; 14 November 1911) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] industrialist, the most important in [[Jakobstad]] at the beginning of the 20th century. He was the older brother of [[Ossian Schauman]]. Wilhelm Schauman's first industrial installation was a small [[chicory]] (coffee additive/substitute) factory, which he founded in 1883. He was also involved in the local tobacco factory as part of the management. Apart from this, he continuously founded new enterprises such as a [[sugar refinery]], a steam-powered [[saw mill]] and a [[plywood]] factory, which was the first of its kind in Finland. His enterprises soon expanded beyond the borders of Jakobstad.

A paper and pulp mill was later built in Jakobstad, and remains today as the largest factory in Jakobstad. It is owned by '''[[UPM-Kymmene]]''', as a result of a merger in 1988.

==Life==

After graduating as a mechanical engineer in 1879, Schauman gained employment at a metal factory in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Four years later, his young wife (Mimmi Roos) wanted to return home, and the couple decided to return to their hometown [[Jakobstad]] when Schauman was turned down for the post of technical director at the [[Serlachius]] Mänttä Mills (despite having received some initial promises). After visiting [[chicory]] factories in [[Germany]] and [[Russia]], he started his own chicory factory in Jakobstad in the Thodén bakery in the centre of town, employing 6 or 7 people. Chicory is a [[coffee]] substitute. The factory met with great success and proved to be very profitable, after which Schauman started to build a second production site just outside town in 1884. Within a few years, he was the largest chicory producer in Finland.

After a fire destroyed the second factory in 1892, Schauman built a third close to the harbour. This factory became operational in 1893, and is today a museum, housing the original machinery. Initially, the raw material was supplied from Germany, while later [[Belgium]] became the most important supplier of chicory root, followed by [[the Netherlands]], Imperial Russia, [[Estonia]] and [[Poland]].

The business boomed as Schauman combined a high quality product at competitive prices with successful marketing strategies. Schauman employed his own agents in cities such as [[Helsinki]], [[Turku]], [[Tampere]] and [[Viipuri]], and was careful to design attractive packaging with Russian type print consisting of medallions and other embellishments. Schauman would himself travel around Finland, inviting shopkeepers to sample his products. At the peak of production in 1903, Schauman employed 60 employees, producing close to 1400 tons of roasted and ground chicory.

After the mid-1890s, Schauman diversified into other business activities such as the export of timber goods, towboat operations, the production of saw goods and he also founded a sugar refinery on the [[Alholmen peninsula]] outside Jakobstad. In 1889, Schauman was elected to the board of directors of the [[Strengberg|Ph. U. Strengberg]] tobacco factory, and seven years later, he was given the post of [[chairman]] and [[CEO]]. The Strengberg tobaccy factory was at this time the largest producer of cigarettes in the [[Nordic countries]], and also the first internal tobacco producer in the Nordic region.

Schauman continued to expand his personal business empire and in 1910 he purchased a steam-powered saw mill in Yxpila (near [[Karleby]]) and the same year he founded a [[plywood]] factory in [[Jyväskylä]]. He did not live to see the factory completed, however, as he died suddenly during a business trip to [[Berlin]] on 14 November 1911. His fortune at the time of his death was estimated as 2 million [[Finnish mark|Finnish Marks]].

==Industrial expansion==
[[File:Schauman's factory in Jyväskylä.jpg|thumb|300px|Schauman plywood factory complex in Jyväskylä. The Building is now used by the Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences.]]
After Wilhelm Schaumans death in 1911, and in accordance with his last will, his business activities were transferred under the ownership of a newly created and publicly traded company '''Oy Wilhelm Schauman Ab'''. After divestment of the sugar interests, the company concentrated on its plywood processing plants, eventually becoming the market leader in plywood products. The Jyväskylä plywood mill was a promising and highly profitable new venture, and the mill flourished during the early years of [[World War I]]. Plywood production also began in [[Savonlinna]] in 1921, and a plywood mill in [[Joensuu]] was acquired in 1924. The mills at Jyväskylä, Savonlinna, and Joensuu were all later merged into the Oy Wilh. Schauman Ab entity.

During [[World War II]] the proportion of plywood products rose considerably, and in 1958 a chipboard mill was opened in Jyväskylä. A [[Particle board|chipboard]] mill was purchased from Viiala Oy in 1962, and in 1969 Oy Wilh. Schauman Ab opened a chipboard mill in Joensuu, and by the early 1990s the company had chipboard mills in Joensuu, Ristiina (Pellos chipboard mill), and Kitee (Puhos chipboard mill).

The chicory production in Jakobstad also continued after Schaumans death, and it consistently made a profit every year between 1912 and 1935, although its overall contribution to the company results was relatively modest. However, the demand and production of chicory was in terminal decline, except during the period of World War II, when chicory demand temporarily surged due to the restricted availability of coffee. The Jakobstad factory produced its last batch of chicory in February 1960, and the last shipment from the warehouse was made in September 1964.

The foundation of Schauman's [[paper-and-pulp]] operations was laid with the construction of a [[sulfite]] pulp mill in Jakobstad in 1934. In the early 1960s, a [[sulfate]] pulp mill, a paper mill, and a [[paper sack]] plant were added. During the first half of the 1970s, major investments were made in pulp manufacturing, and this made Schauman the largest producer of market pulp in Finland. The paper sack plant in Jakobstad soon became the largest of its kind in Finland, and in 1969 Schauman purchased the Craf'Sac plant in [[Rouen]], [[France]]. Schauman had already become a world leader in plywood product development by the beginning of the 1960s, grabbing additional market share through the use of new and innovative production methods for [[glue|gluing]], [[coating]] and processing of plywood, as well as through the use of [[spruce]] as raw material.

Schauman at various points in its history also acquired business activities that did not fit well with its core activities, such as the making of furniture, along with more conventional converted panel products. In 1971, Schauman also became a producer of large [[Yacht|sailing yachts]] after having bought [[Nautor's Swan|Nautor]], a [[shipyard|boatyard]] located outside Jakobstad. Eventually, all such non-core businesses were divested.

Following the implementation, no new YKs were allowed in Japan, but pre-existing YKs were allowed to continue their operations as [[kabushiki gaisha]] under special rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iflr.com/Article/1978086/SPCs-under-company-law.html Japan: SPCs under company law] - Abolishment of YK Law&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the term is pronounced as  ''yūgen gaisha'' or ''yūgen kaisha'' is up to the local dialect or the company's preference when it is part of the company's name. While it is pronounced ''yūgen gaisha'' in standard Japanese, the alphabetic abbreviation is always Y.K. by standard.

==Structure==

As of 2005, a Y.K. can have up to 50 investors, called {{nihongo|members|社員|shain}}. The members were required to provide at least ¥3 million in capital contributions, with each {{nihongo|investment unit|持分|mochibun}} valued at no less than ¥50,000. The minimum capital amount was much more permissive than the ¥10 million minimum for a kabushiki gaisha. A Y.K. was also not required to issue certificates for investment units, whereas stock certificates were required for a K.K.

Unlike a K.K., a Y.K. does not need to have a board of directors or statutory auditors: the minimum requirement is one {{nihongo|director|取締役|torishimariyaku}}.

Because of its simplified structure and relatively lax incorporation requirements, the Y.K. form is associated with small businesses. However, some larger companies have used the form: [[ExxonMobil]]'s principal Japanese subsidiary, for instance, is a Y.K. with paid-in capital of ¥50 billion (US$420 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Legal-Office/20061018/1161193754 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330132959/http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Legal-Office/20061018/1161193754 |date=March 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to simplified [[corporate governance]], a Y.K. receives some tax benefits under foreign laws such as the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]].
