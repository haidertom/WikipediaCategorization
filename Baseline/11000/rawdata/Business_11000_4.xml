{{nihongo|'''''A-Train'''''|A列車で行こう|Ē Ressha de Ikō|lit. ''Let's Take the A-Train''}} is a series of [[vehicle simulation game|train simulation]] [[video game]]s that were originally developed and published by [[Japan]]ese [[Video game developer|game developer]] [[Artdink]] in Japan. The first game in the series was published in 1985.&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt; The first release in the [[United States]] was ''Take the A-Train II'', published in 1988 by the Seika Corporation under the title ''Railroad Empire''. However, the most well known U.S. release is ''Take the A-Train III'', published in 1992 by [[Maxis]] as simply ''A-Train''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==A-Train (original)==
The first iteration of the A-Train series was released in December 1985 for the [[FM-7]], [[NEC PC-8801]], [[NEC PC-9801]], [[Sharp X1|X1 Turbo]], [[Sharp MZ|MZ-2500]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] and [[MSX]]2. A [[Windows 95]]/[[Windows 98|98]] port followed in April 2000.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==A-Train II==
The second iteration of the A-Train series was released in July 1988 for the NEC PC-9801 and [[Sharp X68000]]. In the USA, it was released under the name ''Railroad Empire''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==A-Train III==
[[Image:Maxis a-train on mac1.jpg|thumb|left|The "New Town" scenario in A-Train 1.0 for Macintosh]]
'''''Take the A-Train III''''' (known internationally as '''''A-Train''''') is the third game in the A-Train series. It was originally developed and published by [[Japan]]ese [[Video game developer|game developer]] [[Artdink]] for Japan, and was later published by [[Maxis]] for the [[United States]]. It was originally released in December 1990 for the NEC PC-9801, [[FM Towns Marty]], [[Sharp X68000]], and [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] (TurboGrafx-16). The US version was released in October 1992 on DOS and Amiga.&lt;ref&gt;http://hol.abime.net/3339&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Japanese version was re-released in March 2000 for [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows 98|98]]. Artdink ported the A-Train III along with the editor to Windows 95, and published both titles as a package as the 3rd ARTDINK BEST CHOICE title in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The game puts players in command of a [[Rail transport|railway]] company. There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the [[city]] and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended. A-Train III is the first game in the series to make use of [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|near-isometric]] [[Axonometric projection#Three types of axonometric projections|dimetric projection]] to present the city, similar to Maxis's later ''[[SimCity 2000]]''.&lt;ref name="pcmuseum"&gt;[http://www.pcmuseum.ca/details.asp?id=40218&amp;type=software A-Train], Personal Computer Museum&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with [[house]]s, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself.  As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as [[ski resort]]s and [[hotel]]s, and make profits from them if the conditions are right.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''''A.III. Map Construction''''', known internationally as '''''A-Train Construction Set''''', is an editor that can change existing saved games, or to build landscapes from scratch. It comes with 6 sample maps.  Maxis also published A-Train Construction Set with A-Train as a single package in Europe, without the Ocean Software label.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The game was tremendously popular in [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="1UP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172863|title=Take the A-Train To Your DS|work=1UP News|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=2009-03-14|date=2009-02-18|author=Kevin Gifford}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus motivating Maxis to license it for [[United States|US]] distribution as ''A-Train'', available for DOS, Macintosh and Amiga platforms. It was released in October 1992, though it sold poorly.  Even the release of an add-on pack for the game failed to stir up any real support amongst the gaming community. The game was the first major failure from Maxis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s reviewer stated in 1992 that while he enjoyed the financial and management aspects of ''A-Train'', "many people will miss out on a fine program because of a steeply graded learning curve".&lt;ref name="trevena199209"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=98 | title=Leavin' On That Noonday Train To Chiba | work=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1992 | accessdate=3 July 2014 | author=Trevena, Stanley | pages=38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors wrote, "Fascinating, absorbing and now quite cheap, ''A-Train'' is worth a place in any games collection — and don't be put off by the subject matter.

==MD A-Train==
{{nihongo|A Ressha de Ikou MD|Ａ列車で行こうＭＤ||"MD A-Train"}} is a [[simulation game|simulation]] game involving the construction of a [[Rail transport|railroad]] in order to boost the city's [[Public transport|mass transit]] system.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The game was released to an exclusively [[Japan]]ese market; with no release ever being attempted for the North American or European markets.

The player must use the [[resource]]s at hand to build a [[Rail transport|railroad]] connecting the two ends of a map in each scenario. A train can be controlled throughout the day (05:00-17:00) while building new tracks and stations. Nighttime activities (17:00-05:00) involve changing train schedules to better suit the needs of the player's growing mass transportation hub. New [[Real estate development|developments]] will spring up around the tracks and stations. This permits the player to increase the amount of money that can earn; resulting in the increased ability to build railroad tracks and stations for the growing city. Five scenarios offer a tutorial mode for first-time players, an extremely hard scenario for veterans, and three more scenarios for players in between the two extremes in difficulty levels. Players can play using speeds that range from slow to normal to fast.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==A-Train IV==

They scored it 28 out of 40 (average 7 out of 10).&lt;ref name="EGM"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: A-Train |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=80|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1996|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Desmond and Sushi-X, ''[[GamePro]]'' felt the game "just doesn't roll with the same FunFactor of other sim games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=A Train|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=91|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1996|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' said it was "a quality management title.

'''Australian trust law''' is the law of [[Trust law|trusts]] as it is applied in [[Law of Australia|Australia]]. It is derived from, and largely continues to follow [[English trust law]], as modified by state and federal legislation. A number of unique features of Australian trust law arise from interactions with the Australian systems of [[Australian corporate law|company law]], [[Australian family law|family law]] and [[Taxation in Australia|taxation]].

Trusts were introduced in Australia in the 1970s for the mainstream population in regards to mortgage brokers activities and their regulation by a chartered accountant, Malcolm E.J. Morgan, of the accountancy firm Morgan, Priddy and Keogh, based in Perth, Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Law Reform Commission of Australia Project 45&lt;/ref&gt;

==General law of trusts==
A trust is a legal agreement where a person (the trustee) holds and manages property for the benefit of others in the agreement (the beneficiaries) as laid out in a trust deed. The trustee legally owns the properties but is obliged to act in accordance with the provisions of the deed.   

The word trust specifically refers to the duty or aggregate accumulation of obligation that rest upon a person described as the trustees.&lt;ref name="re Scott"&gt;{{cite AustLII|SAStRp|11|1948|litigants=Re Scott |parallelcite=[1948] [[South Australian State Reports|SASR]] 193 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of South Australia|Supreme Court]] (SA)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibilities of trustees are in relation to property held by them, or under their control. The trustees will be compelled by a court in its equitable jurisdiction to administer trust property in the manner lawfully prescribed by the trust instrument, or where there be no specific provision written or oral, or to the extent that such provision is invalid or lacking, in accordance with equitable principles.&lt;ref name="re Scott"/&gt;

A trustee has a legal interest in the property of the trust. The beneficiary has an equitable interest. If a person holds both the legal interest and the equitable interest, then the equitable interest will cease to exist and a single legal estate will subsist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|14|1982|litigants=DKLR Holdings Co (No 2) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 431 at p. 463}}.&lt;/ref&gt; See also: Stickney v. Keeble [1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 386 [http://swarb.co.uk/stickney-v-keeble-hl-1917/ Swarb Law UK]

Equity recognises cases where a party places trust/confidence in another, these relationships are protected by equity and are called [[fiduciary relationship]]s. The critical feature of fiduciary relationships is that the trustee undertakes to act for or on behalf of the beneficiary in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interest of the trustee in a legal or practical sense.&lt;ref name="Hospital Products  HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|64|1984|litigants=[[Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation]] |parallelcite=(1984) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 41 |date=25 October 1984 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breen v Williams"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|57|1996|litigants=[[Breen v Williams]] ("Medical Records Access case") |parallelcite=(1996) 186 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 71|date=6 September 1996 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the exercise of a fiduciary duty, a trustee must not take a benefit from their position as trustee unless the beneficiary or beneficiaries have given their informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;''Boardman v Phipps'' {{Cite BAILII|court=UKHL|year=1966|num=2}}. See also {{Cite AustLII|HCA|36|1984|litigants=Chan v Zacharia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common trusts==

===Express trust===
In an express trust, the settlor indicates an intention to and deliberately creates the trust, while a non-express trust is one that arises by operation of law, such as when created by statute or by judges, such as a constructive trust.

An express trust may be an public express trust such as one for a charitable purpose, or a private express trust with the private purpose.

===Classification of trusts===
There are a variety of trusts recognised and used in Australia, including [[unit trust]]s, [[discretionary trust]]s, [[hybrid trust]]s, and [[testamentary trust]]s.

Under a discretionary trust the share, if any, which each beneficiary is to receive is determined by the trustees. Therefore, the trustee has a discretion as to which beneficiary is to receive income or capital under the trust even if there is a duty for them to distribute the income. In addition, the trustees also have a discretion as to the amount that each beneficiary will receive. However, the beneficiary has no real right substantively.

Streaming a category of trust income to a particular beneficiary provides tax planning opportunities. For example, foreign tax credits can be best used by resident individual beneficiaries with high marginal tax rates and net capital gains can be best used by beneficiaries with carried forward capital losses, low-income beneficiaries with carried forward revenue losses and minors able to receive excepted trust income. However, discretionary trusts are usually unsuitable for the accumulation of profits as the undistributed income will generally be taxed at 45%.

Family trusts are often used to distribute income to beneficiaries in an attempt to achieve the lowest tax outcomes available to the members of the trust. Discretionary trusts also protect assets when individual members become insolvent or bankrupt. Asset protection is also extended to other types of liabilities.

The power of appointment of the trustee of a discretionary trust is held by the Appointor. In some trust deeds, the person holding the power of appointment of the trustee is called the Custodian or the Principal of the trust. The Appointor is usually a natural person but can also be a company. Generally, upon the death of the Appointor, in the absence of an alternate appointment in the trust deed, the personal legal representative (executor) of the Appointor becomes the Appointor. The real power in relation to the control of the trust rests with the Appointor because of the ability to terminate the appointment of the trustee and appoint a different trustee. This must be kept in mind when considering succession and estate planning involving assets held in a discretionary trust.

==Creating a trust==
A trust can be intentionally created during the settlor's life (''inter Vivos'') by declaration or transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|SASC|225|2002|litigants=Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Jimenez |courtname=[[Supreme Court of South Australia|Supreme Court]] (SA)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A deceased estate is a [[testamentary trust]] which automatically arises on the death of the testator. Courts may also create trusts, such as [[constructive trust]]s, as an [[equitable remedy]].

===Declaration of trust===
A settlor can declare him/herself trustee of his/her own property. The settlor already holds title to the property and all that needs to be done is to make a valid declaration. However, a declaration of trust will not be allowed out of an invalid gift.

Formalities relevant depend on nature of trust property. A trust of land must comply with statutory requirements based on the [[Statute of Frauds 1677]].

Where the trust is created by virtue of a contract made as consideration for marriage, or a contact which concerns any interests in land, s 4 of the Statute of Frauds (or their equivalent legislation in other states)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=H.A.J.|last2=Lee|first2=W.A.|title=Principles of the law of trusts|date=2006|publisher=LBC Information Services|location=North Ryde, N.S.W.|isbn=9780455213163|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; may operate to void such a contact unless it is evidenced in writing and signed by both parties to be charged.&lt;ref&gt;''Fletcher v Burns'' (1997) 12 BPR 22,937&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trusts created by transfer===
A settlor can create an express trust by transferring property to a trustee to hold on trust. Two requirements must be satisfied:

* declaration of trust, which must establish that the recipient of the property is intended to take the property in the capacity of trustee and not beneficially. The words used by the settlor will be construed in the context of the transfer itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Choihram International SA v Pagarini'' {{Cite BAILII|court=UKPC|year=2000|num=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* there must be a valid transfer of trust property following the principle set out in ''[[Corin v Patton]]''&lt;ref name="Corin"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|12|1990|litigants=Corin v Patton |parallelcite=(1990) 169 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 540}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which held a transfer may be valid in equity even though it may not be considered valid at law. A transfer will be considered valid in equity only when the settlor has done all the things that must be done to transfer their interest in the property. The things required to be done by the settlor cannot be done by anyone else.&lt;ref name="Corin"/&gt;

Trusts of land created by transfer must be evidenced in writing, as required by provisions derived from the [[Statute of Frauds 1677]]. See also ''Conveyancing Act 1919'' (NSW) s23C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca1919141|Conveyancing Act 1919|23C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A trust that fails to meet the requirement to transfer property in writing will not be void, rather it will be unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;''Gardner v Rowe'' (1828) 5 Russ 258; 38 [[English Reports|ER]] 1024.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawn by Horace Benge Dobell, physician, whilst a student at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College|St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School.]]]]
'''Chimney sweep's cancer''', also called '''soot wart''', is a [[squamous cell carcinoma]] of the skin of the [[scrotum]]. It has the distinction of being the first reported form of [[occupational disease|occupational cancer]], and was initially identified by [[Percivall Pott]] in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;General Surgery Lecture notes, H.Ellis, Wiley Blackwell, 12th edition&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially noticed as being prevalent amongst [[chimney sweep]]s.

==Pathogenesis==
Chimney sweeps' carcinoma is a [[squamous cell carcinoma]] of the skin of the [[scrotum]]. [[Wart]]s caused by the irritation from soot particles, if not excised, developed into a scrotal cancer. This then invaded the [[dartos]], enlarged the [[testicle]], and proceeded up the [[spermatic cord]] into the [[abdomen]] where it proved fatal.

==History==
Chimney sweeps' carcinoma was first described by [[Percivall Pott]] in 1775 who postulated that the cancer was associated with [[occupational exposure]] to soot.&lt;ref name="RSC"&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Dronsfield |first= Alan |date= 1 March 2006 |title= Percivall Pott, chimney sweeps and cancer |url= https://eic.rsc.org/feature/percivall-pott-chimney-sweeps-and-cancer/2020205.article |magazine= [[Education in Chemistry]] |volume= 43 |issue= 2 |pages= 40–42, 48 |publisher= [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |access-date= 19 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancer primarily affected chimney sweeps who had been in contact with soot since their early childhood. The median age of onset of symptoms in one review was 37.7 years, although boys as young as 8 years old were found to have the disease.&lt;ref name="Waldron"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldron|first1=H. A.|title=A brief history of scrotal cancer.|journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine|date=1 November 1983|volume=40|issue=4|pages=390–401|doi=10.1136/oem.40.4.390|url=http://oem.bmj.com/content/40/4/390|accessdate=11 December 2016|language=en|issn=1470-7926|pmc=1009212}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by W.G. Spencer in 1890 that sweat running down their bodies had caused soot to accumulate in the [[rugae]] of the inferior surfaces of the scrotum, with the resulting chronic irritation causing scrotal cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=WG|title=Soot in cells of chimney-sweepers' cancer.|journal=Medico-Chirurgical Transactions|date=1890|volume=1|issue=74|pages=59–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was shown to be an incorrect artifact of the method used to stain his microscope slides.&lt;ref name="Waldron"/&gt;

In 1922, R.D. Passey, a research physician at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London produced malignant skin tumors in mice exposed to an extract made from soot, demonstrating the presence of carcinogenic substances in soot which were the likely cause of cancer of the scrotum in chimney sweeps.&lt;ref name="Waldron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Passey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Passey|first1=R. D.|title=Experimental Soot Cancer|journal=The British Medical Journal|date=1 January 1922|volume=2|issue=3232|pages=1112–1113|jstor=20421879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in the 1930s [[Ernest Kennaway]] and James D. Cook of the Research Institute of the Cancer Hospital, London, (later known as the [[Royal Marsden]] Hospital) discovered several [[polycyclic hydrocarbon]]s present in soot that were potent [[carcinogens]]: 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene; 1,2,7,8-dibenzanthracene; and 1,2-benzpyrene (3) benzo[α]pyrene. [[DNA]] consists of sequences of four bases – [[adenine]], [[thymine]], [[cytosine]] and [[guanine]] – bound to a [[deoxyribonucleic]] backbone. Benzo[α]pyrene interacts with [[deoxyguanosine]] of the DNA, damaging it and potentially starting the processes that can lead to cancer.&lt;ref name="RSC"/&gt;

===Social context===
The disease was principally a British phenomenon; in Germany, for example, sweeps wore tight-fitting protective clothing{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=393}} which prevented the soot from accumulating on the lower surface of the scrotum, whereas boys in the UK were once sent up the chimneys wearing only trousers and shirt, and occasionally naked.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=390}} 
In the United Kingdom before the flexible brush was introduced, the master sweeps took apprentices, who were boys from the [[workhouse]] or bought them from their parents and trained them to climb chimneys. In the [[States of the German Confederation|German States]], master sweeps belonged to [[trade guild]]s{{sfn|Strange|1982|p=40}} and did not use climbing boys. In Italy, Belgium, and France climbing boys were used. Boys as young as four climbed hot [[flue]]s that could be as narrow as 230&amp;nbsp;mm square. Work was dangerous and they could get jammed in the flue, suffocate or burn to death. The boys slept under the soot sacks and were rarely washed.  From 1775 onwards there was increasing concern for the welfare of the boys, and [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] were passed to restrict, and in 1875 to stop this usage.{{sfn|Strange|1982|p=80}} [[Lord Shaftesbury]], a [[philanthropist]], led the later campaign. In the United States, black children were hired from their owners and used in the same way, and were still climbing after 1875.{{sfn|Strange|1982|p=93}}

===Sir Percivall Pott===
[[Sir Percivall Pott]] (6 January 1714 – 22 December 1788)  London, England) was an English [[surgery|surgeon]], one of the founders of [[orthopedy]], and the first scientist to demonstrate that a cancer may be caused by an environmental [[carcinogen]].
In 1765 he was elected Master of the Company of Surgeons, the forerunner of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]]. It was in 1775 that Pott found an association between exposure to [[soot]] and a high incidence of chimney sweeps' carcinoma, a scrotal cancer (later found to be [[squamous cell carcinoma]]) in [[chimney sweep]]s. This was the first [[occupational disease|occupational]] link to cancer, and Pott was the first person to demonstrate that a malignancy could be caused by an environmental [[carcinogen]]. Pott's early investigations contributed to the science of [[epidemiology]] and the [[Chimney Sweepers Act 1788]].{{sfn|Gordon|1994|p=128}}

Pott describes chimney sweeps' carcinoma thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a disease which always makes it first attack on the inferior part of the [[scrotum]] where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges.....in no great length of time it pervades the skin, [[dartos]] and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the [[testicle]], which it inlarges,{{sic}} hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the [[Spermatic cord|spermatic process]] into the [[abdomen]].{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=391}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He comments on the life of the boys:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fate of these people seems peculiarly hard ... they are treated with great brutality ... they are thrust up narrow and sometimes hot chimnies,{{sic|nolink=y}} where they are bruised burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to [[puberty]] they become ... liable to a most noisome, painful and fatal disease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The carcinogen was thought to be [[coal tar]], possibly containing some [[arsenic]].{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=390}}{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|p=55}}

Though Pott wrote no further papers on the subject, clinical reports began to appear suggesting that others had seen it without realising what it was and like Pott had said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[as it occurs after puberty]....it is generally taken, both by patient and surgeon  for venereal and treated with mercurial [salts].{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=391}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The disease was usually preceded by the development of hyperkeratotic [[lesion]]s on the scrotum, which was what the sweeps called soot warts.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=392}} These could be benign; sweeps often removed them themselves by trapping them in a split cane and cutting them off with a pocket knife. For instance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"he... seized with a split stick and cut off with a razor. He remarked that it was not very painful. He resumed work the following day."{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=392}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But if the lesion had become malignant it was far more serious. Patients frequently delayed seeking medical opinion, and when they did many were in a dreadful state. A 28-year-old sweep approached Jefferies in 1825, who describes his condition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The sore occupies the whole of the left side of the [[scrotum]] and the inner angle of the [[thigh]], extending from the [[anus]] to the [[posterior inferior spinous process]] of the [[ileum]], presenting a surface as large as a man's open hand, with hard indurated edges and irregular margins, discharging a thin [[sanies]], which is extremely offensive; the left [[testicle]] is entirely denuded, and projects from its centre; in the left [[groin]] is a mass of [[indurated glands]], the size of a goose's egg, which appears to suppurate in the right groin: there is likewise an [[Genital ulcer|ulceration]], of the same [[malignant]] nature, about the size of a [[Half crown (British coin)|half-crown]]  (5 cm)..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Despite the appearance of this growth, the man was in no pain and his only complaint was that about 10 days before his admission he had bled from his groin and lost about a pint of blood. Even this, however, had not unduly affected his constitution.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=392}}

===Treatment===
Treatment was by surgery, where all the diseased flesh was cut out. Before the introduction of [[anaesthetic]]s this was a simple process for the surgeon but terrifying for the patient. Alternative treatments were also proposed including the application of an [[arsenic]] paste poultice. The real cause of this cancer was unproved until the discovery of weak carcinogens in soot by Passley in 1922.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=393}}  Until then the most popular theory was that soot got trapped in the [[rugae]] of the scrotum and this caused a general irritation. Sweeps were not known for their attention to bodily hygiene and it was assumed they never washed their genitals. The youngest victim, recorded in 1790 by James Earle (Pott's son-in-law), was 8 years old.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=391}}

==Related diseases==
Decades later, it was noticed to occur amongst gas plant and [[oil shale]] workers, and it was later found that certain constituents of tar, soot, and oils, known as [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], were found to cause cancer in laboratory animals. The related cancer, [[mule spinners' cancer|mule spinners' carcinoma]], was blamed on the carcinogenic content of [[shale oil]] that was used to lubricate the rapidly revolving [[Spinning mule|mule spindles]].

'''Colin Andrew Nielsen Beyer'''&lt;ref&gt;see [[Talk:Colin Beyer|talk page]] for a justification of the spelling&lt;/ref&gt; (10 September 1938 – 21 August 2015) was a New Zealand lawyer. He was a partner and then consultant with [[Simpson Grierson]] in [[Wellington]]. Also prominent businessman with many governance positions, Beyer was a securities commissioner on the [[Securities Commission of New Zealand]] from 2001 until 2010. He was the stepfather of former Member of Parliament [[Georgina Beyer]].

==Early life==
Of Danish descent,{{sfn|Beyer|1999|p=18}} Beyer was born in Wellington on 10 September 1938 to Knud Johan Nielsen and Carla Emilie (née Pallesen) Beyer.&lt;ref name="Tribute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tributes.co.nz/ViewMyTribute.aspx?id=10906 |title=In memory of Colin Andrew Nielsen Beyer |date= |website= |publisher=Tributes Online |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19380912.2.2 | title=Births | date=12 September 1938 | work=Evening Post | accessdate=25 August 2015 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked on the wharves in Wellington and his mother worked for the Education Department.

[[File:April 2013 to March 2014 Import commodities from India, by percent value in US$.png|thumb|Indian commodity imports in US$]]
In the field of [[economics]], the '''[[commodity]] value''' of a [[economic good|good]] is its [[free market]] [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] under optimal use conditions. In a free market, the commodity value of a good will be reflected by its price. For example, if an acre of land can yield a net of 100 dollars loss by lying [[fallow]], 50 dollars gain by being planted with corn, and 100 dollars gain by being planted with wheat, then that acre's commodity value is 100 dollars; the farmer is assumed to put his land to best use. The price of a commodity fluctuates around its commodity value.&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption and Management: New Discovery and Applications |last=Wu |first=Bingxin |year=2011 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9781908818072 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pIpwAgAAQBAJ |accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Currency ==
A commodity value expressed as a [[price]] is determined by historical, social and cultural aspects of production and distribution.&lt;ref name="macu"&gt;{{cite book |title=Material Culture in America: Understanding Everyday Life |last=Sheumaker |first=Helen |author2=Shirley Teresa Wajda |year=2008 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781576076477 |page=299 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JjVlAzj9qDQC |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karl Marx]] described price as the money-name for the [[Labour economics|labour]] realised in a commodity.&lt;ref name="caac"&gt;{{cite book |title=Capital: A Critique of Political Economy - The Process of Capitalist Production |last=Marx |first=Karl |year=2007 |publisher=Cosimo, Inc |isbn=9781605200064 |page=114 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sxQl44nJmjwC |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A commodity value is dependent on its [[utility]].&lt;ref name="tvom"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Value of Money |last=Anderson |first=B. M. |year=1922 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |isbn=9781610162777 |page=15 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PzrKq7x06MQC |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodity value is of particular significance in the study of currency. For example, the commodity value of a coin is the value of the metal of which it is made. Gold and silver coins have a high commodity value, whereas [[fiat money|fiat]] coins such as modern day [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarters]] have a low commodity value. This is of particular historical relevance when analyzed in light of [[Gresham's Law]].

Because money becomes valuable not due to its substance, that is, its commodity value, but rather because of its performance, currencies tend to become [[token money|token]].&lt;ref name="ncsp"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nature, Choice and Social Power |last=Schoenberger |first=Erica |year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1135051585 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TO5TBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debt ==
[[Asset]] backed [[debt]] has a commodity value equal to the price of the [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]; a loan backed by a house has a commodity value equal to the free market price of the house. Non-collateralized debt, on the other hand, does not have a commodity value; it is valuable only insofar as it is repaid.

== Investment ==
Commodity value is an important consideration in hedging against [[inflation]]. Whereas fiat currencies can devalue, often [[hyperinflation|catastrophically]], currencies with considerable commodity value are known to better maintain their value; a government can print as many fiat bills as it wants with relative ease, the same is not true of mining [[precious metals]]. This leads some investors to purchase goods and debts with high commodity value, which are inherently safer than those with low, or no commodity value, minimizing risk by sacrificing potential return.

==Early Years and Family==

Dionisio Gutierrez is the second son of Dionisio Gutierrez and Esperanza Mayorga&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wikiguate.com.gt/juan-bautista-gutierrez-blanco/|title=Juan Bautista Gutiérrez|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

His grandfather, Juan Bautista Gutierrez, was a Spaniard businessman and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] who established in [[Guatemala]] in the first years of the 20th Century.  

He was one of the founders of Multi Inversiones, S. A. According to Francisco Pérez de Antón&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wikiguate.com.gt/francisco-perez-de-anton/|title=Wikiguate Francisco Pérez de Antón|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, “…for Mr. Juan Gutierrez, life had only two purposes: to work and to create a heritage for his descendants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memorial de cocinas y batallas.|last=Pérez de Antón,|first=Francisco|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial México|year=2012|isbn=|location=https://books.google.com/books/about/Memorial_de_Cocinas_y_Batallas.html?id=uREWrSqMQWMC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;” which led him to build “one of the most solid and solvent groups in [[Central America]]”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memorial de cocinas y batallas|last=Pérez de Antón|first=Francisco|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial México, 2012.|year=2012|isbn=9929576584|location=https://books.google.com/books/about/Memorial_de_Cocinas_y_Batallas.html?id=uREWrSqMQWMC|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In the decade of the 20’s, Juan Bautista Gutierrez opened a small store in San Cristobal Totonicapan, a small town in the western region of Guatemala.  

In 1936 he founded Molino Excelsior; in 1965 he started operations in the poultry industry with the Villalobos farm. In the decade of the 70’s, by initiative of his son, Dionisio Gutierrez (father) and Francisco Pérez de Antón, he started in the business of fried chicken, with what would become the most emblematic company of the then Grupo Gutierrez (today, Corporación Multi Inversiones): Pollo Campero. 

Today, Corporación Multi Inversiones has diversified into different industries: food, livestock, energy, finance, real estate development, telecommunications, among others, adapting to both local and international market trends.
=== Family Tragedy ===
On October 3, 1974, the Gutierrez family suffered a painful and sad tragedy, when the small plane bound to Honduras, filled with medicine that had been collected by the Guatemalan Rotary Club for the victims of hurricane Fifi, and piloted by Dionisio Gutierrez father and Alfonso Bosch, plummeted in the midst of San Jose Pinula&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memorial de cocinas y batallas|last=Pérez de Antón|first=Francisco|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial México|year=2012|isbn=9929576584|location=https://books.google.com.gt/books/about/Memorial%20de%20Cocinas%20y%20Batallas.html?id=uREWrSqMQWMC&amp;redir_esc=y|pages=105-106}}&lt;/ref&gt;, causing the death of them both.

According to Francisco Perez de Antón, that tragedy led to a “generational void” inside the Gutierrez family, since the sons of both Dionisio Gutierrez father and this business partner Alfonso Bosch, were too young to take on management roles in the family business. This is why Dionisio Gutierrez began to work in Grupo Gutierrez since 1976, when he was only 17 years old. 

Besides, those years were socially and politically convulsive; violence from the local armed conflict and the consolidation of military governments, scourged practically all the Central American region.

==Business career==

By the end of the 70’s, Dionisio Gutierrez and his cousin Juan Luis Bosch took on a shared Chief Executive Officer role at Corporación Multi Inversiones&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmi.co/es/quienes-somos/historia|title=Coporación Multi Inversiones|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a family owned multinational corporation with over 45,000 employees, and presence in 14 countries in three continents. 

For 33 years, Dionisio Gutierrez held the presidency role in the multinational company, founded by his grandfather in 1936. Currently, he is member of the Management Board at CMI. 

He has also been Director of the Guatemalan Manager’s Association (Asociación de Gerentes de Guatemala), Director of the Trade Chamber, Director of Banco Occidente, and Vicepresident of Banco Reformador.

==Civic career==

His foray into politics starts in the sunset of the military regime, and the beginnings of the democratic era, towards the end of the 80’s. Therefore, for almost forty years, Dionisio Gutierrez has had a permanent participation in the critical moments of the Central American region.

=== First incursions in the civic scene ===
Since his college years, Dionisio Gutierrez got involved in projects of several student associations and groups, where he denounced both the actions of the military government and the Marxist guerrilla.  

Among them Electorama 82,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/biografia|title=Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an effort by young people to audit the questioned electoral process of March 7, 1982. A few weeks later, on March 23, General Efraín Ríos-Montt came to power through a coup d’état to the then president Fernando Lucas García&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Breve historia contemporánea de Guatemala|last=Luján Muñoz|first=Jorge|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|year=|isbn=9681666070|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPZqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=breve+historia+contempor%C3%A1nea+de+guatemala&amp;dq=breve+historia+contempor%C3%A1nea+de+guatemala&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkl8a9k_XcAhVJ0FkKHYlxCDkQ6AEIKDAA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Gutierrez also participated with the “Student Committee Against Terrorism” and the “Civil Student Front”, with several publications in the independent journal El Imparcial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/hemeroteca/el-recordado-diario-el-imparcial|title=Surge El Imparcial|last=Prensa Libre|first=Guatemala|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, when he was only 24 years old, takes on a role as a member of the board of the Guatemalan Trade Chamber.

=== Free Enterprise Chamber ===
For seven years he was president of the Free Enterprise Chamber and led one of the first programs of political surveys in the country. The first publication “Guatemala Responde 1987”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biblioteca.ufm.edu/library/index.php?&amp;title=Special:GSMSearchPage&amp;process=&amp;field1=encabezamiento&amp;value1=DEMOCRACIA%20GUATEMALA%20HISTORIA%20&amp;mode=advanced&amp;page=1|title=Cámara de la Libre Empresa|last=|date=1989|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Guatemala Answers 1987) revealed Guatemalan citizen’s opinion about the economic, political and social situation in the first years of Vinicio Cerezo. 

Later, in 1989, he published a second edition “Guatemala Responde IV: Percepciones y opiniones del pueblo guatemalteco después de 37 meses de gobierno democrático” and in 1990, he issues a political&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/biografia?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImZbk__m13QIVwmSGCh3nLwY0EAAYASABEgLH2_D_BwE|title=Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; survey about the voter’s preferences on the presidential elections of that year.

=== Libre Encuentro ===
This was a TV show hosted by Dionisio Gutierrez broadcast in Guatemala, other cities in Central America and the United States during twenty years.  Libre Encuentro &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/libre-encuentro|title=Libre Encuentro|last=Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;encouraged thought and debate among leaders from different sectors of the society, and became a referent for the public opinion in Guatemala, where he reached record rating levels. In his emissions, Gutierrez stirred debate and controversy among guests from all social sectors and experts. In many occasions even abandoning his role as moderator, and participating in the arguments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title="Insoportable Prepotencia"|last=Zarco|first=José Eduardo|date=|work=Prensa Libre, 5/28/2006|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Serranazo ===
Six days after the rupture of the constitutional order perpetrated on Tuesday, May 25, 1993, by Jorge Antonio Serrano Elías&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/un-escenario-politico-similar|title=El Serranazo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which he tried to dissolve the Congress, dismiss the Supreme Court of Justice, the Constitutional Court and the Human Rights Delegate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Serranazo|last=Luján Muñoz|first=Jorge|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Several Guatemalan civil citizens, among whom was Dionisio Gutiérrez, issued a declaration "Given the political crisis the country is undergoing", better known as the document of "Los Abajo Firmantes"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dionisiogutierrez.gt/los-abajo-firmantes/|title=Los Abajo Firmantes|last=Prensa Libre|first=Guatemala|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where they rejected the violations of the Constitution by Serrano Elías, calling him "dictator" and demanding his irrevocable resignation as well as the restitution of the Public Powers of the republic. 

In addition to this document, Gutiérrez, along with other actors of civil society, organized citizen protests, marches and rallies in front of the National Palace, through a platform called the National Consensus Instance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nomada.gt/pais/los-13-dias-de-agonia-del-expresidente-serrano-y-sus-diferencias-con-opm/|title=“Cómo fue el Serranazo, el último golpe en Guatemala hace 25 años”|last=Nómada gt|first=Guatemala|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Presidency of Alfonso Portillo (2000-2004) ===
In early 2003, then president Alfonso Portillo attacks media calling them “clowns”, and stated they were “at the service of obscure interests”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Portillo ataca a la prensa|last=Siglo 21|first=“Portillo ataca a la prensa”|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to Dionisio Gutierrez as “the circus owner”. Dionisio Gutierrez issued an answer stating that “the government called conspirator and subversive to any person who speaks the truth about the President”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Nos gobiernan tres chiflados|last=Sexto Estado|first=7 de febrero de 2003|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Jueves Negro (2003) ===
On July 24, 2003, in the streets of several zones of Guatemala City, the General and former President Efraín Ríos-Montt, in an action that has been described as a "populist ruse"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/hemeroteca/jueves-negro-el-ardid-populista-de-efrain-rios-montt|title=Jueves Negro|last=Prensa Libre, 07/24/2003|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, demanded that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal register him as a presidential candidate, despite being banned for having led a coup d'état.  

A few days before the event, on July 14 of that year, the Constitutional Court issued a decision denying the petition. For this reason, on Monday, July 21, the General indirectly led his followers to rebellion, and warned that he would not be held responsible if the protests got out of control.

On July 24, several people took different points of the city, and one of the most threatened places was the Centro Empresarial building, where the corporate offices of Multi Inversiones  is located. One of the most fierce opponents of the inscription of Ríos Montt was Dionisio Gutierrez. According to Prensa Libre: &lt;blockquote&gt;'''''“That day, the lives of hundreds of employees in that building was put at risk, because several tires were set on fire, which made the air unbreathable, and the mob threatened to burn the building”.'''''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After being besieged for twelve hours, 900 people who had been trapped in the Centro Empresarial building were rescued and the protesters withdrew. The damage to property, life and production was invaluable.

==== Opposition to the government of the UNE (2010) ====
On Thursday, July 1, 2010, the government of then President Álvaro Colom denounced a "destabilization plan composed of attacks on security forces and reports in some media outlets" in the public complaint, the president accused Dionisio Gutiérrez as one of the responsible for that plan. In response, the businessman said "With all due respect, I ask you not to fall into the totalitarian trap".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dionisiogutierrez.gt/gutierrez-pide-a-colom-evitar-caer-en-tentacion-totalitaria/|title=Gutiérrez pide a Colom evitar caer en tentación totalitaria|last=Siglo 21, 7/05/2010|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Months later, Dionisio Gutiérrez started one of the most controversial episodes of 2010 due to a comment against President Álvaro Colom and his wife Sandra Torres at the National Entrepreneurs Conference.&lt;ref&gt;''El Periódico''. Guatemala, viernes 24 de diciembre de 2010. Página 4.&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident, Dionisio Gutierrez ended up taking distance from the “Libre Encuentro" program and the country, alleging, among other reasons, the "evident increase in  forms of harassment and intimidation, even constant death threats" against him&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/noticias/justicia/Dionisio-Gutierrez-programa-Libre-Encuentro_0_355764450.html|title=Dionisio Gutiérrez deja el programa Libre Encuentro|last=Prensa Libre|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo==
In 2012, already back in Guatemala City, Dionisio Gutiérrez created the Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo (Freedom and Development Foundation), which is an independent, private and proactive think tank dedicated to the study and analysis of social, economic and political issues to promote values and principles of a free society. As president of the Foundation, Gutiérrez leads a team of intellectuals with whom he works in multiple civic activities and develops the articulation of long-term state proposals for Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/somos|title=Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo|last=Quienes somos|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dimensión ===
On January 27, 2013 was born the television show "Dimension", sponsored by the Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo, which was broadcast weekly on Canal 3, under the direction of Dionisio Gutiérrez until August 2018. The show dealt with social issues and tried to promote participation "to generate reflection on the complex problems that afflict Guatemalan and Central American societies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/dimension|title=Dimensión|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confrontation with the Partido Patriota Government (2015) ===
In August 2015, following the announcement of the participation of Vice President Roxana Baldetti and President of the Republic Otto Pérez Molina in a structure dedicated to customs fraud in Guatemala known as La Línea, Dionisio Gutiérrez asks the resignation of the then President Otto Pérez Molina in a Public Letter from the Libertad y Desarrollo Foundation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://republica.gt/2015/08/24/dionisio-gutierrez-a-perez-molina-general-marchese-usted/|title=Dionisio Gutiérrez a Pérez Molina: “General, márchese usted”|last=República GT, 08/24/2015|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an interview in a local media outlet, Dionisio Gutiérrez said about Otto Pérez Molina:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''“An individual I met in the Serranazo days, and with whom I no longer had a significant contact until the end of 2010, when he was the most persecuted opposition politician, and I was the most persecuted civil citizen by the government of the UNE party. And four months after he was appointed President, I denounced his would be another government taking Guatemala towards lost paths”.''''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/dionisio-gutierrez-esta-claro-el-lado-correcto-de-la-historia-para-que-el-pais-avance|title=Dionisio Gutiérrez: Está claro el lado correcto de la historia para que Guatemala avance|last=Prensa Libre, 03/05/2018|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Encuentros Ciudadanos ===
In September 2016, through the Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo, Dionisio Gutierrez opened the first Encuentros Ciudadano (Citizen Encounters) with a speech focused on inequality in the country. Since then, these meetings have become an annual experience that is replicated in other cities in Guatemala, where key personalities from different sectors of the society get together to discuss about different topics of national interest. In April 2017, the second Encuentro Ciudadano was held, in which the country reality was analyzed, with emphasis in politics, inequality and underdevelopment. 

On March 7, 2018, the main topic on the third Encuentro Ciudadano focused on the importance of the fight against corruption in Guatemala. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fundacionlibertad.com/seccion/eventos/encuentros-ciudadanos|title=Encuentros Ciudadanos|last=Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Then Attorney General Thelma Aldana and the Chief of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), Iván Velásquez were invited as panelists, the latter participated through a pre-recorded interview. In his keynote, Gutierrez said that president Jimmy Morales had not been invited and encouraged him to “''stop shaming Guatemala''” and to “''stop representing the obscure forces that don’t want the country to change. Your actions contradict your words''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/el-tercer-encuentro-ciudadano-estado-democratico-o-capturado-lo-preside-dionisio-gutierrez|title=Tercer Encuentro Ciudadano {{!}} Participantes coinciden en que prevalece captura del Estado|last=Prensa Libre, Guatemala|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Position regarding CICIG and the fight against corruption ===
In late February 2018, Gutierrez makes a public appearance, in the days of the formation of the Frente Ciudadano Contra la Corrupción (Citizen Front Against Corruption), formed by businessmen, activists, Mayan authorities, communicators and several personalities from the society, who manifested their commitment in the fight against corruption and impunity in Guatemala, and also their commitment to support the permanence of Iván Velásquez as Chief of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), and the work of Thelma Aldana as Attorney General of the Ministerio Público.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elperiodico.com.gt/nacion/2018/02/28/diversos-sectores-conforman-frente-ciudadano-contra-la-corrupcion/|title=“Diversos sectores conforman Frente Ciudadano Contra la Corrupción”|last=El periódico, Guatemala|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Gutierrez at the front of the fight against corruption has earned him several criticism from different sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elfaro.net/es/201809/centroamerica/22405/Siete-tesis-para-el-desconcierto-de-Guatemala.htm?st-full_text=all&amp;tpl=11|title=Siete tesis para el desconcierto de Guatemala|last=Enrique|first=Naveda|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2018, given the smear campaign against CICIG and the lobby that was being made in Washington against the Commission, Dionisio Gutierrez sent a letter to twelve Senators and Congressmen of the United States, about the importance of the permanence of CICIG in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dionisiogutierrez.gt/carta-de-dionisio-gutierrez-a-senadores-y-congresistas-de-estados-unidos/|title=Carta a Senadores y Congresistas de Estados Unidos|last=Dionisiogutiérrez.gt|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that letter, Gutierrez lists a number of prosecuted officials by the Guatemalan justice due to corruption. He also stated that CICIG “has demonstrated its ability to bring justice to Guatemala, and for the first time in recent history, let Guatemalans have trust and faith in their government institutions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guatevision.com/noticias/nacional/empresario-dionisio-gutierrez-envia-carta-a-senadores-de-eeuu-por-cicig/|title=Empresario Dionisio Gutierrez envía carta a senadores de EEUU por CICIG|last=Guatevisión|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Razón de Estado==
On September 19, 2018, after three years away from the television, Dionisio Gutierrez makes a comeback to the screen with the show “Razón de Estado”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dionisiogutierrez.gt/razon-de-estado/|title=Razón de Estado|last=Dionisiogutierrez.gt|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast through Guatevisión channel, on Wednesdays at 9:30 PM. According to the show’s website, “it is a tribune for debate and reflection, engaged with freedom, democracy, and rule of law”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dionisiogutierrez.gt/television/|title=Razón de Estado|last=Dionisio Gutiérrez|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several content formats are used in this show: documentaries, interviews, discussion panels, and coverages.

==Awards, acknowledgments and relevant positions==
In 2012, the Power Awards and the American Business Council Foundation of the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.estrategiaynegocios.net/empresasymanagement/empresas/460363-330/poder-awards-reconoce-al-dr-dionisio-gutierrez|title=Poder Awards reconoce al Dr. Dionisio Gutiérrez|last=Estrategia y Negocios|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognized the efforts and trajectory of  Gutiérrez by bestowing upon him the award “Empowering Democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/GUATEMALA/es/Embajada/Documents/boletin%20n%C2%BA%2024.pdf|title=El Embajador impone la condecoraciones a Dionisio Gutiérrez y a la Hermana Uti|last=Exteriorres.gob.es|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, His Majesty, King Felipe VI of Spain, awarded him the high honor of the Order of Civil Merit in Commendation to Gutiérrez.

He is also a founder and trustee of the School of Government in Guatemala, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edg.org.gt/|title=Escuela de Gobierno|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an educational entity whose mission is to transform the way government and politics are conducted in Guatemala.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10398">[[File:Intel Board of Directors.jpg|thumb|320x320px|Intel Board of Directors]]
A '''director''' is a person from a group of managers who leads or supervises a particular area of a company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/director.html|title=What is director? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[corporation|Companies]] that use this term often have many directors spread throughout different business functions or roles (e.g. director of [[human resources]]).&lt;ref name="about.com Human Resources"&gt;{{cite web |author=Heathfield, Susan M |url=http://humanresources.about.com/od/jobdescriptions/a/HR_Director.htm |title=Sample Human Resources Director Job Description |publisher=about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director usually reports directly to a [[vice president]] or to the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] directly in order to let them know the progress of the organization. Large organizations also sometimes have assistant directors or deputy directors. ''Director'' commonly refers to the lowest level of executive in an organization, but many large companies use the title of ''associate director'' more frequently. Some companies also have regional directors and area directors. Regional directors are present in companies that are organized by location and have their departments under that. They are responsible for the operations for their particular country. Though directors are the first stage in the executive team, area directors are seen as higher up, based on their area of control.

==Corporate titles==
{{Main|Corporate title}}
Corporate titles (commonly known as business titles) are titles given to individuals within a business depending on the role they have and which also portray the duties and responsibilities within that specific role. The larger the business, the more titles that are present, such as CEO, COO and executive directors.

Those that have higher roles within a company such as the elite positions are often referred to as "chief" and those that have lower roles within the company are employees that simply carry out day-to-day tasks. There are many titles within a company such as executive director, managing director, company director and chairman.

The corporate structure consists of four key areas:
* Board of directors- oversees a department and maintains full operational responsibilities area is next to the C-level executives in the corporate jobs hierarchy. They oversee daily tasks of the business or the company.
* Employees- This role is ranked at the bottom of the structure. Employees work on daily tasks and objectives either in a group or individually aiming for that common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hierarchystructure.com/corporate-jobs-hierarchy/|title = Corporate titles|date = 2014-10-22| accessdate = 2014-10-22|website = Corporate jobs hierarchy|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structuring a board of directors ==
Depending upon the size of an organization or a company, the number of directors can vary. Start-up companies can have a single director, which is the minimum for a private limited company according to the law. However, as organizations and businesses expand, the number of directors can increase because more tasks and responsibilities become present. For example, if the company expands and has more than one department, such as finance, sales, marketing, production and IT, then the business may form a board of directors, with each director overseeing a department and maintaining full responsibility within that department.

A board of directors ensures that a clearly outlined structure is in place which will help the business to work much more efficiently.

Larger businesses and organizations will form a clear board structure as the following:

'''Chairman''' - This particular role within the company is often a non executive role that also has the task of overseeing the entire business or organization.

'''Managing Director''' - A managing director is employed by the business, often by the chairman. Other roles include running the business and producing salaries. The managing director manages the board of directors and oversees the performance of the business, thus reporting back to the chairman.

'''Executive Directors''' -  A group of executive directors who each play a significant role within the company. They maintain full responsibility over their respective departments such as Finance, Marketing and Sales. Each director manages their department ensuring that tasks and objectives are being met. Executive directors also sit on the board.

'''Non-executive directors''' -  These advise the business by proposing different forms of strategy and also decide remuneration of the executive directors.

Having a clear structure within the business has a positive impact on the employees and it also helps to organize the business. By having a team of executive directors, employees can report to their executive directors if a problem or an issue occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/structuring-board-directors|title = Structuring a board of directors|date = 2014-10-22|accessdate = 2014-10-22|website = https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/structuring-board-directors|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managing director==
{{Main|Chief executive officer}}

===Roles include===
* Maintaining the overall performance of the company and in particular the departments within.
* Producing and planning strategic operating plans and objectives for the long-term future. Also ensuring all short term targets have been achieved.
* Keeping in regular contact with the board of directors or chairman and to maintain a positive relationship.

== Executive director ==
{{Main|Executive director}}

[[File:San Antonio - Texas Flag.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Texas Flag in San Antonio]]
'''Downtown San Antonio''' is the [[central business district]] of [[San Antonio, Texas]], [[United States]]. It also serves as the urban core of [[Greater San Antonio]], a metropolitan area with nearly 2.5 million people.
In addition to being encircled by Loops [[Texas State Highway Loop 1604|1604]] and [[Interstate 410|410]], Downtown San Antonio is encircled by three Interstate [[freeway]]s: [[Interstate 35 in Texas|I-35]], [[Interstate 37 (Texas)|I-37]], and [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]]. Together, the three highways create a rectangular route around the city's urban core: I-35 to the north and west, I-37 to the east, and I-10 to the south. The rectangular loop has a nine-mile circumference and is known as the "Downtown Loop" or "Central Loop", which encompasses both it and [[Neighborhoods and districts of San Antonio#South Side|Southtown]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Districts==

Downtown is home to many districts including the Alamo District, Alamodome District, Central Business District, Convention Center District, Historic Civic District, Houston Street District, Lavaca District, [[La Villita]] District, Market Square District, North Downtown, River North District, Zona cultural, San Antonio CO-OP district, River Bend District, [[King William Historic District]], South Flores Warehouse District, SoSo (South of Southtown), [[Southtown Arts District]], Eastbourough, and the University District.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The northwestern corner of Downtown is the Medical District.

The Central Business District is home to the [[Rivercenter]], anchored by a [[Macy's]], an [[IMAX]] theater, an [[H&amp;M]], and formerly [[Dillard's]]. The five-level [[Art Deco]] Dillard's, at the corner of Alamo and Commerce streets, opened in 1887 as [[Joske's]]. Joske's flagship store was {{convert|551000|sqft|m2|-2}} in floor space until Dillard's bought the Joske's chain in 1987. In August 2008, Dillard's moved out of the historic building as a part of a redevelopment plan for Rivercenter Mall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The Rivercenter Mall was built around [[St. Joseph Catholic Church (San Antonio, Texas)|St. Joseph Catholic Church]] after the church refused to move.

[[Image:Enos Kagaba.jpg|thumb|right|Enos Kagaba]]

'''Enos Kagaba''' is a [[Rwanda]]n businessman who, in 2001, was arrested at the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport]] when he attempted to gain entry into the United States.&lt;ref name="Schaack"&gt;Beth Van Schaack &amp; Ronald C. Slye, International Criminal Law and Its Enforcement: Cases and Materials (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
He was initially charged with fraud and attempting to enter the country under false identity. Once the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Human Rights Violators and Public Safety Unit]] (HRVPSU) became aware that Rwanda had issued an international arrest warrant against Kagaba for actions of genocide during the 1994 war in Rwanda, [[Rwandan Genocide|genocide]] charges were also added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/insideice/articles/InsideICE_101204_Web2.htm |title=INSIDE ICE Newsletter: Volume 1, Issue 13: ICE WINS LANDMARK RWANDAN GENOCIDE CASE |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923102422/http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/insideice/articles/insideice_101204_Web2.htm |archivedate=September 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A removal order was then issued.  

This was the first incidence in the United States of a removal order for the accusation of [[genocide]]. The United States used [[18 U.S.C. §2340a]] to establish jurisdiction over Kagaba.&lt;ref name="Schaack"/&gt; This statute granted jurisdiction over an alleged offender if he: a) is a national of the United States OR b) is present in the United States (regardless of whether he or the victims(s) are/were U.S. nationals).

A widely quoted 2007 [[Ecojustice Canada]] report showed those large industrial facilities located within 25&amp;nbsp;km of Sarnia, Ontario, Canada emitted more than 131,000 tonnes of [[air pollution]] in 2005, a toxic load of more than 1,800 kilograms per resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecojustice.ca/publications/reports/report-exposing-canadas-chemical-valley/attachment |title=Exposing Canada’s Chemical Valley-An Investigation of Cumulative Air Pollution Emissions in the Sarnia, Ontario Area |date=October 2007 |publisher= Ecojustice Canada |author1=Elaine MacDonald |author2=Sarah Rang |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particulate Matter==
[[File:Aajimwnaang Resource Centre right next to Dow Chemical in Chemical Valley.jpg|thumb|right|Aamjiwnaang Resource Centre adjoining [[Dow Chemical]] in Chemical Valley, specifically [[INEOS]] Styrolution (formerly Nova)]]
In January 2011, the ''[[Sarnia Observer]]'' noted "Sarnia had by far the highest levels of fine [[particulate matter]] recorded at any of the province's 40 monitoring stations, with significantly [[soot]]ier air than [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], and [[Chatham, Ontario|Chatham]]".&lt;ref name="Shawn Jeffords"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanairalliance.org/node/933 |title=Sarnia’s Dirty Air Clouds New Report Touting Air Pollution Cuts |publisher=Sarnia Observer |author=Shawn Jeffords |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2011, the [[World Health Organization]] reported that "While Canada ranks third in the world when it comes to [[air quality]], Sarnia was ranked the worst city in the country, with the most particulate matter per cubic metre of air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theobserver.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3312431 |title=Sarnia Air Canada's Worst |publisher=[[Sarnia Observer]] |date=27 September 2011 |author=Tara Jeffrey |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pamela Calvert]]'s 2006 documentary on the [[Aamjiwnaang First Nation]], ''The Beloved Community'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsreel.org/guides/belovedcommunity/bcdiscuss.htm |title=The Beloved Community |publisher=California Newsreel |author=Pamela Calvert |year=2007 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; details the startling revelation that the Aamjiwmnaang birth rate of males to females is 1 to 2, the lowest live male birth rate in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/aboriginals/health.html |title=Aboriginal Canadians, Chemical valley |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |author=Mary Ann Colihan |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.elc.uvic.ca/associates/documents/ChemicalValleyAssociatesBackgrounder_June13.11.pdf |title=Environmental Rights--Human Rights and Pollution in Sarnia's Chemical Valley |publisher=University of victoria |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the detrimental effect on birth rates among the First Nation peoples of the area, there is also correlation between Sarnia and [[cancer rate]]s among men—34% higher overall cancer rate than the provincial average, a [[lung cancer]] rate that is 50% higher, a [[mesothelioma]] rate five times higher and an [[asbestosis]] rate nine times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/dying-for-a-living/article789982/ |title=Dying For a Living |author=Martin Mittelstaedt |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=3 April 2009|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a positive note, however, the ''Observer'' also stated in the January 2011 article that, "despite having what has been described as the 'dirtiest air in the province,' Sarnia has reduced its [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] problems by 30% in the last three years" and "Environment Minister [[John Wilkinson (Canadian politician)|John Wilkinson]] said it's the first time in the report's 39-year history pollutants have not exceeded provincial monitoring standards. That translated into a record low of three [[smog]] advisories and five smog days in 2009."&lt;ref name="Shawn Jeffords"/&gt;

Additionally, a [[Lambton County]] document indicates that in 2005, up to fifty-five percent of [[ground level ozone]] and fine particulate matter emissions come from neighboring US facilities.  In fact, the 2005 study "Transboundary Air Pollution in Ontario" states that "Long-range transport and transboundary flow of air pollutants play a significant role in air quality considerations on a regional scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@ene/@resources/documents/resource/std01_079137.pdf |title=Transboundary Air Pollution in Ontario |author1=David Yap |author2=Neville Reid |author3=Gary De Brou |author4=Robert Bloxam |publisher=Ontario Ministry of the Environment |date=June 2005 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water Pollution==
[[Water pollution]] is a serious concern in Sarnia.  A June 2003 [[Ryerson University]] study concluded that the main source of water pollution in the [[St. Clair River]] occurs at the Sarnia Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) due to [[chemical spill]]s and [[Environmental impact of shipping|ship emissions]].  The study goes on to say that "A significant reduction of the pollution to the St. Clair River will only be achieved by improving the quality of the Sarnia WPCC effluent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civil.ryerson.ca/urban/techno/stormwater/studies/6-0-3.htm |title=Pollution Prevention and Control Planning Study |publisher=Ryerson University |date=June 2003 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the city resolved to replace the aging sewer pumps that controlled the effluent.  Minutes of a meeting between Mayor [[Mike Bradley (politician)|Mike Bradley]] and Sarnia City Council state "The cost of repairing the raw sewage pumps is a significant portion of purchasing a new unit. However based on the performance of the existing units over the past 8 years, City staff prefers to look at other manufacturers for replacing the existing [[Fairbanks-Morse]] pumps as they require their second rebuilding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sarnia.civicweb.net/FileStorage/514300623A90480D801412C659F39B33-Water%20Pollution%20Control%20Centre%20rpt.pdf |title=Mayor Bradley and Members of Sarnia City Council Water Pollution Control Centre – Raw Sewage Pump Replacement |publisher=City of Sarnia |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, though, the Water Distribution Report indicated that "It should be noted that no filter effluent turbidity exceeded the prescribed test result for adverse reporting..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.sarnia.on.ca/pdf/2010%20Water%20Distribution%20Report%20-%20LAWSS.pdf |title=2010 Water Distribution Report |publisher=City of Sarnia |date=August 2010 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, the Water Distribution Report concluded that "Note- No inorganic or organic parameters exceeded half the standard prescribed in Schedule 2 of the Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standards."

==Plans for Pollution Improvement==
As a city, Sarnia is committed to the improvement of its pollution, both air and water. The following statements from City of Sarnia Website succinctly establish this position: "As part of the City's commitment to monitoring and improving the environment, the City Council has established a number of committees to advise Council as well as appointing City representatives to outside committees who have an interest in the environment and the preservation of habitats" and "The City of Sarnia has adopted a Smog Alert Response Plan in support of the Ontario Government's [[Air Quality Ontario]] initiative. The initiative is to provide better and more timely air quality information to the Ontario public. City staff are notified of smog alerts and implement the air quality improvement strategies outlined in the City's Smog Alert Plan.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.sarnia.on.ca/visit.asp?sectionid=220 |title=City of Sarnia Environmental Services |publisher=City of Sarnia |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, Sarnia had a record low three smog advisories and only five smog days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanairalliance.org/node/933 |author=Shawn Jeffords |title=Sarnia's Dirty Air Clouds New Report of Pollution Cuts |publisher=The Sarnia Observer |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The County of Lambton reports that from 1995–2008, Sarnia experienced a high of thirteen smog advisories and forty-six smog days, both in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambtonhealth.on.ca/environmental/air/#advisories_to_date |title=County of Lambton, Sarnia-Lambton Smog Advisories to date |publisher=County of Lambton |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shale Gas Controversy==
Despite all Sarnia has done to improve its pollution, there are plans to bring [[shale gas]] into Chemical Valley by pipeline in mid-2013.  This process is environmentally divisive because it necessitates [[hydraulic fracturing]] to extract the gas.  Hydraulic fracturing involves injecting a liquid into rock, shale or otherwise, at very high pressure to extract [[fossil fuels]] such as the aforementioned [[shale gas]].  Environmentalists oppose hydraulic fracturing since it can damage water supplies and produce long lasting toxic deposits, either in the waste water produced, air particulates, or solid forms of the gels or chemicals mixed with the water as part of the process. Supporters tout the employment benefits to an already sagging [[Sarnia]] [[petrochemical industry]]. Business interests seem to have won the argument since the shale gas is expected to flow into Chemical Valley this year, notably to [[Nova Chemicals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theobserver.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3132207 |title=Industry Abuzz Over Shale Gas |publisher=The Sarnia Observer |author=Shawn Jeffords |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warning Sirens==
Due to the risk of hazardous materials incidents (chemical emergencies) occurring in the industrial corridor south of Sarnia, four [[Siren (noisemaker)|sirens]] have been placed in Sarnia south of Wellington Street, three more on nearby the [[Aamjiwnaang First Nation]] reserve, three in [[Corunna, Ontario|Corunna]], and one in [[Point Edward, Ontario|Point Edward]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caer.ca/PDF%20Files/Home%20Emergency%20Preparedness%20Guide%20-%20Final.pdf CAER's Home Emergency Preparedness Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315182436/http://www.caer.ca/PDF%20Files/Home%20Emergency%20Preparedness%20Guide%20-%20Final.pdf |date=2012-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of an emergency requiring immediate action by the public, the sirens are sounded for a three-minute period, serving as an alert to the public to [[Shelter in place|seek shelter indoors]] and to tune to a [[#Radio|local radio station]] for updated instructions. These sirens are tested (and can be heard) every Monday at 12:30pm to ensure proper functioning.  An emergency Command Centre located at the Sarnia Police Station can coordinate deployments of emergency responders during hazardous materials incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caer.ca/warning.html CAER Community Warning System] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907233642/http://www.caer.ca/warning.html |date=September 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foo Choo Choon''' ({{zh|t=|s=胡子春|p=Hú Zichūn}}; AKA “Man with no wang”30 July 1860 - 27 Mar 1921), a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] tin miner, revenue farmer and businessman from [[Penang]] and [[Perak]] was, in his time, said to have been the richest Chinaman in the world.&lt;ref name="Rajes"&gt;Chinese Business Enterprise By Rajeswary Ampalavanar Brown Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996 {{ISBN|0-415-14293-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-14293-9}}; pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinang Gazette, 7 September 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

He was called the "Tin King" and 'the Carnagie of the Orient'. Although his own father was born in Penang, Foo Choo Choon was born in Yongding, in the Fujian province. At thirteen years of age he accompanied his father, Foo Yu Chio ({{zh|t=|s=胡玉池|p=Hú Yùchí}}; 30 July 1860 - 27 Mar 1921), to Malaya where he studied at Penang and worked his uncle's mines in Perak.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Merchants and Businessmen in the Indian Ocean and the China Sea By Denys Lombard, Jean Aubin Contributor Denys Lombard Published by Oxford University Press, 2000; p. 345, 351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaori"&gt;Re-examination of the "Chinese nationalism" and Categorization of the Chinese in Malaya: The Case of the Chinese in Penang, 1890s-1910s by SHINOZAKI Kaori, Ph.D. student, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences University of Tokyo Email: kaoris@pd.jaring.my at The Penang Story – International Conference 2002, 18–21 April 2002, The City Bayview Hotel, Penang, Malaysia, Organised by The Penang Heritage Trust &amp; STAR Publications&lt;/ref&gt; A 1908 profile reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Mr. Foo Choo Choon, proprietor of the Tronoh Mines, and a member of the Perak State Council has had a remarkable career. he is a scion of an ancient family, whose ancestral home is in Choong hang, Eng Teng, Hokien, near Kwantung. His grandfather emigrated to Pinang many years ago and was one of the pioneers of the northern settlement. His father was born in Pinang, but spent most of his life in China. Mr Foo Choo Choon was born on July 30, 1860, and at the age of thirteen came to Pinang to be educated. Afterwards he entered the employment of an uncle who had extensive mining rights at Taiping, and a few years later commenced business on his own account. Subsequently he removed to Kinta, and settling down at Lahat, was soon employing several thousand workmen. Ill-health necessitated a visit to China, and on returning to the Federated Malay States he became connected to the Tronoh Mines owing to the owners abandoning their workings. He visited and examined the place thoroughly, and subsequently obtained a sublease of the land, upon which he decided to install extensive modern plant. Although this decision was not entertained favourably in many quarters, the results achieved have since testified to the wisdom of the proprietor. Mr. Foo Choo Choon's acquisition of wealth has been accompanied by many {{sic|philantrophic}} acts. On returning to China during a famine he built and supplied several public granaries, established schools in his native district, and directed that the revenue of his property there should be used in assisting the poorer scholars. His generosity during the Shantung famine was the means in bringing him to the notice of the Chinese Government, and he received the honorary title of magistrate, with the additional privilege of wearing peacock feathers. Further acts of generosity raised him to the rank of Taotai, and finally, to that of Commissioner of the Salt Revenue. In the Federated Malay States he has been recognised always as one of the most advanced Chinese in educational reform and towards the movement he has contributed largely by instituting and maintaining many Chinese and English schools. Mr. Foo Choo Choon is a naturalised British subject, and is a Fellow of the Society of Arts of England. In addition to the Tronoh Mines, he is proprietor of the Selangor, Sungei Besi, and other mines, is a director of the Kledang Mines, Ltd., The Ipoh Foundry, Ltd., and of the Tanglin Rubber Syndicate, besides owning several estates. He employs some 10,000 coolies. He has always associated himself with public affairs in the Federated Malay States. He is president for the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States of the Chinese Board of Education; of the Pinang Anti-Opium Society; and of the Chinese Widows and Orphans' Association, Ipoh. Mr. Foo Choo Choon is also a member of the State Council of Perak and of the Chinese Advisory Board for that State. He founded the Perak Mining and Planting Association, the Chinese Maternity Hospital and the Chinese Girls' School at Ipoh, and the Mandarin School at Lahat. He is a member of the committee of King Edward VII School, Taiping, and is a patron in the Perak Anti-Opium Society. In 1906, H. I. M. the Emperor of China, by special command, ordered the ex-Viceroy Shum of Canton to confer on Mr. Foo Choo Choon the Order of Merit for his services to his country, and this decoration, together with a gold medal, was sent from China and presented by a special envoy. Mr. Cheah Cheang Lim,&lt;ref&gt;Francis Cooray &amp; Khoo Salma Nasution, ''Redoutable Rerformer: The Life and Times of Cheah Cheang Lim''. Areca Books, 2015. {{ISBN|9789675719202}}&lt;/ref&gt; his cousin, is Mr. Foo Choo Choon's attorney, and since 1894, has managed his business affairs in the native states."

He sat on the Board of Directors of the Eastern Shipping Company, Ltd. - one of nine joint-stock companies registered in Penang in 1907 - whose members also included the Khaw family, Quah Beng Kee (b. 1872), and Cheah Choo Yew.&lt;ref name="Rajes"/&gt;

In the late 1880s, he sublet land originally granted to [[Chung Keng Quee]], father of [[Chung Thye Phin]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mining Magazine: For Minerals Industry Management Worldwide'' Published by Mining Publications, 1909; p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; This, one of his first ventures, was the Tronoh Mine,&lt;ref&gt;The Far East Revisited: Essays on Political, Commercial, Social, and General Conditions in Malaya, China, Korea and Japan By A.

G. Stokes Published by E. Arnold, 1908; p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
''One of the biggest mining ventures in Malaya has been successfully floated in London. A company has been formed to work the land at Tronoh owned by Foo Choo Choon. The company was registered under the name of Tronoh Mines, Ltd., on December 4th. The Capital is £160,000 and the working capital £20,000. The property was examined and reported on by Mr Frederick Wickett M. I. M. E. of Ipoh, and now Manager of the Kinta Tin Mines, Ltd., who has been appointed Manager of the Tronoh Mines, Ltd., and will probably take over at the end of the year. The property will be fully equipped with modern mining machinery and promises to be the largest and the best paying property in the East. The property was very much over-subscribed, 2,000 shares only were reserved for local applications -- Penang Gazette''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''THE MALAY MAIL'' THURSDAY DEC 12, 1901 PAGE 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 he opened one of the largest opencast mines in the country, worked by Sungei Besi Mines Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;The Geology of Malayan Ore-deposits By John Brooke Scrivenor Published by Macmillan and co., 1928; p. 108, 209&lt;/ref&gt; previously owned by Kapitan China Yap Kwan Seng.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; He had a mine in Southern Thailand, known as Tongkah. In 1935 with Choo Kia Peng as partner Foo established Tong Hin Company.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Personalities of Penang By Historical Personalities of Penang Committee, Published by Historical Personalities of Penang Committee, 1986; p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

He once hosted the geologist [[R. A. F. Penrose, Jr.|Richard Alexander Fullerton Penrose, Jr.]], better known as R.A.F. Penrose as Penrose notes in his letters.&lt;ref&gt;"I was treated finely at the house of a rich Chinaman named Foo Choo Choon, at a place called Lahat. He owns a big tin mine. When I left he gave me his photograph." (Life and letters of R.A.F. Penrose, Jr: Y Helen R. Fairbanks and Charles P. Berkey By Richard Alexander Fullerton Penrose, Helen R. Fairbanks, Charles P. Berkey Published by Geological Society of America, 1952; p. 273)&lt;/ref&gt;

Foo Choo Choon and partner Loke Yew defrayed the total cost of the Anglo Chinese School, Ipoh, in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Methodist Schools in Malaysia: Their Record and History By Seng Ong Ho Published by Board of Education, Malaya Annual Conference, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Rev W. E. Horley, founder of the Anglo Chinese School Ipoh, said of him, "In 1905, Mr. Foo Choo Choon, one of the most enlightened Chinese [[:wikt:towkay|towkay]]s in Malaya, built the present Primary Hall and presented it as a gift to the School. I have never met a finer type of a Chinese gentleman than he and it was mainly due to his and Mr. Cheah Chiang Lim's exertions that a monster petition was presented to the Government asking for the suppression of licensed gambling houses."&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Rev. Horley's letter to Dr. L. Proebstel, published in the 1928 Voyager&lt;/ref&gt; When due to an increase in student enrolment, Rev. Pykett wanted to expand the Anglo Chinese School, Penang, Foo Choo Choon, together with two other benefactors donated $6,000 for the purchase of a site at Maxwell Road on April 16, 1895 (See [[Methodist Boys' School (Penang)#Foo Choo Choon|History of Methodist Boys' School]]). To that school also he endowed a well selected library.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; Together with Cheong Fatt Tze and Leong Fee, he founded the Chung Hua School, Penang.&lt;ref name="Kaori"/&gt;

On 9 September 1906, he was made a president of the Penang Chinese Town Hall. In 1913 he was elected as a president of Perak Chinese Chamber of Commerce in and appointed to both the Perak State Council and Perak Chinese Advisory Board.&lt;ref name="Kaori"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

He was very well connected through his business networks, his seats on social, commercial and political councils and bodies. Through marriage he was connected to [[Chung Keng Quee]] and [[Chung Thye Phin]], fellow tin magnates and revenue farmers.

To honor his legacy, the road ''Jalan Foo Choo Choon'' in Ipoh, Perak is named after him.

==Research==
Forrest Iandola and his doctoral research advisor Kurt Keutzer published a series of papers on improving the speed, memory usage, and energy-efficiency of [[deep neural networks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y1lVpBEAAAAJ|title=Forrest Iandola|last=|first=|date=|website=Google Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Iandola, Keutzer, and their collaborators published a deep neural network architecture called [[SqueezeNet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/09/deep-learning-reading-group-squeezenet.html|title=Deep Learning Reading Group: SqueezeNet|last=Ganesh|first=Abhinav|date=|work=KDnuggets|access-date=2018-04-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind SqueezeNet was to develop a smaller neural network with fewer parameters that can more easily fit into memory and can more easily be transmitted over a computer network.

'''Havana Club''' is a brand of [[rum]] created in Cuba in 1934, and now one of the best-selling rum brands in the world. Originally produced in [[Cárdenas, Cuba|Cardenas]], [[Cuba]] by family-owned Jose Arechabala S.A., the brand was nationalized after the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959. Since 1994 it has been produced in Cuba and sold globally (except the United States) by Havana Club International, a 50:50 [[joint venture]] between [[Pernod Ricard]] and the Cuban government. 

[[Bacardi]] also produces a competing product with the same name in Puerto Rico, sold only in the United States. The two companies have engaged in ongoing litigation about ownership of the brand.

== History and production ==
[[File:Roneria Havana Club.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The current distillery in Santa Cruz del Norte]]The Arechabala family founded a distillery in Cardenas, Cuba in 1878.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later renamed Jose Arechabala S.A., the company created the Havana Club brand in 1934, and sold rum under that name in both Cuba and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://delafe.com/cardenas//arechabe.htm|title = Arechabala Industries|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = de la Fé|first = E.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20040329005992/en/Bacardi-Files-Appeal-Asks-Court-Declare-Company|title = Bacardi Files Appeal and Asks Court to Declare Company Exclusive Owner of Havana Club Brand|date = 30 March 2004|accessdate = 11 January 2015|website = Business Wire|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was nationalized by the Castro government in 1960.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Susan|title=Pernod Ricard Loses Appeals Court Ruling in Bacardi ‘Havana Club Fight|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-29/pernod-ricard-loses-appeals-court-ruling-in-bacardi-havana-club-fight.html|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Arechabala family left Cuba for [[Spain]] and the [[United States]].

The Cuban government sold rum abroad under the Havana Club name beginning in 1972, focusing primarily on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.goodwinprocter.com/~/media/Files/Publications/Attorney%20Articles/2006/A_Heady_Mix.pdf|title = A heady mix|last = O'Connell, Jr.|first = Robert M.|date = 2006|journal = World Trademark Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 11 January 2015|pages = 5–10|edition = |issue = November/December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government focused on Havana Club because (unlike the Barcardi family) the Arechabala family had not established plants outside of Cuba and so could not produce a competing brand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba: The Biography of a Cause | publisher=Penguin | author=Gjelten | year=2008|isbn = 9780670019786|first = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was considered a "national jewel" by the Cuban government, and in 1977 manufacturing was moved to a new plant in [[Santa Cruz del Norte]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since 1994, Cuban production and non-US global marketing of Havana Club has continued under a joint partnership between [[Pernod Ricard]] and [[Corporación Cuba Ron]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt;

In 1994, Bacardi began producing rum under the Havana Club name in [[Cataño, Puerto Rico|Cataño]], Puerto Rico using a recipe given to them by Arechabala family members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While originally sold in only a few US states (primarily Florida), production was expanded in 2006, and in 2012, after winning a critical court battle, Bacardi announced plans to sell the rum more broadly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Pernod Ricard/Bacardi trademark conflict ==
The Havana Club trademark has been the subject of extensive trademark litigation in the US, Spain, and World Trade Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joaquín Roy|title=Cuba, the United States, and the Helms-Burton Doctrine|publisher=University Press of Florida|page=55|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jose Arechabala S.A. was nationalized, the Arechabala family left Cuba and stopped producing rum. They therefore allowed the US trademark registration for "Havana Club" to lapse in 1973. Taking advantage of the lapse, the Cuban government registered the mark in the US in 1976.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/incoming/article1941675.html | title=Havana Club rum dispute isn’t over yet | work=Miami Herald | date=20 July 2012 | accessdate=11 January 2015 | author=Whitefield|first = Mimi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand was then assigned by the Cuban government to Pernod Ricard in 1993.

In 1994, Bacardi obtained the Arechabala family's remaining rights in the brand, and began producing limited amounts of rum bearing the name. 922 cases were sold in the US in 1995 and 1996.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = International Business and Economics: Law and Policy|last = Stephan|first = Paul B.|publisher = LexisNexis|year = 2010|isbn = 9780327174677|location = |pages = |last2 = Roin|first2 = Julie A.|edition = 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew litigation from Pernod Ricard.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=55761&amp;ct_id=1 | title=Bacardi wins round in Havana Club fight | publisher=Caribbean Business PR | date=30 March 2011 | accessdate=8 January 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109025423/http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=55761&amp;ct_id=1 | archivedate=9 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pernod Ricard was successful in two of the first three court holdings issued in this litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 2039818|title = Rumble of the Rums: The Battle Over 'Havana Club'|last = Aste|first = Dylan M.|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Contemporary Legal issues|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 19|page = 271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1998, after heavy lobbying from Bacardi, the US Congress passed the "Bacardi Act", which protected trademarks related to expropriated Cuban companies, and effectively ended the first phase of the litigation by eliminating Pernod Ricard's [[Standing (law)|standing]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/19/why-congress-hates-your-cuban-rum.html|title = Why Congress Hates Your Cuban Rum|date = 19 December 2014|accessdate = 8 January 2015|website = Daily Beast|publisher = |last = Mak|first = Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act (also known as Section 211) has been applied only to the Havana Club trademark.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt; The act was ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization in 2001 and 2002, on grounds that it singled out one country (Cuba).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wto.int/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds176_e.htm|title = DISPUTE SETTLEMENT: DISPUTE DS176 United States — Section 211 Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998|date = 2 January 2002|accessdate = |website = World Trade Organization|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States has not yet acted to address the WTO ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cardozoaelj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Farhadian.pdf|title = Stealing Bacardi's Thunder|last = Farhadian|first = Sarah L.|date = 8 June 2012|journal = Cardozo Arts and Entertainment Law Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 320|volume = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a 2005 deadline and requests from the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2008/03/john-beast-bruton-savages-yanks.html|title = John ("the Beast") Bruton savages the yanks ... diplomatically|date = 28 March 2008|accessdate = |website = IP Kat|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the initial round of litigation, a second round of litigation occurred, through both the US Federal court system and the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]], focused in part on the allegedly deceptive nature of the use of "Havana" in the name of a rum produced outside of Cuba.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This round of litigation lasted from 2009 to 2012, and again resulted in a victory for Bacardi.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After this defeat, Pernod Ricard announced plans to market the product in the US under the "Havanista" mark,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2014/12/pernod-moves-step-closer-to-havanista-us-launch/|title = Pernod moves step closer to Havanista US launch|date = 18 December 2014|accessdate = 11 January 2015|website = The Spirits Business|publisher = |last = Hopkins|first = Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bacardi announced plans to extend distribution of Bacardi's version of Havana Club throughout the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/bacardi-havana-club-rum_n_1592027.html|title = Bacardi To Start Selling Havana Club Rum Across The United States|date = 13 June 2012|accessdate = |website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = Harrison|first = Carlos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, Pernod Ricard's ownership of the mark has been upheld in three court rulings, most recently in 2011.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In January 2016, after a thaw in US-Cuba relations, the U.S. government awarded a trademark for Havana Club to the Cuban government, which was "expected to reignite longstanding tension between Bacardi Ltd. and the Cuban government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article54863035.html|title=Cuba prevails in Havana Club rum dispute with Bacardi|last=Whitefield|first=Mimi|date=15 January 2016|work=|access-date=2016-12-06|via=|newspaper=Miami Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trippmickle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/cuban-government-granted-a-u-s-trademark-for-havana-club-rum-1452890441|title=U.S. Grants Cuban Government a Trademark for Havana Club Rum|author=Tripp Mickle|date=15 January 2016|work=WSJ|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacardi appealed the decision, and in 2017, Florida lawmakers asked President Donald Trump to reverse the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/international-business/article57948323.html|title=Bacardi says it’s not over yet in Havana Club trademark battle|last=Whitefield|first=Mimi|date=2 February 2016|work=|newspaper=Miami Herald|access-date=2016-12-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article141553089.html|title=Florida lawmakers ask Trump administration to revoke Havana Club trademark license|last=Gámez Torres|first=Nora|date=2017-03-29|work=Miami Herald|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current sales and marketing ==
[[File:Giradilla.jpg|thumb|upright|The Giraldilla of Havana, used on the Havana Club logo and labeling.]]
Pernod Ricard's Havana Club is the fifth-largest rum brand in the world, with almost 4 million cases sold in 2012&amp;ndash;2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cubacontemporanea.com/en/havana-club-sales-3-percent|title = Havana Club Sales Up 3 Percent|date = 30 August 2013|accessdate = |website = Cuba Contemporanea|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150109041412/http://www.cubacontemporanea.com/en/havana-club-sales-3-percent|archivedate = 9 January 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sold in over 120 countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Its strongest markets include France, and Germany, where marketing plays off the brand's distribution in East Germany during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sun, Sex, and Socialism: Cuba in the German Imaginary|last = Hosek|first = Jennifer Ruth|publisher = University of Toronto Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9781442641389|location = |pages = 27–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, it is also bottled in India, the world's second-largest rum market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-08-19/news/27720124_1_bacardi-white-rum-cuban-government|title = Pernod takes on Bacardi with Havana Club|last = Kurian|first = Boby|date = 19 August 2008|work = The Economic Times|access-date = |last2 = Gupta|first2 = Swagata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pernod Ricard plays heavily on Cuban themes in its marketing, including labeling Havana Club as "El Ron de Cuba" ("The Rum of Cuba").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is one of the most common items brought into the US by tourists returning from Cuba.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To avoid charges of customer deception, Bacardi's Havana Club labeling prominently mentions that it is made in Puerto Rico and is often referred to as "Havana Club Puerto Rican rum".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tushnet.blogspot.com/2010/04/havana-club-rum-from-puerto-rico-not.html|title = Havana Club rum from Puerto Rico not false advertising|date = 15 April 2010|accessdate = 15 January 2015|website = [[Rebecca Tushnet]]'s 43(B)log: False advertising and more|publisher = |last = Tushnet|first = Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pernod Ricard's labeling, originated by Cubaexport in the 1970s, is gold and red, and features the [[Castillo de la Real Fuerza#La Giraldilla|Giraldilla]], a weathervane from the old fort of Havana.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pernod Ricard has announced plans to use similar gold and red labels on their "Havanista" product in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2016, Bacardi announced new branding and plans to sell their version of Havana Club nationally. This will be distilled in Puerto Rico and bottled in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article81034457.html|title=Bacardi evokes Cuba’s ‘golden age’ in taking Havana Club rum national|last=Whitefield|first=Mimi|date=2016-05-31|work=Miami Herald|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IBM Cognos Business Intelligence''' is a web-based integrated  [[business intelligence]] suite by [[IBM]]. It provides a toolset for [[Report#Enterprise/Client reporting|reporting]], [[analytics]], [[Balanced scorecard|scorecarding]], and monitoring of events and metrics. The software consists of several components designed to meet the different information requirements in a company. IBM Cognos has components such as IBM Cognos Framework Manager, IBM Cognos Cube Designer, IBM Cognos Transformer.

==Basic components==
The elements described below are web-based components that can be accessed from most popular browsers (IBM Cognos specifically supports Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer).

===Cognos Connection===

Cognos Connection is the Web portal for IBM Cognos BI. It is the starting point for access to all functions provided with the suite. Using this portal, content can be searched in the form of reports, scorecards and agents, it can be managed, structured and displayed. In addition, the portal is used for multiple functions,  for example to schedule and distribute reports, for creating tasks, administering the server and the access permissions to content available to different users. You can also create shortcuts, URLs and pages.

===Query Studio===

Query Studio allows simple [[Information retrieval|queries]] and self-service reports to answer basic business questions. The report layout can be customized and data can be filtered and sorted.  Formatting and creation of diagrams is also supported.&lt;ref name="Main Documentation"&gt;IBM Cognos 8 Mainly this document for  Documentation,bm
 p.10 [http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/data/cognos/documentation/docs/en/8.4.0/wig_cr.pdf], (04.04.2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Report Studio===

The Report Studio is used to create management reports. It offers two different modes: The professional authoring mode enables users to access the full range of Report Studio functionality. In this mode, users can create any type of report, including charts, maps, lists, and repeat functions.  In professional authoring mode all types of Data (relational or multidimensional) can be used, but dynamic data can not be displayed.&lt;ref name="Main Documentation"/&gt;

The express authoring mode has a more simple user interface, designed for non-technical users. It enables them to create traditional financial or management reports in a more focused user interface. In contrast to the professional authoring mode, the express authoring mode allows the use of dynamic data.&lt;ref name="Main Documentation"/&gt;

===Analysis Studio===

[[File:OLAP drill up&amp;down.png|thumb|alt=OLAP-functionalities|Drill-up and drill-down as example OLAP-functionalities]]
Users can create analyses of large data sources and search for background information about an event or action. [[Multidimensional analysis]] allows identifying trends and understanding of anomalies or deviations, which are not obvious in other types of reports. [[Drag-and-drop]] features, elements and [[Performance indicator|key performance indicators]] can be included in the analysis, [[In-place matrix transposition|rows and columns can be switched]],  [[OLAP cube#OLAP operations|OLAP-functionalities]]&lt;ref name="Hannig Uwe (2008)"&gt;Hannig Uwe (2008), Vom Data Warehouse zum Corporate Performance Management, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lusti (2002)"&gt;Lusti (2002), Data Warehouse und Data Mining, pp.157&lt;/ref&gt; like drill-up and drill-down can be used to get a deeper understanding about the sources of the information used in the analysis.

===Event Studio===

The Event Studio is a notification tool that informs about events within the enterprise in real time. Therefore, agents can be created to detect the occurrence of business events or exceptional circumstances,  based on the change of specified event- or data conditions. A notification may be served by sending an e-mail, its publication in the portal, or by triggering reports. This can be used to handle failure with notification.It is very robust in nature.

===Workspace===
IBM Cognos Workspace (formerly introduced in version 10.1 as IBM Cognos Business Insight and renamed in version 10.2.0) is a web-based interface that allows business users to use existing IBM Cognos content (report objects) to build interactive workspaces for insight and collaboration.

===Workspace Advanced===
IBM Cognos Workspace Advanced (formerly introduced in version 10.1 as IBM Cognos Business Insight Advanced and renamed in version 10.2.0) is a web-based interface that allows business users to author/create reports and analyze information.

==Windows-based components==
* IBM Cognos Framework Manager
* IBM Cognos Cube Designer
* IBM Cognos Transformer
* IBM Cognos Lifecycle Manager
* IBM Cognos Map Manager

==Additional components==

===Go! Office===

The Go! Office component lets users work with IBM Cognos content in their familiar [[Microsoft Office]] environment. The component provides access to all IBM Cognos Report contents, including data, [[metadata]], headers and footers, and diagrams. Users can use predefined reports or create new content with [[#Query Studio|Query Studio]], [[#Analysis Studio|Analysis Studio]] or [[#Report Studio|Report Studio]]. By importing content into [[Microsoft office#Excel|Microsoft Excel]] users can use the formatting, calculation and presentation features. The created documents can then be imported using Cognos Connection, published and made available for other users.

===Go! Search===

In Cognos Connection, you can do a full-text search for content contained in reports, analyses, dashboards, metric information and events. When searching, an index of the prompts, titles, headings, column names, row names, data elements and other important fields is used as base. The full text search in [[Cognos|IBM Cognos]] Go! Search is related to the search in regular search engines such as [[Google]]. Users can search operators such as +, - or use "" (quotation marks) to change the default behavior of search queries with multiple words. Search terms are not case sensitive, word and spelling variants are included in the results. You can also search for a specific type of entry, such as an agent. The search results are sorted in descending order, the entry with the greatest amount of relevant metadata is displayed at the top of the list. In [[#Analysis Studio|Analysis Studio]], [[#Query Studio|Query Studio]] and IBM Cognos Viewer, you can either perform a full text search, as also search for content related to the data of the current view.&lt;ref name="Go! Search"&gt;IBM Go! Search Documentation, p.59 [http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/data/cognos/documentation/docs/en/8.4.0/ug_search.pdf],(04.04.2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Go! Dashboards===

With IBM Cognos Go! Dashboard, interactive [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboards]] containing IBM Cognos content and external data '''sources''' '''can''' be '''created''' to fit the information needs of an individual user.

The following items can be added to a dashboard:&lt;br /&gt;
Report objects, they are displayed in a Cognos Viewer portlet. Report parts such as lists, crosstabs, and charts are displayed in interactive portlets. Lists or crosstabs can be displayed as a chart and vice versa. Content can be shown or hidden dynamically by the use of sliders and checkboxes. The Cognos Search portlet allows searching for published content. In addition, Web links, Web pages, RSS feeds, and images can be displayed on the dashboard.
&lt;ref name="Go! Dashboard"&gt;IBM Go! Dashboard Documentation, p. 7 [http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/data/cognos/documentation/docs/en/8.4.0/ug_exd.pdf],(25.04.2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The user interface has two modes: In the interactive mode, existing dashboards are viewed and interacted with, creating and editing of dashboards can be done in assembly mode.&lt;ref name="Go! Dashboard" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15300">'''Intention to create legal relations'''', otherwise "'''intention to be legally bound'''", is a [[Contract theory|doctrine]] used in [[contract law]], particularly [[English contract law]] and related [[common law]] jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt; As in the New Zealand case of ''[[Welch v Jess]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine establishes whether a court should presume that parties to an agreement wish it to be enforceable at law, and it states that an [[agreement in English law|agreement]] is legally enforceable only if the parties are deemed to have intended it to be a binding contract.

==Identifying intention to create legal relations==
A contract is a legally binding [[Meeting of minds|agreement]]. Once an offer has been accepted, there is an agreement, but not necessarily a contract. The element that converts any agreement into a true contract is "intention to create legal relations". There must be evidence that the parties intended the agreement to be subject to the law of contract. If evidence of intent is found, the agreement gives rise to legal obligations whereby any party in breach may be sued.

In [[English law]], there are '''two''' judicial devices to help a court to decide whether there is intent: the earlier '''[[objective test]]''', &amp; the later '''[[rebuttable presumption]]'''. Both tests are used together in combination.

* '''The objective test'''
[[Image:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|right|The reasonable man would deem that the [[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company|Company's]] offer was intended to be binding.]]
Counterintuitively, the best way of discovering whether the parties intended to contract is '''not''' to ask them, as this "subjective test"  would give the rogue an easy loophole to escape liability. (He would reply, "No!".) Instead, just as in ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893] 1 QB 256&lt;/ref&gt; the court applies the "objective test" and asks whether the reasonable bystander, after taking into account all the circumstances of the case, thinks that the parties intended to be bound.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Carlill'', the contract was unilateral, with only one promise, so that only the company was bound.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the advertisement (pictured) stated that the company had "deposited £1,000 in the Alliance Bank to show sincerity in the matter", the court held that any objective bystander who read this would presume an intention to contract.

* '''The rebuttable presumption'''
The rebuttable presumption establishes a burden of proof; but the burden may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.  The civil standard of proof is "a balance of probabilities", while the criminal standard of proof is "beyond reasonable doubt".  Here, different presumptions will apply, according to the class of agreement.  For these purposes, there are four classes of agreement:
* Family agreements: a presumption of NO contract
* Social agreements (i.e. agreements between friends): no presumption (case decided on its merits, using the objective test)
* Commercial agreements: a presumption of a VALID contract
* Collective agreements: a presumption of NO contract

==The four classes==
* '''Family agreements''': a presumption of NO contract
Family agreements are presumed '''not''' to give rise to legal relations, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary. The courts will dismiss agreements which for policy reasons should not be legally enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Koffman, Macdonald, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, [[Lord Atkin]] held in ''[[Balfour v Balfour]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Balfour v Balfour'' [1919] 2 KB 571&lt;/ref&gt; (where a husband promised his wife to pay maintenance while he worked in [[Ceylon]]) that there was no "intention to be legally bound", even though the wife was relying upon the payments. The judge stated that as a general rule, agreements between spouses would not be legally enforceable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The matter really reduces itself to an absurdity when one considers it, because if we were to hold that there was a contract in this case we should have to hold that with regard to all the more or less trivial concerns of life where a wife, at the request of her husband, makes a promise to him, that is a promise which can be enforced in law.&lt;ref&gt;per Warrington LJ, [1919] 2 KB 571, pp. 574-575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
In a more modern case, ''[[Jones v Padavatton]]'' [1969],&lt;ref&gt;''Jones v Padavatton'' [1969] 1 WLR 328&lt;/ref&gt; the court applied ''Balfour v Balfour'' and declared that a mother's promise to allow her daughter an allowance plus the use of a house provided that she left the USA to study for the [[English Bar]] was not an enforceable contract.

However, if there is clear intent to be contractually bound, the presumption is rebutted.  In ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' [1970],&lt;ref&gt;''Merritt v Merritt'' [1970] 2 All ER 760, [1970] 1 WLR 1211&lt;/ref&gt; a separation agreement between estranged spouses was enforceable.  In ''[[Beswick v Beswick]]'' [1967]&lt;ref&gt;''Beswick v Beswick'' [1967] AC 58&lt;/ref&gt; an uncle's agreement to sell a coal delivery business to his nephew was enforceable.  Also, in ''[[Errington v Errington]]'' [1952], a father's promise to his son and daughter-in-law that they could live in (and ultimately own) a house if they paid off the balance of the mortgage, was an enforceable [[unilateral contract]].

* '''Social agreements''': NO presumption, the case being decided solely on its merits
''Although many sources consider "Social and Domestic Agreements" to be a single class, it is better to regard "Family Agreements" as a class  separate from "Social Agreements", as the latter invokes ''no'' presumption, and ''only'' the objective test applies.''

In ''[[Simpkins v Pays]]'' [1955],&lt;ref&gt;''Simpkins v Pays'' [1955] 1 WLR 975&lt;/ref&gt; an informal agreement between a grandmother, granddaughter and a lodger to share competition winnings was binding. Sellers J held, applying the objective test, that the facts showed a "mutuality" between the parties, adding:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If my conclusion that there was an arrangement to share any prize money is not correct, the alternative position to that of these three persons competing together as a "syndicate", as counsel for the plaintiff put it, would mean that the plaintiff, despite her propensity for having a gamble, suddenly abandoned all her interest in the competition in the ''[[Sunday Empire News]]''. I think that that is most improbable ... .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Coward v MIB]]'' [1962],&lt;ref&gt;''Coward v M.I.B.'' [1962] 1 All ER 531 CA&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal held that when a motorcyclist regularly gave a friend a pillion lift in return for some remuneration in cash or in kind, there was '''no''' contract.&lt;ref&gt;The court had so decided presumably to prevent a finding of the bike being used "for hire or reward", beyond the scope of the "social, domestic &amp; pleasure" policy.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, in ''[[Connell v MIB]]'' [1969],&lt;ref&gt;''Connell v M.I.B.'' [1969] 3 All ER 572 CA&lt;/ref&gt; a case with materially similar facts, [[Lord Denning]] (violating the rule that the Court of Appeal was bound by its own decisions) said, "I am not satisfied by the decision in ''Coward''. I think that when one person regularly gives a lift to another in return for money, there ''is'' a contract, albeit informal". In a similar "lifts for friends case", ''[[Coward v MIB|Albert v MIB]]'' [1971],&lt;ref&gt;''Albert v M.I.B.'' [1971] 2 All ER 1345&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] [[Mechanisms of the English common law#TheMechanisms|approved]] Denning's decision in ''Connell'' (so that ''Coward'' may be considered bad law).

* '''Commercial agreements''': Business transactions incur a strong presumption of a VALID contract
[[Image:Handshake (Workshop Cologne '06).jpeg|thumb|right|Business transactions are presumed to be binding contracts.]]
These agreements where the parties deal as though they were strangers, are presumed to be binding. However, "Honour Clauses" in "Gentlemen's' Agreements" will be recognised as negating intention to create legal relations, as in ''Jones v Vernons Pools'' [1938]&lt;ref&gt;''Jones v Vernons Pools'' [1938] 2 All ER 626&lt;/ref&gt; (where the clause "this agreement is binding in honour only" was effective). One must be careful not to draft a clause so as to attempt to exclude a court's jurisdiction, as the clause will be void, as in ''Baker v Jones'' [1954].&lt;ref&gt;''Baker v Jones'' [1954] 1 WLR 1005&lt;/ref&gt; If a contract has both an "honour clause" and a clause that attempts to exclude a court's jurisdiction (as in ''[[Rose &amp; Frank Co v JR Crompton &amp; Bros Ltd|Rose &amp; Frank v Crompton]]'' [1925]&lt;ref&gt;''Rose &amp; Frank v Crompton'' [1925] AC 445&lt;/ref&gt;) the court may apply the ''blue pencil rule'', which strikes out the offending part. The court will then recognise the remainder, provided it still makes sense, and remains in accord with the parties' bargain. The offending clause was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This arrangement is not entered into, nor is this memorandum written, as a formal or legal agreement, and shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the Law Courts either of the United States or England, but it is only a definite expression and record of the purpose and intention of the three parties concerned, to which they each honourably pledge themselves with the fullest confidence - based on past business with each other - that it will be carried through by each of the three parties with mutual loyalty and friendly co-operation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the words "and shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the Law Courts either of the United States or England," are "blue-pencilled out", the remainder becomes legally acceptable, while staying true to the intended meaning.

The party asserting an absence of legal relations must prove it; and any terms seeking to rebut the presumption must be clear and unambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Furmston, Cheshire, Simpson, Fifoot, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Where in ''[[Edwards v Skyways Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Edwards v Skyways Ltd'' [1964] 1 WLR 349&lt;/ref&gt; a bonus payment, described as '[[ex gratia]]', was promised to an employee, this was found to be legally binding. He had relied upon the promise in accepting a redundancy package, and his employer could not adequately prove that they had not intended their promise to become a contractual term.&lt;ref&gt;Furmston, Cheshire, Simpson, Fifoot, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Collective agreements''' : a presumption of NO contract (unless parties agree otherwise in writing)
A [[collective agreement]] is a special type of commercial agreement, such as one negotiated through [[collective bargaining]] between management and [[trades union]]s. At [[English common law|common law]], ''[[Ford v A.U.E.F.]]'' [1969],&lt;ref&gt;''Ford v A.U.E.F.'' [1969] 2 QB 303&lt;/ref&gt; the courts held that collective agreements were '''not''' binding.&lt;ref&gt;In Germany, where employers and employees regard themselves as "[[social partner]]s", collective agreements have always been enforceable; in England, the class war intervened to maintain a mutual distrust, hence the current status of such agreements.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], introduced by [[Robert Carr]] (Employment Minister in [[Edward Heath]]'s cabinet), provided that collective agreements '''were''' binding, unless a contact clause ''in writing'' declared otherwise. After the demise of the [[Heath ministry|Heath government]], the law was reversed.&lt;ref name="Honeyball2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Honeyball|title=Honeyball and Bowers' Textbook on Employment Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sdb1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-968562-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law is now contained in the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] s.179:

:"Any collective agreement made after the commencement of this section shall be conclusively presumed not to have been intended  by the parties to be a legally enforceable contract, unless the agreement:
::(a) is in writing, and
::(b) contains a provision which states that the parties intend that the agreement shall be a legally enforceable contract".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/179 Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 s.179]&lt;/ref&gt;

This reflects the tradition in British industrial relations policy of legal abstentionism from workplace disputes.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} By contrast, in post-war Germany, employers and employees bathe in the luxurious title of "[[social partner]]s", and they are content that collective agreements are binding.

==The Civil Law approach==
In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law systems]], the concept of intention to create legal relations&lt;ref&gt;in Latin: (''animus contrahendi'' or ''obligandi'')&lt;/ref&gt; is closely related to the "will theory" of contracts as espoused by German jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] in his nineteenth century work ''[[System des heutigen Römischen Rechts]]'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, [http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/books/%22199236%22 System des heutigen Römischen Rechts] (1840) online, in German&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a prominent concept through the nineteenth century that contracts were based on a [[meeting of minds]] between two or more parties, and that their mutual consent to a bargain, or their intention to contract, were paramount.  While it is generally true that courts wish to uphold the parties' intentions,&lt;ref&gt;''[[BCCI v Ali]]'' and ''[[HIH v Chase Manhattan Bank]]''&lt;/ref&gt; courts moved in the later half of the nineteenth century to a more objective stance for interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Smith v Hughes]]'' [1871] LR 6 QB 597&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the emphasis moved to the way in which the parties had manifested their consent to a bargain to the outside world. Given this change, it was still said that "intention to be legally bound" was a necessary element for a contract, but it came to reflect a policy about when to enforce agreements, and when not to.

In [[computing]], '''internationalization and localization''' are means of adapting [[computer software]] to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target locale.&lt;ref name="SFW"&gt;{{cite book|title=Software Without Frontiers: A multi-platform, multi-cultural, multi-nation approach|isbn=9780471969747|editors=Patrick A.V. Hall, Martyn A. Ould|others=With contributions and leadership by Ray Hudson, Costas Spyropoulos, Timo Honkela et al.|publisher=Wiley|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding [[Locale (computer software)|locale]]-specific components. Localization (which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization (which is ideally performed only once, or as an integral part of ongoing development).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bert Esselink|url=http://isg.urv.es/library/papers/Esselink_Evolution.pdf|title=The Evolution of Localization|series=Guide to Localization|publisher=Multilingual Computing and Technology|year=2003|quote=In a nutshell, localization revolves around combining language and technology to produce a product that can cross cultural and language barriers. No more, no less.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907235057/http://isg.urv.es/library/papers/Esselink_Evolution.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming ==

The terms are frequently abbreviated to the [[numeronym]]s '''''i18n''''' (where ''18'' stands for the number of letters between the first ''i'' and the last ''n'' in the word ''internationalization'', a usage coined at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in the 1970s or 1980s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/2001/12/Glossary#I18N | title=Glossary of W3C Jargon | publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] | accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.i18nguy.com/origini18n.html | title=Origin of the Abbreviation I18n }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''L10n'' for ''localization'', due to the length of the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n | title=Localization vs. Internationalization| publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies, like [[IBM]] and [[Sun Microsystems]], use the term "globalization", ''g11n'', for the combination of internationalization and localization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/|title=IBM  Globalization|date=17 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as "[[glocalization]]" (a [[portmanteau]] of ''globalization'' and ''localization'').

[[Microsoft]] defines internationalization as a combination of world-readiness and localization. World-readiness is a developer task, which enables a product to be used with multiple scripts and cultures (globalization) and separating user interface resources in a localizable format (localizability, abbreviated to ''L12y'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688110.aspx|title=Software Internationalization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688112.aspx|title=Software Internationalization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[HP-UX]] created a system called "National Language Support" or "Native Language Support" (NLS) to produce localizable software.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

==Scope==
[[File:Globalisationchart.jpg|right|thumb|400px|The internationalization and localization process&lt;br&gt;(based on a chart from the [[Localization Industry Standards Association|LISA]] website)]]

According to ''Software without frontiers'', the design aspects to consider when internationalizing a product are "data encoding, data and documentation, software construction, hardware device support, user interaction"; while the key design areas to consider when making a fully internationalized product from scratch are "user interaction, algorithm design and data formats, software services, documentation".&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

Translation is typically the most time-consuming component of [[language localization]].&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; This may involve:
* For film, video, and audio, translation of spoken words or music lyrics, often using either [[Dub localization|dubbing]] or [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]
* Text translation for printed materials, digital media (possibly including error messages and documentation)
* Potentially altering images and logos containing text to contain translations or generic icons&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* Different translation length and differences in character sizes (e.g. between [[Latin alphabet]] letters and [[Chinese characters]]) can cause layouts that work well in one language to work poorly in others&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* Consideration of differences in [[dialect]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]]&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* Writing conventions like:
** Formatting of numbers (especially [[decimal separator]] and [[digit grouping]])
** [[Date and time representation by country|Date and time format]], possibly including use of different calendars

=== Standard locale data ===

[[Computer software]] can encounter differences above and beyond straightforward translation of words and phrases, because computer programs can generate content dynamically.  These differences may need to be taken into account by the internationalization process in preparation for translation. Many of these differences are so regular that a conversion between languages can be easily automated. The [[Common Locale Data Repository]] by [[Unicode]] provides a collection of such differences. Its data is used by major [[operating system]]s, including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Debian]], and by major Internet companies or projects such as [[Google]] and the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Examples of such differences include:
* Different "scripts" in different [[writing systems]] use different [[Character (symbol)|characters]] - a different set of letters, syllograms, logograms, or symbols.  Modern systems use the [[Unicode]] standard to represent many different languages with a single [[character encoding]].
* [[Writing direction]] is left to right in most European languages, right-to-left in Hebrew and Arabic, or both in [[boustrophedon]] scripts, and optionally vertical in some Asian languages.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* [[Complex text layout]], for languages where characters change shape depending on context
* Capitalization exists in some scripts and not in others
* Different languages and writing systems have different [[Collation|text sorting]] rules
* Different languages have different [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral systems]], which might need to be supported if [[Western Arabic numerals]] are not used
* Different languages have different pluralization rules, which can complicate programs that dynamically display numerical content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/gettext/Plural-forms.html|title=GNU gettext utilities: Plural forms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other grammar rules might also vary, e.g. [[genitive]].
* Different languages use different punctuation (e.g. quoting text using double-quotes (" ") as in English, or [[guillemet]]s (« ») as in French)
* [[Keyboard shortcut]]s can only make use of buttons actually on the [[keyboard layout]] which is being localized for.  If a shortcut corresponds to a word in a particular language (e.g. Ctrl-s stands for "save" in English), it may need to be changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://languagetranslationsservices.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/do-we-need-to-localize-keyboard-shortcuts/ languagetranslationsservices.wordpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403113353/http://languagetranslationsservices.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/do-we-need-to-localize-keyboard-shortcuts/ |date=April 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National conventions ===

Different  countries have different economic conventions, including variations in:
* [[Paper size]]s
* [[Broadcast television systems]] and popular [[storage media]]
* [[National conventions for writing telephone numbers|Telephone number formats]]
* [[Address (geography)#Mailing address format by country|Postal address formats]], [[postal code]]s, and choice of delivery services
* [[Currency]] ([[Currency symbol|symbols]], positions of currency markers, and reasonable amounts due to different [[inflation]] histories) - [[ISO 4217]] codes are often used for internationalization
* [[System of measurement]]
* [[Battery sizes]]
* [[Mains electricity by country|Voltage and current standards]]
In particular, the United States and Europe differ in most of these cases. Other areas often follow one of these.

Specific third-party services, such as online maps, weather reports, or [[payment service provider]]s, might not be available worldwide from the same carriers, or at all.

[[Time zone]]s vary across the world, and this must be taken into account if a product originally only interacted with people in a single time zone.  For internationalization, [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is often used internally and then converted into a local time zone for display purposes.

Different countries have different legal requirements, meaning for example:
* [[Compliance (regulation)|Regulatory compliance]] may require customization for a particular jurisdiction, or a change to the product as a whole, such as:
** [[Privacy law]] compliance
** Additional [[disclaimer]]s on a web site or packaging
** Different consumer labelling requirements
** Compliance with [[export restrictions]] and regulations on [[encryption]]
** Compliance with an [[Internet censorship]] regime or [[subpoena]] procedures
** Requirements for [[accessibility]]
** Collecting different taxes, such as [[sales tax]], [[value added tax]], or [[customs duties]]
** Sensitivity to different political issues, like [[:Category:Geographical naming disputes|geographical naming disputes]] and [[Border dispute|disputed borders]] shown on maps (e.g., India has proposed a controversial bill that would make failing to show [[Kashmir]] and other areas as intended by the government a crime&lt;ref name="HaiderPakistan16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1258908/pakistan-expresses-concern-over-indias-controversial-maps-bill |title=Pakistan expresses concern over India's controversial 'maps bill' |author=Haider, M. |work=Dawn |publisher=Pakistan Herald Publication (Pvt.) Ltd |date=17 May 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HamdaniChanging16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/34594/changing-maps-will-not-mean-kashmir-is-a-part-of-you-india/ |title=Changing maps will not mean Kashmir is a part of you, India |author=Hamdani, Y.L. |work=The Express Tribune Blogs |publisher=Express Tribune News Network |date=18 May 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CourierAnOver17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://madrascourier.com/policy/an-overview-of-the-geospatial-information-regulation-bill/ |title=An Overview Of The Geospatial Information Regulation Bill |author=Madrad Courier |work=Madras Courier |publisher=Vipra Holdings Ltd |date=24 July 2017 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Government-assigned numbers have different formats (such as passports, [[Social Security Number]]s and other [[national identification number]]s)

Localization also may take into account differences in culture, such as:
* [[List of holidays by country|Local holidays]] 
* [[Personal name]] and [[title]] conventions
* [[Aesthetics]]
* Comprehensibility and cultural appropriateness of images and [[color symbolism]]
* [[Ethnicity]], clothing, and [[socioeconomic status]] of people and architecture of locations pictured
* Local customs and [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], such as social taboos, popular local religions, or superstitions such as [[blood types in Japanese culture]] vs. astrological signs in other cultures

==Business process for internationalizing software==
In order to ''internationalize'' a product, it is important to look at a variety of markets that the product will foreseeably enter.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

Details such as field length for street addresses, unique format for the address, ability to make the postal code field optional to address countries that do not have postal codes or the state field for countries that do not have states, plus the introduction of new registration flows that adhere to local laws are just some of the examples that make internationalization a complex project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccjk.com/what-is-internationalization-i18n-localization-l10n-and-globalization-g11n/ Internationalizing a Product: What is Internationalization (i18n), Localization (L10n) and Globalization (g11n)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114350/http://www.ccjk.com/what-is-internationalization-i18n-localization-l10n-and-globalization-g11n/ |date=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Address Formats|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc195167.aspx|work=Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader approach takes into account cultural factors regarding for example the adaptation of the business process logic or the inclusion of individual cultural (behavioral) aspects.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pawlowski, J.M. (2008): Culture Profiles: Facilitating Global Learning and Knowledge Sharing. Proc.
of ICCE 2008, Taiwan, Nov. 2008.  [http://users.jyu.fi/~japawlow/culture_profiles_pawlowski_draft20080901.pdf Draft Version]&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the 1990s, companies such as [[Groupe Bull|Bull]] used [[machine translation]] ([[Systran]]) in large scale, for all their translation activity: human translators handled pre-editing (making the input machine-readable) and [[post-editing]].&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

==Engineering==

Both in re-engineering an existing software or designing a new internationalized software, the first step of internationalization is to split each potentially locale-dependent part (whether code, text or data) into a separate module.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;&lt;!-- § 4.3.1 --&gt; Each module can then either rely on a standard library/dependency or be independently replaced as needed for each locale.

The current prevailing practice is for applications to place text in resource strings which are loaded during program execution as needed.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; These strings, stored in resource files, are relatively easy to translate. Programs are often built to reference resource libraries depending on the selected locale data.

The storage for translatable and translated strings is sometimes called a message catalog&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; as the strings are called messages. The catalog generally comprises a set of files in a specific localization format and a standard library to handle said format. One [[software library]] and format that aids this is [[gettext]].

Thus to get an application to support multiple languages one would design the application to select the relevant language resource file at runtime. The code required to manage data entry verification and many other locale-sensitive data types also must support differing locale requirements. Modern development systems and operating systems include sophisticated libraries for international support of these types, see also [[#Standard locale data|Standard locale data]] above.

Many localization issues (e.g. writing direction, text sorting) require more profound changes in the software than text translation. For example, [[OpenOffice.org]] achieves this with compilation switches.

==Process==

A globalization method includes, after planning, three implementation steps: internationalization, localization and quality assurance.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

To some degree (e.g. for [[quality assurance]]), development teams include someone who handles the basic/central stages of the process which then enable all the others.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; Such persons typically understand foreign languages and cultures and have some technical background. Specialized technical writers are required to construct a culturally appropriate syntax for potentially complicated concepts, coupled with engineering resources to deploy and test the localization elements.

Once properly internationalized, software can rely on more decentralized models for localization: [[free and open source software]] usually rely on self-localization by end-users and volunteers, sometimes organized in teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38928-3_11|title=A Preliminary Analysis of Localization in Free Software: How Translations Are Performed|last=Reina|first=Laura Arjona|last2=Robles|first2=Gregorio|last3=González-Barahona|first3=Jesús M.|date=2013-06-25|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642389276|editor-last=Petrinja|editor-first=Etiel|series=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|pages=153–167|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38928-3_11|editor-last2=Succi|editor-first2=Giancarlo|editor-last3=Ioini|editor-first3=Nabil El|editor-last4=Sillitti|editor-first4=Alberto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[KDE3]] project, for example, has been translated into over 100 languages;&lt;ref&gt;For the current list see [http://l10n.kde.org/teams-list.php KDE.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[MediaWiki]] in 270 languages, of which 100 mostly complete {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Group_statistics|title=Translating:Group statistics - translatewiki.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When translating existing text to other languages, it is difficult to maintain the parallel versions of texts throughout the life of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/feature/58406/sponsored-feature-how-to-translate-a-game-into-20-languages-and-avoid-going-to-hell/|title=How to translate a game into 20 languages and avoid going to hell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a message displayed to the user is modified, all of the translated versions must be changed.

==Commercial considerations==

In a commercial setting, the benefit from localization is access to more markets. In the early 1980s, [[Lotus 1-2-3]] took two years to separate program code and text and lost the market lead in Europe over [[Microsoft Multiplan]].&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; MicroPro found that using an Austrian translator for the West German market caused its [[WordStar]] documentation to, an executive said, not "have the tone it should have had".&lt;ref name="schrage19850217"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/02/17/ibm-wins-dominance-in-european-computer-market/bdcb9e21-8107-4dad-88d7-713f2709a8d8/ |title=IBM Wins Dominance in European Computer Market |last=Schrage |first=Michael |date=1985-02-17 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2018-08-29 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are considerable costs involved, which go far beyond engineering. Further, business operations must adapt to manage the production, storage and distribution of multiple discrete localized products, which are often being sold in completely different currencies, regulatory environments and tax regimes.

Finally, sales, marketing and technical support must also facilitate their own operations in the new languages, in order to support customers for the localized products. Particularly for relatively small language populations, it may thus never be economically viable to offer a localized product. Even where large language populations could justify localization for a given product, and a product's internal structure already permits localization, a given software developer or publisher may lack the size and sophistication to manage the ancillary functions associated with operating in multiple locales.

'''Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Base''' (LADOL), officially '''LADOL Free Zone''', also known as '''LADOL Base''' or the initials '''LFZ''', is an industrial [[Special Economic Zone|Free Zone]] privately owned logistics and engineering facility located on an island  in the Port of [[Apapa]], [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]].

LADOL was designed to provide logistics, engineering and other support services to offshore oil &amp; gas exploration and production companies operating in and around West Africa.

== History ==
[[File:Ladol Activity at quay.jpg|thumb]]
LADOL's developer, LiLe, began the construction of the logistics and engineering base in 2001 and commenced full operations in 2006. In June 2006, LADOL was designated as a [[Free economic zone|Free Zone]] pursuant to the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Act No. 63 1992. Completed at a cost of US$150 million, LADOL's initial infrastructures included: a 200m quay, 8.5m draft, 25-ton/m2 high load bearing area and additional 30-ton bollards at either end that can accommodate up to six [[platform supply vessel|supply vessels]] and three [[heavy-lift ship|heavy-lift vessels]]; a hotel; warehouse; office complex; road; water treatment; and underground reticulation.

In 2015, with the support of [[Total S.A.|Total]] Upstream Nigeria Limited, LADOL was further expanded to include a new US$300 million [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading]] (FPSO) vessel fabrication and integration facility. The FPSO vessel fabrication and integration facility - currently being operated by SHI-MCI FZE, a Nigerian Local Content initiative-driven incorporated [[joint venture]] between [[Samsung Heavy Industries]] and LADOL's [[shipyard]] operator, Mega-Construction and Integration FZE - was initiated to fabricate and integrate Total Egina FPSO in Nigeria and other similar projects expected to be carried out in Africa.

The next phase of LADOL's expansion has been reported to include a [[dry dock]] that will be the largest in West Africa and attract as many as 100,000 direct and indirect jobs.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.thebusinessyear.com/nigeria-2015/future-today/interview| TBY talks to Dr. Amy Jadesimi, Managing Director of Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Base (LADOL), on the company's business model, the joint venture with Samsung, and plans for the near future reported by The Business Year| 2 Mar 2016]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In December 2015, LADOL won the award for ''‘Outstanding Free Zone Integrated Hub Capacity Building Firm for Deep Water Oil &amp; Gas Exploration, Manufacturing and Engineering Services’'' by The [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ladol.com/ladol-wins-award/ LADOL wins award from The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, LADOL won 5 awards in [[fDi Magazine]] Global Free Zones of the Year Annual Rankings 2015.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fdiintelligence.com/Locations/fDi-Global-Free-Zones-of-the-Year-2015-Winners fDi Global Free Zones of the Year 2015 – Winners]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded ''winner of the Sub-Saharan African regional free zones award'' and ''winner of the Large Tenants award'' for Africa. LADOL was also ''Highly Commended as African Free Zone of the year''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ladol.com/ladol-wins-5-awards-in-fdi-global-free-zones-of-the-year-annual-rankings-2015/ LADOL wins 5 awards in fDi Global Free Zones of the Year Annual Rankings 2015]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4572">'''Loren Murphy Berry''' (July 24, 1888 – February 10, 1980) was born in [[Wabash, Indiana]], the son of Charles D. and Elizebeth (Murphy) Berry.  He was a pioneer in the [[Yellow Pages]] business [[telephone directory]] industry.

== Early life ==

His father died when Loren was four years old. His mother worked as a maternity nurse and seamstress, among other jobs, to support herself and Loren. At age eight, Berry prepared and sold horseradish, and had newspaper and laundry routes. In high school, he was a reporter for the Wabash ''Plain Dealer'' and was sports editor and business manager for his school’s monthly publication. As business manager, he gained experience selling advertising space. While selling advertising for timetables that served [[Interurban|interurban railroads]], Berry was asked by the manager of a telephone company to sell advertising space in the company’s directory.  

In 1910, Loren and his wife Lucille moved to [[Dayton, Ohio]], and, on a shoestring budget, began The Ohio Guide Company, printing timetables. He recognized the opportunities for [[Yellow Pages]] and soon concentrated on a telephone directory operation that, as L. M. Berry and Company, developed into a coast-to-coast enterprise and became one of the foremost telephone directory publishers in the United States, handling one out of every four telephone directories in the United States.

His wife Lucille died in 1935 and Loren married Helen, who lived until 1974.

== Mr Yellow Pages ==

Loren Berry became known as "Mr. Yellow Pages." His motto was "It CAN be done!" He expanded his operations to Europe, where the product is called the Golden Pages.  The company sold advertising space and handled production for many of the local Yellow Pages. It was sold to [[BellSouth]] Corp. in 1986. Terms were not disclosed, but industry observers estimated the sales price at more than $1 billion. The subsidiary is operated as The Berry Company and is responsible for more than 800 directory titles nationwide, serving more than 100 U.S. telephone companies and one million advertisers.

Berry established the Loren M. Berry Foundation to oversee charitable gifts to arts, education, and medical research.  These have included gifts to establish the Loren M. Berry Center for Economic Education and Ohio Stock Market Simulation at the [[University of Rio Grande]] and the Loren M. Berry Endowment for the [[Ray C. Bliss]] Institute of Applied Politics at the [[University of Akron]], established in 1990 to support speakers and public programs within the Institute.

Loren Berry was a Republican [[United States Electoral College|Presidential Elector]] for Ohio in 1956 and 1972.  In 1976, Loren Berry was inducted as a member of the [[Horatio Alger Award|Horatio Alger]] Association of Distinguished Americans, which honors the achievements of outstanding individuals who have succeeded in spite of adversity.  In 1982, he was added to the Telephone Hall of Fame honor roll of the Independent Telecommunications Pioneer Association.

On the occasion of his 90th birthday he said, "I've been fortunate to know many people who have shared with me...a faith in the individual's ability to achieve, a willingness to work hard — very hard, and a strong belief in the free enterprise system."

He died at his home in [[Oakwood, Montgomery County, Ohio|Oakwood]] and he and his wives and two children are interred at [[Woodland Cemetery, Dayton, Ohio]].

In 1978, Loren's son John W. Berry endowed the Loren M. Berry Chair in
Economics at [[Dartmouth College]] to honor his father.  John W. Berry was a 1944 graduate of Dartmouth and also donated $27 million for the construction of the Berry Library.  The Berry Sports Center, opened in 1987, was also a gift of the Berry family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">'''Nairobi Business Park''' is a flagship [[business park]] located in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. It was the first business park in [[East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hananews.org/WholeArticle.asp?artId=628 Welcome To HORN OF AFRICA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase, which includes 7,000 square metres of commercial office space, was completed in 2003.

==History==

The Nairobi Business Park was first envisaged by the [[Jockey Club of Kenya]]. The club owned of {{convert|400|acre|km2|1}} of land by the Ngong Road between [[Nairobi]] and [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]]. The club decided to diversify their land use by restructuring their land portfolio. 

Some {{convert|30|acre|m2}} of land was sub-divided from the main block of land and transferred into the joint ownership of the Jockey Club of Kenya and CDC Capital Partners and the Nairobi Business Park Ltd was formed to develop the site, with the Jockey Club of Kenya retaining a shareholding in the development.

===Development of the Business Park===

Various studies were undertaken to define the type of development. An office park was decided upon, and designs made by [[Triad Architects]], a [[Nairobi]]-based architectural firm. The overall scheme included 30,000 square metres of lettable office space, to be developed in phases to suit market conditions.
The business park is managed by [[Knight Frank]] and [[CB Richard Ellis]].

==Today==

Phase 1 of the overall development was completed in March 2003 and consists of three office units. This phase includes 7,000 square metres of lettable space. Parking is provided on site to a ratio of one parking bay per 25 square metres of usable office space.

The offices are designed around a standard modular unit of a core and the two wings. The standard core element comprises WCs, a reception area and circulation. The two wings vary in size from a minimum of 400 square metres to a maximum of 600 square metres per floor.

Several companies have opened offices at Nairobi Business Park, including [[Siemens]] and [[Nokia]].

==History==
Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, the national university of Malaysia was born from the aspirations of the nationalists to uphold the Malay Language as a language of knowledge. The quest for a national university was suggested in 1923 by the writer Abdul Kadir Adabi as a move against British colonisation. This nationalist tide galvanised Malay intellectuals of the time but met British suppression. The nationalists never wavered and in 1969 the movement again blossomed. A Sponsoring Committee chaired by Syed Nasir Ismail, a Malay intellectual, was set up to prepare a report recommending the establishment of UKM. Other prominent members of this committee include Dr. Mahathir Mohamed (Tun), Malaysia's fourth Prime Minister who was then the Education Minister, and Dr. Mohd Rashdan Haji Baba, who later became UKM's first Vice-Chancellor.

Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia opened its doors on 18 May 1970 to 192 undergraduate students in Jalan Pantai Baru, Kuala Lumpur, a temporary campus housing three main faculties, the Faculties of Science, Arts and Islamic Studies. In October 1977, UKM moved to its present premises which form the main campus in Bangi. The campus has a size of {{Convert|1096|ha}}, situated in the metropolis encompassing the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Kuala Lumpur, the main commercial centre, and Putrajaya, the administrative capital. The UKM Bangi Campus is {{Convert|45|km|abbr=on}} from KLIA, {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}} from Kuala Lumpur and {{Convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from Putrajaya.

UKM has two health campuses, the Kuala Lumpur campus in Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, and the UKM Medical Centre in Cheras. The Kuala Lumpur campus consists of the Faculties of Health Sciences, Pharmacy, Dentistry and the Pre-Clinical Departments of the Medical Faculty. With a size of {{Convert|20|ha}}, the Kuala Lumpur campus was established in 1974.

The campus in Cheras consists of the Medical Faculty, the UKM Teaching Hospital and the [[UKM Medical Molecular Biology Institute (UMBI)]]. The Cheras campus was opened in 1997. Besides these campuses, UKM operates seven research stations (RS); The Tasik Chini RS, The Marine Ecosystem RS, The Langkawi Geopark RS, The Marine RS, The Fraser's Hill RS, The Plant Biotechnology RS and in the main campus itself, the UKM Campus Living Laboratory, which comprises the UKM Permanent Forest Reserve, or its Malay name, Hutan Simpan Kekal UKM as well as the Fernarium and the Herbarium.

Based on a foundation of 30 years of research, UKM was awarded the status of a Malaysian Research University in October 2006 by the Ministry of Higher Education, a move designed to propel the four public universities into leading research universities in line with the Higher Education Strategic Plan 2007–2020.

The year 2006 also saw UKM winning the Prime Minister's Quality Award. This award vindicates UKM's efforts at quality education and management, as outlined by the objectives of the UKM Strategic Plan 2000–2020 (PS2020). The Strategic Plan has been augmented by the newly unveiled UKM Knowledge Ecosystem Transformation Plan, a transformation set to catapult UKM into the league of leading research universities by 2018.

When the Times Higher Education Guide University Rankings (THE) was published in October 2014, it was reported that UKM, along with Universiti Malaya, opted to not submit data for consideration. UKM Strategic Centre deputy executive director Associate Professor Dr Masturah Markom responded to the snub by saying that the rankings were unfair to the Malaysian education context. She specifically cited the measurement of "industry income" in the THE methodology of university assessment, stating that Malaysian industry input cannot compete with other countries such as the United States of America. This is despite the fact that only a 2.5% weightage is allocated to "industry income" in the methodology, and more conventional categories such as teaching and research still makes up 90% of the methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/global-education-index-disappointed-um-ukm-snubbed-rankings-poll|title =Global education index disappointed UM, UKM snubbed rankings poll|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141002192815/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/global-education-index-disappointed-um-ukm-snubbed-rankings-poll|archive-date =2 October 2014|dead-url =yes|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/um-and-ukm-defend-snubbing-global-varsity-rankings|title =UM and UKM defend snubbing of global varsity rankings|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141002192936/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/um-and-ukm-defend-snubbing-global-varsity-rankings|archivedate =2 October 2014|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''payment''' is the trade of [[value (economics)|value]] from one [[Party (law)|party]] (such as a person or company) to another for [[good (accounting)|goods]], or [[Service (economics)|service]]s, or to fulfill a [[legal obligation]].

Payment can take a variety of forms. [[Barter]], the exchange of one good or service for another, is a form of payment. The most common means of payment involve use of [[money]], [[cheque]], or [[Direct debit|debit]], [[Credit (finance)|credit]] or [[bank transfer]]s. Payments may also take complicated forms, such as [[stock]] issues or the transfer of anything of value or benefit to the parties. In US law, the '''payer''' is the party making a payment while the '''payee''' is the party receiving the payment. In [[trade]], payments are frequently preceded by an [[invoice]] or bill.

In general, the payee is at liberty to determine what method of payment he or she will accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's [[legal tender]] up to a prescribed limit. Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of the payee, unless if the parties agree otherwise. Payment in another currency involves an additional [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] transaction. The payee may [[compromise]] on a debt, i.e., accept a part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, for example, for payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc. On the other hand, the payee may impose a [[Surcharge (payment systems)|surcharge]], for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc.

The acceptance of a payment by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation. A [[creditor]] cannot unreasonably refuse to accept a payment, but payment can be refused in some circumstances, for example, on a Sunday or outside banking hours. A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge payment by producing a [[receipt]] to the payer. A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as "paid in full". The giving of a guarantee or other security for a debt does not constitute a payment.

==Etymology ==
The root word "pay" in "payment" comes from the Latin "pacare" (to pacify), from "pax", meaning "peace". In the Middle Ages, the term began to be used more broadly, to mean "to pacify one's creditors". As the Latin word was made part of Old French "paier", it retained the meaning "pacify" (and "appease") but gained the meaning "to pay" (as in paying a debt). The Middle English word "payen", which came from French, was also used in both ways.&lt;ref&gt;''The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories''. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
There are two types of payment methods; [[Financial transaction|exchanging]] and [[Provision (accounting)|provisioning]]. Exchanging involves the use of [[money]], comprising [[banknote]]s and [[coin]]s. Provisioning involves the transfer of money from one account to another, and involves a third party. [[Credit card]], [[debit card]], [[cheque]], [[Electronic funds transfer|money transfer]]s, and recurring cash or ACH ([[Automated Clearing House]]) disbursements are all electronic payments methods. Electronic payments technologies include [[magnetic stripe card]]s, [[smartcard]]s, [[contactless smart card|contactless cards]], and [[mobile payment]]s.

== Parties involved ==
Payments may be classified by the number of parties involved in a transaction. For example, a [[credit card|pre paid care]] transaction usually involves four parties (the purchaser, the seller, the [[issuing bank]], and the [[acquiring bank]]). A [[cash]] payment requires a minimum of three parties (the seller, the purchaser, and the issuer of the currency). A barter payment requires a minimum of two parties (the purchaser and the seller).

== Providers ==
The infrastructure and electronic clearing methods are formed by the [[Payment service provider|payment provider]]. Global credit card payment providers are [[Diners Club]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[American Express]] and [[MasterCard]]. [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] and [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]] are international debit card payment providers.

== Interbank ==
The ''central bank CB(Ccy)'' of a currency can maintain a '''loro account''' for a bank (which the bank would call a '''[[Nostro and vostro accounts|nostro]]''' account).

=== Direct ===
A bank ''P'' (the ''payer'') with a central bank nostro can ''pay directly'' to another bank ''R'' (the ''receiver'') which has also a nostro with ''CB(Ccy)'' by instructing the central bank to make a payment of ''N[Ccy]'' (or an amount ''N'' in ''Ccy''). 
The central bank however will only accept ''P''s payment instruction if the balance ''B'' on P's loro account before the payment is ''B≥N''. The payment itself is a booking in the loro accounts of the central bank where P's loro account is debited with ''N'' (it will be ''B-N≥0'' thereafter) and simultaneously ''R''s loro account is credit with ''N'' (its balance ''C'' will be ''C+N≥0'' thereafter).

We denote the payment symbolically with ''[P→CB→R]''.

=== Indirect ===
If the payer ''P'' maintains a loro account for another bank ''X'', ''P'' can act as a payment agent for ''X'':
''X'' instructs ''P'' to pay to ''R''; then ''P'' instructs ''CB(Ccy)'' to pay on behalf of ''X'': [''X→P→CB→R''].

In this example the first half of the payment is ''indirect'' and the second one (from ''CB(Ccy)'' to ''R'') is still ''direct''. If ''X'' would pay via ''P'' to ''R'' and finally to another party ''Y'', the payment would be 'fully indirect': [''X→P→CB→R→Y''].
In practice, not every payment agent might have a direct nostro with the central bank, thus rather weird payment constellations can exist, which are hard to describe.

=== Directness coefficient ''(p,q)'' ===
If we define '''(p,q)''' where ''p'' is number of parties on the sender side and ''q'' on the receiver side, we can classify the directness of payments.

=== ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' Description ===
We denote with ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' the senders and with ''R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' the receivers in a payment process, such that

''R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=CB&lt;sub&gt;CCY&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the central bank of the currency which has 'no' distance (''n=m=0'') to the payment process,

''m,n=1'': the ''direct'' nostro agents of the sender / receiver:  
S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''direct payer''; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''direct receiver'' (or nostro agent)

''m,n=2'': the ''indirect nostro agents'' of the sender / receiver:  
S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''indirect payer''; R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''indirect receiver''

''m,n=3'': the ''sender / payer bank'' :  
S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''sender bank''; R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''receiver bank''

''m,n=4'': the ''sender / payer'':  
S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''sender (payer)''; R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''receiver (payee)''

Here is an (p=q=4) example:

 [sender→sender bank → indirect agent of sender bank → direct agent of sender bank → central bank → direct agent of receiver bank → indirect agent of receiver bank → receiver bank → receiver(payee)]

or
 [S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]

== Global market ==
In 2005, an estimated $40 trillion globally passed through some type of payment system. Roughly $12 trillion of that was transacted through various credit cards, mostly the 21,000 member banks of [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]].  Processing payments, including the extending of credit, produced close to $500 billion in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;McKinsey and Company, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, roughly $377 trillion passed through noncash payment systems.  This led to total account and transaction revenues close to $524 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Consulting Group, [http://www.swift.com/assets/swift_com/documents/products_services/BCG_Global_Payments_Report_2013_Sep_2013.pdf "Global Payments 2013"], September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debit cards ===
In the U.S., [[debit card]]s are the fastest growing payment technology. In 2001, debit cards accounted for 9 percent of all purchase transactions, and this is expected to double to 18.82 percent in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;The Nilson Report, Issue 761, April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cheques ===
{{Main|Cheque clearing}}
Historically, [[cheques]] have been one of the primary means of payment for purchasing goods and services, though its share in the payment mix is falling worldwide. In 2001, in the United States, cheques accounted for 25% of the U.S.-based payment mix; and in 2006, this was projected to fall to 17%.&lt;ref&gt;The Nilson Report&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a cheque as a form of payment can legally be refused for any reason (or no reason).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} A payment by cheque is not a "payment" until the cheque has been cashed (i.e., deposited) and cleared by the banking system.

== Timing ==
The timing of a payment has legal implication in some situations. For tax purposes, for example, the timing of a payment may determine whether it qualifies as a [[Tax deduction|deduction]] in a taxpayer's calculation of [[taxable income]] in one year or the next.

For U.S. tax purposes, [[cash]] payments generally are taken to occur at the time of payment. Payment may also occur when a person transfers property or performs a service to the payee in satisfaction of an obligation.&lt;ref name="donaldson"&gt;See Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 734 (2nd. Ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; A payment by check is normally deemed to occur when the check is delivered, as long as the check is honored on presentation by the payee. This rule also generally applies where the check is not presented to the bank until the next taxable year, and even though the payer could stop payment on the check in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;''Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner'', 12 T.C. 524 (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Postdated check]]s, however, are not considered payment when delivered.&lt;ref&gt;''Griffin v. Commissioner,'' 49 T.C. 253 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, payments by [[credit card]] take effect at the point of the sale and not when a payer is billed by the credit card company or when the payer pays the credit card company's bill.&lt;ref&gt;Revenue Ruling 78-38, 1978-1 C.B. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A business that reports on an accrual basis, would report income in the year of sale though payment may be received in a subsequent year.

Payment of most fees to government agencies by cheque, if permitted, usually takes effect after a set number of days for [[Cheque clearing|clearance]] or until the cheque is actually cleared. Payments by credit card, if permitted, and cash payments take immediate effect. Normally, no other forms of payment are permitted or accepted.

==Spelling==
The spelling "queueing" over "queuing" is typically encountered in the academic research field. In fact, one of the flagship journals of the profession is named ''[[Queueing Systems]]''.

== Single queueing nodes ==
Single queueing nodes are usually described using [[Kendall's notation]] in the form ''A''/''S''/''C'' where ''A'' describes the time between arrivals to the queue, ''S'' the size of jobs and ''C'' the number of servers at the node.&lt;ref name="tijms"&gt;Tijms, H.C, ''Algorithmic Analysis of Queues", Chapter 9 in  A First Course in Stochastic Models, Wiley, Chichester, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kendall | first1 = D.

Markov, Extension of the law of large numbers to dependent quantities, Izvestiia Fiz.-Matem. Obsch. Kazan Univ., (2nd Ser.), 15(1906), pp. 135&amp;ndash;156 [Also [37], pp.
339&amp;ndash;361].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Agner Krarup Erlang]], a Danish engineer who worked for the Copenhagen Telephone Exchange, published the first paper on what would now be called queueing theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pass.maths.org.uk/issue2/erlang/index.html |title=Agner Krarup Erlang (1878 - 1929) &amp;#124; plus.maths.org |publisher=Pass.maths.org.uk |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Asmussen | first1 = S.

* M stands for Markov or memoryless and means arrivals occur according to a Poisson process
* D stands for deterministic and means jobs arriving at the queue which require a fixed amount of service
* ''k'' describes the number of servers at the queueing node (''k'' = 1, 2,...). If there are more jobs at the node than there are servers, then jobs will queue and wait for service

The [[M/M/1 queue]] is a simple model where a single server serves jobs that arrive according to a Poisson process and have [[exponentially distributed]] service requirements. In an [[M/G/1 queue]], the G stands for general and indicates an arbitrary [[probability distribution]]. The M/G/1 model was solved by [[Felix Pollaczek]] in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;Pollaczek, F., Ueber eine Aufgabe der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie, Math. Z. 1930&lt;/ref&gt; a solution later recast in probabilistic terms by [[Aleksandr Khinchin]] and now known as the [[Pollaczek–Khinchine formula]].&lt;ref name="century" /&gt;&lt;ref name="century1" /&gt;

The [[matrix geometric method]] and [[matrix analytic method]]s have allowed queues with [[phase-type distribution|phase-type distributed]] inter-arrival and service time distributions to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ramaswami | first1 = V. | doi = 10.1080/15326348808807077 | title = A stable recursion for the steady state vector in markov chains of m/g/1 type | journal = Communications in Statistics.

;Service facility
*Single server: customers line up and there is only one server
*Several parallel servers - Single queue: customers line up and there are several servers
*Several servers - Several queues: there are many counters and customers can decide going where to queue

;Customer’s behavior of waiting
*Balking: customers deciding not to join the queue if it is too long
*Jockeying: customers switch between queues if they think they will get served faster by doing so
*Reneging: customers leave the queue if they have waited too long for service

==Simple two-equation queue==
A common basic queuing system is attributed to [[Erlang distribution|Erlang]], though its exact origin remains unclear. The queue refers to a single server with one demand rate (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;), one dropout rate (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;), and one rate of service (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;), for which the length of the queue ''L'' is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{\delta-\sigma}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming an exponential distribution for the rates, the waiting time ''W'' can be defined as the proportion of demand that is served. This is equal to the exponential survival rate of those who do not drop out over the waiting period, giving:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sigma}{\delta} = e^{-W{\mu}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second equation is commonly rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt;W = \frac{1}{\mu}ln\frac{\delta}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

The two-stage one-box model is common in epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernández-Suarez|first=Carlos|date=2010|title=An application of queuing theory to SIS and SEIS epidemic models|url=|journal=Math. Biosci.|volume=7|pages=809–823|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queueing networks==
Networks of queues are systems in which a number of queues are connected by what's known as customer routing. When a customer is serviced at one node it can join another node and queue for service, or leave the network.

For networks of ''m'' nodes, the state of the system can be described by an ''m''–dimensional vector (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the number of customers at each node.

The simplest non-trivial network of queues is called [[Jackson network|tandem queues]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~winkel/bs3a07l13-14.pdf#page=4&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant results in this area were [[Jackson network]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = J.

===Routing algorithms===
In discrete time networks where there is a constraint on which service nodes can be active at any time, the max-weight scheduling algorithm chooses a service policy to give optimal throughput in the case that each job visits only a single person &lt;ref name="Manuel" /&gt;service node. In the more general case where jobs can visit more than one node, [[backpressure routing]] gives optimal throughput. A [[network scheduler]] must choose a [[queuing algorithm]], which affects the characteristics of the larger network{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. See also [[Stochastic scheduling]] for more about scheduling of queueing systems.

==Mean field limits==
[[Mean field model]]s consider the limiting behaviour of the [[empirical measure]] (proportion of queues in different states) as the number of queues (''m'' above) goes to infinity. The impact of other queues on any given queue in the network is approximated by a differential equation. The deterministic model converges to the same stationary distribution as the original model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Bobbio | first1 = A. | last2 = Gribaudo | first2 = M. | last3 = Telek | first3 = M.

==Fluid limits==
{{main article|fluid limit}}
Fluid models are continuous deterministic analogs of queueing networks obtained by taking the limit when the process is scaled in time and space, allowing heterogeneous objects. This scaled trajectory converges to a deterministic equation which allows the stability of the system to be proven. It is known that a queueing network can be stable, but have an unstable fluid limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bramson | first1 = M. | title = A stable queueing network with unstable fluid model | doi = 10.1214/aoap/1029962815 | journal = The Annals of Applied Probability | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 818 | year = 1999 | jstor = 2667284| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy traffic/diffusion approximations==
{{Main article|heavy traffic approximation}}
In a system with high occupancy rates (utilisation near 1) a heavy traffic approximation can be used to approximate the queueing length process by a [[reflected Brownian motion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = H. | last2 = Whitt | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1007/BF01149260 | title = Diffusion approximations for open queueing networks with service interruptions | journal = [[Queueing Systems]]| volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 335 | year = 1993 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process]] or more general [[diffusion process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yamada | first1 = K. | title = Diffusion Approximation for Open State-Dependent Queueing Networks in the Heavy Traffic Situation | doi = 10.1214/aoap/1177004602 | journal = The Annals of Applied Probability | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 958 | year = 1995 | jstor = 2245101| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of dimensions of the RBM is equal to the number of queueing nodes and the diffusion is restricted to the non-negative [[orthant]].

The regulation of '''therapeutic goods''', that is '''drugs''' and '''therapeutic devices''', varies by jurisdiction. In some countries, such as the [[United States]], they are regulated at the national level by a single agency. In other jurisdictions 
they are regulated at the [[State (administrative division)|state]] level, or at both state and national levels by various bodies, as is the case in [[Australia]].

The role of therapeutic goods regulation is designed mainly to protect the health and safety of the population. Regulation is aimed at ensuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of the therapeutic goods which are covered under the scope of the regulation. In most jurisdictions, therapeutic goods must be registered before they are allowed to be marketed. There is usually some degree of restriction of the availability of certain therapeutic goods depending on their risk to consumers.

== History ==

Modern drug regulation has historical roots in the response to the proliferation of universal antidotes which appeared in the wake of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]]' death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How Ancient Cure-Alls Paved the Way for Drug Regulation|last=Silver|first=Carly|date=10 January 2017|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mithridates had brought together physicians, scientists, and shamans to concoct a potion that would make him immune to poisons. Following his death, the Romans became keen on further developing the Mithridates potion's recipe. Mithridatium re-entered western society through multiple means.  The first was through the ''Leechbook of the Bald'' (''[[Bald's Leechbook]]''), written somewhere between 900 and 950, which contained a formula for various remedies, including for a theriac. Additionally, theriac became a commercial good traded throughout Europe based on the works of Greek and Roman physicians.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffin|first=J P|date=2004|title=Venetian Treacle and the Foundation of Medicines Regulation.|url=|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=58.3|pages=317–325|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2004.02147.x|pmc=1884566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting proliferation of various recipes needed to be curtailed in order to ensure that people were not passing off fake antidotes, which led to the development of government involvement and regulation. Additionally, the creation of these concoctions took on ritualistic form and were often created in public and the process was observed and recorded. It was believed that if the concoction proved unsuccessful, it was due to the apothecaries’ process of making them and they could be held accountable because of the public nature of the creation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 9th century, many Muslim countries established an office of the ''[[Hisbah|hisba]]'', which in addition to regulating compliance to Islamic principles and values took on the role of regulating other aspects of social and economic life, including the regulation of medicines. Inspectors were appointed to employ oversight on those who were involved in the process of medicine creation and were given a lot of leigh weigh to ensure compliance and punishments were stringent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penn|first=Rg|date=1979|title=The State Control of Medicines: The First 3000 Years|url=|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=8|pages=293–305|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1979.tb04710.x|pmc=1429842}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first official 'act', the 'Apothecary Wares, Drugs and Stuffs' Act (also sometimes referred to as the 'Pharmacy Wares, Drugs and Stuffs' Act) was passed in 1540 by Henry VIII and set the foundation for others. Through this act, he encouraged physicians in his ''College of Physicians'' (founded by him in 1518) to appoint four people dedicated to consistently inspecting what was being sold in apothecary shops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In conjunction with this first piece of legislation, there was an emergence of standard formulas for the creation of certain ‘drugs’ and ‘antidotes’ through [[Pharmacopoeia]]s which first appeared in the form of a decree from [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II of Sicily]] in 1240 to use consistent and standard formulas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drug Benefits and Risks: International Textbook of Clinical Pharmacology|last=van Boxtel|first=C.J.|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern pharmacopoeias were the Florence Pharmacopoeia published in 1498,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the Spanish Pharmacopoeia published in 1581 and the London Pharmacopoeia published in 1618.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Key Issues in Pharmaceuticals Law.|last=Valverde|first=Jose Luis|publisher=IOS Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, regulation of drugs was originally a state right, as opposed to federal right. But with the increase in fraudulent practices due to private incentives to maximize profits and poor enforcement of state laws, increased the need for stronger federal regulation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Law: Regulation of Research, Development, and Marketing|last=Clark|first=Michael|publisher=Bloomberg BNA|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Roosevelt signed the Federal Food and Drug Act (FFDA) in 1906 which established stricter standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A 1911 Supreme Court decision, ''United States vs. Johnson'', established that misleading statements were not covered under the FFDA.  This directly led to Congress passing the Sherley Amendment which established a clearer definition of ‘misbranded’.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another key catalyst for advances in drug regulation were certain catastrophes that served as calls to the government to step in and impose regulations that would prevent repeats of those instances. One such instance occurred in 1937 when more than a hundred people died from using sulfanilamide elixir which had not gone through any safety testing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This directly led to the passing of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] in 1938.  One other major catastrophe occurred in the late 1950s when Thalidomide, which was originally sold in Germany (introduced into a virtually unregulated market) and eventually sold around the world, led to approximately 100,000 babies being born with various deformities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The UK's Chief Medical Officer had established a group to look into safety of drugs on the market in 1959 prior to the crisis and was moving in the direction of address the problem of unregulated drugs entering the market. The crisis created a greater sense of emergency to establish safety and efficacy standards around the world. The UK started a temporary Committee on Safety of Drugs while they attempted to pass more comprehensive legislation.  Though compliance and submission of drugs to the Committee on Safety of Drugs was not mandatory immediately after, the pharmaceutical industry larger complied due to the thalidomide situation. The European Economic Commission also passed a directive in 1965 in order to impose greater efficacy standards before marketing a drug.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emanuel|first=Michael|date=2012|title=Thalidomide and its sequelae|url=|journal=The Lancet|volume=380|pages=781–783|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(12)60468-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States congress passed the Drug Amendments Act of 1962 The Drug Amendments Act required the FDA to ensure that new drugs being introduced to the market had passed certain tests and standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both the EU and US acts introduced the requirements to ensure safety and efficacy.  Of note, increased regulations and standards for testing actually led to greater innovation in pharmaceutical research in the 1960s, despite greater preclinical and clinical standards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1989, the International Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities organized by the WHO, officials from around the world discussed the necessity for streamlined processes for global drug approval.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Various other events throughout history have demonstrated the importance of drug and medicine regulation keeping up with scientific advances.  In 2006, the challenges associated with [[TGN1412|TGN 1412]] highlighted the shortcomings of animal models and paved the way for further advances in regulation and development for biological products.  [[Rofecoxib]] represents a drug that was on the market that had not clearly represent the risks associated with the use drug which led to the concept of 'risk management planning' within the field of regulation by introducing the need to understand how various safety concerns would be managed.  Various cases over recent years have demonstrated the need for regulation to keep up with scientific advances that have implications for people's health.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Regulation by country==

===Australia===
Therapeutic goods in Australia are regulated by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tga.gov.au TGA - Therapeutic Goods Administration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of drugs and poisons is regulated by scheduling under individual state legislation, but is generally under the guidance of the national [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons]] (SUSDP).

Under the SUSDP, medicinal agents generally belong to one of five categories:
*Unscheduled/exempt
*Schedule 2 (S2) - Pharmacy Medicines
*Schedule 3 (S3) - Pharmacist Only Medicines
*Schedule 4 (S4) - Prescription Only Medicines
*Schedule 8 (S8) - Controlled Drugs

{{See also|Illicit drug use in Australia}}

===Brazil===
Therapeutic goods in [[Brazil]] are regulated by the [[Brazilian Health Ministry]], through its [[National Health Surveillance Agency]] (equivalent to the USA's FDA). There are five main categories:
*Normal Medicines - Cough, cold and fever medicines, [[antiseptic]]s, [[vitamin]]s and others. Sold freely in pharmacies and some large supermarkets.
*Red Stripe Medicines - These medicines are sold only with medical prescription. [[Antibiotics]], Anti allergenics, [[Anti-inflammatory|Anti inflammatories]], and other medicines. In Brazil, governmental control is loose on this type; it is not uncommon to buy this type of prescription medicine over the counter without a prescription.
*Red Stripe Psychoactive Medicines - These medicines are sold only with a "Special Control" white medical prescription with carbon copy, which is valid for 30 days. The original must be retained by the pharmacist after the sale and the patient keeps the carbon copy. Drugs include [[anti-depressant]]s, [[anti-convulsant]]s, some sleep aids, anti-psychotics and other non-habit-inducing controlled medicines. Though some consider them habit inducing, anabolic steroids are also regulated under this category.
*Black Stripe Medicines - These medicines are sold only with the "Blue B Form" medical prescription, which is valid for 30 days and must be retained by the pharmacist after the sale. Includes [[sedatives]] ([[benzodiazepines]]), some anorexic inducers and other habit-inducing controlled medicines.
*"Yellow A Form" prescription medicines - These medicines are sold only with the "Yellow A Form" medical prescription - the most tightly controlled, which is valid for 30 days and must be retained by the pharmacist after the sale. Includes amphetamines and other stimulants (such as [[methylphenidate]]), [[opioids]] (such as [[morphine]] and oxycodone) and other strong habit-forming controlled medicines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anvisa.gov.br/eng/institution/history.htm Anvisa - The History Of Health Surveillance In Brazil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In Canada, regulation of therapeutic goods are governed by the [[Food and Drug Act]] and associated regulations. In addition, the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] requires additional regulatory requirements for controlled drugs and drug precursors.&lt;ref name="HealthCanadaFacts"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/index-eng.php |title=Health Canada: Drugs and Health Products |publisher=[[Health Canada]] |accessdate=2 July 2010 |year=2000 |isbn=0-662-29208-1 |location=[[Ottawa, Ontario]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burma (Myanmar)===
The regulation of drugs in Burma is governed by the [[Food and Drug Administration (Burma)]] and [[Food and Drug Board of Authority]].

===China===
The regulation of drugs in China is governed by the [[China Food and Drug Administration]].

===Europe===

====Germany====
{{main article|List of German drug laws}}
German law classifies drugs into
* Narcotics ("Betäubungsmittel")
** [[Anlage I]] BTMG (authorized scientific use only)
** [[Anlage II]] BTMG (authorized trade only, not prescriptible)
** [[Anlage III]] BTMG ([[special prescription form]] required &amp;ndash; "Betäubungsmittelrezept")
* [[Research chemical]]s ("neue psychoaktive Stoffe" &amp;ndash; permitted only for industrial and scientific purposes)
* [[Prescription drug]]s ("verschreibungspflichtig" or "rezeptpflichtig")
* Pharmacy-only drugs ("apothekenpflichtig")
* General sales list drugs ("freiverkäuflich")
* [[Raw material]]s for synthesizing drugs
** Kategorie 1 (authorization required)
** Kategorie 2 (reporting required) 
** Kategorie 3 (export restrictions)

====United Kingdom====

Medicines for Human Use in the [[United Kingdom]] are regulated by the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA). The availability of drugs is regulated by classification by the MHRA as part of marketing authorisation of a product.

The United Kingdom has a three-tiered classification system:
*General Sale List (GSL)
*Pharmacy medicines (P)
*Prescription Only Medicines (POM)

Within POM, certain agents with a high abuse/addiction liability are also separately scheduled under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] (amended with the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001); and are commonly known as [[Controlled Drug in United Kingdom|Controlled Drugs]] (CD).

====Norway====

Medicines in Norway are divided into five groups:

'''Class A'''
Narcotics, sedative-hypnotics, and amphetamines in this class require a [[special prescription form]]:
*[[morphine]] and its immediate family, [[heroin]], [[desomorphine]], [[nicomorphine]];
*[[codeine]] and its immediate family, [[dihydrocodeine]], [[ethylmorphine]], [[nicocodeine]];
*morphine relatives: [[hydromorphone]] and [[oxymorphone]];
*codeine relatives: [[hydrocodone]] and [[oxycodone]];
*synthetic [[opioids]]: [[pethidine]], [[methadone]], [[fentanyl]], and [[levorphanol]];
*various [[Hypnotic|sedative-hypnotic]]s: [[temazepam]], [[methaqualone]], [[pentobarbital]], and [[secobarbital]];
*various [[stimulant]]s: [[amphetamine]]s and [[methylphenidate]];
*[[flunitrazepam]] (moved from class B)
 
'''Class B'''  
Restricted substances which easily lead to addiction like:
*[[co-codamol]]
*[[tramadol]]
*[[diazepam]]
*[[nitrazepam]]
*all other [[benzodiazepine]]s (with the exception of temazepam and [[flunitrazepam]])
*[[phentermine]]
 
'''Class C''' - All prescription-only substances

'''Class F''' - Substances and package-sizes not requiring a prescription

'''Unclassifieds''' - Brands and packages not actively marketed in Norway

====Iceland====
Medicines in Iceland are regulated by the [[Icelandic Medicines Control Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imca.is/ Icelandic Medicines Control Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
Medicines in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are regulated according to the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Ireland)|Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988]]. Controlled drugs (CDs) are divided into five categories based on their potential for misuse and therapeutic effectiveness.

*'''CD1''': [[cannabis]], [[lysergamide]], [[coca leaf]], etc. Use is prohibited except in limited circumstances where a license has been granted.
*'''CD2''': [[amphetamine]], [[methadone]], [[morphine]], [[fentanyl]], [[oxycodone]], [[tapentadol]], etc. Prescriptions must be handwritten and are only valid for 14 days. Repeat prescriptions are not permitted. Drugs must comply with safe custody and destruction of unsold/unused medication must be witnessed. Must be registered in a Controlled Drugs register.
*'''CD3''': [[temazepam]], [[flunitrazepam]], etc. As CD2, except witnessed destruction and CD register are not required.
*'''CD4''': [[benzodiazepines]], e.g. [[diazepam]], [[nitrazepam]], low dose [[Methylphenobarbital|(methyl)phenobarbitone]]
*'''CD5''': low-dose [[codeine]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imt.ie/mims/2011/08/controlled-drugs.html&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ie&amp;strip=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
Medicines in Switzerland are regulated by [[Swissmedic]]. The country is not part of the [[European Union]], and is regarded by many as one of the easiest places to conduct clinical trials on new drug compounds.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

There are five categories from A to E to cover different types of delivery category:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Supply of medicinal products|publisher=Federal Office of Public Health|url=http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/medizin/00709/04670/04679/index.html?lang=en|accessdate=2014-01-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203002122/http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/medizin/00709/04670/04679/index.html?lang=en|archivedate=2014-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A: Supply once with a prescription from a doctor or veterinarian
* B: Supply with a prescription from a doctor or veterinarian
* C: Supply on technical advice from medical staff
* D: Supply on technical advice
* E: Supply without technical advice

===India===
{{main|Drug policy of India}}
Medicines in [[India]] are regulated by [[Central Drugs Standard Control Organization]] (CDSCO) Under [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]]. Headed by [[Directorate General of Health Services]], CDSCO regulates pharmaceutical products through [[Drugs Controller General of India]] (DCGI) at Chair.

Drugs are classified under five headings. Under retail and distribution: 
* Schedule X drugs - narcotics
* Schedule H and L - injectables, antibiotics, antibacterials
* Schedule C and C1 - biological products, for example serums and vaccines
 
Under manufacturing practice:
* Schedule N - list of the equipment for the efficient running of manufacturing wing, qualified personnel

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Edinburgh]] on 11 June 1743. He was the eighth son of Gavin Hamilton, a bookseller and publisher.{{sfn|Anderson|1890}}

His grandfather, [[William Hamilton (educator)|William Hamilton]], [[principal of Edinburgh University]], had been a professor of divinity. Robert Hamilton was also the nephew of the [[Very Rev Prof Robert Hamilton]] (1707–87), and the cousin of James Hamilton (1749-1835).

Having completed his education at the [[High School, Edinburgh]], and the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he was distinguished in mathematics, Robert was induced to enter a banking-house in order to acquire a practical knowledge of business, but his ambition was really academic.

In 1769 he gave up business pursuits and accepted the rectorship of [[Perth Academy]]. In 1779 he was presented to the chair of [[natural philosophy]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. For many years, however, by private arrangement with his colleague Professor Copland, Hamilton taught the class of mathematics. In 1816 he was presented to the latter chair.

In his later years he lived at 82 Broad Street in Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;Aberdeen Post Office Directory 1825-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Hamilton's most important work is the ''Essay on the National Debt'', which appeared in 1813 and was undoubtedly the first to expose the economic fallacies involved in [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]]'s policy of a sinking fund. It is still of value. A posthumous volume published in 1830, ''The Progress of Society'', is also of great ability, and is a very effective treatment of economical principles by tracing their origin and position in the development of social life. Some minor works of a practical character (''Introduction to Merchandise'', 1777; ''Essay on War and Peace'', 1790) are now forgotten.

==Family==
He married twice: firstly to Ann Mitchell of Ladath, and, following her death in 1778, to Jane Morison (d.1825).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter, Grizel Hamilton, married the eminent [[Edinburgh]] surgeon, [[Benjamin Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

His uncle was the [[Very Rev Prof Robert Hamilton]] [[FRSE]], twice [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rochdale Principles''' are a set of ideals for the operation of [[cooperative]]s. They were first set out in 1844 by the [[Rochdale Pioneers|Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers]] in [[Rochdale]], England and have formed the basis for the principles on which co-operatives around the world continue to operate. The implications of the Rochdale Principles are a focus of study in [[co-operative economics]]. The original Rochdale Principles were officially adopted by the [[International Co-operative Alliance]] (ICA) in 1937 as the Rochdale Principles of Co-operation. Updated versions of the principles were adopted by the ICA in 1966 as the Co-operative Principles and in 1995 as part of the [[Statement on the Co-operative Identity]].&lt;ref name="icapr"&gt;[http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles-revisions.html ICA Co-operative Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029163330/http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles-revisions.html |date=2009-10-29 }}, 1937, 1966, and 1995 revisions.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current ICA version of co-operative principles==

The Rochdale Principles, according to the 1995 ICA revision, can be summarised as follows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles ICA Co-operative identity, values &amp; principles.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary and open membership===
The first of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have an open and [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] membership. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, "Co-operatives are voluntary organisations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination."

====Anti-discrimination====

To discriminate [[socially]] is to make a distinction between [[people]] on the basis of [[Social class|class]] or [[Categorization|category]]. Examples of social discrimination include [[racism|racial]], [[Religious discrimination|religious]], [[Sexism|sexual]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Disability discrimination act|disability]], and [[Ethnic persecution|ethnic]] discrimination.  To fulfil the first Rochdale Principle, a Co-operative society should not prevent anyone willing to participate from doing so on any of these grounds.  However, this does not prohibit the co-operative from setting reasonable and relevant ground rules for membership, such as residing in a specific geographic area or paying a membership fee to join, so long as all persons meeting such criteria are able to participate if they so choose.

====Motivations and rewards====

Given the voluntary nature of co-operatives, members need reasons to participate. Each person's motivations will be unique and will vary from one co-operative to another, but they will often be a combination of the following:
*Financial&amp;nbsp;– Some co-operatives are able to provide members with financial benefits.
*Quality of life&amp;nbsp;– Serving the community through a co-operative because doing service makes one's own life better is perhaps the most significant motivation for volunteering. Included here would be the benefits people get from being with other people, staying active, and above all having a sense of the value of ourselves in society that may not be as clear in other areas of life.
*Giving back&amp;nbsp;– Many people have in some way benefited from the work of a co-operative and volunteer to give back.
*Altruism&amp;nbsp;– Some volunteer for the benefit of others.
*A sense of duty&amp;nbsp;– Some see participation in community as a responsibility that comes with citizenship. In this case, they may not describe themselves as volunteers.
*Career experience&amp;nbsp;– Volunteering offers experiences that can add to career prospects.

===Democratic member control===
The second of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have democratic member control. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.”

===Member economic participation===
Member economic participation is one of the defining features of co-operative societies, and constitutes the third Rochdale Principle in the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity. According to the ICA, co-operatives are enterprises in which “Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.” This principle, in turn, can be broken down into a number of constituent parts.

====Democratic control====

The first part of this principle states that “Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative.” This enshrines [[democracy|democratic control]] over the co-operative, and how its capital is used.

====Limitations on member compensation and appropriate use of surpluses====

The second part of the principle deals with how members are compensated for funds invested in a Co-operative, and how surpluses should be used. Unlike for-profit [[corporations]], co-operatives are a form of [[social enterprise]]. Given this, there are at least three purposes for which surplus funds can be used, or distributed, by a Co-operative.
* “Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership.”
* “Developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible;” in other words, the surplus can be reinvested in the co-operative.
* "Benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative;” for example, a [[Consumers' Co-operative]] may decide to pay [[dividend]]s based on purchases (or a 'divvi').
* “Supporting other activities approved by the membership.”

===Autonomy and independence===
The fourth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must be autonomous and independent. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.”

===Education, training, and information===
The fifth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must provide education and training to their members and the public. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the general public – particularly young people and opinion leaders – about the nature and benefits of co-operation.”

===Cooperation among cooperatives===
The sixth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operatives cooperate with each other. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.”

===Concern for community===
The seventh of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have concern for their communities. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.”

'''''Software Star''''' is a 1985 game released by [[Kevin Toms]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]].

== Gameplay ==
Essentially a text-based management game.  The player's task is to manage a software house, create new games, manage his publicity and make a profit of £10000. Meanwhile, he must achieve the status of "Software Star" for ten successive months.

Having a large portfolio of games has its advantages by increasing the player's monthly sales. However, money must be spent on promoting aging titles. Each game has its own quality rating, where the quality increases with the amount of time spent on development. Managing the productivity of the player's staff is also key to the game, giving him a snapshot of the last six months. He could decide to either discipline offer incentives or take no action. There are four sales regions where the player's products are sold. These regions are ordered from one to four, depending on how much importance he gives to them by consulting the sales from the previous month. Public relations also needs tweaking by choosing Honesty or [[Media circus|Hype]].  Each decision has an effect on his company image. Finally, the player will have to evaluate his potential market depending on the time of year and decide how many advertising pages to buy. Markets are larger around [[Christmas]] and [[New Year]]. It is then time to sit back and look at the sales figures as the player's game enters the Top 20.  He is then given a sales break even figure and each game climbs the chart if it sells well to the Number One spot.

At the end of the month the player views your monthly statement to check his progress and Stardom rating ranging from Nobody to Software Star. At the end of the year, the directors will check the player's progress. They will either fire him, raise the bar, or give him another chance.

=== Objective ===
To become a software Star and to avoid [[bankruptcy]].

== Trivia ==
*The player can name the games that he is developing.
*This game has some similarities to the video game ''[[Millionaire (video game)|Millionaire]]''.
*A very similar game, ''Software House'' was released by [[Cult Games]] a few years later.

==Reception==
Zzap!64 thought the game was a disappointing follow-up to Football Manager, with too little to do for the player and less feeling of control.  It received a rating of 43%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=001&amp;amp;page=043&amp;amp;thumbstart=0&amp;amp;magazine=zzap&amp;amp;check=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Office of the Telecommunications Authority]] (OFTA) is the legislative body responsible for regulating the [[telecommunications]] industry in Hong Kong. The OFTA has liberalized all telecom sectors and there are no foreign ownership restrictions. 

In the local fixed-line market there is neither a pre-set limit on the number of licenses issued nor deadline for applications. {{As of|2004}}, there are nine [[fixed-line]] licensees: [[PCCW-HKT]], [[New World Telephone Limited]], [[Wharf T &amp; T Limited]], [[Hutchison Global Crossing Limited]], [[Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited]], [[Eastar Technology Limited]], [[CM Tel. (HK) Limited]], [[TraxComm Limited]] and [[HKC Network Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lai, D. Murphy, "Hong Kong’s Telecommunications Industry", Stat-USA Market Research Reports. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the telephone density is, with 56 lines per 100 people, among the highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Hong Kong: The Facts. Telecommunications", Information Services Department. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2004}} there are 197 licensed [[Internet Service Provider]]s (ISP) in Hong Kong, providing [[dial-up]] or broadband services. Hong Kong is the second after [[South Korea]] in terms of broadband penetration rate (53%).

With regard to mobile services, the OFTA awarded four [[3G]] licenses in 2001: [[Hong Kong CSL Limited]], [[Hutchison 3G (HK) Limited]], [[SmartTone 3G Limited]] and [[Sunday 3G (HK) Limited]] The first 3G mobile services were launched in January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"Hong Kong: The Facts. Telecommunications", Information Services Department. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these four 3G operators, together with [[New World Mobility]] and [[Peoples Telephone Company Limited]] operate a total of eleven [[GSM]] networks. Thus the mobile density {{As of|2004|lc=on}} is one of the highest in the world (106.3%).&lt;ref&gt;"Hong Kong: The Facts. Telecommunications", Information Services Department.

'''''The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People''''', first published in 1989, is a business and [[self-help]] book written by [[Stephen Covey]].&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" author, Stephen Covey, dies|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48203718/ns/today-entertainment/t/habits-highly-effective-people-author-stephen-covey-dies/#.UEIc7yLpriQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covey presents an approach to being [[effective]] in attaining [[goal]]s by aligning oneself to what he calls "true north" principles based on a [[Moral character|character ethic]] that he presents as universal and timeless.

Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of [[The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs|the ''goose that laid the golden eggs'']]. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where ''P'' refers to getting desired results and ''PC'' is caring for that which produces the results.

Covey's best-known book, it has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication. The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CNN Wire Staff|title='7 Habits' author Stephen Covey dead at 79|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/16/us/obit-stephen-covey/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covey argues against what he calls "''the personality ethic''", that he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He promotes what he labels "''the character ethic''": aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles. In doing this, Covey is deliberately and mindfully separating principles and values. He sees ''principles'' as external [[natural law]]s, while ''values'' remain internal and subjective. Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of [[habits]], manifesting as a progression from dependence through [[independence]] on to [[interdependence]].

== The 7 Habits ==

The book first introduces the concept of [[paradigm shift]] and helps the reader understand that different [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspectives]] exist, i.e. that two people can see the same thing and yet differ with each other. On this premise, it introduces the seven [[habits]] in a proper order.

Each chapter is dedicated to one of the habits, which are represented by the following [[Moral imperative|imperatives]]:

===  Independence ===

The First Three Habits surround moving from dependence to [[independence]] (i.e., [[Self-efficacy|self-mastery]]):

==== 1 - Be [[Proactivity|proactive]] ====
: Talks about the concept of Circle of Influence and Circle of Concern. Work from the center of your influence and constantly work to expand it. Don't sit and wait in a reactive mode, waiting for problems to happen (Circle of Concern) before taking action.

==== 2 - Begin with the end in mind ====
: Envision [[Personal mission statement|what you want in the future]] so you can work and plan towards it. Understand how people make decisions in their life. To be effective you need to act based on principles and constantly review your mission statement. Are you - right now - who you want to be? What do I have to say about myself? How do you want to be remembered? If habit 1 advises to change your life to act and be proactive, habit 2 advises that ''you are the programmer!'' Grow and stay humble.

==== 3 - Put [[First Things First (book)|first things first]] ====
:[[File:7 habits decision-making matrix.png|thumb|Matrix of importance vs urgency that [[Stephen Covey]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] used in deciding where to invest their efforts.]]Talks about difference between Leadership and Management. Leadership in the outside world begins with personal vision and personal leadership. Talks about [[Time management#The Eisenhower Method|what is important and what is urgent]]. Priority should be given in the following order (in brackets are the corresponding actions from the Eisenhower Matrix)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987616572|title=Habit stacking : 127 small changes to improve your health, wealth, and happiness|last=J.,|first=Scott, S.|isbn=9781545339121|edition=The 2nd edition|location=[Mahwah, NJ]|oclc=987616572}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
: Quadrant I. ''Urgent and important'' (Do) – important deadlines and crises
: Quadrant II. ''Not urgent but important'' (Plan) – long-term development
: Quadrant III. ''Urgent but not important'' (Delegate) – distractions with deadlines
: Quadrant IV. ''Not urgent and not important'' (Eliminate) – frivolous distractions
: The order is important; after completing items in quadrant I, we should spend the majority of our time on II, but many people spend too much time in III and IV. The calls to delegate and eliminate are effective reminders of their relative priority.

If habit 2 advises that you are the programmer, habit 3 advises: ''write the program, become a leader''! Keep personal integrity: what you say vs what you do.

=== Interdependence ===
The next three habits talk about [[Interdependence]] (e.g., working with others):

==== 4 - Think [[Win-win game|win-win]] ====
: Genuine feelings for mutually beneficial solutions or agreements in your relationships. Value and respect people by understanding a "win" for all is ultimately a better long-term resolution than if only one person in the situation had gotten their way. Think Win-Win isn't about being nice, nor is it a quick-fix technique. It is a character-based code for human interaction and collaboration. 

==== 5 - Seek first to understand, then to be understood ====
: Use [[empathetic]] listening to genuinely [[understand]] a person, which compels them to reciprocate the listening and take an open mind to being influenced by you. This creates an atmosphere of caring, and positive problem solving. 
: The Habit 5 is greatly embraced in the Greek philosophy represented by 3 words: 
: 
: 1) Ethos - your personal credibility. It's the trust that you inspire, your Emotional Bank Account.
: 2) Pathos is the empathetic side -- it's the alignment with the emotional trust of another person communication.
: 3) Logos is the logic -- the reasoning part of the presentation. 
: The order is important: ethos, pathos, logos -- your character, and your relationships, and then the logic of your presentation.

==== 6 - [[Synergy|Synergize!]] ====
: Combine the strengths of people through positive [[teamwork]], so as to achieve goals that no one could have done alone.

=== Continual improvement ===
The final habit is that of [[continuous improvement]] in both the personal and interpersonal spheres of influence.

==== 7 - Sharpen the Saw ====
: Balance and renew your resources, energy, and health to create a [[sustainable]], long-term, effective lifestyle. It primarily emphasizes exercise for physical renewal, good prayer (meditation, [[yoga]], etc.) and good reading for mental renewal. It also mentions service to society for spiritual renewal.

Covey explains the "Upward Spiral" model in the sharpening the saw section. Through our conscience, along with meaningful and consistent progress, the spiral will result in growth, change, and constant improvement. In essence, one is always attempting to integrate and master the principles outlined in The 7 Habits at progressively higher levels at each iteration. Subsequent development on any habit will render a different experience and you will learn the principles with a deeper understanding. The Upward Spiral model consists of three parts: learn, commit, do. According to Covey, one must be increasingly educating the conscience in order to grow and develop on the upward spiral. The idea of renewal by education will propel one along the path of personal freedom, security, wisdom, and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Covey, S.

== Reception ==
''The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People'' has sold more than 25 million copies in 40 languages worldwide, and the audio version has sold 1.5 million copies, and remains one of the best selling nonfiction business books in history. In August 2011 ''Time'' listed ''7 Habits'' as one of "The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books".&lt;ref name = time&gt;{{cite journal| title = The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People (1989), by Stephen R. Covey in The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books |first = Stephen| last = Gandel| date= August 9, 2011| magazine = Time | url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2086680_2086683_2087685,00.html | accessdate = January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] invited Covey to [[Camp David]] to counsel him on how to integrate the book into his presidency.&lt;ref name=marriott&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Lena M.|title=The Highly Effective Person|journal=Marriott Alumni Magazine|date=Summer 2012|url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/marriottmag/summer12/features/feature02.cfm|accessdate=August 11, 2012|publisher=[[Brigham Young University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abundance mentality==

Covey coined the idea of ''[[abundance (economics)|abundance]] mentality'' or ''abundance mindset'', a concept in which a person believes there are enough resources and successes to share with others. He contrasts it with the ''[[scarcity]] mindset'' (i.e., destructive and unnecessary [[competition]]), which is founded on the idea that, if someone else wins or is successful in a situation, that means you lose; not considering the possibility of all parties winning (in some way or another) in a given situation (see [[zero-sum game]]). Individuals with an abundance mentality reject the notion of zero-sum games and are able to celebrate the success of others rather than feel threatened by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stafforini.com/docs/Covey%20-%20The%207%20habits%20of%20highly%20effective%20people.pdf | format = pdf | last = English | first = L | title = The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Information Professionals, Part 7 | journal = DM Review | year = 2004 | pages = 60–61 | volume = September/October '04 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this book's publishing, a number of books appearing in the business press have discussed the idea.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the chapter in Carolyn Simpson's ''High Performance through Negotiation''.&lt;/ref&gt; Covey contends that the abundance mentality arises from having a high [[Self-esteem|self-worth]] and security (see Habits 1, 2, and 3), and leads to the sharing of profits, recognition and responsibility. Organizations may also apply an abundance mentality when doing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Krayer, Karl J. |author2=Lee, William Thomas |title=Organizing change: an inclusive, systemic approach to maintain productivity and achieve results |publisher=Pfeiffer |location=San Diego |year=2003 |page = 238 |isbn=0-7879-6443-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

Sean Covey (Stephen's son) has written a version of the book for teens, ''The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens''. This version simplifies the 7 Habits for younger readers so they can better understand them. In September 2006, Sean Covey also published ''The 6 Most Important Decisions You Will Ever Make: A Guide for Teens.'' This guide highlights key times in the life of a teen and gives advice on how to deal with them.

'''''The Corporate Machine''''' (known in Europe as '''''Business Tycoon''''') is a [[strategy video game|strategy]] [[computer game]] from [[Stardock]] in which the goal is to create a [[corporation]] in one of four [[industries]] ([[automobile]]s, [[aircraft]], [[computer]]s, or [[soft drink]]s) and eventually dominate rival companies. To win the player must dominate the chosen market (getting 55% to 65% of the market share depending on the number of opponents). The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon, which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur, all developed by Stardock.

== Gameplay ==

=== Starting Out ===
When starting a game, the player picks a company specialty. Three specialties are available: [[marketing]], [[Labour (economics)|labor]] and [[research]]. Each specialty doubles productivity in that area. After picking a specialty, the start screen allows choice of how many opponents to be faced, the difficulty of the game, what map will be used (both real and fictional maps are available), starting funds, and what industry is to be competed in.

=== Exploring ===
The game is started at the home site (which is randomly chosen on the map) and with one sales executive. To introduce and sell the product to other regions, the region must be investigated. This process can take from 3 to 10 weeks depending on how far they are from the sites. After an area is explored, the player will know the market leader, if opponents have sites or units there, if the region has a resource, as well as statistics like what the targeted area desires in a product, their concerns with price, and how rich the region is.

=== The Sales Executives ===
The sales executives increase market penetration (the percentage of stores carrying the product) in their regions and all regions up to two spaces away from each executive. The sales executive can be moved around the map freely by plane; however, while in transit he will not grant any penetration benefit. To gain more sales executives the profit must be increased to a certain level by the end of a year. This gets harder later on as the amount to gain a new executive increases. It is also possible to get them through the use of Direct Action Cards.

=== Your Company Sites ===
These places are the player's base of operations. Manufacturing, research, and marketing buildings can be built and upgraded. Additional sites can be purchased but they become progressively more expensive. On the player's first site there will be a sales office and a garage, but every site after will only have a sales office and everything else has to be built. Other buildings include an intelligence facility, which will generate and display information in the form of graphs. Company stores can be built at any site to decrease employee expenses (and therefore lower employee cost).

To get better performance a training center will increase employee efficiency. Employee happiness becomes a factor as well, as an unhappy employee's performance will suffer, so a recreation center will boost morale. If market leadership is lost in an area where a site is, the employees' morale will drop sharply. Marketing, manufacturing, and researching buildings can be accessed in order to make adjustments to the multiple operations within the company. Sales buildings act similarly to sales executives that cannot be moved from region to region.

=== The Marketing Department ===
When a marketing building is built, it will be possible to hire and fire marketers. Marketing associates can be used to create marketing campaigns. As campaigns are created, marketing associate availability drops and the player is forced to build more marketing buildings in order to have more campaigns. These buildings can be upgraded to have more employees and to have more powerful marketing campaigns. Positive campaigns will boost the qualities of the player's product, or negative marketing campaigns to decrease the appeal of an opponents product. For media, there are advertisements to print, and radio and television campaigns. Marketing campaigns can be moved from region to region similarly to a sales executive.

=== The Manufacturing ===
Starting with a simple garage, the player can upgrade to factories. Larger factories, and hire of additional employees, increase efficiency. Employees can be hired or fired as demand rises or falls. The production screen is where the price of the product is set. If the product is better compared to other companies then an overcharge can be made. The price should not be raised too far as demand will drop quickly if there are different companies in the same area and market leadership could be lost.

=== Research ===
This is where scientists develop new technologies to upgrade the product. The bigger the research building, the more scientists can be hired. Four projects can be queued so the player does not have to constantly have to come back to the screen and choose new technologies. Different projects also give different bonuses, such as decreasing the cost to manufacture or increase the appeal to consumers.

=== Direct Action Cards ===
Different regions may or may not have a resource in them. There are five resource types: Labor, Government, Intelligence, Marketing, and Underworld. Every year that a region is controlled that has a resource is one resource point. Having resource points allows the play of direct action cards.

The game is started with two cards and an additional card is received every year. Direct action cards cost resources, and may have a monetary cost in addition. Cards have effects such as receiving money from the government, a research boon, revealing large blocks of regions, twisting the desires of consumers, physical destruction of competitors assets, cutting costs through illegal activities, and publicity boosts. The direct action card system has been likened to the card game [[Magic: The Gathering]].

== Community ==
The Corporate Machine’s popularity has decreased over the years since the game was first introduced. Recently a fan of the game (known as Money) has tried to reunite the TCM community by creating a forum, tutorials, help, and support.

The problem that the community is facing is that Stardock's TCM server (which allows users to play online) is down often, disabling internet play.

The community is considering creating a new, more reliable server on which to play (see external links).

==Early life==
Cholmondeley was a great-grandson of [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere]] (1870–1931), a pioneering settler in Kenya who was the effective "founder" of the [[Whites in Kenya|White community]] in that country. Cholmondeley was the only son and heir of [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 5th Baron Delamere|The 5th Baron Delamere]] (b. 1934) and his wife Anne, ''née'' Renison.  His family is one of the large-scale [[landowner]]s in Kenya.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile"/&gt; He is also a descendant of [[Sir Robert Walpole]], the first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Joseph. (1851). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mMjkTr5XU4cC&amp;pg=PA565&amp;dq=Delamere+and+Sir+Robert+Walpole&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA527,M1 ''The Book of Dignities,'' pp. 527], 565.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]] at Pembroke House, in the town of [[Gilgil]], Kenya, and [[Ashdown House, East Sussex|Ashdown House School]], in the village of [[Forest Row]] in [[East Sussex]], he was educated at [[Eton College]], from where he was expelled for bad behaviour.  After school he worked on various farms for his "pupil year", including time working on [[Kenneth Matiba]]'s farm, Wangu Embori.  He attended the [[Royal Agricultural College]], [[Cirencester]], 1987–1990, and then worked for the [[Agricultural Mortgage Corporation]] in Andover, [[Great Britain]].

==Career==
Back in Kenya from 1991 Cholmondeley started working for the family farming business and was then involved in many developing projects.  He decided against returning to Britain, and stayed to work in Kenya, where he was eventually made finance director of the Delamere beef and dairy farms.  ''The Daily Nation'' reported that the estate became a no-go area for trespassers and locals{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}.  By the 1990s he gained a reputation as an outstanding farmer, conscientious and diligent, he paid high attention to the quality of the land and soil while pursuing a traditional agenda for conservancy.  He established a game cropping enterprise on [[Soysambu|Soysambu Ranch]], the vast family estate in Kenya, which ran from 1992–2003, and which employed 15 people as well as building a modern [[abattoir]] and cold storage facilities.  He was also responsible for the design and layout of the Soysambu Wildlife Sanctuary and the building of Delamere's Camp in 1993, a high-class tourist lodge with a {{convert|6000|acre|km2|adj=on}} exclusive sanctuary covering the area around [[Lake Elmenteita]].

Cholmondeley was diligent in the employment of local labour; he employed hundreds of paid workers and voluntarily assisted others in many micro-projects.  He was promoted as director of [[Delamere Estates]] in 1994, and the following year the chairman of [[Nakuru Wildlife Conservancy]], a position he was elected to twice again.  In his attempts to keep poaching to a minimum he was appointed an honorary game warden.  In 1996 he introduced the first [[centre pivot irrigation]] into [[Naivasha]] and eventually the scheme covered over {{convert|600|acre|km2}} and provided employment for approximately 500 people.  In the same year he organised the reconstruction of the "Delamere Milk Shop" into a petrol station on the outskirts of Naivasha, the A104 highway. This is now a massive concern and Kenya's busiest [[farm shop]]. Of note is the constructed wetland to cope with the sewage resulting from over 3000 customers per day.

His energies turned to building the first straw bale building in [[Gilgil]], the location being on the edge of the [[Otutu forest]]. He created the leases and design criteria for two further tourist lodges, Mbweha Camp on the edge of [[Lake Nakuru National Park]], and [[Mawe Mbili]] lodge. This is part of the greater plan for the [[Soysambu Conservancy]], together with the establishment of two forestry partnerships covering {{convert|510|acre|km2}}.

While Cholmondeley was conscientious in his farm work, he was hedonistic in his free time - "wild women...rallying-car driving, motorcycling, paragliding".  He was 1986 Kenya Novice Motocross Champion.  In one episodic adventure he was confronted by a [[cape buffalo]] that seriously gored his leg, leaving a long gash and huge scar.  It was in hospital that he met Dr Sally Brewerton of [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]].  They married a year later in 1998, and had two sons.&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Telegraph'', Friday 19 August 2016, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shootings==
On 19 April 2005, Cholmondeley shot game ranger Samson ole Sisina, working undercover for the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]] on his ranch in [[Gilgil]] division, [[Nakuru District]].  He arrived at the slaughterhouse after his ranch employees had summoned his help during what seemed to be a robbery.  The accusation was that he shot the KWS employee who was dressed in plain clothes, but Cholmondeley insisted it was in [[self-defense]] as the ranger had shot at him first without warning.  However, a witness account says the victim was shot in the back.  The Attorney General [[Amos Wako]] discontinued the case by issuing a ''[[nolle prosequi]]''. This decision was widely criticised by Kenyan media and the public, with many claiming he walked free due to the influence of class and position.  There was a public outcry in Nairobi, and from Masai who wanted to occupy Delamere land.  Nick Maes, a ''Sunday Telegraph'' reporter, years later found a complex man challenged by changing Kenyan conditions, rising criminality in the countryside, and mounting criticism of white ownership in Kenya generally.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

On 10 May 2006, he was taken again into custody for the killing of Robert Njoya Mbugua, a Kikuyu tribesman, looking for food for his family, whom he had discovered on his land with three companions and a pack of dogs, carrying the caracass of an antelope they had killed on the estate.  Cholmondeley told police he had shot at the poachers' dogs, standard practice under [[Kenya Wildlife Service]] guidelines, killing two of them, and that he had not intended to shoot Njoya, whom he saw lying wounded in the hedgerow.  The dead man's companions disputed that version of events. What was undisputed was that Cholmondeley applied a tourniquet to the bleeding man and shouted for a car to take him to hospital, as well as calling the police.
   
Cholmondeley was held in detention - the only white man out of 3,600 inmates - at the [[Kamiti Maximum Security Prison]] after the incident and during the ongoing court proceedings in a tiny cell in the prison outside Nairobi, "like living inside a greasy saucepan infested with rats and cockroaches."&lt;ref name="Express-Happy valley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/701648/Tom-Cholmondeley-African-Aristocrat-jail-happy-valley-curse | title=Tom Cholmondeley: The African Aristocrat who went to jail | work=Daily Express | date=18 August 2016 | accessdate=22 August 2016 | author=Blackburn, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cholmondeley was divorced but a girlfriend, jeweller [[Sally Dudmesh]], visited him in prison every week.

The trial began 25 September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=50365 "Cholmondeley murder trial kicks off,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513005537/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=50365 |date=13 May 2009 }} Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. 27 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  An interlocutory appeal on a question of procedural law was decided on 13 June 2008. He won an appeal to uphold his right to a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;Pflanz, Mike. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/3167017/Kenyan-murder-charge-aristocrat--Thomas-Cholmondeley-denied-fair-trial.html "Kenyan murder charge aristocrat Thomas Cholmondeley 'denied fair trial',"] ''The Telegraph'' (London). 9 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, lay assessors in his trial found him not guilty.&lt;ref name="times-accquital-2009"&gt;McConnell, Tristan. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5854041.ece "Lay Assessors find Thomas Cholmondeley Not Guilty of Murder,"] ''The Times'' (London). May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May 2009, Judge Muga Apondi, sitting as a single judge and not bound by the lay assessors' verdict, acquitted Cholmondeley of murder but found him guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter.&lt;ref name="bbc2" /&gt;

The verdict of April 2009 was largely based on the evidence by rally driver [[Carl Tundo]], who had accompanied his friend Cholmondeley to the scene. On 14 May 2009 Cholmondeley was sentenced to serve a further eight months in prison.  Apondi said he was imposing a "light" sentence given that he had been imprisoned for three years already, and had tried to help Njoya with first aid and transport to hospital.&lt;ref name="reuters-apondi-8mth-sentence"&gt;Elkington, Natasha and Humphrey Malalo. [https://www.reuters.com/article/africaCrisis/idUSLE892317 "Kenya aristocrat jailed for 8 months over killing,"] Reuters. 7 May 2009,&lt;/ref&gt; Cholmondeley was released early for good behaviour in October 2009 after serving five months of his eight-month prison sentence.&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-10-23" /&gt;

In an interview he expressed his opinions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{cquote|I've been portrayed as this great monster who goes round shooting black men for sport when my whole life I've striven to move away from racist behaviour ....The problem is I'm a very easy target.  I'm a white man, toffee nosed, titled and, on top of that, a white man in Africa...you know these are really bad things.}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Telegraph'', Friday 19 August 2016, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
While murder carries a mandatory death sentence, manslaughter has a statutory maximum of life imprisonment but with no mandatory minimum sentence under Kenyan law.&lt;ref&gt;Kadida, Jillo.

[[BBC Four]]'s ''[[Storyville (television series)|Storyville]]'' series featured the  Cholmondeley trial in an episode titled "Last White Man Standing".&lt;ref name="BBC last white man"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qjnjn | title=Storyville, 2009-2010, Last White Man Standing | work=BBC Four | accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1997, Cholmondeley was gored by a [[african buffalo|buffalo]] while walking to a launching site for [[paragliding]] in the [[Masai Mara]].

He married on 16 May 1998, Sally A. Brewerton. They had two sons but later divorced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p6841.htm#i68401 thepeerage, Lord Delamere retrieved 19 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

He had been a keen motor sportsman and was Kenya Novice [[Motocross]] champion in 1986 and runner-up in the Kenya [[Enduro]] championship in 2000. In addition he held a private pilot's licence [[Private pilot licence|PPL]] since 2000 and flew in Kenya, Britain, France, Germany, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.

Cholmondeley died of [[cardiac arrest]] on Wednesday 17 August 2016 while undergoing [[hip surgery]] at MP Shah Hospital Nairobi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/08/17/aristocrat-tom-cholmondeley-dies-aged-48_c1405336|title=Aristocrat Tom Cholmondeley dies aged 48|last=|first=|date=August 17, 2016|website=The Star|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is survived by his sons, Hugh (b. 1998) (now heir apparent of the Delamere barony) and Henry (b. 2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7110">A '''travel survey''' (or '''travel diary''' or '''travel behavior inventory''') is a survey of individual [[travel behavior]].  Most surveys collect information about an individual (socio-economic, demographic, etc.), their household (size, structure, relationships), and a diary of their journeys on a given day (their start and end location, start and end time, mode of travel, accompaniment and purpose of travel).

Major travel surveys are conducted in metropolitan areas typically once a decade. Some regions, notably metropolitan [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] conduct a panel survey, which interviews the same people year after year, to see how their particular behavior evolves over time.

==Recent or continuous city-wide travel surveys==
[[Auckland]], New Zealand - A travel survey was conducted in 2006 and involved 6,000 households in the greater Auckland region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuti.com.au/AHTS06.html Auckland Travel Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106043049/http://www.tuti.com.au/AHTS06.html |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brisbane]], Australia - The South East Queensland Travel Survey collects travel data in the Greater Brisbane region and the neighbouring areas of [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]]. The continuous survey commenced in 2003 and surveys around 6,000 households every two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.qld.gov.au/Home/Projects_and_initiatives/Projects/South_east_queensland_travel_survey/ Queensland Transport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927153110/http://www.transport.qld.gov.au/Home/Projects_and_initiatives/Projects/South_east_queensland_travel_survey/ |date=2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hobart]], Australia - The Greater Hobart Household Travel Survey collects information from 200 households each month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/publications/greater_hobart_household_travel_survey Tasmanian Dept of Transport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918214407/http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/publications/greater_hobart_household_travel_survey |date=2008-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[London]], United Kingdom - The London Travel Demand Survey covers 8,000 households annually. Data is collected via face to face interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/5033.aspx Transport for London]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sydney]], Australia - The continuous Household Travel Survey collects travel data annually for approximately 3,500 households in the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/tdc/house-survey.html NSW Ministry of Transport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720105033/http://transport.nsw.gov.au/tdc/house-survey.html |date=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], United States - The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments conducted a 10,000 household survey in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mwcog.org/transportation/activities/hts/ MWCOG]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent or continuous province/state-wide travel surveys==
[[Southern Ontario]], the Transportation Tomorrow Survey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmg.utoronto.ca/reports/ttsreports.html Data Management Group - University of Toronto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913144459/http://www.dmg.utoronto.ca/reports/ttsreports.html |date=2009-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was conducted in 2005-6 (two phases: September 2005 -&gt; January 2006 and September 2006 -&gt; February 2007). This is a repeat survey using essentially the same instrument as conducted in 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001 and most recently 2006 where 149,631 households comprise the final database.  The survey was conducted using telephone interviews with an advance letter sent to households to solicit their participation.

==Recent or continuous country-wide travel surveys==
[[Denmark]]'s most recent National Travel was initiated in 2006 and has been going on continuously since then. The interviews are conducted using the internet and telephone interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modelcenter.transport.dtu.dk/english/tu]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] is conducting its National Travel Survey since 1994 on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobilitaetspanel.ifv.uni-karlsruhe.de/en The German Mobility Panel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911153315/http://mobilitaetspanel.ifv.uni-karlsruhe.de/en |date=2009-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each household member fills in a travel diary in which he records each trip made during the course of one week. Despite this yearly survey there is another non regular scheduled survey which is conducted again in 2008. 25,000 households are expected to participate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelsurveymethods.org/pdfs/newsletter09_08.pdf travelsurveymethods.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920082123/http://www.travelsurveymethods.org/pdfs/newsletter09_08.pdf |date=2009-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] National Travel Survey surveyed around 34,500 households in 2003. The survey has been conducted yearly since 1985, but with some changes in methodology. Survey forms are mailed out, with follow-up motivational phone calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swov.nl/uk/research/kennisbank/inhoud/90_gegevensbronnen/inhoud/ovg.htm Institute for Road Safety Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Zealand]] the Ministry of Transport annually surveys 4,600 households for a two-day period. Data is collected via face to face interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.govt.nz/research/Pages/TravelSurvey.aspx/ NZ Ministry of Transport]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Unstoppable: Finding Hidden Assets to Renew the Core and Fuel Profitable Growth''''' is a non-fiction book on business strategy by American business consultant [[Chris Zook]]. This is the third book in his ''Profit from the Core'' trilogy, preceded by ''[[Profit from the Core]]'' released in 2001 and ''[[Beyond the Core]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1422103668|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title =Unstoppable: Finding Hidden Assets to Renew the Core and Fuel Profitable Growth by Chris Zook|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/838110.Unstoppable|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=Unstoppable: Finding Hidden Assets to Renew the Core and Fuel Profitable Growth by Chris Zook|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In previous books in the trilogy, Zook explaines how to expand, exploit, and support the current core of a company's [[business model]]. Firms usually go through a common growth cycle. Initially, they focus their resources on establishing their core businesses and using them against competition. Then, companies should leverage their strengths and move into closely related areas of business. Finally, companies exhaust these opportunities and have to redefine their cores, making hard decisions and launching a necessary transformation. When a company tries to redefine its core, often managers follow one of three paths—they commit ever more deeply to what they currently do, they move into segments where they have no experience, or they merge with some other group to create a new megacompany.

Zook argues that each of those moves has a very small chance of success over the long term. The chances are much better when companies examine what they already have, and then map out how to leverage those hidden assets. Zook divides these assets in three categories: undervalued business platforms, unexploited customer assets, and underutilized capabilities. If the company moves in these areas where it already has experience, it may successfully redefine itself to meet the next growth period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duffbert.com/duffbert/blog.nsf/d6plinks/TDUF-73TNKR|publisher=duffbert.com]|title=Book Review - Unstoppable - Finding Hidden Assets to Renew the Core and Fuel Profitable Growth by Chris Zook|accessdate=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2007/06/harvard-business-ideacast-46-u|publisher=[[hbr.org]]|title=Unleash Your Hidden Assets|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{quote|In this volume, Zook draws upon an even wider and deeper wealth of research sources that include about fifty interviews, mostly of CEOs. The title is explained by the fact that he and his associates chose to study most closely those companies “that beat the odds. We also analyzed patterns of failure and estimated the odds of success offered by various paths in various situations.” He goes on to observe that all of the success stories built their renewal on their “hidden assets” that had been previously been undervalued, unrecognized, and/or underutilized. “These assets were not central to the strategy of the past, but they held the key to the future. Furthermore, the older and more complex the company, the greater was the likelihood of finding promising hidden assets.” In other words, many companies already “hold most of the cards for “a winning hand” but do not realize it. No company is forever “unstoppable” but most (if not all) companies can take full advantage of the information and counsel Zook provides in this book to find correct answers to all three of these questions achieve core renewal without “leaps to distant and hot new markets, …being the first adopter of a pioneering new strategy,..[or making] a ‘big bang’ acquisition.” In fact, unless a given organization has “beaten the odds” by sustaining profitable growth, it should first define or redefine its core assets and then grow or renew them, before committing any resources to organizational and/or territorial expansion.}}

'''Offer Shlomi'''  ({{lang-he-n|עוֹפﬧ שלוֹמי}}; born April 25, 1964), better known as '''Vince Offer''', '''Vince Shlomi''', '''"The ShamWow  Guy"''', or '''"The Slap Chop Guy"''' is an [[Israeli American|Israeli-American]] infomercial pitchman, director, writer, and [[comedian]].&lt;ref name="cnbc interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tsgarrest" /&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|last=Brian|first=Greg|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/who-vince-offer-hes-changing-2520378.html|title=Who is Vince Offer? He's Changing the Style of Pitchman for Infomercials|publisher=[[Yahoo! Voices]]|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offer's first major work was the 1999 comedy film ''[[The Underground Comedy Movie]]''. Offer owns, produces, and appears in television commercials for his products "ShamWow!", an absorbent towel; the "Slap Chop", a kitchen utensil; a lint roller called the "Schticky"; a liquid cleaner called "InVinceable"; and another kitchen utensil called "Crank Chop". He has also officially advertised other products that he does not own, such as Quicky Grass.

==Early life==
Offer was born in [[Beersheva]], [[Israel]] and raised in [[Brooklyn, New York City]].&lt;ref name=cleans/&gt;

==Career==

===Film===
In 1999, Offer directed and appeared in ''[[The Underground Comedy Movie]]'', which was met with extremely negative reviews. DVDs of the film were marketed via television [[infomercial]]. The film also led to several lawsuits. Although the film was released and screened in 1999, Offer was bankrupt by 2002 and home video distribution plans were shelved. Offer, who had previously been a successful vegetable chopper salesman and businessman, resumed selling vegetable choppers at swap meets to support himself and raise money to complete his film project. Within a few months, he had earned enough to resume production, and the movie was finally completed, released, and marketed entirely on late-night infomercials that Offer paid for with his earnings from the swap meet vegetable chopper sales. The film has sold in excess of 100,000 copies and Offer has used the proceeds from sales to file a lawsuit against the [[Church of Scientology]].&lt;ref name="rovell"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/28880253 |title=First Interview with Vince from ShamWow! |last=Rovell |first=Darren |date=2009-01-27 |publisher=[[CNBC]].com |accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an ex-Scientologist.&lt;ref name=ew.com&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294037,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Jason | last=Cochran | title=Low-Rent Riot | date=13 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prnews&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-11-2004/0002171569&amp;EDATE= "Filmmaker Sues Church of Scientology"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he appeared as himself in the [[Adam Sandler]] film ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]''. Title character Jill, played by Sandler, referred to him as "the ShamWow guy".

In 2013, Offer released the universally panned ''[[InAPPropriate Comedy]]'', which he directed, wrote and appears in as a character called 'Peeping Tom'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/movies/inappropriate-comedy-directed-by-vince-offer.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Neil | last=Genzlinger | title=‘InAPPropriate Comedy,' Directed by Vince Offer | date=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film was originally envisioned as a sequel to his previous anthology, called ''Underground Comedy 2010''. The film features stars  [[Rob Schneider]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Adrien Brody]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]]. Examples of film sketches include comedian Ari Shaffir as 'The Amazing Racist', with deliberately offensive hidden-camera encounters with members of different minority groups, and Brody as 'Flirty Harry', a ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' spoof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/inappropriate-comedy-red-band-trailer/ Someone Thought It Was a Good Idea to Spend Money On This], Rope of Silicon&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infomercial marketing===

====Background====
Offer funded ''The Underground Comedy Movie'' with his own money, but had difficulty selling it. He put the trailer in an infomercial, and claims to have sold 50,000 copies via direct order and 50,000 more in stores.&lt;ref name="rovell"/&gt; In 2010, he advertised [[Eminem]]'s ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/eminem-taps-shamwow-guy-infomercial-12561 | title=Eminem taps ShamWow guy for infomercial | publisher=[[Adweek]] | date=June 17, 2010 | accessdate=March 8, 2012 | author=Griner, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ShamWow====
In 2006, Offer began to market a cleaning product that he saw in [[flea market]]s, an absorbent towel that he called the "ShamWow!"&lt;ref name=rovell/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=Seth |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2190658/pagenum/all/#page_start |title=Salesjerk; Meet the next great TV pitchman. |date=2008-05-13 |journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the product derives from the French pronunciation of the [[Chamois leather|chamois]], often shortened to "shammy" in English. Offer visited the factory in Germany where the product is made, and he decided to incorporate that fact into the TV pitch.&lt;ref name=rovell/&gt;

The advertisement, filmed in the summer of 2007 with a budget of $20,000, received critical praise.&lt;ref name=rovell/&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com's]]'' Seth Stevenson praised Offer for his "impressive and subtle mastery of the pitchman's art" (with lines such as "you know the Germans always make good stuff"), and wondered if Offer's "abrasive manner might also mark a unique, new strategy in the annals of pitchdom." Stevenson compared Offer to earlier, "more upbeat" television pitchmen like [[Billy Mays]] and the [[Home Shopping Network]] hosts and concluded that Offer's "smooth-talking condescension" was more suited to the present "[[zeitgeist]]" than the "earnest fervor" of spokesmen like Mays and [[Ron Popeil]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

''[[Consumer Reports]]'' reported that the infomercial for "ShamWow!" initially featured Offer claiming that the product held "20 times its weight in liquid". Later, the infomercial was changed to Offer claiming the "ShamWow!" held "12 times its weight in liquid", then again to "10 times". ''Consumer Reports'' did its own test on the product and found that it does indeed hold 10 times its weight in liquid but no more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/home/2009/05/shamwow-cloth-wipes-consumer-reports-review.html|title=Consumer Reports: ShamWow fails to wow in Consumer Reports tests|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offer says that he has sold millions of the towels. In contrast to claims that the absorbency of the towels are over-hyped, he responds that returns are low.&lt;ref name=rovell/&gt;

Pitchman Billy Mays had been promoting a similar product called [[Zorbeez]] two years prior to Offer's "ShamWow!" product. Mays noted that the "ShamWow!" commercials use many of the same [[product demonstration]]s as the earlier-produced Zorbeez commercial. In February 2009 while on the [[Adam Carolla]] radio show, Billy Mays publicly challenged Offer to a "pitch off" between their respective absorbent towel products.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} ''Popular Mechanics'' tested the absorbency of the two towel products and declared "ShamWow!" was the more effective of the two, but noted "If you have reusable cloth rags (and a roll of paper towels for backup), then neither product is necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sawyers|first=Harry|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/home_journal_news/4309587.html|title=Shamwow vs. Zorbeez: Which works Better? As Seen On TV Lab Test|date=March 29, 2009 |accessdate=March 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the episode, it was suggested that the ''Popular Mechanics'' tester did not use the Zorbeez correctly.&lt;ref&gt;Pitchmen, episode: "Revenge of the Pitchmen" (2009-07-01).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the popularity of the commercial, ''[[TMZ (website)|TMZ]]'' in 2009 posted a remix of the commercial on their site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tmz.com/2009/10/22/shamwow-guy-sir-remix-a-lot/#.T1isKMx0qHk | title=ShamWow Guy -- Sir Remix-a-Lot | publisher=[[TMZ (website)|TMZ]] | date=October 22, 2009 | accessdate=March 8, 2012 | author=[[TMZ (website)|TMZ]] Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remix was originally created by [[DJ]] [[Steve Porter (producer)|Steve Porter]] and uploaded on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV6puTS14Ho&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vince Offer at Rosebowl Fleamarket.jpg|left|187px|thumb|Vince pitching the ''Slap Chop'' in August 2008]]

====Slap Chop====
In December 2008, Offer, who had previously sold kitchen utensils at [[swap meets]],&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt; appeared in another [[Kitchen gadget|kitchen-gadget]] infomercial, advertising the Slap Chop and the Graty. The Slap Chop is a hand-held chopping device with internal blades; to operate it, the user places it over a food item and slaps down the button on the top. The Graty is a cheese grater operated by placing the cheese inside and then turning the outside housing of the utensil which causes the cheese to be grated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/main/6215205.html |title=Hoffman: A vote for Jay, against Conan |last=Hoffman |first=Ken |date=2009-01-16 |publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' |accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these devices are offered in several colors. Offer's [[hard sell|aggressiveness]] and use of [[double entendre]]s like "you're gonna love my nuts" have been noted by ''[[AdWeek]]'',&lt;ref name="Griner"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2009/01/how-vince-became-an-infomercial-superstar.html |title=How Vince Became an Infomercial Superstar |last=Griner |first=David |date=2009-01-19 |publisher=''adfreak.com, an online publication of [[Adweek]]'' |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to an ''[[Adweek]]'' blog, helped make Offer "the man who could beat Billy Mays at his own game."{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Billy Mays]] had been promoting a similar product set which included the Quick Chop utensil and the Quick Grater utensil prior to Offer's Slap Chop/Graty product set. Mays again noted that the Slap Chop commercials use many of the same demos as the earlier-produced Quick Chop commercial. Mays said in the same [[Adam Carolla]] radio show interview in February 2009 that Offer stole not only the Zorbeez product idea, but also the Quick Chop idea.&lt;ref name="corolla"&gt;[http://www.thedailytube.com/video/15991/billy-mays-shampows-shamwow-guy The Daily Tube: Billy Mays 'ShamPows' ShamWow Guy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505011352/http://www.thedailytube.com/video/15991/billy-mays-shampows-shamwow-guy |date=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, DJ [[Steve Porter (producer)|Steve Porter]] posted an [[electro music|electro]]-themed "Slap Chop Rap" [[Auto Tune]] remix which grew a [[cult following]] during July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-42742106/slap-chops-vince-shlomi-spawns-remix-cult-on-youtube/ | title=Slap Chop's Vince Shlomi Spawns Remix Cult on YouTube | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=July 6, 2009 | accessdate=March 8, 2012 | author=Edwards, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montgomery|first1=James|title=Eminem And Snoop Dogg Recognize Vince ‘ShamWow!’ Offer’s Street Cred|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/06/16/eminem-shamwow-guy/|website=MTV|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schticky====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:vince-offer-schticky.jpg|thumb|left|The commercial makes many references, such as this one when Vince Offer had his mugshot taken.{{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 11 March 2012}}]] --&gt;
In 2012 Offer returned to television selling the "Schticky", a reusable lint roller that comes in three sizes: little Schticky, Schticky, and big Schticky.

The commercial makes many references to his other two commercials for the ShamWow and the Slap Chop, with Offer saying many of his catchphrases. He also pokes fun at his 2009 arrest by posing for a fake [[mugshot]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.schticky.com/ Official Schticky website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Vince+Offer/articles/48OLfFMo7Cr/The+Schticky+by+Vince+Offer|title=The Schticky by Vince Offer|publisher=advertfix.com|date=January 10, 2012|accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/infomercial-pariah-vince-offer-returns-brand-new-spot-137406 | title=Infomercial Pariah Vince Offer Returns With Brand-New Spot Pokes fun at 2009 arrest in Schticky pitch | publisher=[[Adweek]] | date=January 9, 2012 | accessdate=March 8, 2012 | author=Nudd, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schticky commercial was co-written by the comedian [[Dante (comedian)|Dante]].

====InVINCEable====

In 2013, Offer began a series of advertisements pitching a kitchen cleaner called "InVINCEable". He hoped that this product, the first one he developed himself, would be the start of a comeback. He also expressed interest in working as a [[TV producer]] for other salespeople.&lt;ref name=cleans&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2421116/ShamWow-guy-Vince-Offer-makes-comeback-cleans-act-following-arrest-beating-prostitute.html |title= Notorious 'ShamWow infomercial guy' cleans up his act in comeback four years after his arrest for 'beating up a prostitute' |first= Ryan |last= Gorman |date= 15 September 2013 |accessdate= 2014-01-06 |location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada Green====
In April 2014, Offer appeared in a "Canada Green" commercial advertising their "Quicky Grass" product.&lt;ref name = "Quicky"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/05/prweb11847178.htm| title=Vince the ‘ShamWow’ Guy Returns With a New Product| publisher=prweb.com| date=May 13, 2014| accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

===Lawsuits===
''[[The Underground Comedy Movie]]'' was the subject of several lawsuits filed by Offer against others. On September 23, 1998, Vince Offer filed a suit against [[20th Century Fox]] and Bobby and Peter Farrelly, the co-directors of ''[[There's Something About Mary]]''. Offer claimed that 14 scenes in ''Mary'' were lifted from his film. The Farrellys released this statement: "We've never heard of him, we've never heard of his movie, and it's all a bunch of baloney."&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285287,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first1=Dave | last1=Karger | first2=Suna | last2=Chang | title=Monitor | date=16 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed with prejudice on a motion for [[summary judgment]] by order of the court in 2000, and [[Twentieth Century Fox]] was awarded $66,336.92 in attorneys' fees.&lt;ref&gt;''Offer v. Farrelly'', Case No. CV 98-7697 RAP(RCx) (C.D. Cal. Jan. 13, 2000); ''id.'' (Mar. 14, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Offer successfully sued [[Anna Nicole Smith]] for $4 million, claiming that Smith had agreed to be in his movie, but backed out in 1996 over fears that appearing in the movie would be detrimental to her career.&lt;ref name="imdbnews"&gt;[http://imdb.com/news/wenn/2000-10-23#celeb7 Movie &amp; TV News @ IMDb.com - WENN - 23 October 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Offer won the lawsuit, but the case was settled anyway.

In 2004, Offer sent out a press release through prnewsonline.com announcing his intention to sue the Church of Scientology. In 1997, while production was ongoing, the [[Church of Scientology]] had allegedly begun a large-scale [[smear campaign]] against Offer and his film (Offer was a Scientologist at the time).&lt;ref name="prnews"/&gt;
The director claimed the Scientologists' "[[Celebrity Center]]" in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] labeled him a "criminal" (based on the rules of Scientology) and threatened his Scientology friends in the movie business with "condemnation" punishment that could be lethal to their careers if they did not write malicious reports against Offer.&lt;ref name=prnews/&gt;

===Arrest===
On February 7, 2009, Offer was arrested in [[Miami Beach, Florida]] on a charge of [[aggravated battery|felony battery]] after an altercation with a 26-year-old [[sex worker]]. Offer contended that he struck the prostitute when she "bit his tongue and would not let go." Prosecutors later declined to file formal charges against either person.&lt;ref name="tsgarrest"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0327092sham1.html |title=ShamWow Guy In Slap, Chop Bust |date=2009-03-27 |agency=[[The Smoking Gun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ottawacitizen327"&gt;{{cite news|title=ShamWow Guy arrested after hotel fight with woman: Smoking Gun |date=2009-03-27 |url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/Technology/ShamWow+arrested+after+hotel+fight+with+woman+Smoking/1436935/story.html |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |accessdate=2009-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331041423/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/Technology/ShamWow%20arrested%20after%20hotel%20fight%20with%20woman%20Smoking/1436935/story.html |archivedate=March 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrea-chalupa/shamwow-guy-the-movie_b_180237.html | title=ShamWow Guy the Movie: Noooo! | publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=March 27, 2009 | accessdate=March 8, 2012 | author=Chalupa, Andrea}}&lt;/ref&gt;
