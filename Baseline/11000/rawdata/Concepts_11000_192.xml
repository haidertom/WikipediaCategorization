'''''A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution and Cooperation''''' is a 1999 book by [[Peter Singer]], in which the author argues that the view of human nature provided by evolution (e.g., [[evolutionary psychology]]) is compatible with and should be incorporated into the ideological framework of the [[Left-Right politics|Left]].

==Summary==
Singer believes that the Left will be better able to achieve its social and economic goals if it incorporates the more accurate view of human nature provided by evolutionary science: "To be blind to the facts about human nature is to risk disaster". For example, Singer argues that the Left's view of human nature as highly malleable, which he identifies with [[Marxism]] and the [[standard social science model]], is incorrect.

Singer argues that evolutionary psychology suggests that humans naturally tend to be self-interested. He further argues that the evidence that selfish tendencies are natural must not be taken as evidence that selfishness is right. He concludes that [[game theory]] (the mathematical study of strategy) and experiments in psychology offer hope that self-interested people will make short-term sacrifices for the good of others, if society provides the right conditions. Essentially Singer claims that although humans possess selfish, competitive tendencies naturally, they have a substantial capacity for [[co-operation (evolution)|cooperation]] that has also been selected for during [[human evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Left Got Darwin Wrong|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-the-left-got-darwin-w|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=25 May 2012|author=Leigh Van Valen|date=June 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosopher [[Philip Kitcher]] has criticised the book's handling of [[sociobiology]], saying that it contains "credulous retailing of sociobiological speculations" while noting that "much of this book is admirable in its clarity, directness, and grasp of central points".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kitcher | first1 = P. | title = Peter Singer, A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution, and Cooperation | doi = 10.1086/339782 | journal = Ethics | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 861–863 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6690">'''Abhasavada''' ([[Sanskrit]]: आभासवाद) is the term derived from the word Abhasa meaning mere or fallacious appearance, reflection, looking like, light, semblance of reason, intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=Abhasavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ij3fUtH8MeTmywOn4IHQAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Abhasavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu philosophy]] this term refers to the Theory of Appearance, both of the [[Shaivism|Shaivite school]] and the [[Advaita Vedanta]], though with differing connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.1|author=Ganga Ram Garg|publisher=Concept Publishing Co.|page=95|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=Abhasavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ij3fUtH8MeTmywOn4IHQAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Abhasavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shaivites rely on Maheshvaraya (Sovereignty of Will) of [[Shiva]], the creator-sustainer-destroyer to explain Creation. Jnanadikara deals with two theories a) Svatantryavada and b) Abhasavada to explain Shiva’s volitional power. The whole creation or manifestation is the result of the Kriya Sakti of the Lord who becomes Nirmana Sakti (constituent power) owing to the operation of three laws viz. the law of Division (bheda-bheda), the law of Perception (mana-tat-phala-meya) and the law of Causation (Karya karana, Kriya Sakti). [[Svātantrya|Svatantryavada]] or the universal voluntarism is the chief doctrine of the [[Pratyabhijna]] system; it is the doctrine of self-dependence or sovereignty of the Lord’s Will which imparts impetus to the process of the world. It explains the creative power in Nature and multiplication of effect. This theory replaced Arambhavada (theory of Realistic creation), [[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Parinamavada]] (theory of transformation) and [[Vivartavada]] (theory of Manifestation). Abhasavada is the Pratyabhijna’s theory of Manifestation, propounded by Utpalacarya and influenced Abhinavagupta, which explains [[Monism]] and holds the world objects as manifestations or Abhasas, and the view that it is the very nature of Shiva, the Supreme Cause (Parma Shiva), to manifest Himself in diverse forms of the universe, that the whole universe is an abhasa of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Literary Heritage of Kashmir|author=Krishan Lal Kala|publisher=Mittal Publications|pages=275–279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzozRa9wJ9kC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;dq=abhasavada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6xJ0eQ65F4&amp;sig=H6g-JH12eNIb2V9eED2S3WmMytQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VjLfUoLXMM_vygOW1IDoBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=abhasavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognizes the truth that appearance as appearance or as process of the world, is real, the appearance is not a superimposition on Shiva actively involved in free spontaneous kriya of creation. Prakrti is projection of the free-will of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kashmir Shaivism: Under Siege|author=M.G.Chitkara|publisher=APH Publication|pages=113–115|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5CK0DFijayQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=Abhasavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9V7fUszeDeW7yQPxu4CYBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Abhasavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Advaita Vedanta version, Abhasavada, the theory of appearance advocated by [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Suresvara]], holds that the individual soul is merely an illusory appearance – a projection – of Brahman-intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy and Religion Vol.1|author=Nagendra Kumar Singh|publisher=Global Vision Publishing|page=2|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Uec1E8DpiH8C&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Abhasavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9V7fUszeDeW7yQPxu4CYBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Abhasavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this school of thought championed by [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]], at the level of Consciousness [[Jiva]] and [[Ishvara]] are considered to be mere reflection or appearance of the One Impartite [[Brahman]]; because they are identical with Brahman they have no separate identity of their own. Suresvara maintains that Jivas are as real as Brahman, they being primary appearances in and through avidya, while the objects of the world are unreal, they being secondary appearances, the mere reflections of the primary appearances. Reality thus appearing in [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]] is the cause of all further outward appearances by way of phenomenal or empirical entities, recognized as illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhamati and Vivarna Schools of Advaita Vedanta: A Critical Approach|author=Pulasth Soobah Roodurmum|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=160|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Uec1E8DpiH8C&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Abhasavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9V7fUszeDeW7yQPxu4CYBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Abhasavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankara holds the view that Avidya or [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]], the metaphysical Ignorance, is of the nature of a superimposition of Self on the Not-self ([[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]]), the real on the real and vice versa, there cannot be superimposition on the empty void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Method of the Vedanta: A Critical Account of the Advaita Tradition|author=Swami Satchianandendra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=263|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMkbWhjE2M4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Theory+of+Appearance++Advaita+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jWnfUpeLDoyS7Qbgh4HYDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Theory%20of%20Appearance%20%20Advaita%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the universe is nothing but self-creation (Brahma Sutra I.iv.26); Brahman creates all things by transforming Itself into all things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Thousand Teachings: The Upadesasahasri of Sankara|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=SUNY Press|page=19|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8fkLggRFFBwC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Theory+of+Appearance++Advaita+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jWnfUpeLDoyS7Qbgh4HYDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Theory%20of%20Appearance%20%20Advaita%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pratibimbavada]], the theory of reflection, evolved from Abhasavada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10369">The '''active intellect''' ([[Latin]]: ''intellectus agens''; also translated as '''agent intellect''', '''active intelligence''', '''active reason''', or '''productive intellect''') is a concept in classical and medieval [[philosophy]]. The term refers to the [[Substantial form|formal]] (''morphe'') aspect of the intellect (''[[nous]]''), in accordance with the theory of [[Hylomorphism (Aristotelian)|hylomorphism]]. 

The nature of the active intellect was the subject of intense discussion in medieval philosophy, as various Muslim, Jewish and Christian thinkers sought to reconcile their commitment to Aristotle's account of the body and soul to their own theological commitments. At stake in particular was in what way Aristotle's account of an incorporeal soul might contribute to understanding of the nature of eternal life.

== Aristotle's conception ==
The idea is first encountered in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[On the Soul|''De Anima'']], Book III. Following is the translation of one of those passages (''De Anima'', Bk. III, ch. 5, 430a10-25) by Joe Sachs, with some notes about the Greek:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Joe |last=Sachs |title=Aristotle's On the Soul and On Memory and Recollection|year=2001|publisher=Green Lion Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...since in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] one thing is the material ([[matter|''hulē'']]) for each kind ''([[genos]])'' (this is what is in potency all the particular things of that kind) but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it is necessary in the soul (''[[psyche (psychology)|psuchē]]'') too that these distinct aspects be present;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the one sort is intellect (''[[nous]]'') by becoming all things, the other sort by forming all things, in the way an active condition (''[[hexis]]'') like [[light]] too makes the colors that are in potency be at work as colors (''to phōs poiei ta [[dunamis|dunamei]] onta chrōmata [[energeia]]i chrōmata'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;This sort of intellect [which is like light in the way it makes potential things work as what they are] is separate, as well as being without attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a [[being-at-work]], for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Knowledge]] (''epistēmē''), in its being-at-work, is the same as the thing it knows, and while knowledge in potency comes first in time in any one knower, in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is destructible), and without this nothing thinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage tries to explain "how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does." He inferred that the energeia/dunamis distinction must also exist in the soul itself.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle says that the [[passive intellect]] receives the [[intelligible form]]s of things, but that the active intellect is required to make the potential knowledge into actual knowledge, in the same way that light makes potential colors into actual colors. 

The passage is often read together with ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book XII, ch.7-10, where Aristotle also discusses the human mind and distinguishes between the active and [[passive intellect|passive]] intellects. In that passage Aristotle appears to equate the active intellect with the "[[unmoved mover]]" and [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D12%3Asection%3D1072b 1072b].&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=May 2017}}

==Interpretations==
Sachs comments that the nature of the active intellect was "the source of a massive amount of commentary and of fierce disagreement"; elsewhere, chapter 5 of ''De Anima'' has been referred to as "the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt; As Davidson remarks: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - terms not even explicit in the ''De anima'' and at best implied - and just how he understood the interaction between them remains moot. Students of the history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Greek'''

The early Greek commentators on Aristotle, in particular [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Themistius]], gave several different interpretations of the distinction between the active and passive intellects. Some of them regarded the active intellect as a power external to the human mind, Alexander going so far as to identify it with God. 

Later, both these interpretations, [[Neoplatonist]] ones, and perhaps others, influenced the development of an important Arabic language philosophical literature, using the term ''[['aql]]'' as the translation for ''nous''. This literature was later translated into, and commented upon, in Latin and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish and Islamic'''

[[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], and also the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]], agreed with the "external" interpretation of active intellect, and held that the active intellect was the lowest of the ten emanations descending through the [[celestial spheres]]. Maimonides cited it in his definition of [[prophecy]] where 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Prophecy is, in truth and reality, an emanation sent forth by the [[God|Divine Being]] through the medium of the Active Intellect, in the first instance to man's [[Reason|rational faculty]], and then to his [[Imagination|imaginative faculty]].&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, [[Guide for the Perplexed]] (translator: [[Michael Friedländer]]), Dover: New York, 1904, [http://www.meru.org/Advisors/Sunwall/RambamProphecy.html p. 225]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; The more strictly Aristotelian Muslims (in particular [[Avempace]] and [[Averroes]]) wrote about how one could conjoin oneself with the active intellect, thus attaining philosophical nirvana.  

The reason of the Islamic and Jewish Aristotelians for positing a single external Agent Intellect is that all (rational) human beings are considered by Aristotelians to possess or have access to a fixed and stable set of concepts, a unified correct knowledge of the universe.  The only way that all human minds could possess the same correct knowledge is if they all had access to some central knowledge store, as terminals might have access to a mainframe computer {{Harv|Kraemer|2003}}. This mainframe is the Agent Intellect, the "mind" of the universe, which makes all other cognition possible.

'''Western Christian'''

In medieval and Renaissance Europe some thinkers, such as [[Siger of Brabant]], adopted the interpretation of Averroes on every point, as did the later school of "Paduan Averroists". [[Thomas Aquinas]] elaborated on Aristotle's distinction between the active intellect and passive intellect in his ''Disputed Questions on the Soul'' and his commentary on Aristotle's ''De anima'', arguing, against Averroes, that the active intellect is part of the individual human personality. A third school, of "Alexandrists", rejected the argument linking the active intellect to the [[immortality]] of the soul, while hastening to add that they still believed in immortality as a matter of religious faith. (See [[Pietro Pomponazzi]]; [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]].)

The active intellect, in the sense described, is more properly called the Agent Intellect, as it is the force triggering intellection in the human mind and causing thoughts to pass from the potential to the actual. It must not be confused with the "intellect in act", which is the result of that triggering, and is more akin to the psychological term "active knowledge".  Another term for the final result of intellection, that is to say a person's accumulated knowledge, is the "acquired intellect".

'''Auditory learning''' is a  [[learning style]] in which a person learns through listening. An auditory learner depends on listening and speaking as a main way of learning.&lt;ref name="Kostelnik, M.J. 2004"&gt;Kostelnik, M.J., Soderman, A.K., Whiren, AP. (2004). Developmentally Appropriate Curriculum: Best Practices in Early Childhood Education (3rd ed.). Columbus: Pearson, Merrill Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory learners must be able to hear what is being said in order to understand and may have difficulty with instructions that are drawn but if the writing is in a logical order  it can be easier to understand. They also use their listening and repeating skills to sort through the information that is sent to them. They are good listeners when people speak.&lt;ref name="Vincent, A. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vincent | first1 = A. | last2 = Ross | first2 = D. | year = 2001 | title = Learning Style Awareness | url = | journal = Journal of Research on Computing in Education | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Auditory learners may have a knack for ascertaining the true meaning of someone's words by listening to audible signals like changes in [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]. When memorizing a phone number, an auditory learner will say it out loud and then remember how it sounded to recall it.

Auditory learners are good at writing responses to lectures they’ve heard. They’re also good at oral exams, effectively by listening to information delivered orally, in lectures, speeches, and oral sessions.

Proponents claim that when an auditory/verbal learner reads, it is almost impossible for the learner to comprehend anything without sound in the background. In these situations, listening to music or having different sounds in the background ([[Television|TV]], people talking, [[music]], etc.) will help learners work better.

Auditory learners are good at storytelling. They solve problems by talking them through. Speech patterns include phrases “I hear you; That clicks; It's ringing a bell”, and other sound or voice-oriented information. These learners will move their lips or talk to themselves to help accomplish tasks.&lt;ref name="Kostelnik, M.J. 2004" /&gt;

==Recommended techniques==

Proponents say that teachers should use these techniques to instruct auditory learners: verbal direction, group discussions, verbal reinforcement, group activities, reading aloud, and putting information into a rhythmic pattern such as a rap, poem, or song.&lt;ref name="Kostelnik, M.J. 2004" /&gt;

==Prevalence==
Auditory learners make up about 30% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Steven, and Terry Steelblahe. Monsters and Magical Sticks. Gay Falcon. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of evidence==
Although learning styles have "enormous popularity", and both children and adults express personal preferences, there is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes, and there is significant evidence that the widely touted "meshing hypothesis" (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style) is invalid.&lt;ref name=Pashler&gt;{{cite journal

'''Bandenbekämpfung''' is a German-language term that means "bandit fighting" or "combating of bandits". In the context of German military history, ''Bandenbekämpfung'' was an operational doctrine that was part of countering [[Resistance movement|resistance]] or insurrection in the rear during wars.  Another more common understanding of ''Bandenbekämpfung'' is anti-partisan warfare. The doctrine of "bandit-fighting" provided a rationale to target and murder any number of groups, from armed [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] to civilian population, as "bandits" or "members of gangs". As applied by the [[German Empire]] and then [[Nazi Germany]], it became instrumental in the [[genocide|genocidal programs]] implemented by the two regimes, including the [[Holocaust]].

==Origins==
Under the German Empire established by Bismarck in 1871 after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]—formed also with the union of twenty-five German states under the Hohenzollern king—Prussian militarism flourished; martial traditions that included the military doctrine of Antoine-Henri Jomini's 1837 treatise, ''Summary of the Art of War'' were put into effect.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=5}} Some of the theories laid out by Jomini contained instructions for intense offensive operations and the necessity of securing one's "lines of operations."{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=5}} German military officers took this to mean as much attention should be given to logistical operations used to fight the war at the rear as those in the front; this most certainly entailed security operations to protect the lines.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=5}} Following Jomini's lead, Obersleutnant Albrecht von  Boguslawski published lectures entitled ''Der Kleine Krieg'' (The Small War), which outlined in detail the tactical procedures related to partisan and anti-partisan warfare—likely deliberately written without clear distinctions between combatant and non-combatants.{{sfn|Blood|2006|pp=5–6}} To what extent this contributed to the intensification of unrestrained warfare cannot be known, but Prussian officers like [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] encouraged his professional soldiers to embrace a dictum advocating that "for every problem, there was a military solution."{{sfn|Blood|2006|pp=8–9}} 

Prussian security operations during the Franco-Prussian War included the use of the ''[[Landwehr]]'', whose duties ranged from guarding railroad lines, to taking hostages, and carrying out reprisals to deter activities of the ''franc-tireur.''{{sfn|Blood|2006|pp=10–11}} Foreign Minister of Prussia under Wilhelm I and later German Chancellor, [[Otto von Bismarck]], wanted all ''franc-tireurs'' hung or shot, and encouraged his military commanders to burn down villages that housed them.{{sfn|Wawro|2009|p=279}} More formal structures like Chief of the Field Railway, a Military Railway Corps, District Commanders, Special Military Courts, intelligence units, and military police of varying duties and nomenclature were integrated into the Prussian system to bolster security operations all along the military's operational lines.{{sfn|Blood|2006|pp=12–14}}  Such was the heritage of German anti-partisan warfare. Operationally, the first attempts to use tactics that would later develop into ''Bandenbekämpfung'' or be recognized as such were carried out in China in the wake of the [[Boxer Rebellion]], after two German officers went missing, which was followed up with more than fifty operations by German troops, who set fire to a village and held prisoners. Shortly after these operations, the infantry was provided with a handbook for "operations against Chinese bandits" (''Bänden'').{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=15}} The first full application of ''Bandenbekämpfung'' in practice, however, was the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide]], a campaign of racial extermination and collective punishment that the [[German Empire]] undertook in [[German South West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]) against the [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people]].{{sfn|Blood|2006|pp=16–18}}

==World War I==
During the [[First World War]], the German army ignored many of the commonly understood European conventions of war, when between August and October 1914,{{Efn|A more thorough examination of the German Army's crimes during the First World War can be found in the following work: Horne, John and Alan Kramer. ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2001.}} they deliberately killed some 6,500 French and Belgian citizens.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=20}} Throughout the war, Germany's integrated intelligence, perimeter police, guard network, and border control measures all coalesced to define the German military's security operations.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=21}} Along the Eastern front sometime in August 1915, Field Marshal Falkenhayn established a general government under General von Beseler, creating an infrastructure to support ongoing military operations, which included guards posts, patrols and a security network. Unfortunately, maintaining security meant dealing with Russian prisoners, many of whom tried to sabotage German plans and kill German soldiers, so harsh pacification measures and terror actions were carried out to deal with these partisans (including brutal reprisals against civilians), otherwise known as bandits.{{sfn|Blood|2006|pp=22–23}} Before long, similar practices were being instituted throughout both the Eastern and Western areas of German occupation.{{sfn|Blood|2006|pp=24–25}}

==World War II==
German army policy for deterring partisan or "bandit" activities against its forces was to strike "such terror into the population that it loses all will to resist."{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=234}} Even before the Nazi campaign in the east had begun, Hitler had already absolved his soldiers from any responsibility for brutality against civilians, expecting his soldiers and police forces to kill anyone that even "looked askance" at the German forces.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=234}} Much of the partisan warfare became an exercise of anti-Semitism, as military commanders like General Bechtolsheim exclaimed that whenever an act of sabotage was committed and one killed the Jews from that village, then "one can be certain that one has destroyed the perpetrators, or at least those who stood behind them."{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=234}} 
When the [[Wehrmacht]] entered Serbia in 1941, they carried out mass reprisals against partisans by executing Jews there.{{sfn|Gregor|2008|p=7}} The commander responsible for combating partisan warfare in 1941, General Böhme, reiterated to the German forces, "that rivers of German blood" had been spilled in Serbia during the First World War and the Wehrmacht should consider any acts of violence there as "avenging these deaths."{{sfn|Gregor|2008|p=17}}  

From September 1941 onwards through the course of [[World War II]], the term ''Bandenbekämpfung'' supplanted ''Partisanenkämpfung'' ([[Counter-insurgency|anti-partisan warfare]]) to become the guiding principle of [[Nazi Germany]]'s security warfare and occupational policies; largely as a result of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s insistence that for psychological reasons, bandit was somehow preferable.{{sfn|Heer|2000|pp=112–113}} On 23 October 1942, Himmler named [[SS]] General [[Erich von dem Bach-Zalewski]] the "Commisioner for anti-bandit warfare."{{sfn|Heer|2000|p=113}} Then Himmler transferred [[Curt von Gottberg|SS-Brigadeführer von Gottberg]] to Belorussia to ensure that the ''Bandenbekämpfung'' operations were conducted on a permanent basis, a task which Gottberg carried out with fanatical ruthlessness, declaring the entire population bandits, Jews, Gypsies, spies, or bandit sympathizers.{{sfn|Heer|2000|p=113}} During Gottberg's first major operations, Operations Nürnberg and Hamburg, conducted between November thru December 1942, he reported 5,000 murdered Jews, another 5,000 bandits or suspects eliminated, and 30 villages burned down.{{sfn|Heer|2000|p=114}} 

In October 1942—just a couple months prior to Gottberg's exploits—Reichsmarschall [[Hermann Göring]] had ordered "anti-bandit warfare" in Army Group Rear Area Center, which was shortly followed by an OKH Directive on 11 November 1942 for "anti-bandit warfare in the East" that announced sentimental considerations as "irresponsible" and instructed the men to shoot or preferably hang bandits, including women.{{sfn|Heer|2000|p=114}} Misgivings from commanders within Army Group Rear that such operations were counterproductive and in poor taste since women and children were being murdered went ignored or resisted from Bach-Zalewski, who frequently "cited the special powers of the Reichsführer."{{sfn|Heer|2000|p=115}} Over time, the Wehrmacht acculturated to the large scale anti-bandit operations, as the enemy was not simply populated by partisan groups, but instead they too came to see the entire population as criminal and complicit in any operation against German troops. In fact, many of the Wehrmacht commanders were unbothered by the fact that these operations fell under the jurisdiction of the SS.{{sfn|Heer|2000|pp=118–119}} 

[[Einsatzgruppen]], [[Order Police]], [[Sonderkommando]] units, and army forces—for the most part—worked cooperatively to combat partisans (bandits), not only acting as judge, jury, and executioners in the field, but also in plundering "bandit areas"; they laid these areas to waste, seized crops and livestock, enslaved the local population or murdered them.{{sfn|Shepherd|2016|pp=364–367}} Anti-bandit operations were characterized by "special cruelty."{{sfn|Messerschmidt|2000|p=394}} For instance, Soviet Jews were murdered outright under the pretext that they were partisans per Hitler's orders.{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=263}} Historian Timothy Snyder asserts that by the second half of 1942, "German anti-partisan operations were all but indistinguishable from the mass murder of the Jews."{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=240}} Other historians have made similar observations. Omer Bartov argued that under the auspices of destroying their "so-called political and biological enemies," often described as  "bandits" or "partisans," the Nazis made no effort "to distinguish between real guerrillas, political suspects, and Jews."{{sfn|Bartov|1991|p=83}} 

Surging operations from better equipped partisans against Army Group Center during 1943 intensified to the degree that the [[221st Security Division (Wehrmacht)|221st Security Division's]] did not just eliminate "bandits" but laid entire regions where they operated to waste.{{sfn|Shepherd|2004|p=166}}{{Efn|This practice was in keeping with Führer Directive 46, where once pro-bandit areas were turned into "dead zones" by the German forces.}} The scale of this effort must be taken into consideration, as historian Michael Burleigh reports that anti-partisan operations had a significant impact on German operations in the East; namely, since they caused "widespread economic disruption, tied down manpower which could have been deployed elsewhere, and by instilling fear and provoking extreme countermeasures, drove a wedge between occupiers and occupied."{{sfn|Burleigh|1997|p=103}} 

Following the [[Warsaw Uprising]] of August 1944, the Nazis intensified their anti-partisan operations in Poland, during which the German forces employed their version of anti-partisan tactics by shooting upwards of 120,000 civilians in Warsaw.{{sfn|Snyder|2015|p=273}} Ideologically speaking, since partisans represented an immediate existential threat, in that, they were equated with Jews or people under their influence, the systematic murder of anyone associated with them was an expression of the regime's racial anti-Semitism and was viewed by members of the Wehrmacht as a "necessity of war."{{sfn|Fritze|2014|pp=79–80}}  

Throughout the war in Europe, and especially during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|German-Soviet War, 1941–45]], these doctrines amalgamated with the Nazi regime's genocidal plans for the racial reshaping of the Eastern Europe to secure "living space" (''[[Lebensraum]]'') for Germany. In the first eleven months of the war against the Soviet Union, the German forces liquidated in excess of 80,000 "alleged" partisans.{{sfn|Bessel|2006|p=128}} Implemented by units of the SS, Wehrmacht and Order Police, ''Bandenbekämpfung'' as applied by the Nazi regime and directed by the SS across occupied Europe led to mass [[crimes against humanity]] and was an instrumental part of the [[Holocaust]].{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=xx}}

==Führer Directive 46==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-031-2436-03A, Russland, Hinrichtung von Partisanen.jpg|thumb|upright|Original caption reads: "Soviet Union: Execution of partisans. 21 January 1941" (Source: ''[[Wehrmacht Propaganda Troops|PK]]'' 666).]]

In July 1942, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the [[SS]], was appointed to lead the security initiatives in rear areas. One of his first actions in this role was the prohibition of the use of "partisan" to describe counter-insurgents.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=626–627}} Bandits (''Banden'') was the term chosen to be used by German forces instead.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=627}} Hitler insisted that Himmler was "solely responsible" for combating bandits except in districts under military administration; such districts were under the authority of the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=627}} The organisational changes, putting experienced SS killers in charge, and language that criminalised resistance, whether real or imagined, presaged the transformation of security warfare into massacres.{{sfn|Westermann|2005|pp=191–192}}  

The radicalisation of "anti-bandit" warfare saw further impetus in the [[Adolf_Hitler%27s_directives#F%C3%BChrer_Directive_No._46|Führer Directive 46]] of 18 August 1942, where security warfare's aim was defined as "complete extermination". The directive called on the security forces to act with "utter brutality", while providing immunity from prosecution for any acts committed during "bandit-fighting" operations.{{sfn|Geyer|Edele|2009|p=380}}

The directive designated the SS as the organisation responsible for rear-area warfare in areas under [[Reichskommissariat|civilian administration]]. In areas under military jurisdiction (the [[Army Group Rear Area Command (Wehrmacht)|Army Group Rear Areas]]), the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Army High Command]] had the overall responsibility. The directive declared the entire population of "bandit" (i.e. partisan-controlled) territories as enemy combatants. In practice, this meant that the aims of security warfare was not pacification, but complete destruction and depopulation of "bandit" and "bandit-threatened" territories, turning them into "dead zones" (''Tote Zonen'').{{sfn|Geyer|Edele|2009|p=380}}

"'''Best friends forever'''" ("'''BFF'''") is a phrase that describes a close [[friendship]].

==Definition==
A BFF is a term for someone's best friend&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary, 
[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bff  BFF], Official website, UK, retrieved August 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and are characterized by  trust, and permanence.&lt;ref name=Levine_ch1&gt;{{citation |chapter=Ch. 1: Understanding Female Friendships |title=Best Friends Forever |author=Irene S. Levine |publisher=Penguin |year=2009 |isbn=9781590203705}}&lt;/ref&gt; BFFs are usually in close contact and have shared experiences, such as attending the same school or sharing musical tastes. Relationships described as BFF are common in [[high school]] and often decline when the parties go to college.&lt;ref name=Oswald&gt;{{citation |title=Best friends forever?: High school best friendships and the transition to college |author=Debra L. Oswald, Eddie M. Clark |year=2003 |doi=10.1111/1475-6811.00045 |journal=Personal Relationships |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=187–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term BFF does not necessarily convey exclusivity; depending on a person's individual interpretation or philosophy of the concept of "BFF", an individual may not have more than one BFF simultaneously.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-friendship-doctor/201009/bff-dob-1996-welcome-the-oxford-english-dictionary|title=BFF: DOB 1996 - Welcome to the Oxford English Dictionary|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Although the concept of having or being a "best friend" is ageless, the acronym BFF was popularized as a quick way for friends to sign off and express their positive feelings for one another while instant-messaging (IM-ing) on the computer or sending a text message on cell phones.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

The acronym "BFF" was added to the [[New Oxford American Dictionary]] on 16 September 2010.&lt;ref name="oup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2010/09/noad3/|title=My BFF just told me "TTYL" is in the dictionary. LMAO. - OUPblog|work=OUPblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary states that the acronym BFF originated in 1996.&lt;ref name="oup.com"/&gt;

==Cultural perception==
According to a survey in [[France]], the BFF friendship is a concept that occupies a certain place on [[social networks]].&lt;ref&gt;Mina Soundiram, lexpress.fr, [http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/psycho/amitie-appartenir-a-une-bande-est-signe-d-un-bon-equilibre-de-vie_1745044.html Amitié: appartenir à une bande est devenu un signe de réussite sociale], France , December 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This value is reassuring, especially for the millennial generation that experiences a divorce frequently. It is a sign of social success and a balanced life.

A large survey of friendship in the UK in 2003 found that on average, people had nine close friends.&lt;ref name=Levine_ch1/&gt; In elementary and middle school, best friendships often last less than one full academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berndt | first1 = T. J. | last2 = Hawkins | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Hoyle | first3 = S. G. | year = 1986 | title = Changes in friendship during a school year: Effects on children's and adolescents' impressions of friendship and sharing with friends | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 1284–1297 | doi=10.2307/1130451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Delinsky]] described a BFF as "someone you don't have to see every day to still connect with, someone who loves you whether you talk often or not, someone who would drop everything and catch the next flight if you needed her.  It's someone who couldn't care less where or what she eats, as long as she's with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbaradelinsky.com/2012/02/what-is-a-bff/|title=What is a BFF?|work=barbaradelinsky.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
In a 1997 episode, season 3 episode 25, of ''[[Friends]]'', [[Lisa Kudrow]]'s character, [[Phoebe Buffay]], uses the term.

Michael Scott uses the abbreviation as well in S2E2 of "[[The Office (U.S. TV series)]]".

''[[Paris Hilton's My New BFF]]'', also known as ''[[My New BFF]]'', is a competitive reality television show in which Paris Hilton searches for her new BFF.

''[[Best Friends Forever]]'' was an American television comedy series that ran on [[NBC]] from April 4, to June 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/21/community-returns-march-15-at-8pm-premieres-for-bent-best-friends-forever-and-betty-whites-off-their-rockers/121031/ |title='Community' Returns March 15 at 8pm + Premieres for 'Bent,' 'Best Friends Forever' and 'Betty White's Off Their Rockers' |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Seidman |first=Robert |date=February 21, 2012 |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224030204/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/21/community-returns-march-15-at-8pm-premieres-for-bent-best-friends-forever-and-betty-whites-off-their-rockers/121031/ |archivedate=February 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[social networking service]] [[Myspace]] launched "BFF", an online game show series that tested how well best friends knew each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |publication-date=April 2, 2009 |title=MySpace Launches "BFF," Online Game Show Series |work= [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |page= |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a3fgJyRSZD6I |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Best Friends Forever (South Park)]]'' is an episode of [[Comedy Central]]'s [[South Park]], which first aired 30 March 2005, based on the [[Terri Schiavo case]].

==Academic studies==
[[Eileen Kennedy-Moore]] says that parents can help children cope with a conflict between friends through strategies such as empathizing, discouraging retaliation, and encouraging relationship repair.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy-Moore, E. (2012). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201205/make-new-friends-keep-the-old-or-not Make new friends but keep the old...or not.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the BFF concept was a part of a BFF contract "to encourage the signatories to work through their differences before splitting up."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |publication-date=February 11, 2010 |title=The BFF Contract makes friendships a lasting proposition |work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]] |page= B1|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20100211/ARTICLE/2111063|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their article "Friendship and Natural Selection" in July, 2014, Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler reported a positive correlation between close friendships and common genotypes, indicating that DNA similarities may be a causal factor in establishing friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/Supplement_3/10796.short|title=Friendship and natural selection|author=Nicholas A. Christakis | doi=10.1073/pnas.1400825111|volume=111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=10796–10801|arxiv=1308.5257|bibcode=2014PNAS..111S0796C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted at the University of Oxford, Tamas David-Barrett and his colleagues reported that there is an unusually large number of profile pictures on Facebook that depict two women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women Favour Dyadic Relationships, but Men Prefer Clubs: Cross-Cultural Evidence from Social Networking|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118329|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2015-03-16|pmc = 4361571|pmid = 25775258|pages = e0118329|volume = 10|issue = 3|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0118329|first = Tamas|last = David-Barrett|first2 = Anna|last2 = Rotkirch|first3 = James|last3 = Carney|first4 = Isabel|last4 = Behncke Izquierdo|first5 = Jaimie A.|last5 = Krems|first6 = Dylan|last6 = Townley|first7 = Elinor|last7 = McDaniell|first8 = Anna|last8 = Byrne-Smith|first9 = Robin I. M.|last9 = Dunbar|bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1018329D}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern is present in each region of the world. After eliminating the alternative hypotheses, the study concluded that the finding suggests that (a) close friendship formation patterns are universal among humans, and (b) there is a marked gender difference in the propensity to form lasting friendship due to an evolutionary ultimate cause.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This suggests that the BFF concept, albeit with a different name, may exist in many cultures, going back to evolutionary times. Recent studies have also shown that close friends are treated as siblings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rotkirch|first1=Anna|last2=Lyons|first2=Minna|last3=David-Barrett|first3=Tamas|last4=Jokela|first4=Markus|title=Gratitude for Help among Adult Friends and Siblings|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|date=1 October 2014|volume=12|url=http://evp.sagepub.com/content/12/4/147470491401200401.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David-Barrett|first1=Tamas|last2=Behncke Izquierdo|first2=Isabel|last3=Carney|first3=James|last4=Nowak|first4=Katharina|last5=Launay|first5=Jacques|last6=Rotkirch|first6=Anna|title=Life course similarities on social networking sites|journal=Advances in Life Course Research|date=14 May 2016|doi=10.1016/j.alcr.2016.04.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260816300247|volume=30|pages=84–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial use ==
Companies like [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola]] have used the expression on some of their Cola products. Their cans say "Share a Diet Coke with your BFF".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coca-colacompany.com/press-center/press-releases/coca-cola-celebrates-a-summer-of-sharing#TCCC Coca-Cola Celebrates a Summer of Sharing], Coca Cola Press Release June 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21935">'''Chess notations''' are various systems that have developed to [[notation|record]] either the moves made in a game of [[chess]] or the position of [[chess piece|pieces]] on a [[chessboard]]. The earliest systems of notation used lengthy narratives to describe each move; these gradually evolved into terser notation systems. Currently [[algebraic chess notation]] is the accepted standard and is widely used. Algebraic notation has several variations. [[Descriptive chess notation]] was used in English- and Spanish-language literature until the late 20th century, but is now obsolete.  There are some special systems for international [[correspondence chess]]. [[Portable Game Notation]] is used when working with computer chess programs.  Systems also exist for transmission using [[Morse code]] over [[telegraph]] or radio.

==Recording moves==
Some move-recording notations are designed mainly for use by human players; others are designed for use by computers.

===Notation systems for humans===
[[Image:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Correspondence chess card showing algebraic notation and ICCF notation]]
In recognized competitions, all players are required to record all the moves of both players in order to resolve disputes about whether a player has made an illegal move and what the position should now be. In addition, if there is a time limit rule that requires each player to complete a specified number of moves in a specified time, as there is in most serious competition, an accurate count of the moves must be kept.&lt;ref name="GijssenArbitersNotebook"&gt;{{cite web

 }}  Includes sample hand-written score sheet.&lt;/ref&gt; The algebraic and descriptive notations are also used in books about chess.

* '''[[Algebraic chess notation]]''' is more compact than [[descriptive chess notation]], and is the most widely used method for recording the moves of a game of chess. In embryonic form it was used by [[Philip Stamma]] in the 1737 book ''Essai sur le jeu des echecs''. It was later adopted (in long form) by the influential ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'' and became standard in German publications. It is more compact and less prone to error than the English descriptive system. Algebraic notation is the official notation of [[FIDE]] which must be used in all recognized international competition involving human players.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Schiller|Schiller, Eric]], ''The Official Rules of Chess'', 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-58042-092-1}}, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Chess Federation]] prefers the use of algebraic notation but still permits descriptive notation.&lt;ref name="USCF Rulebook ChangesAug2007"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rulebook Changes (as of August 2007) |url=http://main.uschess.org/content/view/7594/28/ |publisher=The United States Chess Federation |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610222821/http://main.uschess.org/content/view/7594/28/ |archivedate=2015-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* ''Standard algebraic notation'' (SAN) is the notation standardized by FIDE.&lt;ref name="FIDERulesAppendices"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?view=article&amp;id=125 | title=FIDE Handbook: Rules - Appendices | publisher=[[Fédération Internationale des Échecs]] | accessdate=September 29, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003050537/http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=125&amp;view=article | archivedate=October 3, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It omits the starting [[file (chess)|file]] and [[rank (chess)|rank]] of the [[chess piece|piece]], unless it is necessary to disambiguate the move.
:* ''Figurine algebraic notation'' (FAN) is a widely used variation of standard algebraic notation that which replaces the letter that stands for a piece by its [[Chess symbols in Unicode|symbol]], e.g., '''♞c6'''  instead of '''Nc6''' or '''♖xg4''' instead of '''Rxg4'''. Pawns are omitted as in standard algebraic notation.  This enables the moves to be read independent of language. To display or print these symbols on a computer, one or more [[font]]s with good [[Unicode]] support must be installed, and the document (web page, word processor document, etc.) must use one of these fonts.&lt;ref name="alanwoodTestForUnicodeSuportInBrowser"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/miscellaneous_symbols.html |title=Test for Unicode support in Web browsers |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103134038/http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/miscellaneous_symbols.html |archivedate=2008-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information see [[Chess symbols in Unicode]].
:* ''Long algebraic notation'' (LAN) includes the starting file and rank of the piece, followed by a dash.
:* ''Minimal algebraic notation'' (MAN) is similar to SAN but omits the indicators for capture ("x") and check ("+"). It was used by ''Chess Informant''.&lt;ref name="Chess960"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chessville.com/reviews/PlayStrongerChessExaminingChess960.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622105629/http://chessville.com/reviews/PlayStrongerChessExaminingChess960.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=22 June 2006 | title=Not Your Father’s Chess | accessdate=29 September 2013 | author=Jeffreys, Michael | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ''Reversible algebraic notation'' (RAN) is based on LAN, but adds an additional letter for the piece that was captured, if any. The move can be reversed by moving the piece to its original square, and restoring the captured piece. For example, Rd2xBd6.&lt;ref name="Chess960" /&gt;
:* ''Concise reversible algebraic notation'' (CRAN) is like RAN, but omits the file or rank if it is not needed to disambiguate the move. For example, Rd2xB6. This notation is recommended by Gene Milener in ''Play Stronger Chess by Examining Chess 960: Usable Strategies for Fischer Random Chess Discovered''.&lt;ref name="Chess960" /&gt;
:* ''[http://www.castlelong.com/essay/Essay_HSym_fd47b_Doc_Prn.PDF Figurine concise reversible algebraic notation]'' (FCRAN) is a form of CRAN with non-Staunton figurines, used by Gene Milener during [[Chess960]] tournaments.
*'''[[Descriptive chess notation]]''', '''English notation''' or '''English descriptive notation'''. Until the 1970s, at least in English-speaking countries, chess games were recorded and published using this notation. This is still used by a dwindling number of mainly older players, and by those who read old books (some of which are still important&lt;ref name="McKimGreat Chess BooksAtSilman"&gt;{{cite web |title=Great Chess Books |url=http://www.jeremysilman.com/chess_gst_wrtrs/041004_great_chess_books.html |author=McKim, D.K. |publisher=Jeremy Silman |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219005645/http://www.jeremysilman.com/chess_gst_wrtrs/041004_great_chess_books.html |archivedate=2007-12-19 |df= }} Published by an International Master and prolific writer.&lt;/ref&gt;).
*'''[[ICCF numeric notation]]'''. In international correspondence chess the use of algebraic notation may cause confusion, since different languages have different names for the pieces. The standard for transmitting moves in this form of chess is ICCF numeric notation.&lt;ref name="ChessNotationICCFNumeric"&gt;{{cite web |title=ICCF Numeric Chess Notation |url=http://chessnotation.com/ICCFnumeric.htm |publisher=ChessNotation.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170105003412/http://chessnotation.com/ICCFnumeric.htm |archivedate=2017-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[https://www.chessclub.com/chessviewer/smith.html '''Smith notation'''] is a straightforward chess notation designed to be reversible and represent any move without ambiguity. The notation encodes the source square, destination square, and what piece was captured, if any.
* '''Coordinate notation''' is similar to algebraic notation except that no abbreviation or symbol is used to show which piece is moving. It can do this almost without ambiguity because it always includes the square from which the piece moves as well as its destination, but promotions must be disambiguated by including the promoted piece type, such as in parentheses. It has proved hard for humans to write and read, but is used internally by some chess-related computer software.

The following table lists examples of the same moves in some of the notations which may be used by humans. Each table cell contains White's move followed by Black's move, as they are listed in a single line of written notation.

In all forms of notation, the result is usually indicated at the conclusion of the game by either "1–0", indicating that White won, "0–1" indicating that Black won or "½–½", indicating a draw. Moves that result in checkmate can be marked with "#", "++", or "‡" or to indicate the end of game and the winner, instead of or in addition to "1–0" or "0–1".

Annotators commenting on a game frequently use question marks ("?") and exclamation marks ("!") to label a move as bad or praise the move as a good one (see [[Chess annotation symbols]]).&lt;ref name="ExeterCCCommentCodes"&gt;{{cite web

*'''[[Forsyth–Edwards Notation]]''' (FEN).  A single line format which gives the current positions of pieces on a board, to enable generation of a board in something other than the initial array of pieces.  It also contains other information such as castling rights, move number, and color on move.  It is incorporated into the PGN standard as a Tag Pair in conjunction with the SetUp tag.
*'''Extended Position Description''' (EPD). Another format which gives the current positions of a board, with an extended set of structured attribute values using the ASCII character set. It is intended for data and command interchange among chessplaying programs. It is also intended for the representation of portable opening library repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thechessdrum.net/PGN_Reference.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822185456/http://www.thechessdrum.net/PGN_Reference.txt |archivedate=2007-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is better than FEN for certain [[chess variant]]s, such as [[Chess960]].

===Notation for telegraph and radio===
Some special methods of notation were used for transmitting moves by telegraph or radio, usually using [[Morse Code]].  The Uedemann code and Gringmuth notation worked by using a two-letter label for each square and transmitting four letters – two letters for the origin square followed by two letters for the destination square.  Castling is shown as a king move.  Squares are designated from White's side of the board, files from left to right and ranks from nearest to farthest.  The Rutherford code first converted the move into a number and then converted the move number into a composite Latin word.  It could also transmit moves of two games at the same time.
&lt;!-- The codes below are in subsections so they can be linked from other articles --&gt;

====Uedemann code====
This code was devised by [[Louis Uedemann]] (1854–1912).  The method was never actually used, mainly because a transposition of letters can result in a valid but incorrect move.  Many sources incorrectly use this name for the Gringmuth code.

The files are labeled "A", "E", "I", "O", "O", "I", "E", and "A".  The ranks are labeled "B", "D", "F", "G", "H", "K", "L", and "P". A square on the [[queenside]] is designated by its file letter and then its rank letter.  A square on the [[kingside]] is designated by its rank letter then its file letter.&lt;ref name="Hooper"&gt;[[David Vincent Hooper|David Hooper]] and [[Kenneth Whyld]], 1992, ''[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]]'', {{ISBN|0-19-280049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gringmuth notation====
This method was invented by Dmitry Alexeyevich Gringmuth but it is sometimes incorrectly called the Uedemann Code.  It was used as early as 1866.  Files were designated with one of two letters, depending on whether it was on White's side or Black's side.  These letters were: B and M, C and N, D and P, F and R, G and S, H and T, K and W, L and Z.  Ranks were labeled: "A", "E", "I", "O", "O", "I", "E", and "A".&lt;ref name="Hooper" /&gt;

====Rutherford code====
This code was invented in 1880 by Sir [[William Watson Rutherford]] (1853–1927).  At the time, the British Post Office did not allow digits or [[cipher]]s in telegrams, but they did allow Latin words.  This method also allowed moves for two games to be transmitted at the same time.  In this method, the legal moves in the position were counted using a system until the move being made was reached. This was done for both games.  The move number of the first game was multiplied by 60 and added to the move number of the second game.  Leading zeros were added as necessary to give a four-digit number.  The first two digits would be 00 through 39, which corresponded to a table of 40 Latin roots.  The third digit corresponded to a list of 10 Latin prefixes and the last digit corresponded to a list of 10 Latin suffixes.  The resulting word was transmitted.

After rules were changed so that ciphers were allowed in telegrams, this system was replaced by the Gringmuth Notation.&lt;ref name="Hooper" /&gt;

==Recording positions==
Positions are usually shown as diagrams (images), using the symbols shown here for the pieces.

There is also a notation for recording positions in text format, called the [[Forsyth–Edwards Notation|Forsyth–Edwards notation]] (FEN). This is useful for adjourning a game to resume later or for conveying chess problem positions without a diagram. A position can also be recorded by listing the pieces and the squares they reside on, for example: White: Ke1, Rd3, etc.

Written chess notation recording is often necessary when participating in chess tournaments. In many tournaments players are required to record their games' notation on a score sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Read and Write Chess Notation|url=https://chesswarehouse.com/blogs/news/chess-notation-how-to-read-write|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413155001/https://chesswarehouse.com/blogs/news/chess-notation-how-to-read-write|archivedate=2017-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exercise full of delight; fit for princes, or any person of what qualitie soeuer''. Published by A. S. Gent. 1614&lt;/ref&gt; The great 18th-century player [[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor]] used an almost equally verbose approach in his influential book "Analyse du jeu des Échecs", for example, "The king's bishop, at his queen bishop's fourth square."&lt;ref&gt;François-André Danican Philidor, ''Analysis of the Game of Chess (1777)'', Hardinge Simpole, 2005 (reprint), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algebraic chess notation]] was first used by [[Philipp Stamma]] (c. 1705–1755) in an almost fully developed form before the now obsolete [[descriptive chess notation]] evolved.  The main difference between Stamma's system and the modern system is that Stamma used "p" for pawn moves and the original [[file (chess)|file]] of the piece ("a" through "h") instead of the initial letter of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document

In London in 1747, Philidor convincingly defeated Stamma in a match. Consequently, his writings (which were translated into English) became more influential than Stamma's in the English-speaking chess world; this may have led to the adoption of a descriptive system for writing chess moves, rather than Stamma's coordinate-based approach. However, algebraic notation became popular in Europe following its adoption by the highly influential [[Handbuch des Schachspiels]], and became dominant in Europe during the 20th century. However, it did not become popular in the English-speaking countries until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="McCraryHistoryOfNotation"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12945">'''Cognitive style''' or "thinking style" is a concept used in [[cognitive psychology]] to describe the way individuals [[thought|think]], perceive and remember information. Cognitive style differs from cognitive ability (or level), the latter being measured by aptitude tests or so-called intelligence tests. There is controversy over the exact meaning of the term "cognitive style" and whether it is a single or multiple dimension of human [[personality]]. However it remains a key concept in the areas of [[education]] and [[management]]. If a pupil has a cognitive style that is similar to that of his/her teacher, the chances are improved that the pupil will have a more positive learning experience.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Likewise, team members with similar cognitive styles likely feel more positive about their participation with the team.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} While matching cognitive styles may make participants feel more comfortable when working with one another, this alone cannot guarantee the success of the outcome.

==Multi-dimensional models and measures==
A popular multi-dimensional instrument for the measure of cognitive style is the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]].

Riding (1991) developed a two-dimensional cognitive style instrument, his [[Cognitive styles analysis|Cognitive Style Analysis]] (CSA), which is a compiled computer-presented test that measures individuals' position on two orthogonal dimensions – Wholist-Analytic (W-A) and Verbal-Imagery (V-I). The W-A dimension reflects how individuals organise and structure information. Individuals described as Analytics will deconstruct information into its component parts, whereas individuals described as Wholists will retain a global or overall view of information. The V-I dimension describes individuals' mode of information representation in memory during thinking – Verbalisers represent information in words or verbal associations, and Imagers represent information in mental pictures. The CSA test is broken down into three sub-tests, all of which are based on a comparison between response times to different types of stimulus items. Some scholars argue that this instrument, being at least in part reliant on the ability of the respondent to answer at speed, really measures a mix of cognitive style and cognitive ability (Kirton, 2003). This is said to contribute to the unreliability of this instrument.

==Bipolar, one-dimensional models and measures==
The [[field dependence]]-independence model, invented by [[Herman Witkin]], identifies an individual's perceptive behaviour while distinguishing object figures from the content field in which they are set. Two similar instruments to do this were produced, the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) and the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) (1971). In both cases, the content field is a distracting or confusing background. These instruments are designed to distinguish field-independent from field-dependent cognitive types; a rating which is claimed to be value-neutral. Field-independent people tend to be more autonomous when it comes to the development of restructuring skills; that is, those skills required during technical tasks with which the individual is not necessarily familiar. They are, however, less autonomous in the development of interpersonal skills. The EFT and GEFT continue to enjoy support and usage in research and practice. However, they, too, are criticised by scholars as containing an element of ability and so may not measure cognitive style alone.

[[Liam Hudson]] (Carey, 1991) identified two cognitive styles: [[convergent thinking|convergent thinkers]], good at accumulating material from a variety of sources relevant to a problem's solution, and [[Divergent thinking|divergent thinkers]] who proceed more creatively and subjectively in their approach to problem-solving. Hudson's Converger-diverger construct attempts to measure the processing rather than the acquisition of information by an individual. It aims to differentiate convergent from divergent thinkers; the former being persons who think rationally and logically while the latter tend to be more flexible and to base reasoning more on heuristic evidence.

In contrast, [[cognitive complexity]] theories as proposed by [[James Bieri]] (1961) attempt to identify individuals who are more complex in their approach to problem-solving against those who are simpler. The instruments used to measure this concept of "cognitive style" are either Driver's Decision Style Exercise (DDSE) (Carey, 1991) or the Complexity Self-Test Description Instrument, which are somewhat ad hoc and so are little used at present.

[[Gordon Pask]] (Carey, 1991) extended these notions in a discussion of strategies and styles of learning. In this, he classifies learning strategies as either holist or serialist. When confronted with an unfamiliar type of problem, holists gather information randomly within a framework, while serialists approach problem-solving step-wise, proceeding from the known to the unknown.

[[Robert E. Ornstein|Robert Ornstein]]'s Hemispherical lateralisation concept (Carey, 1991), commonly called left-brain/right-brain theory, posits that the left hemisphere of the brain controls logical and analytical operations while the right hemisphere controls holistic, intuitive and pictorial activities. Cognitive style is thus claimed to be a single dimension on a scale from extreme left-brain to extreme right-brain types, depending on which associated behaviour dominates in the individual, and by how much.

Taggart's (1988) "Whole-brain human information processing theory" classifies the brain as having six divisions, three per hemisphere, which in a sense is a refined model of the hemispherical lateralisation theory discussed above.

The Allinson-Hayes (1996) Cognitive Style Index (CSI) has features of Ornstein's left-brain/right-brain theory. Recent evidence suggests that it may be the most widely used measure of cognitive style in academic research in the fields of management and education (Cools, Armstrong and Verbrigghe, 2014; Evans, Cools and Charlesworth, 2010). The CSI contains 38 items, each rated using a 3-point scale (true; uncertain; false). Certain scholars have questioned its construct validity on the grounds of theoretical and methodological approaches associated with its development. Allinson and Hayes (2012), however, have refuted these claims on the basis of other independent studies of its psychometric properties. Research has indicated both gender and cultural differences in CSI scores. While this may complicate some management and educational applications, previous investigations have suggested it is entirely plausible that cognitive style is related to these social factors.

==Kirton's model of cognitive style==
Another popular model of cognitive style was devised by Michael Kirton (1976, 2003). His model, called Adaption-Innovation theory, claims that an individual's preferred approach to problem solving, can be placed on a continuum ranging from high adaptation to high innovation. He suggests that some human beings, called '''adaptors''' tend to prefer the adaptive approach to problem-solving, while others ('''innovators'''), of course, prefer the reverse. Adaptors use what is given to solve problems by time-honoured techniques. Alternatively, innovators look beyond what is given to solve problems with the aid of innovative technologies. Kirton suggests that while adaptors prefer to do well within a given paradigm, innovators would rather do differently, thereby striving to transcend existing paradigms.

Kirton also invented an instrument to measure cognitive style (at least in accordance with this model) known as the Kirton Adaption-innovation Inventory (KAI). This requires the respondent to rate themselves against thirty-two personality traits. A drawback of all the other efforts to measure cognitive style discussed above is their failure to separate out cognitive style and cognitive level. As the items on the KAI are expressed in clear and simple language, cognitive level plays no significant role. Scores on the A-I continuum are normally distributed between the extreme cognitive styles of high innovation and high adaptation.

Another important concept associated with A-I theory is that of bridging in teams. Kirton (2003) defines bridging as "reaching out to people in the team and helping them be part of it so that they may contribute even if their contribution is outside the mainstream". Bridging is thus a task and a role, which has to be learnt. It is not a cognitive style. Bridging is also not leading, although the skilled leader may make use of persons they recognise as good bridgers to maintain group cohesion. Group cohesion means, to keep the group aware of the importance of its members working well together. Kirton (2003) suggests that it is easier for a person to learn and assume a bridging role if their cognitive style is an intermediate one. If person B assumes a bridging role which assists persons A and C to work well together in a team, then B's KAI score is recommended to be between those of A and C. Of course, it is only recommended that B's score lies between the scores of A and C, not that B's score lies near the KAI mean. All of A, B and C could be high-scoring innovators or, for that matter, high-scoring adaptors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6324">In [[mathematics]], a '''cover''' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of sets whose union contains &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a [[subset]]. Formally, if
:&lt;math&gt;C = \lbrace U_\alpha: \alpha \in A\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;
is an [[indexed family]] of sets &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if
:&lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A}U_{\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Cover in topology==
Covers are commonly used in the context of [[topology]]. If the set ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then a ''cover'' ''C'' of ''X'' is a collection of subsets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' whose union is the whole space ''X''. In this case we say that ''C'' ''covers'' ''X'', or that the sets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; ''cover'' ''X''. Also, if ''Y'' is a subset of ''X'', then a ''cover'' of ''Y'' is a collection of subsets of ''X'' whose union contains ''Y'', i.e., ''C'' is a cover of ''Y'' if

:&lt;math&gt;Y \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in C}U_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''C'' be a cover of a topological space ''X''. A '''subcover''' of ''C'' is a subset of ''C'' that still covers ''X''.

We say that ''C'' is an '''{{vanchor|open cover}}''' if each of its members is an [[open set]] (i.e. each ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is contained in ''T'', where ''T'' is the topology on ''X'').

A cover of ''X'' is said to be [[locally finite collection|locally finite]] if every point of ''X'' has a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] which intersects only [[finite set|finite]]ly many sets in the cover.  Formally, ''C'' = {''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;} is locally finite if for any ''x'' ∈ ''X'', there exists some neighborhood ''N''(''x'') of ''x'' such that the set
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \alpha \in A : U_{\alpha} \cap N(x) \neq \varnothing \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
is finite. A cover of ''X'' is said to be '''point finite''' if every point of ''X'' is contained in only finitely many sets in the cover. A cover is point finite if it is locally finite, though the converse is not necessarily true.

==Refinement==
A '''refinement''' of a cover ''C'' of a topological space ''X'' is a new cover ''D'' of ''X'' such that every set in ''D'' is contained in some set in ''C''. Formally,
:&lt;math&gt;D = \{V_{\beta \in B}\} \; \text{is a refinement of} \; C = \{U_{\alpha \in A}\} \; \text{when} \; \forall \beta \ \exists \alpha \ V_\beta \subseteq U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, there is a '''refinement map''' &lt;math&gt;\phi: B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;V_{\beta} \subseteq U_{\phi(\beta)}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\beta \in B&lt;/math&gt;. This map is used, for instance, in the  [[Čech cohomology]] of X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology|date = 1982|last = Bott, Tu|page = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every subcover is also a refinement, but the opposite is not always true. A subcover is made from the sets that are in the cover, but omitting some of them; whereas a refinement is made from any sets that are subsets of the sets in the cover.

The refinement relation is a [[preorder]] on the set of covers of ''X''.

Generally speaking, a refinement of a given structure is another that in some sense contains it. Examples are to be found when partitioning an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (one refinement of &lt;math&gt;a_0 &lt; a_1 &lt; ... &lt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; being &lt;math&gt;a_0 &lt; b_0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; ... &lt; a_n &lt; b_1&lt;/math&gt;), considering [[topology|topologies]] (the [[standard topology]] in euclidean space being a refinement of the [[trivial topology]]). When subdividing [[simplicial complex]]es (the first [[barycentric subdivision]] of a simplicial complex is a refinement), the situation is slightly different: every [[simplex]] in the finer complex is a face of some simplex in the coarser one, and both have equal underlying polyhedra.

Yet another notion of refinement is that of [[star refinement]].

==Subcover==
A simple way to get a subcover is to omit the sets contained in another set in the cover. Turn to open cover.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; be the topological basis of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}=\{A\in\mathcal{B},A\subset U \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is any set in an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a refinement. For any &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, we select a &lt;math&gt;U_A\in\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; (require the selection axiom). Now &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\{U_A\in\mathcal{O},A\subset U_A \}&lt;/math&gt; is a subcover of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the cardinal of a subcover of an open cover can be as small as that of  topological basis. And second countability implies Lindelöf spaces.

==Compactness==
The language of covers is often used to define several topological properties related to ''compactness''. A topological space ''X'' is said to be
;[[compact space|Compact]]: if every open cover has a finite subcover, (or equivalently that every open cover has a finite refinement);
;[[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]]: if every open cover has a [[countable]] subcover, (or equivalently that every open cover has a countable refinement);
;[[metacompact space|Metacompact]]: if every open cover has a point finite open refinement;
;[[paracompact space|Paracompact]]: if every open cover admits a locally finite open refinement.

For some more variations see the above articles.

==Covering dimension==
A topological space ''X'' is said to be of [[covering dimension]] ''n'' if every open cover of ''X'' has a point finite open refinement such that no point of ''X'' is included in more than ''n+1'' sets in the refinement and if ''n'' is the minimum value for which this is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Floodgate_clamshell.JPG|thumb|right|275px|"Floodgate" is a visual metaphor suggesting a potential torrent of claims.]]
{{English tort law}}
The '''floodgates principle''', or the '''floodgates argument''', is a [[legal principle]] which is sometimes applied by judges to restrict or limit the right to make claims for [[Damages (law)|damages]] because of a concern that permitting a claimant to recover in such situations might open the metaphorical "[[floodgate]]s" to large numbers of claims and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniassignment.com/essay-samples/law/fear-of-opening-the-floodgates-law-general-essay.php |title=Fear Of Opening The Floodgates |publisher=UAC |accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principle is most frequently cited in [[common law jurisdictions]], and in [[English tort law]] in particular.

Most of the situations in which the courts have employed the floodgates argument have revolved around liability in tort, and in particular in relation to the liability for nervous shock or for pure economic loss. The rationale in which the floodgates principle has been applied may vary. In some cases it is expressed to be a constraint upon when a defendant will owe a [[duty of care]], in others it is expressed to be a limitation upon the [[Remoteness in English law|remoteness of damage]] for which a defendant should be held responsible for.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Spartan Steel &amp; Alloys Ltd v Martin &amp; Co (Contractors) Ltd]]'' [1973] 1 QB 27 [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning MR]] recognised this explicitly: "At bottom I think the question of recovering economic loss is one of policy. Whenever the courts draw a line to mark out the bounds of duty, they do it as matter of policy so as to limit the responsibility of the defendant. Whenever the courts set bounds to the damages recoverable - saying that they are, or are not, too remote - they do it as matter of policy so as to limit the liability of the defendant. In many of the cases where economic loss has been held not to be recoverable, it has been put on the ground that the defendant was under no duty to the plaintiff. ... In other cases, however, the defendant seems clearly to have been under a duty to the plaintiff, but the economic loss has not been recovered because it is too remote."&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases it is simply stated as a principle of [[public policy]].

The floodgates principle is arguably the antithesis of the legal maxim: ''[[fiat justitia ruat caelum]]'' ("let justice be done though the heavens fall").

==Rationale==

The core of the principle was enunciated by the then-Chief Justice of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (later [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Supreme Court Justice]]) [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] in ''[[Ultramares Corp. v. Touche]]'' (1932) 174 N.E. 441 as the risk of exposing defendants to liability for "indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class".

In ''[[Spartan Steel &amp; Alloys Ltd v Martin &amp; Co (Contractors) Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1973] 1 QB 27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning MR]] put the same point in more expansive terms:

{{cquote|[I]f claims for economic loss were permitted for this particular hazard, there would be no end of claims. Some might be genuine, but many might be inflated, or even false. A machine might not have been in use anyway, but it would be easy to put it down to the cut in supply. It would be well-nigh impossible to check the claims. If there was economic loss on one day, did the claimant do his best to mitigate it by working harder next day? and so forth. Rather than expose claimants to such temptation and defendants to such hard labour - on comparatively small claims - it is better to disallow economic loss altogether, at any rate when it stands alone, independent of any physical damage.}}

If a party by their negligence causes physical injury to one other person, then the pool of claimants for that physical injury is just that person.  However, if each person who suffers [[pure economic loss|resultant economic loss]] as a result of the injury to the person is also able to make a claim, then potentially the negligent party (and the courts) could be opened up to a vast array of claims.  Similarly, where a party publishes a negligent in a document, if that document is published widely, if every person who read that statement was entitled to rely upon it and claim for any loss caused by relying upon it, there would similarly be an extremely wide-ranging liability for [[negligent misstatement]]. The last, and probably most difficult area where the floodates principle has been evoked relates to psychiatric injury, or "[[Nervous shock in English law|nervous shock]]". How far should a person be liable if they injure someone negligently, and then other persons see the accident and suffer psychiatric injury (but no physical harm) just from witnessing the accident?  In trying to answer these questions the courts have sometimes fallen back on the floodgates principle to try and limit the potential range of claims.

==Nervous shock cases==

In [[English law]] the first recorded reference to the floodgates principle was in 1888&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixthformlaw.info/01_modules/other_material/tort/1_duty/5_duty_fair_just.htm|title=Tort, negligence, duty of care - policy - fair just and reasonable |publisher=Sixth Form Law |accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Victorian Railway Commissioners v Coultas''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Victorian Railway Commissioners v Coultas|court=UKPC |division= |year=1888 |num=3 |parallelcite=(1888) 13 App Cas 222 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That case involved a pregnant woman (the claimant) whose husband had driven onto train tracks at a level crossing, and due to the negligence of the gate keeper, were nearly struck by a high speed train. The plaintiff, Mrs Coultas, suffered from serious shock, leading to impaired memory and eyesight, and the loss of her unborn child. Nonetheless, the Privy Council held that she had no sustainable claim for damages, holding that:

{{cquote|Damages arising from mere sudden terror unaccompanied by any actual physical injury, but occasioning a nervous or mental shock, cannot under such circumstances, their Lordships think, be considered a consequence which, in the ordinary course of things, would flow from the negligence of the gate-keeper. ... damages must be the natural and reasonable result of the defendant's act; such a consequence as in the ordinary course of things would flow from that act.}}

The leading authority on nervous shock cases under English law is now ''[[Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police|court=UKHL |division= |year=1991 |num=5 |parallelcite=[1992] 1 AC 310 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a case which draws heavily upon the floodates principle. In limiting the right to recover to those who saw the accident or its immediate aftermath [[Peter Oliver, Baron Oliver of Aylmerton|Lord Oliver]] held:

{{cquote|It would be inaccurate and hurtful to suggest that grief is made any the less real or deprivation more tolerable by a more gradual realisation, but to extend liability to cover injury in such cases would be to extend the law in a direction for which there is no pressing policy need and in which there is no logical stopping point.}}

==="Worried well" cases===

As an adjunct to the nervous shock cases, the courts have also had to consider claims by persons who are loosely classified as the "worried well", i.e. persons who are not actually ill, but have suffered an exposure and therefore are greatly concerned they may become gravely ill.  These claims often relate to [[asbestos]] exposure, as [[mesothelioma]] can take [[Mesothelioma#Signs and symptoms|20 to 50 years, or longer]], to manifest after an exposure. To date, the courts have appeared unwilling to consider claims from the "worried well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/x/57144/Healthcare/English+House+Of+Lords+Slams+Door+On+Worried+Well+Claims |title=English House Of Lords Slams Door On "Worried Well" Claims |publisher=Mondaq |date=11 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pure economic loss cases==

[[Pure economic loss in English Law|Pure economic loss]] cases have also felt the strong influence of the concerns of the courts in relation to the floodgates principle. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] in the decision of ''[[Spartan Steel &amp; Alloys Ltd v Martin &amp; Co (Contractors) Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1973] 1 QB 27&lt;/ref&gt; made extensive reference to risks of such claims, and sought to limit economic loss to claims which are proximate to physical damage.

==Negligent misstatement==

Judicial concern has also been expressed about potential liability for negligent misstatements. Unlike physical acts, a negligent statement may be relied upon by a great many people leading to a wide class of potential claims. Accordingly, in ''[[Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1964] AC 465&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords imposed the requirement that there would need to be a "special relationship" in order to justify a duty of care under which a person making a negligent statement could be held liable to a person who relied upon it.

==Other cases==

In ''[[Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1989] AC 53&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords had to consider a claim by Jacqueline Hill, the last victim of [[Peter Sutcliffe]] (a serial killer known as the "Yorkshire Ripper"), against the police. The case argued that police had been sloppy and careless in their investigation, and if they had not been so the killer would have caught long before he murdered his last few victims. The claim was struck out on a number of grounds, one of which was the risk that every victim of crime might have an action against the police arguing that they should have caught the perpetrators at an earlier stage of their criminal careers.

The decision was upheld in ''[[Kent v Griffiths]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2000] 2 All ER 474&lt;/ref&gt; and rationalised on a different basis, viz., that the emergency services to do not owe general duties to the public on grounds of public policy.
 
However, by contrast in ''[[Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office|court=UKHL |division= |year=1970 |num=2 |parallelcite= [1970] AC 1004 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords were fully prepared to hold the Home Office responsible for the acts of young offenders whom it failed to supervise, and who subsequently caused damage to the property of various members of the general public.

==Examples of opening the floodgates==

The floodgates principle is by no means a principle of universal application.

The courts have, on occasion, been prepared to uphold claims notwithstanding that they recognise that the effect of a decision will most likely result in a large amount of subsequent litigation. In the case of ''[[Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 2 AC 1&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] upheld a claim that [[interest rate swaps]] entered into with local authorities in the United Kingdom were [[void (law)|void]] although they knew that large numbers of such contracts had been entered into, and that [[Local authorities swaps litigation|unwinding the swaps would result in a large amount of litigation]]. In the event, over 200 separate sets of legal proceedings were launched,&lt;ref name=Hirst&gt;In his judgment in ''[http://www.ucc.ie/law/restitution/archive/englcases/interest.htm Re Interest Rate Swap Litigation]'' (unreported, 28 November 1991) [[David Hirst (judge)|Hirst J]] recorded that "As at 30th October, 1991 there were 203 extant swap actions, 18 had been settled after the issue of proceedings, 2 had been discontinued and 4 are in progress in the Chancery Division. Although in the vast majority of cases the banks are plaintiffs, there are 10 actions involving 8 local authorities in which a local authority is plaintiff because they are net losers under their swap transactions. The number of plaintiff banks in these actions totals in all 42 and the number of local authority defendants 62. These figures may need up-dating, but give a substantially accurate picture."&lt;/ref&gt; several of which were litigated to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and three of which reached the House of Lords.

[[File:"Freedom from Fear" - NARA - 513538.jpg|thumb|''Freedom from Fear'' from painter [[Norman Rockwell]], c. 1943]]
'''Freedom from fear''' is listed as a fundamental [[human right]] according to [[The Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. On January 6, 1941, [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] called it one of the "[[Four Freedoms]]" at his [[State of the Union]], which was afterwards therefore referred to as the "Four Freedoms Speech."&lt;ref name="4FS"&gt;Roosvelt, Franklin Delano (January 6, 1941) [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrthefourfreedoms.htm ''The Four Freedoms''], American Rhetoric&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In his speech President Franklin D. Roosevelt formulated freedom from fear as follows: "The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbour—anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name="4FS" /&gt;

The four freedoms of Roosevelt formed an important pillar of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] that were adopted on December 10, 1948, by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfredsson, Gudmundur &amp; Asbjørn Eide (1999) ''The Universal UN Declaration of Human Rights: A Common Standard of Achievement'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;pg=PA523 page 524], Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, {{ISBN|978-9041111685}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom from fear is mentioned in the preamble of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml ''Universal Declarations of Human Rights'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
In 1943 painter [[Norman Rockwell]] created ''[[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]]'', in his series of four paintings called ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]''.

It is an important concept for [[Burma|Burmese]] [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who published a book on it in 1991 with the title ''[[Freedom from Fear (Aung San Suu Kyi)|Freedom from Fear]]''. In 1999 historian [[David M. Kennedy (historian)|David M. Kennedy]] published a book called ''[[Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929–1945]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">The '''fundamental theorem of software engineering''' (FTSE) is a term originated by [[Andrew Koenig (programmer)|Andrew Koenig]] to describe a remark by [[Butler Lampson]]&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams and Gurtovoy, C++ Template Metaprogramming, 2005, Addison Wesley, p13.&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to the late [[David Wheeler (computer scientist)|David J. Wheeler]]:&lt;ref&gt;http://bwlampson.site/Slides/TuringLecture.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of [[indirection]]."}}

The theorem does not describe an actual theorem that can be proven; rather, it is a general principle for managing complexity through [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]].

The theorem is often expanded by the humorous clause "…except for the problem of too many levels of indirection," referring to the fact that too many abstractions may create intrinsic complexity issues of their own. For example, the use of protocol layering in [[computer network]]s, which today is ubiquitous, has been criticized in ways that are typical of more general disadvantages of abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Wakeman | first1 = I. | last2=Crowcroft | first2=J. | last3=Wang | first3=Z.|last4=Sirovica|first4=D. | date = Jan 1992| title = Is Layering Harmful?| journal = IEEE Network| pages =20–24| doi = 10.1109/65.120719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the adding of extra levels of indirection may cause higher layers to [[Abstraction inversion|duplicate the functionality of lower layers]], leading to inefficiency, and functionality at one layer may need data present only at another layer, which fundamentally violates the goal of separation into different layers.

In 2000, shortly after [[Hugo Chávez]] came to power, Nasr Al-Din immigrated into Venezuela.&lt;ref name="USforeign"&gt;{{cite web|title=IRAN’S INFLUENCE AND ACTIVITY IN LATIN AMERICA|url=http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Roger_Noriega_Testimony1.pdf|publisher=[[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasr Al-Din eventually established a relationship with aspiring Venezuelan politician [[Tareck El Aissami]].&lt;ref name="USforeign"/&gt; He was then made the Charge d' Affaires of the Venezuelan Embassy in Damascus, Syria.&lt;ref name="USforeign"/&gt; In 2008, he was appointed as Director of Political Aspects at the Venezuelan Embassy in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasury Targets Hizballah in Venezuela|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/hp1036.aspx|work=Press Release|publisher=United State Department of Treasury|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
===Hezbollah allegations===
While serving as a Venezuelan diplomat in Venezuela and making connections through a local Islamic group in Venezuela, Nasr Al-Din allegedly established ties to various entities in the Middle East, including the terrorist organization [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref name="Press Release"/&gt; The Government of the United States has accused Nasr Al-Din of having "counseled Hizballah donors on fundraising efforts and has provided donors with specific information on bank accounts where the donors' deposits would go directly to Hizballah" and had "met with senior Hizballah officials in Lebanon to discuss operational issues, as well as facilitated the travel of Hizballah members to and from Venezuela".&lt;ref name="Press Release"/&gt; Allegations also involved an event in January 2006, where "Nasr al Din facilitated the travel of two Hizballah representatives to the Lebanese Parliament to Caracas to solicit donations for Hizballah and to announce the opening of a Hizballah-sponsored community center and office in Venezuela", later assisting the travel of more Hezbollah members to Iran.&lt;ref name="Press Release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNpassport"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zamost|first1=Scott|last2=Guerrero|first2=Kay|last3=Griffin|first3=Drew|last4=Romo|first4=Rafael|last5=del Rincón|first5=Fernando|title=Pasaportes venezolanos, ¿en manos equivocadas?|url=http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2017/02/06/pasaportes-venezolanos-en-manos-equivocadas/|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[CNN Español]]|date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasr Al-Din had also met with Walid Makled, a Venezuelan drug trafficker, doing "business" with him.&lt;ref name="HOUSEgpo"&gt;{{cite web|title=HEZBOLLAH IN LATIN AMERICA--IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg72255/html/CHRG-112hhrg72255.htm|website=www.gpo.gov|publisher=[[United States House Committee on Homeland Security]]|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2006 appointment of [[Nicolás Maduro]], Venezuela's future president, to be Venezuela's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasr Al-Din's diplomatic workload increased as he delivered multiple Venezuelan visas to Lebanese citizens in 2007.&lt;ref name="ABCjan2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blasco|first1=Emili J.|title=El FBI investiga la conexión entre Hizbolá y el narcoestado venezolano|url=http://www.abc.es/internacional/20150131/abci-narcoestado-venezuela-hizbola-201501301916.html|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=31 January 2015|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] placed Nasr Al-Din on its terrorism blacklist citing his assistance of Hezbollah.&lt;ref name="Press Release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCjan2015"/&gt;

A 22 August 2010 meeting in Caracas was also planned by Nasr Al-Din, which involved Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, [[Hamas]] Supreme Leader [[Khaled Meshal]], a Hezbollah leader and Secretary-General of the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine]] [[Ramadan Abdullah Mohammad Shallah]].&lt;ref name="HOUSEgpo"/&gt; In 2015, the FBI listed him as a person of interest due to his connections to Hezbollah.&lt;ref name="ABCjan2015"/&gt;

====Family involvement====
Nasr Al-Din brothers, Abdallah and Oday, both reside in [[Isla Margarita]], Venezuela.&lt;ref name="USforeign"/&gt; Abdallah Nasr Al-Din allegedly launders money for Hezbollah on the island while Oday recruits [[Chavismo|chavistas]] to join [[Bolivarian Circles]] and travel to Iran for training.&lt;ref name="USforeign"/&gt;

====Response====
In an interview with the Russian state television network [[RT (TV network)|RT]], Nasr Al-Din explained his opposition to the United States, stating that the accusations of his involvement with Hezbollah are due to his anti-American sentiments and his role between Syria and Venezuela. He also boast of Iran's "popular support" and "military potential" against the United States and voiced his support of [[Russian military intervention in Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exdiplomático buscado por el FBI: "EE.UU. compra a un amigo y vende a un aliado de un día para otro"|url=https://actualidad.rt.com/programas/entrevista/190296-entrevista-ghazi-atef-nassereddine-exdiplomatico|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]|date=2 November 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1222">In [[category theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''globular set''' is a higher-dimensional generalization of a [[directed graph]]. Precisely, it is a sequence of sets &lt;math&gt;X_0, X_1, X_2, \dots&lt;/math&gt; equipped with pairs of functions &lt;math&gt;s_n, t_n: X_n \to X_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;s_n \circ s_{n+1} = s_n \circ t_{n+1},&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;t_n \circ s_{n+1} = t_n \circ t_{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
(Equivalently, it is a presheaf on the category of “globes”.) The letters "''s''", "''t''" stand for "source" and "target" and one imagines &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; consists of directed edges at level&amp;nbsp;''n''.

A variant of the notion was used by [[Grothendieck]] to introduce the notion of an [[∞-groupoid]]. Extending Grothendieck's work, {{harv|Maltsiniotis|2010}} gave a definition of a [[weak ∞-category]] in terms of globular sets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5216">The '''Head Injury Criterion''' (HIC) is a measure of the likelihood of [[head injury]] arising from an impact.  The HIC can be used to assess safety related to vehicles, personal protective gear, and sport equipment. 

Normally the variable is derived from the measurements of an accelerometer mounted at the [[center of mass]] of a [[crash test dummy]]’s head, when the dummy is exposed to crash forces.

It is defined as:
&lt;math&gt;\mathit{H}\mathit{I}\mathit{C} = \bigg\{ \Big[ \frac{1}{t_{2}-t_{1}} \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} a(t) dt\Big]^{2.5}\left ( t_{2}-t_{1}\right ) \bigg\}_{max} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=ATB&gt;[http://www.mchenrysoftware.com/HIC%20and%20the%20ATB.pdf Head Injury Criteria and the ATB]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henn&gt;[http://www.health.uottawa.ca/biomech/courses/apa6903/CrashTests%20and%20the%20HIC.pdf Crash Tests and the Head Injury Criterion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
where ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the initial and final times (in seconds) chosen to maximize HIC, and [[acceleration]] ''a'' is measured in ''g''s ([[standard gravity]] acceleration).  The time duration, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is limited to a maximum value of 36&amp;nbsp;ms,&lt;ref name=ATB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henn/&gt; usually 15&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA458677 A Test Methodology for Assessing Demining Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that the HIC includes the effects of head acceleration and the duration of the acceleration.  Large accelerations may be tolerated for very short times.

At a HIC of 1000, there is an 18% probability of a severe head injury, a 55% probability of a serious injury and a 90% probability of a moderate head injury to the average adult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.ac.in/sadhana/Pdf2007Aug/397.PDF The increasing importance of the biomechanics of impact trauma]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automobile safety==

HIC is used to determine  the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) star [[Automobile safety rating|rating for automobile safety]] and to determine ratings given by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]].&lt;ref name="guidelines09"&gt;[http://www.iihs.org/ratings/protocols/pdf/measures_frontal.pdf Guidelines for Rating Injury Measures, 2009, IIHS]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]], head injury risk is evaluated mainly on the basis of head injury criterion.  A value of 700 is the maximum allowed under the provisions of the U.S. advanced airbag regulation (NHTSA, 2000) and is the maximum score for an "acceptable" IIHS rating for a particular vehicle.&lt;ref name="guidelines09"/&gt;   

A HIC-15 (meaning a measure of impact over 15&amp;nbsp;milliseconds) of 700 is estimated to represent a 5 percent risk of a severe injury (Mertz et al., 1997). A "severe" injury is one with a score of 4+ on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) (Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, 1990).&lt;ref name="guidelines09"/&gt; 

Data for specific vehicles can be found on various automotive review websites.  Some sample data is as follows, for comparative purposes:
* The 1998 [[Ford Windstar]], marketed as one of the safest minivans of that year, tested out to a HIC=305 score for driver &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/ford/windstar-minivan/1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
* A small car, a 1998 [[Dodge Neon]], tested at HIC=265. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/dodge/neon-4-door-sedan/1998&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A common family sedan, a 1998 [[Toyota Camry]], tested at HIC=288.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/toyota/camry-4-door-sedan/1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2007 Camry at HIC=175. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/toyota/camry-4-door-sedan/2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automotive.com/2007/12/toyota/camry/crash-tests/index.html 2007 Toyota Camry Crash Test Results]&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive searchable database of vehicles and their HIC scores is available at [http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/ safercar.gov].

==Athletics and recreation==
[[Exercise physiology|Sport physiologists]] and [[biomechanics]] experts use the HIC in the research of safety equipment and guidelines for competitive sport and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astm.org/Standards/F1292.htm ASTM Sport Standard]&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, [[concussion]]s were found to occur at HIC=250 in most athletes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/r859713q00204262 Head Impact Biomechanics in Sport]&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have been conducted in skiing and other sports to test adequacy of helmets &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astm.org/JOURNALS/JAI/PAGES/JAI14203.htm Head Injury in Snowboarding: Evaluating the Protective Role of Helmets]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hybrid algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that combines two or more other algorithms that solve the same problem, either choosing one (depending on the data), or switching between them over the course of the algorithm. This is generally done to combine desired features of each, so that the overall algorithm is better than the individual components.

"Hybrid algorithm" does not refer to simply combining multiple algorithms to solve a different problem – many algorithms can be considered as combinations of simpler pieces – but only to combining algorithms that solve the same problem, but differ in other characteristics, notably performance.

==Examples==
In [[computer science]], hybrid algorithms are very common in optimized real-world implementations of [[recursive algorithm]]s, particularly [[Divide and conquer algorithm#Implementation issues|implementations]] of 
[[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]] or [[decrease and conquer]] algorithms, where the size of the data decreases as one moves deeper in the recursion. In this case, one algorithm is used for the overall approach (on large data), but deep in the recursion, it switches to a different algorithm, which is more efficient on small data. A common example is in [[sorting algorithm]]s, where the insertion sort, which is inefficient on large data, but very efficient on small data (say, five to ten elements), is used as the final step, after primarily applying another algorithm, such as [[merge sort]] or [[quicksort]]. Merge sort and quicksort are asymptotically optimal on large data, but the overhead becomes significant if applying them to small data, hence the use of a different algorithm at the end of the recursion. A highly optimized hybrid sorting algorithm is [[Timsort]], which combines merge sort, insertion sort, together with additional logic (including [[binary search]]) in the merging logic.

A general procedure for a simple hybrid recursive algorithm is ''short-circuiting the base case,'' also known as ''[[arm's-length recursion]].'' In this case whether the next step will result in the base case is checked before the function call, avoiding an unnecessary function call. For example, in a tree, rather than recursing to a child node and then checking if it is null, checking null before recursing. This is useful for efficiency when the algorithm usually encounters the base case many times, as in many tree algorithms, but is otherwise considered poor style, particularly in academia, due to the added complexity.

Another example of hybrid algorithms for performance reasons are [[introsort]] and [[introselect]], which combine one algorithm for fast average performance, falling back on another algorithm to ensure (asymptotically) optimal worst-case performance. Introsort begins with a [[quicksort]], but switches to a [[heap sort]] if quicksort is not progressing well; analogously introselect begins with [[quickselect]], but switches to [[median of medians]] if quickselect is not progressing well.

Centralized [[distributed algorithm]]s can often be considered as hybrid algorithms, consisting of an individual algorithm (run on each distributed processor), and a combining algorithm (run on a centralized distributor) – these correspond respectively to running the entire algorithm on one processor, or running the entire computation on the distributor, combining trivial results (a one-element data set from each processor). A basic example of these algorithms are [[distribution sort]]s, particularly used for [[external sorting]], which divide the data into separate subsets, sort the subsets, and then combine the subsets into totally sorted data; examples include [[bucket sort]] and [[flashsort]].

However, in general distributed algorithms need not be hybrid algorithms, as individual algorithms or combining or communication algorithms may be solving different problems. For example, in models such as [[MapReduce]], the Map and Reduce step solve different problems, and are combined to solve a different, third problem.

An '''impairment rating''' is a percentage intended to represent the degree of an individual's impairment, which is a deviation away from one's normal health status and functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cocchiarella|first=Linda|title=Master the AMA Guides Fifth: A Medical and Legal Transition to Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition|year=2001|publisher=AMA Press|location=Chicago, Ill|isbn=978-1579471040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impairment is distinct from [[disability]].

[[File:4778 - Venezia - Palazzo ducale - Capitello 12 - Iniusticia seva sum - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 31-Jul-2008.jpg|thumb|'''Injustice''', one in a series of [[allegory|allegorical]] [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] depicting vices and virtues at the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Ducal Palace in Venice]]]]

'''Injustice''' is a quality relating to unfairness or undeserved outcomes. The term may be applied in reference to a particular event or situation, or to a larger [[status quo]]. In [[Western philosophy]] and [[jurisprudence]], injustice is very commonly—but not always—defined as  either the absence or the opposite of [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;McCoubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. Textbook on Jurisprudence. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Simon" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heinze" /&gt;

The sense of injustice is a universal human feature, though the exact circumstances considered unjust can vary from culture to culture. While even acts of nature can sometimes arouse the sense of injustice, the sense is usually felt in relation to human action such as misuse, [[abuse]], neglect, or malfeasance that is uncorrected or else sanctioned by a [[legal system]] or fellow human beings.

The sense of injustice can be a powerful motivational condition, causing people to take action not just to defend themselves but also others who they perceive to be unfairly treated.

==Relationship with justice==
Professor [[Judith N. Shklar|Judith Shklar]] has written that Western philosophers tend to spend much more time discussing the concept of 'justice' rather than 'injustice'. On the other hand, she states both historical writing and fiction use instances of injustice as subject matter far more often than justice.&lt;ref name = "Judith" /&gt;

In philosophy and jurisprudence, the dominant view has been that injustice and justice are two sides of the same coin—that injustice is simply a lack of justice.  This view has been challenged by professors including Judith Shklar, Thomas W Simon and [[Eric Heinze]], who consider that justice and injustice are independent qualities. So, in this minority view, you can increase the justice of a situation without reducing the injustice. Heinze has even gone as far as to argue that an increase in justice can actually cause an increase in injustice.&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heinze"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;

A relatively common view among philosophers and other writers is that while justice and injustice may be interdependent, it is injustice that is the primary quality. Many writers have written that, while it is hard to directly define or even perceive justice, it is easy to demonstrate that injustice can be perceived by all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

According to [[Friedrich Hayek|von Hayek]], the earliest known thinker to state that injustice is the primary quality was [[Heraclitus]],  whose view was echoed by [[Aristotle]] and dozens of others down the centuries. Hayek said that writers often express the idea that injustice is the primary concept "as though it were a new discovery", suggesting the view is rarely directly expressed in theories on Justice. But Hayek went on to say that [[legal positivism]] has proved that injustice, not justice, is the primary quality.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 8 "THE QUEST FOR JUSTICE"  in Vol 2 of  von Hayeks's ''The mirage of social justice'' (University of Chicago Press,  1978). For a list discussing dozens of writers who have stated down the centuries that  injustice, not justice, is the primary concept, look out for the long footnote under the sub heading  "Rules of just conduct are generally prohibitions of unjust conduct"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sense of injustice==

The legs of the beast include ''adolescés sine obediétia'' (disobedient youth) and ''plebs sine disciplina''(undisciplined commoners).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://library.law.yale.edu/blogs/rare-books/2010-07 |author=Mike Widener |title=More images in our Flickr galleries|publisher=Yale Law Library |date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Scholars including Judith Shklar, Edmond Cahn  and [[Barrington Moore, Jr.]] have surveyed anthropological and historical work on injustice, concluding that the sense of injustice is found everywhere there are men and women; it is a [[human universal]].&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Moore" /&gt;    
These writers, and others like [[Simone Weil]], Elizabeth Wolgast and Thomas W Simon, hold that the sense of injustice is a powerful motivational condition — unlike the sense of justice which tends to be conceived in more abstract ways, and tends to inspire contemplation rather than action.&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bell" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wolgast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Clive. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Priority_of_Injustice.html?id=_2jmAQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Priority of Injustice: Locating Democracy in Critical Theory'']. (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2017). {{ISBN| 978-0820351520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cahn held that, for [[evolution|evolutionary reasons]], humans who witness others being subjected to injustice can respond as though it was an act of aggression towards themselves. There can be an immediate, visceral activation of the [[fight-or-flight response|flight or fight]] system. As [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] puts it "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr., [[Letter from a Birmingham Jail]] (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study published in [[Psychological Science]] found that even babies have a sense of injustice and dislike having it violated, even when they witness events that do not directly effect them.&lt;ref&gt;

In the field of jurisprudence, Cahn has argued that it is an important skill for lawyers to know how to rouse a jury's sense of injustice — something best done by appeals to the particular, not by abstractions or [[Boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] type statements.  Barrington Moore asserts that reasons why populations often submit to [[oppression]] for long periods of time is that they consider it inevitable and so their sense of injustice is not aroused. He says that a widely shared sense of injustice is an essential, though not sufficient, cause of rebellion.  Writers including Simone Weil, Elizabeth Wolgast and Judith Shklar have said that an aroused sense of injustice can be an essential prerequisite to action needed for protecting the weak and afflicted.&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bell"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wolgast"/&gt;

==Causes==
A common cause of injustice is human selfishness. As [[Plato]] described at length in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', people will often commit acts of injustice when they calculate it is in their interests to do so.&lt;ref name = "Heinze"/&gt;  Plato also adds that "The highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not".   Human injustice is not always caused by attempt to gain unfair advantage or malice; it may be simply the result of the flawed human [[decision making]]. For example, studies have found that judges sitting on review boards are less likely to reach decisions favorable to applicants depending on how long it is since the judges had their last food break.&lt;ref&gt;"We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65% after a break." {{cite journal |author1=Shai Danzigera |author2=Jonathan Levav |author3=Liora Avnaim-Pessoa| title=Extraneous factors in judicial decisions |date=11 April 2011 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=108 |issue=17 |pages=6889–92 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1018033108 |pmid=21482790 | accessdate=15 November 2011|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.6889D |pmc=3084045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more on the substantial difference in judges' decisions depending on time since last food break, see chpt 3 of [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Misuse and abuse with regard to a particular case or context may represent a systemic failure to serve the cause of justice (cf. [[Non liquet|legal vacuum]]).&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn"/&gt;

'''Isolation''' ({{lang-de|Isolierung}}) is a [[defence mechanism]] in [[psychoanalytic theory]] first proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]].  While related to [[Psychological repression|repression]] the concept distinguishes itself in several ways.  It is characterized as a mental process involving the creation of a gap between an unpleasant or threatening cognition, and other thoughts and feelings.  By minimizing associative connections with other thoughts, the threatening cognition is remembered less often and is less likely to affect [[self-esteem]] or the [[self concept]].&lt;ref name = foo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F. |author2=Karen Dale |author3=Kristin L. Sommer|title=Freudian Defense Mechanisms and Empirical Findings in Modern Social Psychology: Reaction Formation, Projection, Displacement, Undoing, Isolation, Sublimation, and Denial|journal=Journal of Personality|date=1 December 1998|volume=66|issue=6|pages=1081–1124|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00043}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Freud illustrated the concept with the example of a person beginning a train of thought and then pausing for a moment before continuing to a different subject.  His theory stated that by inserting an interval the person was  "letting it be understood symbolically that he will not allow his thoughts about that impression or activity to come into associative contact with other thoughts."&lt;ref name=freud&gt;{{cite book|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|title=The standard edition of the complete works of Sigmund Freud (Vol. 20)|year=1961|publisher=Hogarth Press|location=London|pages=77–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a defense against harmful thoughts, isolation prevents the self from allowing these cognitions to become recurrent and possibly damaging to the self-concept.

==Evidence==
A wide range of studies supports the conclusion that people defend themselves against threats by mentally isolating them.  Repressors have been shown to process information in a rushed, shallow, or minimal fashion.&lt;ref name=bonanno&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=G. A.|author2=Davis, P. J. |author3=Singer, J.

This high level of processing develops strong associative links with similar information.  When a depressed person tries to avoid a damaging cognition, they often think of some other negatively affecting thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=J. A.|author2=Weary, G.|title=Depression and the impression-forming continuum: Piecemeal processing despite the availability of category information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1993|volume=64|pages=636–645|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.4.636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from human and animal studies shows that isolation prompts sensitivity to social threats and motivates the renewal of social connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = J.

One study showed that people would remain satisfied with their performance in the face of negative feedback as long as they could keep the feedback isolated from performance standards.  The researchers would present the standards either before the performance, or after the performance but before the feedback, or after both the performance and the feedback. The people who received the standards early recalled them as well as the others, but simply ignored it.  They managed to isolate their feedback from the standards thereby minimizing the threat to their self-esteem.  Those who received the standards later were less satisfied with their performance, unable to avoid their lack of success as compared to the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schul|first=Y|author2=Schiff, M.|title=On the costs and benefits of ignorance: How performance satisfaction is affected by knowing the standard prior to performance|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1995|volume=21|pages=491–501|doi=10.1177/0146167295215007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of isolation has been referred to as trivializing.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;

Another noteworthy type of isolation is referred to as "temporal bracketing", in which some perceived failure or shortcoming is buried away in one's past, effectively removing its impact on the current self.  This type of separation from the past can be seen in religious conversion or "born again" experiences, in certain drug addiction recovery programs, and in the throwing away of delinquent files in the legal system.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;  These socially accepted practices effectively make isolation socially permissible, at least in certain instances; and those behaviors seem to relieve some of the stress from past events.  People with low self-esteem often use temporal bracketing when describing past failures.  By isolating themselves from whatever misdeed they are bringing to cognition, they contend that it has nothing to do with their current state or relationships with people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=R.

=== Effect ===
Habitual repressors have been shown to have fewer unhappy memories than other people, but the difference rests in the secondary associations.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;  Research of repressors concluded that they had equally strong negative reactions to bad memories, however those memories did not evoke other negative feelings as much as they did for non-repressors.&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=R.

Further research will be needed for accounts of isolation to be considered fully concrete.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=June 2015}}

Each clue in a [[Jumble]] word puzzle is a word that has been “jumbled” by permuting the letters of each word to make an [[anagram]]. A dictionary of such anagrams may be used to solve puzzles or verify that a jumbled word is unique when creating puzzles.

==Computerized solution==
Algorithms have been designed to solve Jumbles, using a dictionary. Common algorithms work by printing all words that can be formed from a set of letters. The solver then chooses the right word.

First algorithm:

# Begin
# Input: J, all the jumbled letters that form an unknown W word(s)
# Sort the letters of J in alphabetical order, preserving duplicates
# Look up sorted letters in a hash table, initialised with a dictionary, that maps a sorted set of letters to unscrambled words
# Print the set of words, which is W
# End

Second algorithm:

#Begin
#Input: J, all the jumbled letters that form an unknown W word(s)
#Frame a word list Y with all [[permutation]]s of J
#For each word in Y check if the word is existing in the dictionary
#If a match is found then collect it in word list W
#Print the words in W
# End

Algorithm to find the [[permutation]]s of J:

#Begin 
#Initialize a string with first character of J denoted by J(1)
#Add the second character of J denoted by J(2) on either side of J(1) to get two strings&lt;!--
--&gt;

J(1)'''J(2)'''

&lt;!--
--&gt;

'''J(2)'''J(1)

#Add the third character of J denoted by J(3) on either side and in between the above 2 strings to get 6 strings&lt;!--
--&gt;

J(1)J(2)'''J(3)'''

&lt;!--
--&gt;

J(1)'''J(3)'''J(2)

&lt;!--
--&gt;

'''J(3)'''J(1)J(2)

&lt;!--
--&gt;

J(2)J(1)'''J(3)'''

&lt;!--
--&gt;

J(2)'''J(3)'''J(1)

&lt;!--
 --&gt;

'''J(3)'''J(2)J(1)

#In the same way add J(4) to each of the above strings in either sides and between two characters to get 24 strings
#Continue this until all the characters are completed

Though the algorithm looks complex it is easy to program.

[[Douglas Hofstadter]] developed a program called [[Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies|Jumbo]] that tries to solve Jumble problems as a human mind would.
The program doesn't rely on a dictionary and doesn't try to find real English words, but rather words that could be English, exploiting a database of plausibilities for various combinations of letters.
Letters are combined non-deterministically, following a strategy inspired by chemical reactions and free associations.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
In [[category theory]] and its applications to other branches of [[mathematics]], '''kernels''' are a generalization of the kernels of [[group homomorphism]]s, the kernels of [[module homomorphism]]s and certain other [[kernel (algebra)|kernels from algebra]]. Intuitively, the kernel of the [[morphism]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the "most general" morphism ''k'' : ''K'' → ''X'' that yields zero when composed with (followed by) ''f''.

Note that [[kernel pair]]s and [[difference kernel]]s (also known as binary [[Equaliser (mathematics)|equaliser]]s) sometimes go by the name "kernel"; while related, these aren't quite the same thing and are not discussed in this article.

==Definition==
Let '''C''' be a [[category theory|category]].
In order to define a kernel in the general category-theoretical sense, '''C''' needs to have [[zero morphism]]s.
In that case, if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is an arbitrary [[morphism]] in '''C''', then a kernel of ''f'' is an [[Equaliser (mathematics)|equaliser]] of ''f'' and the zero morphism from ''X'' to ''Y''.
In symbols:
:ker(''f'') = eq(''f'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''XY''&lt;/sub&gt;)

To be more explicit, the following [[universal property]] can be used. A kernel of ''f'' is an object ''K'' together with a morphism ''k'' : ''K'' → ''X'' such that:
* ''f'' ∘ ''k'' is the zero morphism from ''K'' to ''Y'';

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[[File:First_property_of_the_kernel.svg|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;

* [[Given any]] morphism ''k''&amp;prime; : ''K''&amp;prime; → ''X'' such that ''f'' ∘ ''k''&amp;prime; is the zero morphism, there is a [[unique (mathematics)|unique]] morphism ''u'' : ''K''&amp;prime; → ''K'' such that ''k'' ∘ ''u'' = ''k&amp;prime;''.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[[File:Properties_of_a_kernel.svg|200px]]&lt;/div&gt;

Note that in many [[concrete category|concrete]] contexts, one would refer to the object ''K'' as the "kernel", rather than the morphism ''k''.
In those situations, ''K'' would be a [[subset]] of ''X'', and that would be sufficient to reconstruct ''k'' as an [[inclusion map]]; in the nonconcrete case, in contrast, we need the morphism ''k'' to describe ''how'' ''K'' is to be interpreted as a [[subobject]] of ''X''. In any case, one can show that ''k'' is always a [[monomorphism]] (in the categorical sense of the word). One may prefer to think of the kernel as the pair (''K'', ''k'') rather than as simply ''K'' or ''k'' alone.

Not every morphism needs to have a kernel, but if it does, then all its kernels are isomorphic in a strong sense: if ''k'' : ''K'' → ''X'' and {{math|''{{ell}}'' : ''L'' → ''X''}} are kernels of ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', then there exists a unique [[isomorphism]] φ : ''K'' → ''L'' such that {{math|1=''{{ell}}'' ∘ φ = ''k''}}.

Kernels are familiar in many categories from [[abstract algebra]], such as the category of [[group (algebra)|group]]s or the category of (left) [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a fixed [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] (including [[vector space]]s over a fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]]).
To be explicit, if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a [[homomorphism]] in one of these categories, and ''K'' is its [[kernel (algebra)|kernel in the usual algebraic sense]], then ''K'' is a [[subalgebra]] of ''X'' and the inclusion homomorphism from ''K'' to ''X'' is a kernel in the categorical sense.

Note that in the category of [[monoid]]s, category-theoretic kernels exist just as for groups, but these kernels don't carry sufficient information for algebraic purposes.
Therefore, the notion of kernel studied in monoid theory is slightly different (see [[#Relationship to algebraic kernels]] below).

In the [[category of rings]], there are no kernels in the category-theoretic sense; indeed, this category does not even have zero morphisms. 
Nevertheless, there is still a notion of kernel studied in ring theory that corresponds to kernels in the [[category of pseudo-rings]].

In the category of [[pointed space|pointed topological spaces]], if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a continuous pointed map, then the preimage of the distinguished point, ''K'', is a subspace of ''X''.  The inclusion map of ''K'' into ''X'' is the categorical kernel of ''f''.

&lt;!-- ''We have plenty of algebraic examples; now we should give examples of kernels in categories from [[topology]] and [[functional analysis]].'' --&gt;

==Relation to other categorical concepts==
The dual concept to that of kernel is that of [[cokernel]].
That is, the kernel of a morphism is its cokernel in the [[opposite category]], and vice versa.

As mentioned above, a kernel is a type of binary equaliser, or [[difference kernel]].
Conversely, in a [[preadditive category]], every binary equaliser can be constructed as a kernel.
To be specific, the equaliser of the morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' is the kernel of the [[subtraction|difference]] ''g'' &amp;minus; ''f''.
In symbols:
:eq (''f'', ''g'') = ker (''g'' &amp;minus; ''f'').
It is because of this fact that binary equalisers are called "difference kernels", even in non-preadditive categories where morphisms cannot be subtracted.

Every kernel, like any other equaliser, is a [[monomorphism]].
Conversely, a monomorphism is called ''[[normal morphism|normal]]'' if it is the kernel of some morphism.
A category is called ''normal'' if every monomorphism is normal.

[[Abelian categories]], in particular, are always normal.
In this situation, the kernel of the [[cokernel]] of any morphism (which always exists in an abelian category) turns out to be the [[image (category theory)|image]] of that morphism; in symbols:
:im ''f'' = ker coker ''f'' (in an abelian category)
When ''m'' is a monomorphism, it must be its own image; thus, not only are abelian categories normal, so that every monomorphism is a kernel, but we also know ''which'' morphism the monomorphism is a kernel of, to wit, its cokernel.
In symbols:
:''m'' = ker (coker ''m'') (for monomorphisms in an abelian category)

==Relationship to algebraic kernels==
[[Universal algebra]] defines a [[kernel (universal algebra)|notion of kernel]] for homomorphisms between two [[algebraic structure]]s of the same kind.
This concept of kernel measures how far the given homomorphism is from being [[injective]].
There is some overlap between this algebraic notion and the categorical notion of kernel since both generalize the situation of groups and modules mentioned above.
In general, however, the universal-algebraic notion of kernel is more like the category-theoretic concept of [[kernel pair]].
In particular, kernel pairs can be used to interpret kernels in monoid theory or ring theory in category-theoretic terms.

{{Judicial interpretation}}
In [[law]], the '''legislative intent''' of the [[legislature]] in enacting [[legislation]] may sometimes be considered by the [[judiciary]] when interpreting the law (see [[judicial interpretation]]). The judiciary may attempt to assess legislative intent where legislation is ambiguous, or does not appear to directly or adequately address a particular issue, or when there appears to have been a [[legislative drafting error]].

The courts have repeatedly held that when a statute is clear and unambiguous, the inquiry into legislative intent ends at that point. It is only when a statute could be interpreted in more than one fashion that legislative intent must be inferred from sources other than the actual text of the statute.

==Sources==
Courts frequently look to the following sources in attempting to determine the goals and purposes that the legislative body had in mind when it passed the law:

* the text of the bill as proposed to the legislative body
* amendments to the bill that were proposed and accepted or rejected,
* the record of hearings on the topic
* legislative records or journals
* speeches and floor debate made prior to the vote on the bill
* legislative subcommittee minutes, factual findings and reports
* other relevant statutes that can be used to understand the definitions in the statute on question
* other relevant statutes which indicate the limits of the statute in question
* legislative files of the executive branch, such as the governor or president
* [[case law]] prior to the statute or following it which demonstrates the problems the legislature was attempting to address with the bill
* constitutional determinations (Would Congress still have passed certain sections of a statute had it known about the constitutional invalidity of the other portions of the statute?)
*legislative intent, which is the reason for passing the law

==Application==
Courts in the [[United States]] and elsewhere have developed a number of principles for handling such evidence of legislative intent; as an example, many courts have suggested that the comments of those opposing a bill under consideration should be treated with skepticism, on the principle that opponents of a bill may often exaggerate its practical consequences. 

One early example of an important Supreme Court case which relied on legislative intent was ''[[Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co.]]'' (1904) 196 U.S. 1, where the court decided that a man may sue the railroad for failing to have an automatic coupler since the legislature was attempting to remedy the problem of multiple injuries by railroad coupling.

Others, most notably [[United States Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], have objected generally to the use of such evidence, rather than reliance on the literal language of the statute, arguing that such evidence of "legislative intent" is often created by proponents of a bill to persuade a court to interpret the statute in a way that they were not able to persuade the legislative body to adopt when passing the bill.

These principles of legislative intent often overlap with those principles of [[statutory interpretation|statutory construction]] that courts have developed to interpret ambiguous or incomplete legislation. As an example, the principle that courts should not interpret a statute to produce absurd or unintended results will often be informed by evidence of what the proponents of a bill stated about the objectives to be achieved by the statute.

"'''Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness'''" is a well-known phrase in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name="DOIdraft"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/rough.htm |title=The Declaration of Independence: Rough Draft |publisher=USHistory.org |accessdate=May 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330160602/http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/rough.htm |archivedate=March 30, 2014 |df= }} Scanned image of the Jefferson's "original Rough draught" of the Declaration of Independence, written in June 1776, including all the changes made later by John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and other members of the committee, and by Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase gives three examples of the "[[unalienable rights]]" which the Declaration says have been given to all humans by their creator.

== Origin and phrasing ==
The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was drafted by [[Thomas Jefferson]], and then edited by the [[Committee of Five]], which consisted of Jefferson, [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Roger Sherman]], and [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]]. It was then further edited and adopted by the [[Committee of the Whole]] of the [[Second Continental Congress]] on July 4, 1776.&lt;ref name="Rakove2009-722"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Annotated U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |first=Jack N. |last=Rakove |authorlink=Jack N.

Jefferson's "original Rough draught" is on exhibit in the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trt001.html |title=We Hold These Truths To Be Self Evident... |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was used by [[Julian P. Boyd|Julian Boyd]] to create a transcript of Jefferson's draft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Papers of Thomas Jefferson. Volume 1: 1760–1776 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |editor-first=Julian P. |editor-last=Boyd |year=1950 |pages=243–47 |oclc=16353926}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reads:

{{quote|We hold these truths to be sacred &amp; undeniable; that all men are created equal &amp; independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent &amp; inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, &amp; liberty, &amp; the pursuit of happiness; ...}}

The Committee of Five edited Jefferson's draft.  Their version survived further edits by the whole Congress intact, and reads:&lt;ref name="doi"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html |title=Declaration of Independence |publisher=U.S. National Archives |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that [[all men are created equal]], that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ——}}

A number of possible sources or inspirations for Jefferson's use of the phrase in the Declaration of Independence have been identified, although scholars debate the extent to which any one of them actually influenced Jefferson. Jefferson declared himself an [[Epicurean]] during his lifetime: this is a philosophical doctrine that teaches the pursuit of happiness, here meaning "prosperity, thriving, wellbeing"&lt;ref name="guardian20160917"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign |title=Two American Dreams: how a dumbed-down nation lost sight of a great idea |work=The Guardian |first=Ben |last=Fountain |date=September 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gettys20160704"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1074&amp;context=histfac |title=What About That Pursuit of Happiness? |publisher=Philly.com ''via'' Gettysburg College |first=Timothy J. |last=Shannon |date=July 4, 2016 |accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposes [[autarchy]], which translates as self-rule, self-sufficiency or freedom. The greatest disagreement comes between those who suggest the phrase was drawn from [[John Locke]] and those who identify some other source.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Lockean roots hypothesis ===
In 1689, Locke argued in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' that political society existed for the sake of protecting "property", which he defined as a person's "life, liberty, and estate".&lt;ref name="Locke-Laslett1988"&gt;{{cite book |title=Two Treatises of Government |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, NY |first=John |last=Locke |authorlink=John Locke |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Laslett |at=Sec. 87, 123, 209, 222 |year=1988 |origyear=1689 |isbn=052135448X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'', he wrote that the magistrate's power was limited to preserving a person's "civil interest", which he described as "life, liberty, health, and indolency of body; and the possession of outward things".&lt;ref name="Locke-Tully1983"&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Letter Concerning Toleration |publisher=Hackett Publishing |location=Indianapolis, IN |first=John |last=Locke |authorlink=John Locke |editor-first=James H. |editor-last=Tully |page=26 |year=1983 |origyear=1689 |isbn=091514560X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared in his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' that "the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness".&lt;ref name="Locke-Nidditch1975"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Essay Concerning Human Understanding |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford, UK |first=John |last=Locke |authorlink=John Locke |editor-first=Peter H. |editor-last=Nidditch |at=Book 2, Chapter 21, Section 51 |year=1975 |origyear=1689 |isbn=0198245955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to those scholars who saw the root of Jefferson's thought in Locke's doctrine, Jefferson replaced "estate" with "the pursuit of happiness", although this does not mean that Jefferson meant the "pursuit of happiness" to refer primarily or exclusively to property. Under such an assumption, the Declaration of Independence would declare that government existed primarily for the reasons Locke gave, and some have extended that line of thinking to support a conception of [[limited government]].&lt;ref name="Zuckert1996"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Natural Rights Republic |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame, IN |first=Michael P. |last=Zuckert |pages=73–85 |year=1996 |isbn=0268014809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbett2009"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lockean Commonwealth |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, NY |first=Ross J. |last=Corbett |year=2009 |isbn=1438427948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pangle1988"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Spirit of Modern Republicanism |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |first=Thomas L. |last=Pangle |authorlink=Thomas Pangle |year=1988 |isbn=0226645401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibson2009"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Interpreting the Founding |publisher=University Press of Kansas |location=Lawrence, KS |first=Alan |last=Gibson |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=0700617051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahe1994"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Republics Ancient &amp; Modern, Volume 3; Inventions of Prudence: Constituting the American Regime |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, NC |first=Paul A. |last=Rahe |pages=13–19 |year=1994 |origyear=1992 |isbn=080784473X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virginia Declaration of Rights ===
The first and second article of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]],  written by [[George Mason]] and adopted unanimously by the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention of Delegates]] on June 12, 1776, speaks of happiness in the context of recognizably Lockean rights and is paradigmatic of the way in which "the fundamental natural rights of mankind" were expressed at the time.&lt;ref name="Rakove2009-78"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Annotated U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |first=Jack N. |last=Rakove |authorlink=Jack N.

{{quote|That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.|2=&lt;small&gt;[[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]&lt;ref name="vdor"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/virginia_declaration_of_rights.html |title=The Virginia Declaration of Rights |publisher=U.S. National Archives |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; }}

[[Benjamin Franklin]] was in agreement with [[Thomas Jefferson]] in downplaying protection of "property" as a goal of government.  It is noted that Franklin found property to be a "creature of society" and thus, he believed that it should be taxed as a way to finance civil society.&lt;ref name="Franklin-Skousen2006"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Compleated Autobiography |publisher=Regnery Publishing |location=Washington, D.C. |first=Benjamin |last=Franklin |authorlink=Benjamin Franklin |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Skousen |page=413 |year=2006 |isbn=0-89526-033-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative hypotheses ===
In 1628, Sir [[Edward Coke]] wrote in ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', his commentary on [[Thomas de Littleton]], that "It is commonly said that three things be favoured in Law, Life, Liberty, Dower."&lt;ref name="Coke1628"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/firstpartofinsti011628coke |title=The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England |publisher=Adam Islip |location=London |first=Edward |last=Coke |authorlink=Edward Coke |at=Section 193 |date=1628 |oclc=84760833}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[common law]], [[dower]] was closely guarded as a means by which the [[widow]] and orphan of a deceased landowner could keep their [[real property]].&lt;ref name="Whitehead1922"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQoaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178 |title=The Law of Real Property in Illinois |volume=1 |publisher=Burdette J. Smith &amp; Company |location=Chicago |first=Edward Jenkins |last=Whitehead |page=178 |date=1922 |oclc=60731472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Garry Wills]] has argued that Jefferson did not take the phrase from Locke and that it was indeed meant to be a standard by which governments should be judged.&lt;ref name="Wills2002"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence |publisher=Mariner Books |location=New York, NY |first=Gary |last=Wills |year=2002 |origyear=1978 |isbn=978-0-618-25776-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wills suggests [[Adam Ferguson]] as a good guide to what Jefferson had in mind:

{{quote|If, in reality, courage and a heart devoted to the good of mankind are the constituents of human felicity, the kindness which is done infers a happiness in the person from whom it proceeds, not in him on whom it is bestowed; and the greatest good which men possessed of fortitude and generosity can procure to their fellow creatures is a participation of this happy character. If this be the good of the individual, it is likewise that of mankind; and virtue no longer imposes a task by which we are obliged to bestow upon others that good from which we ourselves refrain; but supposes, in the highest degree, as possessed by ourselves, that state of felicity which we are required to promote in the world.|[[Adam Ferguson]]|An Essay on the History of Civil Society&lt;ref name="Ferguson-Oz1995"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Essay on the History of Civil Society |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, NY |first=Adam |last=Ferguson |editor-first=Fania |editor-last=Oz-Salzberger |pages=99–100 |year=1995 |origyear=1767 |isbn=052144215X}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Another possible source for the phrase is in the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' published by Sir [[William Blackstone]], from 1765 to 1769, which are often cited in the laws of the United States. Blackstone argues that God 'has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the latter cannot be attained but by observing the former; and, if the former be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter. In consequence of which mutual connection of justice and human felicity, he has not perplexed the law of nature with a multitude of abstracted rules and precepts, referring merely to the fitness or unfitness of things, as some have vainly surmised; but has graciously reduced the rule of obedience to this one paternal precept, “that man should pursue his own true and substantial happiness.” This is the foundation of what we call ethics, or natural law.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |sectionurl=https://archive.org/stream/lawsofenglandc01blacuoft#page/40/mode/2up |section=Section the Second: Of the Nature of Laws in General |title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] |publisher=Clarendon Press |first=William |last=Blackstone |author-link=William Blackstone |pages=40-41 |year=1765 |oclc=65350522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mahoroba''''' is an ancient [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word describing a far-off land full of bliss and [[peace]]. It is roughly comparable to the western concepts of [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadia]], a place surrounded by mountains full of harmony and quiet.

''Mahoroba'' is now written only in [[hiragana]] as まほろば. The origins of the word are not clear; it is described in a poem in the ancient ''[[Kojiki]]'' (古事記) as being the perfect place in [[Japan|Yamato]]:

[[Image:MakeTradeFair.svg|thumb|right|The ''Make Trade Fair'' logo.]]

'''Make Trade Fair''' is a campaign organized by [[Oxfam|Oxfam International]] to promote [[trade justice]] and [[fair trade]] among governments, institutions, and multinational corporations.

==Objectives==
The campaign has focused on the elimination of several trade practices:

* [[Dumping (pricing policy)|Dumping]], which occurs when highly subsidized, surplus commodities from developed countries such as rice, cotton, corn, and sugar are sold at low prices and farmers from poor countries have difficulty competing.   It is believed that this creates an uneven playing field where farmers in developing countries are unable to compete in the market with cheaper foreign produce and crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_dumping.htm#|title=Rigged Rules - Dumping |accessdate=January 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tariffs]], where nations enforce high taxes on imported goods, restricting the sales of products from other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_marketaccess.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Market Access|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221040624/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_marketaccess.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unbalanced [[labour rights]] for women, who often perceive that they earn lower wages than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_labour.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Labour Rights|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224162419/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_labour.htm|archivedate=December 24, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stringent [[patent]] issues, that prevent the prices of medication, software, and textbooks (e.g. [[Gene patent]]s, [[Chemical patent]]s, and [[Software patent]]s) from being lowered.  Thus, such essential goods are often inaccessible to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_patents.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Patents|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322075359/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_patents.htm|archivedate=March 22, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key events==

===The Big Noise===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MakeTradeFairStipe.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M. (band)|REM]] is "dumped" with milk to highlight dumping practices as part of the Big Noise petition]] --&gt;
Launched in April 2002, the Big Noise is a worldwide petition that calls for governments to help end unfair trade practices. By the end of 2005, some 17.8 million signatures have been received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org/en/programs/campaigns/maketradefair/index.htm|title=Oxfam International  - Make Trade Fair |accessdate=January 29, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060104033924/http://www.oxfam.org/en/programs/campaigns/maketradefair/index.htm |archivedate = January 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Desmond Tutu]] was the honorary 1 millionth signee to the petition in 2003.  Other celebrities who have lent their names to the petition include the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]], and musicians [[Bono]] and [[Coldplay]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.ca/news/MakeTradeFair/ArchbishopTutu.htm |title=Make Trade Fair - Oxfam Global Petition Hits One Million Mark |accessdate=January 29, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103065246/http://www.oxfam.ca/news/MakeTradeFair/ArchbishopTutu.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically [[Chris Martin]] who would, before performing on stage, draw an [[equal sign]] (mistaken by many to be a tattoo) on his hand. However, this could also be a reference to the [[Human Rights Campaign]].

The petition was also coupled with a popular photo campaign, where celebrities were "dumped" with various crops and foodstuffs to highlight the practice of [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]], which some perceive to be unfair. [[Colin Firth]], [[Thom Yorke]], [[Jamelia]], and [[Haile Gebrselassie]] were a few of the celebrities to take part in this venture.

===Make Trade Fair concerts===
In 2002 and 2004, special benefit concerts were held in [[London]] to promote the Make Trade Fair campaign.  Proceeds from the shows went to aid Oxfam's promotional campaigns. Produced by [[Emily Eavis]], [[Marianne Troup]], and [[Lily Sobhani]], performers from the 2002 "Fairplay" gig include [[Chris Martin]] and [[Jonny Buckland]] from [[Coldplay]], [[Noel Gallagher]], and [[Ms. Dynamite]], while the 2004 event included Michael Stipe, [[Razorlight]], and [[The Thrills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/kidsweb/stars/mtf_concert.htm|title= 	
Make Trade Fair Concert 2004|accessdate=January 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, the Make Trade Fair support CD ''The Cake Sale'' was produced. The 9 songs were performed by [[Lisa Hannigan]], [[Nina Persson]], [[Gary Lightbody]], [[Gemma Hayes]], [[Glen Hansard]], [[Josh Ritter]], [[Conor Deasy]] and [[Neil Hannon]], and written by Deasy, Hansard, [[Emm Gryner]], [[Paul Noonan]], [[Ollie Cole]], [[Damien Rice]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfamireland.org/whatwedo/campaigns_advocacy/make_trade_fair/thecakesale.shtml |title=Make Trade Fair CD 2008 |accessdate=February 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121174042/http://www.oxfamireland.org/whatwedo/campaigns_advocacy/make_trade_fair/thecakesale.shtml |archivedate=January 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005===
The Make Trade Fair campaign was active at the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005]], held in [[Hong Kong]], [[People's Republic of China]].  Various demonstrations and activities were held, including the handover of some 17.8 million signatures on the Big Noise petition to WTO Director General [[Pascal Lamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/pages/galleries/wto01.htm|title=WTO summit photos|accessdate=February 18, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090706203209/http%3A//www.maketradefair.com/en/pages/galleries/wto01.htm|archivedate=July 6, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3473">'''Mandated choice''' or '''mandatory choice''' is an approach to public policy questions in which people are required by law to state in advance whether or not they are willing to engage in a particular action.  The approach contrasts with "opt-in" and "opt-out" ("presumed consent") models of policy formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2008/10/27/remedying-donor-organ-complications-91466-22122353/ Remedying donor organ complications]&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach has most frequently been applied to cadaveric organ donation,&lt;ref&gt;Herz, Susan.  Two Steps to Three Choices: A New Approach to Mandated Choice, ''Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics'' (1999), 8 : 340-347 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; but has increasingly been considered for [[advance directives]] as well.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;Appel, Jacob M.  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/the-ultimate-prescription_b_247558.html The Ultimate Prescription: Make Us Decide How We Want To Die], July 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  One bioethicist, in advocating for a mandatory choice model for [[living wills]], argues that "while all Americans should have a right to decide how they want their lives to end, it does not follow that they should be able to avoid confronting such a choice."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==History==

One of the first considerations of mandated choice appeared in [[Great Britain]]'s Gore Report, a 1989-1990 study funded by the British Department of Health. From 2011 all those applying for or renewing driving licences online in the UK are required to state whether they wished to donate their organs.&lt;ref&gt;Organ donated 'nudge' for drivers in new DVLA process, BBC, July 31, 2011 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14341553, accessed July 31, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]] endorsed a mandated choice model for organ donation in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Taking organs without asking, Chicago Tribune, July 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicalities==
It has been suggested that individuals could be compelled to choose as part of tax returns, driver's licence applications, and/or state benefits claims.&lt;ref&gt;Chouhan P and H Draper.  Modified Mandated Choice for Organ Procurement  ''J Med Ethics''. 2003;29(3):157-162, at p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public attitudes==

A 1992 survey found that 90% of American college students favored a mandated choice model for organ donation, compared with only 60% who favored presumed consent.&lt;ref&gt;Spital, Aaron.  Mandated Choice:  The Preferred Solution to the Organ Shortage?  ''Arch Intern Med''. 1992;152(12):2421-2424.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Texas implemented such a program, requiring drivers to make a choice on organ donation when obtaining licenses, and found that 80% of drivers declined to donate.&lt;ref&gt;Kolata, Gina.  Families Are Barriers to Many Organ Donations, Study Finds.  ''The New York Times'', July 7, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic debate==
Chouhan and Draper propose a modified scheme of mandated choice, in which though all patients are given a choice whether to donate they are actively encouraged to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Chouhan P and H Draper.  Modified Mandated Choice for Organ Procurement  ''J Med Ethics''. 2003;29(3):157-162, at p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed in 1998 in the Netherlands by the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women’s Movement (IIAV) in collaboration with the [[Royal Tropical Institute]], and [[Oxfam|Oxfam, GB]], with a grant from [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wieringa|first=Saskia |title=Traveling Heritages: New Perspecitves on Collecting, Preserving, and Sharing Women's History|publisher=[[Amsterdam University Press]]|year=2008|page=136|isbn=9789052602998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently [[Atria (institute)|Atria]], institute on gender equality and women’s history, the successor of the IIAV, maintains the database.

It contains almost 600 women's information centres from over 130 countries and can be accessed through the Atria website.

==Finding relevant sources of women's information==
The Mapping the World database is a tool for finding sources of women's information, that are open to the public. The centers provide the information, which includes a description of the center, highlights in their collections, and contact information.
Many of the centers listed in the database have resources such as books, periodicals, and photos, to be viewed and used on site at the center, or to be searched on line through their website.

==What are Women’s Information Services==

Women have collected and disseminated information for hundreds of years, but it is only from early 20th century that centres have been developed for the specific purpose of collecting and documenting what has come to be known as women’s information. Women’s information envelops a wide spectrum of material, cultural, political and educational issues.

Women’s information centres give women access to information that affects them. In the past fifty years, influenced by the worldwide women’s movement, collections have become more established and have developed their own professional instruments  (for example the Women’s Thesaurus,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atria.nl/en/library-archive/womens-thesaurus Women's Thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt; an instrument developed to index women’s information).

Women’s information services include:
* International, national and local women’s information services
* Women’s documentation and research centres connected to universities
* Gender specific information sections in governmental organisations, and
* Resource centres in which, among others, women’s information is collected,
* Or, where the development of the women’s movement is still in its early stages, such as in newly democratic countries, or in countries where war has destabilised development, a women’s magazine, a radio or TV programme are often ‘focal point’ for women’s information, accessible to the public.

==Targetgroup==
The database is a resource for anyone looking for print, on line, photographic, audio-visual, or other resources about women.  Sources of women's information are to be found in over 50 languages, covering hundreds of relevant subjects, from more than 130 countries. 
Targetusers are women and women’s organizations, policymakers, decision-makers and general information services.

'''Maria Anwander''' (born 1980)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maria-anwander.net/cv.php|title=maria anwander|website=www.maria-anwander.net|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Austrian [[conceptual art]]ist who specializes in [[Performance art|performance]] and [[installation art]]. Her work has been featured in multiple solo exhibitions in Europe and the United States since 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Much of her work focuses on challenging art institutions and their conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunsthallesanktgallen.ch/en/3/events/maria-anwander-78f9c7c1.html|title=Maria Anwander "In a Certain State of Uncertainty" – Kunst Halle Sankt Gallen|website=www.kunsthallesanktgallen.ch|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Anwander was born in [[Bregenz]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She studied Theater, Film, and Media Science at the [[University of Vienna]], graduating in 2003.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She earned a degree from the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Vienna in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2013, Anwander stated that "my work mainly questions authenticity of artworks and the gap between the [[Art market|art-market]] and the artist as participator."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leoalmanac.org/vol19-no2-interview-statement-artwork-by-maria-anwander/|title=Leonardo Electronic Almanac – Interview, Statement, Artwork by Maria Anwander|website=www.leoalmanac.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that "my latest works deal with issues of [[collecting]], [[ownership]] and [[authorship]]. Hereby I'm highly interested in the creation of notional images by removing other already existing images. The [[Dematerialization (art)|dematerialization]] and [[deconstruction]] of images into pure descriptions of themselves and vice versa is part of my deliberations."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Anwander currently lives and works in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Works ==

=== ''My Most Favorite Art (2004–2011)'' ===
Anwander created an [[Installation art|installation]] of the exhibition labels she had stolen from art galleries and museums.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maria-anwander.net/work.php?id=16|title=maria anwander|website=www.maria-anwander.net|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation is also intended as a travel diary and Anwander states that its purpose is to give the viewer "access to my innermost, to the works accompanying my artistic career."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== ''The World's Leading Art Magazine (2009–2013)'' ===
Anwander used tissues to remove the ink from the pages of an [[List of art magazines|art magazine]] which purported to be the world's leading art magazine, leaving only the blank magazine and the ink from the pages on the tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maria-anwander.net/work.php?id=24|title=maria anwander|website=www.maria-anwander.net|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Analyzing (2010)'' ===
Anwander filmed a 32-minute video where she met with Adolfo Profumo, a [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], in [[New York City]] who attempts to tell her about her personality through looking through her portfolio.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== ''The Kiss (2010)'' ===
In 2010, Anwander entered the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] as a regular visitor and, unauthorized, French-kissed a wall she had chosen.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casino-luxembourg.lu/en/Artist-residencies/Been-Present|title=Casino Luxembourg ⋅ Artist residencies ⋅ Been Present|website=www.casino-luxembourg.lu|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wetheurban.com/post/72706219639/art-the-kiss-by-maria-anwander-the-kiss-was|title=WETHEURBAN|website=WETHEURBAN|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twoseriousladies.org/an-ongoing-conversation-with-maria-anwander-part-one/|title=An Ongoing Conversation with Maria Anwander, Part One {{!}} Two Serious Ladies|website=www.twoseriousladies.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then affixed a label identical to the labels used by [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], explaining her rationale and explaining that she "uses art institutions as forums where hierarchical, social and economic models can be tested and reimagined. This piece is a part of a series of artworks and performances, which Anwander has developed since 2004, playing with the link between art institutions and market."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== ''Public Dancefloor (2012)'' ===
Anwander staged an intervention in a public space where a public dance floor was installed in the middle of a [[Urban park|public park]] in [[Innsbruck|Innsbruck, Austria]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.curators-network.eu/archiveuploads/items/867.pdf|title=Curators' Network|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A light switch, disco ball, loudspeaker, and lights were installed. When the light switch was pressed, lights turned on and music began to play for the duration of one song.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== ''The Present (2012)'' ===
In 2012, Anwander staged an intervention and placed a block of limestone weighing two tons in the city centre of [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twoseriousladies.org/an-ongoing-conversation-with-maria-anwander-part-2/|title=An Ongoing Conversation with Maria Anwander, Part 2 {{!}} Two Serious Ladies|website=www.twoseriousladies.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Untitled (2012), in collaboration with Ruben Aubrecht'' ===
Anwander and Aubrecht created a 100 x 280&amp;nbsp;cm [[sculpture]] which read, "JUST ANOTHER WORK OF ART WHICH WILL NOT GO DOWN IN HISTORY."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== ''Untitled (2012), in collaboration with Ruben Aubrecht'' ===
In collaboration with Aubrecht, Anwander placed embroidered pillows with statistics about [[poverty]], [[malnutrition]] or [[Distribution of wealth|wealth distribution]] on couches in luxury apartments, hotel lobbies and exclusive restaurants in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The work was intended to be a response to the "increasing development of parallel societies."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

{{Expand French|Mutilation|date=December 2014}}
'''Mutilation''' or '''maiming''' (from the Latin: ''mutilus'') is cutting off or injury to a body part of a person so that the part of the body is permanently damaged, detached or disfigured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Mutilation |volume=19 |pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Some ethnic groups practice ritual mutilation, e.g. [[scarification]], [[burn]]ing, [[flagellation]], [[tattooing]], or [[breaking wheel|wheeling]], as part of a [[rite of passage]]. In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy.

The traditional Chinese practices of [[Slow slicing|''língchí'']] and [[foot binding]] are forms of mutilation. One form of mutilation that has captured the imagination of Westerners is the "long-neck" people, a sub-group of the [[Karen people|Karen]] known as the [[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] where women wear brass rings around their neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiangdao.com/chiangmai/karenlongneck.htm|title=Karen Long Neck hilltribe - Padaung, Northern Thailand|publisher=Chiangdao.com|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of [[tattoo]]ing is also considered a form of self-mutilation according to some cultural traditions, such as within Christianity. A joint statement released by the [[United Nations]] and numerous other international bodies opposes [[female genital mutilation|female circumcision]] as a form of mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Eliminating Female genital mutilation - An interagency statement | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | isbn = 978-92-4-159644-2 | url = http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/fgm/fgm_statement_2008.pdf | format = pdf | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not [[male circumcision]] amounts to mutilation is a subject of academic debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Denniston, G.

[[Castration]] is also a form of mutilation, as are [[body piercing]], some forms of extreme [[body modification]], and some [[cosmetic surgery]].

==Punishment==
''Maiming'', or mutilation which involves the loss of, or incapacity to use, a bodily member, is and has been practised by many societies with various cultural and religious significances, and is also a customary form of [[physical punishment]], especially applied on the principle of [[an eye for an eye]].

The [[mapuche|Araucanian]] warrior [[Galvarino]] suffered this punishment as a prisoner during the Spanish [[conquest of Chile]].

In law, maiming is a criminal offence; the old law term for a special case of maiming of persons was [[Mayhem (crime)|mayhem]], an [[Anglo]]-[[French language|French]] variant form of the word.

Maiming of animals by others than their owners is a particular form of the offence generally grouped as malicious damage. For the purpose of the law as to this offence animals are divided into cattle, which includes horses, pigs and asses, and other animals which are either subjects of larceny at common [[law]] or are usually kept in confinement or for domestic purposes.

In Britain under the [[Malicious Damage Act 1861]] the punishment for maiming of cattle was three to fourteen years penal servitude; malicious injury to other animals is a misdemeanour punishable on summary conviction. For a second offence the penalty is imprisonment with hard labor for over twelve months.  Maiming of animals by their owner falls under the Cruelty to Animals Acts.

==Mutilation as human punishment== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dock]] --&gt;
In times when even judicial [[physical punishment]] was still commonly allowed to cause not only intense pain and [[public humiliation]] during the administration but also to inflict permanent physical damage, or even deliberately intended to mark the criminal for life by [[docking (animal)|docking]] or [[human branding|branding]], one of the common anatomical target areas not normally under permanent cover of clothing (so particularly merciless in the long term) were the ear(s).
[[File:Un pauvre averti Gontran - Frédégonde ordonne la mutilation d'Olericus.jpg|thumb|[[Fredegund]] ordering the mutilation of Olericus.]]
In England, for example, various pamphleteers attacking the religious views of the Anglican episcopacy under [[William Laud]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], had their ears cut off for those writings: in 1630 Dr. [[Alexander Leighton]] and in 1637 still other [[Puritans]], [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (puritan)|Henry Burton]] and [[William Prynne]].

In Scotland one of the [[Covenanters]], James Gavin of [[Douglas, Lanarkshire]], had his ears cut off for refusing to renounce his religious faith. In Japan, [[Gonsalo Garcia]] and his companions were similarly punished.

Notably in various jurisdictions of colonial British North America, even relatively minor crimes, such as hog stealing, were punishable by having one's ears nailed to the [[pillory]] and slit loose, or even [[cropping (punishment)|cropped]], a [[counterfeiter]] would be branded on top (for that crime, considered [[lèse-majesté]], the older [[mirror punishment]] was boiling in oil), which was an example of western mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;Garraty, John A. (2003) Historical Viewpoints. New York City, New York: Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence did not render American justice any less brutal. For example, in the future state of Tennessee, an example of harsh 'frontier law' under the 1780 [[Cumberland Compact]] took place in 1793 when Judge [[John McNairy]] sentenced Nashville's first horse thief, John McKain, Jr., to be fastened to a wooden stock one hour for 39 lashes, have his ears cut off and cheeks [[branding persons|branded]] with the letters "H" and "T".

[[Tongue cutting]] is also a form of mutilation as this leads to bleeding to death in most cases with choking in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/pun.html|title=A History of Punishments|publisher=Localhistories.org|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nebahne Yohannes]], an unsuccessful claimant to the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Ethiopian imperial throne]] who had his ears and nose cut off, yet was then freed. This form of mutilation against unsuccessful claimants to thrones has been in use in middle-eastern regions for thousands of years. To qualify as a king, formerly, one had to exemplify perfection. Obvious physical deformities such as missing noses, ears, or lips, are thereby sufficient disqualifications. The victim in these cases is typically freed alive to act (''a'') as an example to others, and (''b'') as no longer a threat.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Narcissistic personality disorder''' ('''NPD''') is a [[personality disorder]] with a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by [[grandiosity|exaggerated feelings of self-importance]], excessive need for [[admiration]], and a lack of [[empathy]].&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington [etc.]|isbn=9780890425558|pages=645, 669–72|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected often spend much time thinking about achieving [[Abusive power and control|power]] or success, or on their [[vanity|appearance]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; They often take advantage of the [[interpersonal relationships|people around them]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of social situations.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;&lt;!-- Quote = pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations --&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism, and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause of narcissistic personality disorder is unknown.&lt;ref name="Sed2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_7-5dQIpBQC&amp;pg=PA29|title=Blueprints psychiatry|last1=Sederer|first1=Lloyd I.|date=2009|publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=|isbn=9780781782531|edition=Fifth|location=Philadelphia|page=29|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111195341/https://books.google.com/books?id=7_7-5dQIpBQC&amp;pg=PA29|archivedate=11 January 2017|deadurl=no|via=Google Books|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a personality disorder classified within [[Cluster B personality disorders|cluster B]] by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM).&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt; Diagnosis is made by a healthcare professional interviewing the person in question.&lt;ref name="Cal2015" /&gt; The condition needs to be differentiated from [[mania]] and [[substance use disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
People with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) are characterized by persistent [[grandiosity]], excessive need for [[admiration]], and a personal disdain and lack of [[empathy]] for others.&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{citation|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=5th |location=Arlington|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|pages=669–72|isbn=0890425558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ronningstam2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ronningstam|first=Elsa|date=|year=2016|title=New Insights Into Narcissistic Personality Disorder|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/special-reports/new-insights-narcissistic-personality-disorder|journal=[[Psychiatric Times]]|volume=33|issue=2|page=11|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the person with NPD usually displays arrogance and a distorted sense of superiority, and they seek to establish [[abusive power and control]] over others.&lt;ref name="pmid21430487"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronningstam|first=Elsa|date=|year=2011|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder: A Clinical Perspective|url=|journal=[[Journal of Psychiatric Practice]]|volume=17|issue=2|pages=89–99|doi=10.1097/01.pra.0000396060.67150.40|pmid=21430487|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-confidence (a strong sense of self) is different from narcissistic personality disorder; people with NPD typically value themselves over others to the extent that they openly disregard the feelings and wishes of others, and expect to be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo1&gt;{{citation|author=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Narcissistic personality disorder - Symptoms &amp; causes|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|date=November 18, 2017|accessdate=June 28, 2018|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the person with narcissistic personality disorder usually exhibits a fragile ego ([[self-concept]]), intolerance of criticism, and a tendency to belittle others in order to validate their own superiority.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt;

The [[DSM-5]] indicates that persons with NPD usually display some or all of the following symptoms, typically without the commensurate qualities or accomplishments:&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt;

# Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from other people
# Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.
# Self-perception of being unique, superior, and associated with high-status people and institutions
# Needing continual admiration from others
# Sense of [[entitlement]] to special treatment and to obedience from others
# Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain
# Unwilling to empathize with the feelings, wishes, and needs of other people
# Intensely envious of others, and the belief that others are equally envious of them
# Pompous and arrogant demeanor

Narcissistic personality disorder usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; It is not uncommon for children and adolescents to display traits similar to those of NPD, but such occurrences are usually transient, and below the criteria for a diagnosis of NPD.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; True symptoms of NPD are pervasive, apparent in varied situations, and rigid, remaining consistent over time. The NPD symptoms must be sufficiently severe that they significantly impair the person's capabilities to develop meaningful human relationships. Generally, the symptoms of NPD also impair the person's psychological abilities to function, either at work, or school, or important social settings. The DSM-5 indicates that the traits manifested by the person must substantially differ from cultural norms, in order to qualify as symptoms of NPD.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;

===Associated features===
People with NPD tend to exaggerate their skills, accomplishments, and their level of intimacy with people they consider high-status. This sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; or to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation,&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., overinflated).&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;

To the extent that people are pathologically narcissistic, they can be [[control freak|controlling]], blaming, self-absorbed, intolerant of others' views, unaware of others' needs and the effects of their behavior on others, and insist that others see them as they wish to be seen.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; Narcissistic individuals use various strategies to protect the self at the expense of others. They tend to devalue, derogate, insult, and blame others, and they often respond to threatening feedback with anger and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Identifying and understanding the narcissistic personality|first=Elsa F|last=Ronningstam|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the fragile ego of individuals with NPD is hypersensitive to perceived criticism or defeat, they are prone to feelings of [[shame]], humiliation, and worthlessness over minor or even imagined incidents.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; They usually mask these feelings from others with feigned humility or by isolating themselves socially, or they may react with outbursts of rage, defiance, or by seeking revenge.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; The merging of the "inflated self-concept" and the "actual self" is seen in the inherent grandiosity of narcissistic personality disorder. Also inherent in this process are the defense mechanisms of [[denial]], [[idealization and devaluation]].&lt;ref name="pmid16937998"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Siegel|first=Judith P.|date=|year=2006|title=Dyadic splitting in partner relational disorders|url=|journal=[[Journal of Family Psychology]]|volume=20|issue=3|pages=418–22|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.20.3.418|pmid=16937998|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the DSM-5: "Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder."&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; Due to the high-functionality associated with narcissism, some people may not view it as an impairment in their lives.&lt;ref name="ronningstam" /&gt; Although overconfidence tends to make individuals with NPD ambitious, it does not necessarily lead to success and high achievement professionally. These individuals may be unwilling to compete or may refuse to take any risks in order to avoid appearing like a failure.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; In addition, their inability to tolerate setbacks, disagreements, or criticism, along with lack of empathy, make it difficult for such individuals to work cooperatively with others or to maintain long-term professional relationships with superiors and colleagues.&lt;ref name="gol2"&gt;{{citation|last=Golomb|first=Elan|title=Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in their Struggle for Self|volume=|page=22|pages=|year=1992|location=New York|publisher=Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The causes of narcissistic personality disorder are unknown.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt;&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Experts tend to apply a [[biopsychosocial model]] of causation,&lt;ref name="Paris"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paris|first=Joel|date=|year=2014|title=Modernity and narcissistic personality disorder|url=|journal=[[Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages=220–226|doi=10.1037/a0028580|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that a combination of environmental, social, genetic and neurobiological factors are likely to play a role in formulating a narcissistic personality.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;

=== Genetic ===
There is evidence that narcissistic personality disorder is heritable, and individuals are much more likely to develop NPD if they have a family history of the disorder.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;&lt;ref name= Torgersen/&gt; Studies on the occurrence of personality disorders in twins determined that there is a moderate to high [[heritability]] for narcissistic personality disorder.&lt;ref name="Torgersen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Torgersen|first1=Svenn|last2=Lygren|first2=Sissel|last3=Øien|first3=Per Anders|last4=Skre|first4=Ingunn|last5=Onstad|first5=Sidsel|last6=Edvardsen|first6=Jack|last7=Tambs|first7=Kristian|last8=Kringlen|first8=Einar|date=December 2000|title=A twin study of personality disorders.|url=|journal=[[Comprehensive Psychiatry]]|volume=41|issue=6|pages=416–25|doi=10.1053/comp.2000.16560|pmid=11086146|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reichborn-Kjennerud|first1=Ted|date=1 March 2010|title=The genetic epidemiology of personality disorders|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181941/pdf/DialoguesClinNeurosci-12-103.pdf|journal=[[Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=103–14|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3181941|pmid=20373672|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the specific [[genes]] and [[Epistasis|gene interactions]] that contribute to its cause—and how they may influence the developmental and physiological processes underlying this condition—have yet to be determined.

=== Environment ===
Environmental and social factors are also thought to have a significant influence on the onset of NPD.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; In some people, pathological narcissism may develop from an impaired [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to their primary caregivers, usually their parents.&lt;ref name="Magid"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Magid|title=High risk children without a conscience|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/High_Risk.html?id=88C74pQcIm4C|accessdate=17 November 2012|year=1987|publisher=Bantam|isbn=0-553-05290-X|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in the child's perception of himself/herself as unimportant and unconnected to others. The child typically comes to believe they have some personality defect that makes them unvalued and unwanted.&lt;ref name="Johns"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen M. Johnson|title=Humanizing the narcissistic style|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxV2QgAACAAJ|accessdate=29 October 2013|date=1 May 1987|publisher=W.W.

According to Leonard Groopman and Arnold Cooper, the following have been identified by various researchers as possible factors that promote the development of NPD:&lt;ref name="AMN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.am/psy/narcissistic-personality-disorder/|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder|author1=Groopman|first=Leonard C.|author2=Cooper|first2=Arnold M.|date=|year=2006|work=Personality Disorders – Narcissistic Personality Disorder|publisher=Armenian Medical Network|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515054225/http://www.health.am/psy/narcissistic-personality-disorder/|archivedate=15 May 2007|deadurl=no|accessdate=14 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An oversensitive [[temperament]] (personality traits) at birth.
* Excessive admiration that is never balanced with realistic feedback.
* Excessive [[praise]] for good behaviors or excessive [[criticism]] for bad behaviors in childhood.
* Overindulgence and overvaluation by parents, other family members, or peers.
* Being praised for perceived exceptional looks or abilities by adults.
* Severe [[emotional abuse]] in childhood.
* Unpredictable or unreliable caregiving from parents.
* Learning [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behaviors from parents or peers.
* Valued by parents as a means to regulate their own [[self-esteem]].

Cultural elements are believed to influence the prevalence of NPD as well since NPD traits have been found to be more common in modern societies than in traditional ones.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
There is little research into the neurological underpinnings of narcissistic personality disorder. However, recent research has identified a structural abnormality in the brains of those with narcissistic personality disorder, specifically noting less volume of [[gray matter]] in the left anterior [[Insular cortex|insula]].&lt;ref name="Schulze"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulze|first=Lars|last2=Dziobek|first2=Isabel|last3=Vater|first3=Aline|last4=Heekeren|first4=Hauke R.|last5=Bajbouj|first5=Malek|last6=Renneberg|first6=Babette|last7=Heuser|first7=Isabella|last8=Roepke|first8=Stefan|date=|year=2013|title=Gray matter abnormalities in patients with narcissistic personality disorder|url=|journal=[[Journal of Psychiatric Research]]|volume=47|issue=10|pages=1363–69|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2013.05.017|pmid=23777939|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsychCentral"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/news/2013/07/06/narcissists-lack-of-empathy-tied-to-less-gray-matter/56907.html|title=Narcissists’ Lack of Empathy Tied to Less Gray Matter|last=Pedersen|first=Traci|date=6 October 2015|website=|publisher=[[PsychCentral]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424210941/http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/07/06/narcissists-lack-of-empathy-tied-to-less-gray-matter/56907.html|archivedate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=2014-04-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study has associated the condition with reduced gray matter in the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nenadic|first1=Igor|last2=Güllmar|first2=Daniel|last3=Dietzek|first3=Maren|last4=Langbein|first4=Kerstin|last5=Steinke|first5=Johanna|last6=Gader|first6=Christian|date=February 2015|title=Brain structure in narcissistic personality disorder: A VBM and DTI pilot study|url=|journal=[[Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging]]|publisher=Elsevier Ireland|volume=231|issue=2|pages=184–86|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2014.11.001|pmid=25492857|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain regions identified in the above studies are associated with [[empathy]], [[compassion]], [[emotional regulation]], and cognitive functioning. These findings suggest that narcissistic personality disorder is related to a compromised capacity for emotional empathy and emotional regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ronningstam|first1=Elsa|date=19 January 2016|title=Pathological Narcissism and Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Recent Research and Clinical Implications|url=http://bostonneuropsa.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CBNsR-NPD-ER-in-Print-01-20-2016-2-1.pdf|dead-url=No|journal=Current Behavioral Neuroscience Reports|volume=3|issue=1|pages=34–42|doi=10.1007/s40473-016-0060-y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817021647/http://bostonneuropsa.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CBNsR-NPD-ER-in-Print-01-20-2016-2-1.pdf|archive-date=17 August 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

===DSM-5===
The formulation of narcissistic personality disorder in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s (APA) [[DSM-IV-TR|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', 4th Edition, Text Revision]] (DSM-IV-TR) was criticised for failing to describe the range and complexity of the disorder. Critics said it focuses overly on "the narcissistic individual's external, symptomatic, or social interpersonal patterns—at the expense of ... internal complexity and individual suffering", which they argued reduced its clinical utility.&lt;ref name="ronningstam"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronningstam|first=Elsa|date=|year=2010|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder: A Current Review|url=|journal=[[Current Psychiatry Reports]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=68–75|doi=10.1007/s11920-009-0084-z|pmid=20425313|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group originally proposed the elimination of NPD as a distinct disorder in [[DSM-5]] as part of a major revamping of the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=DSM-5: Proposed Revisions: Personality and Personality Disorders|date=2010-02-13|publisher=''[[American Psychiatric Association]]''|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/PersonalityandPersonalityDisorders.aspx|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203170307/http://www.dsm5.org/PROPOSEDREVISIONS/Pages/PersonalityandPersonalityDisorders.aspx|archivedate=3 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20223959"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holden|first=Constance|date=|title=Psychiatry.

Some clinicians objected to this, characterizing the new diagnostic system as an "unwieldy conglomeration of disparate models that cannot happily coexist" and may have limited usefulness in clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shedler|first=Jonathan|last2=Beck|first2=Aaron|last3=Fonagy|first3=Peter|last4=Gabbard|first4=Glen O.|last5=Gunderson|first5=John|author-link5=John G.

===ICD-10===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) [[ICD-10|''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems'', 10th Edition]] (ICD-10) lists narcissistic personality disorder under ''Other specific personality disorders''. It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of [[Personality disorder#General diagnostic criteria 2|general personality disorder criteria]].

===Subtypes===
While the DSM-5 regards narcissistic personality disorder as a homogeneous syndrome, there is evidence for variations in its expression.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt; In a 2015 paper, two major presentations of narcissism are typically suggested, an "overt" or "grandiose" subtype, characterized by grandiosity, arrogance, and boldness, and a "covert" or "vulnerable" subtype characterized by defensiveness and hypersensitivity.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt; Those with "narcissistic grandiosity" express behavior "through interpersonally exploitative acts, lack of empathy, intense envy, aggression, and exhibitionism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pincus|first=Aaron L.|last2=Emily B.|first2=Ansell|last3=Pimentel|first3=Claudia A.|last4=Cain|first4=Nicole M.|last5=Wright|first5=Aidan G. C.|last6=Levy|first6=Kenneth N.|date=|year=2009|title=Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory|url=|journal=[[Psychological Assessment (journal)|Psychological Assessment]]|volume=21|issue=3|pages=365–79|doi=10.1037/a0016530|pmid=19719348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Glen Gabbard]] described the subtype, which he referred to as the "oblivious" subtype as being grandiose, arrogant, and thick-skinned. The subtype of "narcissistic vulnerability" entails (on a conscious level) "helplessness, emptiness, low self-esteem, and shame, which can be expressed in the behavior as being socially avoidant in situations where their self-presentation is not possible so they withdraw, or the approval they need/expect is not being met."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Gabbard described this subtype, which he referred to as the "[[hypervigilance|hypervigilant]]" subtype as being easily hurt, oversensitive, and ashamed. In addition, a "high-functioning" presentation, where there is less impairment in the areas of life where those with a more severe expression of the disorder typically have difficulties in, is suggested.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

[[Theodore Millon]] suggested five subtypes of narcissism.&lt;ref name="millon"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Theodore |last= Millon |year=1996 |title=Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV-TM and Beyond |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |page=393 |isbn= 0-471-01186-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=millon9&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millon.net/taxonomy/summary.htm |title=Millon, Theodore, Personality Subtypes |publisher=Millon.net |accessdate=2013-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055645/http://millon.net/taxonomy/summary.htm |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are few pure variants of any subtype,&lt;ref name=millon9/&gt; and the subtypes are not recognized in the DSM or ICD.

Will Titshaw also suggested three subtypes of narcissistic personality disorder which are not officially recognized in any editions of the DSM or the ICD.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Subtype
!Description

|-
| '''Pure Narcissist'''
| Mainly just NPD characteristics.
| Someone who has narcissistic features described in the DSM and ICD and lacks features from other personality disorders.
|-
| '''Attention Narcissist'''
| Including histrionic (HPD) features.
| They display the traditional NPD characteristics described in the ICD &amp; DSM along with histrionic features due to the fact that they think they are superior and therefore they should have everyone's attention, and when they do not have everyone's attention they go out of their way to capture the attention of as many people as possible.
|-
| '''Beyond The Rules Narcissist'''
| Including antisocial (ASPD) features.
| This type of narcissist thinks that because they are so superior to everyone they do not have to follow the rules like most people and therefore show behavior included in the ICD for dissocial personality disorder and behavior, included in the DSM for antisocial personality disorder.

===Comorbidity===
NPD has a high rate of [[comorbidity]] with other mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; Individuals with NPD are prone to bouts of depression, often meeting criteria for co-occurring [[depressive disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=medline&gt;{{citation|last=Berger|first=FK|date=31 Oct 2014|website=MedlinePlus|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|title=Medical Encyclopedia: Narcissistic personality disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, NPD is associated with [[bipolar disorder]], [[anorexia]], and [[substance use disorders]],&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; especially [[cocaine use disorder|cocaine]].&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; As far as other personality disorders, NPD may be associated with [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], and [[paranoid personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;

==Treatment==
Narcissistic personality disorder is rarely the primary reason for people seeking mental health treatment. When people with NPD enter treatment, it is typically prompted by life difficulties or to seek relief from another disorder, such as [[major depressive disorder]], [[substance use disorder]]s, [[bipolar disorder]], or [[eating disorder]]s,&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; or at the insistence of relatives and friends.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This is partly because individuals with NPD generally have poor [[Insight#Psychiatry|insight]] and [[Egosyntonic and egodystonic|fail to recognize]] their perception and behavior as inappropriate and problematic due to their very positive [[self-image]].&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

Treatment for NPD is centered around [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref name=mayo2&gt;{{cite web |title=Narcissistic personality diorder - Diagnosis and treatment |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20366690 |website=www.mayoclinic.org |accessdate=28 June 2018 |language=en |date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, [[Heinz Kohut]] and [[Otto Kernberg]] challenged the conventional wisdom of the time by outlining clinical strategies for using psychoanalytic psychotherapy with clients with NPD that they claimed were effective in treating the disorder. Contemporary treatment modalities commonly involve [[transference|transference-focused]], [[metacognitive]], and [[schema therapy|schema-focused]] therapies. Some improvement might be observed through the treatment of symptoms related to comorbid disorders with psychopharmaceuticals, but {{asof|2016|lc=y}}, according to Elsa Ronningstam, psychologist at [[Harvard Medical School]], "Alliance building and engaging the patient's sense of agency and reflective ability are essential for change in pathological narcissism."&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt;

Pattern change strategies performed over a long period of time are used to increase the ability of those with NPD to become more empathic in everyday relationships. To help modify their sense of entitlement and self-centeredness schema, the strategy is to help them identify how to utilize their unique talents and to help others for reasons other than their own personal gain. This is not so much to change their self-perception of their "entitlement" feeling but more to help them empathize with others. Another type of treatment would be temperament change.&lt;ref name=sperry&gt;{{citation|last=Sperry|first=Lynn|year=1999|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Cognitive Behavior Therapy of DSM-IV Personality Disorders: Highly Effective Interventions for the Most Common Personality Disorders|pages=131–38|location=Ann Arbor, MI|publisher=Edwards Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychoanalytic psychotherapy may be effective in treating NPD, but therapists must recognize the patient's traits and use caution in tearing down narcissistic defenses too quickly.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Anger, rage, impulsivity, and impatience can be worked on with skill training. Therapy may not be effective because patients may receive feedback poorly and defensively. [[Anxiety disorder|Anxiety disorders]] and [[Somatoform Disorders|somatoform disorders]] are prevalent, but the most common would be depression.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Group psychotherapy|Group treatment]] has its benefits, as the effectiveness of receiving peer feedback rather than the clinician's may be more accepted, but group therapy can also contradict itself as the patient may show "demandingness, [[egocentrism]], social isolation and withdrawal, and socially deviant behavior". Researchers originally thought group therapy among patients with NPD would fail because it was believed that group therapy required empathy that NPD patients lack. However, studies show group therapy does hold value for patients with NPD because it lets them explore boundaries, develop trust, increase self-awareness, and accept feedback. Relationship therapy stresses the importance of learning and applying four basic interpersonal skills: "...effective expression, empathy, discussion and problem solving/conflict resolution".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} [[Relationship counseling|Marital/relationship therapy]] is most beneficial when both partners participate.&lt;ref name=sperry/&gt;

No [[Psychiatric medication|medications]] are indicated for treating NPD, but may be used to treat co-occurring mental conditions or symptoms that may be associated with it such as depression, anxiety, and impulsiveness if present.&lt;ref name=mayo2/&gt;

==Prognosis==
The effectiveness of [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] and [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] interventions in the treatment of narcissistic personality disorder has yet to be systematically and empirically investigated. Clinical practice guidelines for the disorder have not yet been created, and current treatment recommendations are largely based on theoretical [[psychodynamic]] models of NPD and the experiences of clinicians with afflicted individuals in clinical settings.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

The presence of NPD in patients undergoing psychotherapy for the treatment of other mental disorders is associated with slower treatment progress and higher dropout rates.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Lifetime prevalence of NPD is estimated at 1% in the general population and 2% to 16% in clinical populations.&lt;ref name="bd2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2011/01/07/megalomiacs-abound-in-politicsmedicinefinance|title=Megalomaniacs abound in politics/medicine/finance|last=|first=|date=January 7, 2011|work=Business Day Live|accessdate=17 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924072524/http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2011/01/07/megalomiacs-abound-in-politicsmedicinefinance|archivedate=24 September 2016|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AMN/&gt; A 2010 [[systematic review]] found the prevalence of NPD to be between 0% to 6% in community samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dhawan|first=Nikhil|last2=Kunik|first2=Mark E.|last3=Oldham|first3=John|last4=Coverdale|first4=John|date=|title=Prevalence and treatment of narcissistic personality disorder in the community: a systematic review|url=|journal=[[Comprehensive Psychiatry]]|publication-date=July–August 2010|volume=51|issue=4|pages=333–39|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2009.09.003|pmid=20579503|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small gender difference, with men having a slightly higher incidence than in women.&lt;ref name=Grijalva/&gt;

According to a 2015 meta-analysis that looked at gender differences in NPD, there has recently been a debate about a perceived increase in the prevalence of NPD among younger generations and among women. However, the authors found that this was not reflected in the data and that the prevalence has remained relatively stable for both genders over the last 30 years (when data on the disorder were first collected).&lt;ref name="Grijalva"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grijalva|first=Emily|last2=Newman|first2=Daniel A.|last3=Tay|first3=Louis|last4=Donnellan|first4=M.

==History==
The [[history of narcissism|use of the term "narcissism"]] to describe excessive vanity and self-centeredness predates by many years the modern medical classification of narcissistic personality disorder. The condition was named after [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], a [[Greek mythology|mythological Greek]] youth who became infatuated with his own reflection in a lake. He did not realize at first that it was his own reflection, but when he did, he died out of grief for having fallen in love with someone that did not exist outside himself.

The term "narcissistic personality structure" was introduced by [[Otto Kernberg|Kernberg]] in 1967&lt;ref&gt;Kernberg, Otto, Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and "narcissistic personality disorder" first proposed by [[Heinz Kohut]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Kohut H The Psychoanalytic Treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorders: Outline of a Systematic Approach, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Freudianism===
[[Sigmund Freud]] commented, regarding the adult neurotic's sense of omnipotence, "this belief is a frank acknowledgement of a relic of the old megalomania of infancy".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; He similarly concluded: "we can detect an element of megalomania in most other forms of [[Paranoia|paranoic]] disorder. We are justified in assuming that this megalomania is essentially of an infantile nature and that, as development proceeds, it is sacrificed to social considerations".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Bergler]] also considered megalomania to be normal in the child,&lt;ref&gt;Bergler, Edmund, "The Psychology of Gambling", in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) pp. 176, 182&lt;/ref&gt; and for it to be reactivated in later life in [[gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Lindner, "The Psychodynamics of Gambling", in Halliday/Fuller eds., p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]] states that, for those who react in later life to narcissistic [[Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury|hurt]] with [[denial]], a similar [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] to the megalomania of childhood is taking place.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, Otto, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object relations===
Whereas Freud saw megalomania as an obstacle to [[psychoanalysis]], in the second half of the 20th century, [[object relations theory]], both in the United States and among British [[Melanie Klein|Kleinians]], set about revaluing megalomania as a [[defence mechanisms|defence mechanism]] that offered potential access for therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Judith M., ''From Obstacle to Ally'' (2004) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach built on [[Heinz Kohut]]'s view of narcissistic megalomania as an aspect of normal development, by contrast with [[Otto Kernberg|Kernberg]]'s consideration of such grandiosity as a pathological development distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Judith M., ''From Obstacle to Ally'' (2004) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
In popular culture, narcissistic personality disorder has been called megalomania.&lt;ref name=bd2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Par2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AsWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|title=War Is Not Inevitable: On the Psychology of War and Aggression|last1=Parens|first1=Henri|date=2014|publisher=Lexington Books|year=|isbn=9780739195291|location=|page=63|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908145308/https://books.google.com/books?id=8AsWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|archivedate=8 September 2017|deadurl=no|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiction===
An article on the Victorian Web argues that Rosamond Vincy, in [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Middlemarch]]'' (1871–72), is a full-blown narcissist as defined by the DSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/eliot/winnington.html|title=The Narcissism of Rosamond Vincy|last=Winnington|first=G.

In the film ''[[To Die For]]'', [[Nicole Kidman]]'s character wants to appear on television at all costs, even if this involves murdering her husband. A psychiatric assessment of her character noted: "[she] was seen as a prototypical narcissistic person by the raters: on average, she satisfied 8 of 9 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder... had she been evaluated for personality disorders, she would receive a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hesse|first=Morten|last2=Schliewe|first2=Sanna|last3=Thomsen|first3=Rasmus R.|date=|year=2005|title=Rating of personality disorder features in popular movie characters|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/5/45|deadurl=no|journal=[[BMC Psychiatry]]|location=London|publisher=BioMed Central|volume=5|page=45|pages=|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-5-45|pmc=1325244|pmid=16336663|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219154746/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/5/45|archivedate=19 February 2015|via=}}

Other examples in popular fiction include television characters Adam Demamp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsrecord.org/arts_and_entertainment/workaholics-star-recounts-dangerous-situations-weird-gestures/article_43e5904c-6051-11e2-ae9c-0019bb30f31a.html|title=‘Workaholics’ Star Recounts Dangerous Situations, Weird Gestures|last=BieryGolick|first=Keith|date=16 January 2013|website=The News Record|publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025062329/http://www.newsrecord.org/arts_and_entertainment/workaholics-star-recounts-dangerous-situations-weird-gestures/article_43e5904c-6051-11e2-ae9c-0019bb30f31a.html|archive-date=25 October 2017|dead-url=No|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (portrayed by [[Adam DeVine]] in ''[[Workaholics]]'') and [[List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia characters#Dennis Reynolds|Dennis Reynolds]] (portrayed by [[Glenn Howerton]] in ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'').

==Criticism==
A Norwegian study concluded that narcissism should be conceived as personality dimensions pertinent to the whole range of PDs rather than as a distinct diagnostic category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karterud|first=Sigmund|last2=Øien|first2=Maria|last3=Pedersen|first3=Geir|date=|title=Validity aspects of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition'', narcissistic personality disorder construct|url=|journal=[[Comprehensive Psychiatry]]|publication-date=September–October 2011|volume=52|issue=5|pages=517–26|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.11.001|pmid=21193181|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alarcón and Sarabia, in examining past literature on the disorder, concluded that narcissistic personality disorder "shows [[nosological]] inconsistency and that its consideration as a trait domain with needed further research would be strongly beneficial to the field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alarcón|first=Renato D.|last2=Sarabia|first2=Silvana|date=|title=Debates on the Narcissism Conundrum: Trait, Domain, Dimension, Type, or Disorder?|url=|journal=[[The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]|publication-date=January 2012|volume=200|issue=1|pages=16–25|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e31823e6795|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Normative social influence''' is a type of [[social influence]] that leads to [[Conformity (psychology)|conformity]]. It is defined in [[social psychology]] as "...the influence of other people that leads us to conform in order to be liked and accepted by them."&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., &amp; Akert, A.M. (2005). Social Psychology (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. {{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of normative social influence stems from the human identity as a social being, with a need for companionship and association.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych&gt;{{cite web|last=Aronson|first=Eliot|title=Conformity: Influencing Behavior|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/hss_aronson_socpsych_6/64/16428/4205685.cw/-/4205769/index.html|work=Social Psychology|publisher=Pearson|accessdate=15 November 2013 |author2=Timothy Wilson |author3=Robin Akert}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normative social influence involves a change in behaviour that is deemed necessary in order to fit in a particular group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiss|first=Steven|date=2012-04-01|title=Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0098628312437704|journal=Teaching of Psychology|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=152–156|doi=10.1177/0098628312437704|issn=0098-6283}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for a positive relationship with the people around leads us to conformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeWall|first=C.

Social norms refers to the unwritten rules that govern social behavior.&lt;ref name="SchacterDaniel"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L. (2012). Psychology (2nd ed.) {{Publisher missing}} {{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are customary standards for behavior that are widely shared by members of a culture.&lt;ref name="SchacterDaniel" /&gt;

==Research==

=== Classic research ===
In 1955, [[Solomon Asch]] conducted his classic [[Asch conformity experiments|conformity experiments]] in an attempt to discover if people still conform when the right answer is obvious.&lt;ref name="Asch Conformity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=Solomon|title=Opinions and Social Pressure|journal=Scientific American|date=November 1955|volume=193|issue=5|pages=31–35|url=http://www.edmondschools.net/Portals/3/docs/Terri_McGill/READ-AschStudy.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2013|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he asked participants in his experiment to judge the similarity of lines, an easy task by objective standards. Using  accomplices to the plot, also known as confederates, Asch created the illusion that an entire group of participants believed something that was clearly false (i.e., that dissimilar lines were actually similar). When in this situation, participants conformed over a third of the time on trials where the confederates gave blatantly false answers. When asked to make the judgments in private, participants gave the right answer more than 98% of the time. Asch's results cannot be explained by [[informational social influence]], because in this case, the task was easy and the correct answer was obvious. Thus, participants were not necessarily looking to others to figure out the right answer, as informational social influence predicts. Instead, they were seeking acceptance and avoiding disapproval. Follow-up interviews with participants of the original Asch studies confirmed this. When participants were asked why they conformed, many provided reasons other than a need for accuracy.&lt;ref name="Asch Conformity" /&gt;

=== Current research ===
In more current research, Schultz (1999) found that households that received more normative messages describing the frequency and amount of weekly recycling, began to have a direct impact on both the households frequency and amount of their curbside recycling. The sudden change was due to the fact that "the other neighbors'" recycling habits had a direct normative effect on the household to change their recycling behaviors. Similar results were apparent in another study in which researchers were able to increase household energy conservation through the use of normative messages.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, J., Schultz, P., Cialdini, R., Goldstein, N., &amp; Griskevicius, V. (2008). Normative social influence is underdetected. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 34(7), 913-923.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in this conservation study did not believe that such normative messages could influence their behavior; they attributed their conservation efforts to environmental concerns or social responsibility needs. Thus, normative social influence can be a very powerful, yet unconscious, motivator of behavior.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Consequences ===
Lastly, different studies have illustrated the consequences of deviation from a group's influence. In a study by Schachter (1951), participants were placed in groups and asked to discuss what to do with a juvenile delinquent they had read about.&lt;ref name=SchachterDeviation&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=Stanley|title=Deviation, Rejection, and Communication|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|date=December 1951|volume=46|issue=2|pages=190–207|doi=10.1037/h0062326}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A "deviant" was instructed by the experimenter to take a stand strongly opposing that of the rest of the group and to hold this position in the midst of any arguments from other members. After the conclusion of the discussions, participants chose to reject this deviant the most, considering him the least desirable of the members, and relegating him to the least important tasks. Recent work by Berns et al. (2005) examined the physiological effects of deviation by using fMRI to scan participants' brains as they completed an object rotation task with other "participants", who were really confederates. The researchers were interested in examining participants' brain activity when they were under the pressure to conform to an incorrect group majority. The amygdala region (which is associated with negative emotions) was activated when participants sought to break off from the influence of the majority; providing evidence for the fact that resisting normative social influence can often lead to negative emotional consequences for individuals.&lt;ref name=BioPsych&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berns|first=Gregory|author2=Jonathan Chappelow |author3=Caroline F. Zink |author4=Giuseppe Pagnoni |author5=Megan E. Martin-Skurski |author6=Jim Richards |title=Neurobiological Correlates of Social Conformity and Independence During Mental Rotation|journal=Biological Psychiatry|date=August 2005|volume=58|issue=3|pages=245–253|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.04.012|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322305004634#|accessdate=15 November 2013|pmid=15978553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affecting factors ==

=== Social impact theory ===
{{Main article|Social impact theory}}
Latane's social impact theory posits that three factors influence the extent to which we conform to group norms: personal importance, immediacy, and size.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych /&gt; As the group becomes more important to a person, physically closer to him/her, and larger in number, Social Impact Theory predicts that conformity to group norms will increase. However, the size of the group only affects conformity to an extent—as a group expands past 3–5 members, the effect levels off.&lt;ref name=FranzoiPsych&gt;{{cite web|last=Franzoi|first=Stephen|title=Social Influence|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072489049/student_view0/chapter9/chapter_outline.html|work=Social Psychology|publisher=McGraw-Hill|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unanimity ===
{{Main article|Unanimity}}
When a group is unanimous in its support of a norm, an individual feels greater pressure to follow suit.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych /&gt; However, even a small break in unanimity can lead to decrease in the power of such normative influence. In Asch's study, when even one other confederate dissented from the majority and provided the correct answer, the participant answered incorrectly on fewer trials (about a fourth less).&lt;ref name="Asch Conformity" /&gt; In addition, participants experienced positive emotions towards such dissenters. A similar reduction in conformity even occurred when the dissenting confederate provided an answer that was false (but still different from that of the majority).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In some versions of the experiment, Asch had dissenting confederates eventually rejoin the majority opinion after several trials; when this occurred, participants experienced greater pressure from normative influence and conformed as if they had never had the dissenter on their side.&lt;ref name="Asch Conformity" /&gt; However, when the conditions were altered and the dissenting confederate left the room after several trials, the participants did not experience a similar pressure to conform as they had when the confederate rejoined the majority—they made less mistakes than they had in the condition where the confederate rejoined the others.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Private vs. public ===
The pressure to bend to normative influence increases for actions performed in public, whereas this pressure decreases for actions done in private.&lt;ref name=McLeodPsych&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=Saul|date=2008|title=Asch Experiment|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html|publisher=SimplyPsychology|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another variation of the Asch study, the researchers allowed the participant to privately write down his answer after all of the confederates had publicly stated their answers; this variation reduced the level of conformity among participants.&lt;ref name="AschConformity#2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=Solomon|title=Studies of Independence and Conformity:  I. A Minority of One Against a Unanimous Majority|journal=Psychological Monographs: General and Applied|year=1956|volume=70|issue=9|pages=1–70|doi=10.1037/h0093718}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the control condition of the Asch study revealed that participants were almost perfectly accurate when answering independently.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Minority influence ===
{{Main article|Minority influence}}
It is possible for a vocal minority to stem the normative influence of a larger majority.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych /&gt;&lt;ref name=FranzoiPsych /&gt; In the versions of the Asch study where a dissenter was inserted into the group (see Unanimity section), his presence as a minority member gave the participant the confidence to exert his independence to a greater extent.&lt;ref name="Asch Conformity" /&gt; However, as soon as the dissenter waffled on his opinions and rejoined the majority, participant conformity increased. Thus, a minority must consistently stand by its beliefs to be effective.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In addition, there are other factors that increase the power of the minority: when the majority is forced to think about the beliefs and perspective of the minority, when the majority and minority are similar to one another, and when the minority exhibits some willingness to compromise and be flexible, although there is debate over the degree to which consistency and compromise should be balanced.&lt;ref name=MinorityInfluence&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=Moscovici and Minority Influence|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/minority-influence.html|publisher=SimplyPsychology|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often the case that whereas a majority influences public compliance with a norm, a minority can engender private acceptance of a new norm, with the end result often being conversion (public and private acceptance of a norm).&lt;ref name=MinorityInfluence /&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
There is a distinction between [[individualistic culture|individualistic]] (e.g., United States) and collectivistic (e.g., Japan) cultures.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych /&gt;&lt;ref name=FranzoiPsych /&gt; While some predict that collectivistic cultures would exhibit stronger conformity under normative social influence, this is not necessarily the case—the identity of the group acts as a potential moderator. Because collectivists emphasize the importance of in-group members (e.g., family and friends), normative pressure from in-groups can lead to higher conformity than pressures from strangers.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Gender differences ===
Many have long wondered whether there is a gender gap in conformity under normative influence, with women possibly conforming more than men. A meta-analysis by Eagly and Carli (1981) shows that this gap is small, and driven by public vs. private situations.&lt;ref name=EaglyCarli&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=Alice|author2=Linda Carli |title=Sex of researchers and sex-typed communications as determinants of sex differences in influenceability: A meta-analysis of social influence studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=July 1981|volume=90|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.90.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women do conform (slightly) more under normative influence than do men when in public situations as opposed to private ones. Eagly and Carli found that male researchers reported higher levels of conformity among female participants than did female researchers; the authors speculate that each gender could be implicitly biased towards portraying itself in a positive light, thus leading to actions (e.g., setting up experimental conditions under which males or females may be more comfortable) that might favor one gender over the other.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Functions==
In many cases, normative social influence serves to promote [[social cohesion]]. When a majority of group members conform to social norms, the group generally becomes more stable. This stability translates into social cohesion, which allows group members to work together toward a common understanding, or "good," but also has the unintended impact of making the group members less individualistic.&lt;ref&gt;Heuser, L., Brian. (2005). Social Cohesion and Voluntary Associations. ''Peabody Journal of Education'', 80, 16–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Fashion choices are often impacted by normative social influence. To feel accepted by a particular crowd, men and women often dress similarly to individuals in that group. Fashion conformity promotes social cohesion within the group, and can be a result of both conscious and unconscious motivations. Similar to fashion conformity, both the male and female view of the ideal body image is often affected by normative social influence.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych /&gt; Social media and marketing helps to portray what is commonly considered the current view of physical attractiveness by the masses. As each generation defines the ideal female figure, women feel the pressure to conform to avoid disapproval of others. Likewise, as society continues to define the ideal male body type as muscular and fit, men also come under pressure to conform, as well, often leading to changes in eating habits to reach that ideal.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

{{The Works of Aristotle}}
[[Aristotle]]'s '''''Poetics''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Περὶ ποιητικῆς}}; {{lang-la|De Poetica}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isnature.org/Files/Aristotle/ ''Aristotelis Opera''] by [[August Immanuel Bekker]] (1837)&lt;/ref&gt; c. 335 BC&lt;ref name="dukore"&gt;Dukore (1974, 31).&lt;/ref&gt;) is the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]] and first [[Extant literature|extant]] philosophical treatise to focus on [[literary theory]] in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, ix).&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been the traditional view for centuries.  However, recent work is now challenging whether Aristotle focuses on literary theory per se (given that not one poem exists in the treatise) or whether he focuses instead on dramatic musical theory that only has language as one of the elements.&lt;ref&gt;"Aristotle on the Power of Music in Tragedy," Pierre Destrée, Greek &amp; Roman Musical Studies, Vol. 4, Issue 2, 2016; Gregory L. Scott, ''Aristotle on Dramatic Musical Composition The Real Role of Literature, Catharsis, Music and Dance in the Poetics'' (2016b), {{ISBN|9780999704929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In it, Aristotle offers an account of what he calls "poetry" (a term which in Greek literally means "making" and in this context includes verse [[drama]] – [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[tragedy]], and the [[satyr play]] – as well as [[lyric poetry]] and [[epic poetry]]). They are similar in the fact that they are all imitations but different in the three ways that Aristotle describes:
# Differences in music rhythm, harmony, meter and melody. 
# Difference of goodness in the characters. 
# Difference in how the narrative is presented:  telling a story or acting it out.

In examining its "first principles", Aristotle finds two: 1) imitation and 2) [[genre]]s and other concepts by which that of truth is applied/revealed in the poesis. His analysis of [[tragedy]] constitutes the core of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Poetics'' 1447a13 (1987, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Aristotle's ''Poetics'' is universally acknowledged in the [[Western culture|Western]] critical tradition, "almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions".&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;Carlson (1993, 16).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was lost to the Western world for a long time. It was available in the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]] only through a Latin translation of an Arabic version written by [[Averroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Habib|first=M.A.R.|title=A History of Literary Criticism and Theory: From Plato to the Present|year=2005|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=0-631-23200-1|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, Aristotle's original work was divided in two, each "book" written on a separate roll of [[papyrus]].&lt;ref name=j20&gt;Janko (1987, xx).&lt;/ref&gt; Only the first part &amp;ndash; that which focuses on [[tragedy]] and epic (as a quasi-dramatic art, given its definition in Ch 23) &amp;ndash; survives. The lost second part addressed [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]].&lt;ref name=j20/&gt; Some scholars speculate that the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' summarises the contents of the lost second book.&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, xxi).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some other scholars indicate that "tragedy" is a very misleading translation for the Greek &lt;i&gt;tragoidos&lt;/i&gt;, which seems to have meant "goat-song" originally.  The reason is that Aristotle says three times in the treatise that the protagonist can go from fortune to misfortune or &lt;i&gt;misfortune to fortune&lt;/i&gt;; also in Chapter 14 the best type of &lt;i&gt;tragoidos&lt;/i&gt; is that which ends happily, like &lt;i&gt;Cresphontes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Iphigenia&lt;/i&gt; (presumably &lt;i&gt;"in Tauris"&lt;/i&gt;)!&lt;ref&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aristotle's Favorite Tragedy: Oedipus or Cresphontes?&lt;/i&gt;, Gregory Scott, 2018, {{ISBN|9780999704912}} or 9780999704905&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
The table of contents page of the ''Poetics'' found in Modern Library's ''Basic Works of Aristotle'' (2001) identifies five basic parts within it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Basic Works of Aristotle''. Ed. Richard McKeon Modern Library (2001) – Poetics. Trans. Ingrid Bywater, pp. 1453–87&lt;/ref&gt;

* A. Preliminary discourse on tragedy, epic poetry, and comedy, as the chief forms of imitative poetry.
* B. Definition of a tragedy, and the rules for its construction. Definition and analysis into qualitative parts.
* C. Rules for the construction of a tragedy: Tragic pleasure, or [[catharsis]] experienced by fear and pity should be produced in the spectator. The characters must be four things: good, appropriate, realistic, and consistent. [[Discovery (observation)|Discovery]] must occur within the plot. Narratives, stories, structures and poetics overlap. It is important for the poet to visualize all of the scenes when creating the plot. The poet should incorporate complication and [[dénouement]] within the story, as well as combine all of the elements of [[tragedy]]. The poet must express thought through the characters' words and actions, while paying close attention to [[diction]] and how a character's spoken words express a specific idea. Aristotle believed that all of these different elements had to be present in order for the poetry to be well-done.  However, starting in 1948 with a Macedonian classicist, M.D. Petruševski, some scholars have rejected that Aristotle himself could have written the word ''katharsis'' in the definition of tragedy, because unlike all of the other words in the definition, it is not discussed either before or after the definition.&lt;ref&gt;M.D. Petruševski "Pathēmatōn Katharsin ou bien Pragmatōn Systasin?," Ziva antika/Antiquite vivante (Skopje: Societe d'etudes classiques Ziva Antika) 1954.

Scott (2016b) {{ISBN|9780999704929}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D. Possible criticisms of an epic or tragedy, and the answers to them.
* E. Tragedy as artistically superior to epic poetry: Tragedy has everything that the epic has, even the epic meter being admissible. The reality of presentation is felt in the play as read, as well as in the play as acted. The tragic imitation requires less space for the attainment of its end. If it has more concentrated effect, it is more pleasurable than one with a large admixture of time to dilute it. There is less unity in the imitation of the epic poets (plurality of actions) and this is proved by the fact that an epic poem can supply enough material for several tragedies.

===Content===

Aristotle distinguishes between the [[genre]]s of "poetry" in three ways:
* Matter
::[[language]], [[rhythm]], and [[melody]], for Aristotle, make up the matter of poetic creation. Where the [[epic poem]] makes use of language alone, the playing of the lyre involves rhythm and melody. Some poetic forms include a blending of all materials; for example, Greek tragic drama included a singing chorus, and so music and language were all part of the performance.  These points also convey the standard view.  Recent work, though, argues that translating ''rhuthmos'' here as "rhythm" is absurd:  melody already has its own inherent musical rhythm, and the Greek can mean what Plato says it means in ''Laws'' II, 665a:  "(the name of) ordered body movement," or dance.  This correctly conveys what dramatic musical creation, the topic of the ''Poetics'', in ancient Greece had:  music, dance, and language.  Also, the musical instrument cited in Ch 1 is not the lyre but the ''kithara'', which was played in the drama while the kithara-player was dancing (in the chorus), even if that meant just walking in an appropriate way.  Moreover, epic might have had only literary exponents, but as Plato's ''Ion'' and Aristotle's Ch 26 of the ''Poetics'' help prove, for Plato and Aristotle at least some epic rhapsodes used all three means of mimesis:  language, dance (as pantomimic gesture), and music (if only by chanting the words).&lt;ref name="Scott 2016b"&gt;Scott (2016b)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Subjects
::Also "agents" in some translations. Aristotle differentiates between [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] throughout the work by distinguishing between the nature of the [[Character (arts)|human characters]] that populate either form. Aristotle finds that tragedy treats of serious, important, and virtuous people. Comedy, on the other hand, treats of less virtuous people and  focuses on human "weaknesses and foibles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Aristotle's Poetics|page= 270

|first= Stephen |last= Halliwell |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle introduces here the influential ''tripartite division of characters'' in superior (βελτίονας) to the audience, inferior (χείρονας), or at the same level (τοιούτους).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Michael Sifakis (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=9GfLAlkcFYgC&amp;pg=PA50 ''Aristotle on the function of tragic poetry''] p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Poetics 1448a, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1448a English], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0055%3Asection%3D1448a original Greek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]] (1957). ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Method
::One may imitate the agents through use of a narrator throughout, or only occasionally (using direct speech in parts and a narrator in parts, as Homer does), or only through direct speech (without a narrator), using actors to speak the lines directly.  This latter is the method of tragedy (and comedy): without use of any narrator.

Having examined briefly the field of "poetry" in general, Aristotle proceeds to his definition of tragedy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tragedy is a [[Mimesis|representation]] of a serious, complete action which has magnitude, in embellished speech, with each of its elements [used] separately in the [various] parts [of the play] and [represented] by people acting and not by [[Diegesis|narration]], accomplishing by means of pity and [[terror]] the [[catharsis]] of such emotions.

By "embellished speech", I mean that which has rhythm and melody, i.e. song. By "with its elements separately", I mean that some [parts of it] are accomplished only by means of spoken verses, and others again by means of song (1449b25-30).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 7). In Butcher's translation, this passage reads: "Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play, in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper [[catharsis]] of these emotions."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He then identifies the "parts" of tragedy:

* [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'')
::Refers to the "organization of incidents". It should imitate an action evoking pity and fear. The plot involves a change from bad towards good, or good towards bad. Complex plots have reversals and recognitions. These and suffering (or violence) are used to evoke the tragic emotions. The most tragic plot pushes a good character towards undeserved misfortune because of a mistake  (''[[hamartia]]''). Plots revolving around such a mistake are more tragic than plots with two sides and an opposite outcome for the good and the bad. Violent situations are most tragic if they are between friends and family. Threats can be resolved (best last) by being done in knowledge, done in ignorance and then discovered, almost be done in ignorance but be discovered in the last moment.

::Actions should be follow logically from the situation created by what has happened before, and from the character of the agent. This goes for recognitions and reversals as well, as even surprises are more satisfying to the audience if they afterwards are seen as a plausible or necessary consequence.

* [[Character (arts)|character]] (''[[ethos]]'')
::Character is the moral or ethical character of the agents. It is revealed when the agent makes moral choices. In a perfect tragedy, the character will support the plot, which means personal motivations and traits will somehow connect parts of the cause-and-effect chain of actions producing pity and fear. 
::Main character should be
::* good—Aristotle explains that audiences do not like, for example, villains "making fortune from misery" in the end. It might happen though, and might make the play interesting. Nevertheless, the moral is at stake here and morals are important to make people happy (people can, for example, see tragedy because they want to release their anger)
::* appropriate—if a character is supposed to be wise, it is unlikely he is young (supposing wisdom is gained with age)
::* consistent—if a person is a soldier, he is unlikely to be scared of blood (if this soldier is scared of blood it must be explained and play some role in the story to avoid confusing the audience); it is also "good" if a character doesn't change opinion "that much" if the play is not "driven" by who characters are, but by what they do (audience is confused in case of unexpected shifts in behaviour [and its reasons and morals] of characters)
::* "consistently inconsistent"—if a character always behaves foolishly it is strange if he suddenly becomes smart. In this case it would be good to explain such change, otherwise the audience may be confused. If character changes opinion a lot it should be clear he is a character who has this trait, not a real life person - this is also to avoid confusion
* thought (''[[dianoia]]'')—spoken (usually) reasoning of human characters can explain the characters or story background
* diction (''[[Lexis (Aristotle)|lexis]]'')  Lexis is better translated according to some as "speech" or "language."  Otherwise, the relevant necessary condition stemming from ''logos'' in the definition (language) has no followup:  mythos (plot) could be done by dancers or pantomime artists, given Chs 1, 2 and 4, if the actions are structured (on stage, as drama was usually done), just like plot for us can be given in film or in a story-ballet with no words.&lt;ref name="Scott 2016b"/&gt;
::Refers to the quality of speech in tragedy. Speeches should reflect character, the moral qualities of those on the stage. The expression of the meaning of the words.
* melody (''melos'')  "Melos" can also mean "music-dance" as some musicologists recognize, especially given that its primary meaning in ancient Greek is "limb" (an arm or a leg).  This is arguably more sensible because then Aristotle is conveying what the chorus actually did.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2016a and 2016b&lt;/ref&gt;
::The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors. It should be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action. Should be contributed to the unity of the plot. It is a very real factor in the pleasure of the drama. 
* spectacle (''[[opsis]]'')
::Refers to the visual apparatus of the play, including set, costumes and props (anything you can see). Aristotle calls spectacle the "least artistic" element of tragedy, and the "least connected with the work of the poet (playwright). For example: if the play has "beautiful" costumes and "bad" acting and "bad" story, there is "something wrong" with it. Even though that "beauty" may save the play it is "not a nice thing".

He offers the earliest-surviving explanation for the origins of tragedy and comedy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anyway, arising from an [[Improvisation|improvisatory]] beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the [[dithyramb]], and comedy from the leaders of the [[phallic processions]] which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities) [...] (1449a10-13)&lt;ref&gt;
Janko (1987, 6). This text is [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a available online] in an older translation, in which the same passage reads: "At any rate it originated in improvisation—both tragedy itself and [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]. The one tragedy came from the prelude to the dithyramb and the other comedy from the prelude to the [[Fertility rite|phallic songs]] which still survive as institutions in many cities."
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Poetique Aristote Arabe 2346.jpg|thumbnail|Arabic translation of the ''Poetics'' by [[Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus|Abū Bishr Mattā]].]]
The Arabic version of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' that influenced the [[Middle Ages]] was translated from a Greek manuscript dated to some time prior to the year 700. This manuscript, translated from Greek to Syriac, is independent of the currently-accepted 11th-century source designated ''Paris 1741.''  The [[Syriac language | Syriac-language]] source used for the Arabic translations departed widely in vocabulary from the original ''Poetics'' and it initiated a misinterpretation of Aristotelian thought that continued through the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Hardison, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paris 1741'' appears online at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (National Library of France).&lt;ref&gt;To obtain it on images or on a pdf format, follow this route: &gt; http://www.bnf.fr/; &gt; COLLECTIONS ET SERVICES; &gt; Catalogues; &gt; Accès à BnF archives et manuscrits; &gt; Collections; &gt; Département des Manuscrits; &gt; Grec; &gt; Manuscrits grecs - Présentation du fonds. &gt; Grec 1741 &gt; Download Images or pdf. The Poetics begins at 184r, page 380 of the pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic scholars who published significant commentaries on Aristotle's ''Poetics'' included [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Averroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition|pages= 15–16

The cup is manufactured in England. Brooks is marketing the pokito cup though his company, Pocket Enterprises UK, and has completed a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to fund initial production. The Pokito Kickstarter campaign is in the top 1% of all time Kickstarter campaigns. 

The cup adjusts to three sizes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/11/is-creating-a-reusable-coffee-cup-a-planet-saver-or-a-mugs-game-wells.html "Is creating a reusable coffee cup a planet saver or a mug's game?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3602">In psychology, the '''positivity offset''' is a phenomenon where people tend to interpret neutral situations as mildly positive, and rate their lives as good, most of the time. The positivity offset stands in notable asymmetry to the [[negativity bias]].

==In perception==
[[Social neuroscience]] researcher [[John Cacioppo]] has assembled evidence that people typically see their surroundings as positive, whenever a clear threat is not present. Because of the positivity offset, people are motivated to explore and engage with their surroundings, instead of being balanced inactive between approach and avoidance.&lt;ref name=Cacioppo1999/&gt;

==In life satisfaction==
Across most cultures, nations, and groups of people, the [[average]] and [[median]] ratings of [[life satisfaction]] are not neutral, as one might expect, but mildly positive.

Groups of people who do not show a positivity offset include people with [[Clinical depression|depression]], people in severe [[poverty]], and people who live in perpetually threatening situations. However, many groups of people that outsiders would not expect{{Says who|date=July 2011}} to show the positivity offset do, such as people with [[paraplegia]] and [[spinal injury]], very [[elderly]] people, and people with many [[chronic illness]]es. In some cases these individuals never become as satisfied or happy with their lives as before their illness or injury, but over time (generally approximately two years), they still stabilize at a level substantially above neutral. That is, they judge themselves overall as satisfied or happy and not dissatisfied or unhappy.&lt;ref name="Lucas2007"/&gt;

Many of the major psychological publications on life satisfaction ratings have come from [[Ed Diener]] and colleagues.&lt;ref name="Diener1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diener2004"/&gt; This empirical work gathered life-satisfaction judgments from many modern and traditional cultures worldwide.

[[File:A day panorama - digital art.jpg|333px|right|thumb|The present is a moment in time discernible as intermediate between [[past]] and [[future]].]]

The '''present''' (or '''here and now''') is the [[time]] that is associated with the events [[perception|perceived]] directly and in the first time,&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, E. C., &amp; Carus, P. (1890).  [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ The Monist]. La Salle, Ill. [etc.]: Published by Open Court for the Hegeler Institute. page 443.&lt;/ref&gt; not as a recollection (perceived more than once) or a speculation (predicted, hypothesis, uncertain). It is a period of time between the [[past]] and the [[future]], and can vary in meaning from being an instant to a day or longer. In [[radiocarbon dating]], the "present" is [[Before Present|defined as AD 1950]].

It is sometimes represented as a [[hyperplane]] in [[space-time]],&lt;ref&gt;Sattig, T. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=qYNv2zpHOmwC The language and reality of time]. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; typically called "now", although modern physics demonstrates that such a hyperplane cannot be defined uniquely for observers in relative motion. The present may also be viewed as a duration (see ''[[specious present]]'').&lt;ref name="JamesW"&gt;James, W. (1893). [https://books.google.com/books?id=JLcAAAAAMAAJ The principles of psychology]. New York: H. Holt and Company. Page 609.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodder, A. (1901). The adversaries of the sceptic; or, The specious present, a new inquiry into human knowledge.

[[Contemporary history]] describes the [[historical]] [[timeframe]] that is immediately relevant to the present time and is a certain perspective of [[modern history]].

===Philosophy of time===
{{main article|Philosophy of time}}

"The present" raises the question: "How is it that all sentient beings experience ''now'' at the same time?"&lt;ref&gt;McInerney, Peter K. (1992). ''Time and Experience.'' Temple University Press. p. 44. {{ISBN|978-1-56639-010-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no logical reason why this should be the case and no easy answer to the question.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===In Buddhism===
[[Buddhism]] and many of its associated [[paradigm]]s emphasize the importance of living in the present moment — being fully aware of what is happening, and not dwelling on the [[past]] or worrying about the [[future]].&lt;ref&gt;Hạnh, Thích Nhất (1990). ''Our appointment with life: the Buddha's teaching on living in the present.'' Parallax Press. p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0-938077-36-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that they encourage [[hedonism]], but merely that constant focus on one's current position in space and time (rather than future considerations, or past reminiscence) will aid one in relieving suffering. They teach that those who live in the present moment are the happiest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = What the Buddha Taught |last = Rahula |first = Walpola |authorlink = Walpola Rahula |year = 1974 |publisher = Grove Press |isbn = 9780802130310 |page = 72 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_WduwVbiLSsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=what+the+buddha+taught&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate = 2010-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Buddhist meditation|meditative]] techniques aim to help the practiser live in the present moment.
{{See also|Mindfulness (Buddhism)#Examples from contemplative and daily life}}

=== Christianity and eternity ===
Christianity views [[God]] as being outside of time and, from the divine perspective past, present and future are actualized in the now of [[eternity]]. This trans-temporal conception of God has been proposed as a solution to the problem of divine foreknowledge (i.e. how can God know what we will do in the future without us being determined to do it) since at least [[Boethius]].&lt;ref&gt;Consolatio Philosophae, Bk. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] offers the metaphor of a watchman, representing God, standing on a height looking down on a valley to a road where past present and future, represented by the individuals and their actions strung out along its length, are all visible simultaneously to God.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Austin. [http://atheism.about.com/od/whatisgod/a/eternal.htm God is Eternal – Timeless vs. Everlasting]. [[About.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, God's knowledge is not tied to any particular date.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, William; White, Mark D. (2009). ''Watchmen and Philosophy: A Rorschach Test.'' John Wiley and Sons. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical science==

===Special relativity===

[[Image:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|A visualisation of the present (dark blue plane) and past and future [[light cone]]s in 2D space.]] The original intent of the diagram on the right was to portray a 3-dimensional object having access to the past, present, and future in the present moment (4th dimension).{{clarify|date=March 2015}}
It [[Logical consequence|follows from]] [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Special relativity|Special Theory of Relativity]] that there is [[Relativity of simultaneity|no such thing as absolute simultaneity]]. When care is taken to [[Operational definition|operationalise]] "the present", it follows that the events that can be labeled as "simultaneous" with a given event, can not be in [[Causality (physics)|direct cause-effect relationship]]. Such collections of events are perceived differently by different observers. Instead, when focusing on "now" as the events [[perception|perceived]] directly, not as a recollection or a speculation, for a given observer "now" takes the form of the observer's past [[light cone]]. The light cone of a given event is objectively defined as the collection of events in [[Causality (physics)|causal relationship]] to that event, but each event has a different associated light cone. One has to conclude that in relativistic models of physics there is no place for "the present" as an absolute element of reality. Einstein phrased this as: ''"People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion"''.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Einstein to the family of his lifelong friend [[Michele Besso]], after learning of his death, (March 1955) as quoted in ''Science and the Search for God: Disturbing the Universe'' (1979) by [[Freeman Dyson]], Ch. 17, "A Distant Mirror", &lt;!--p. 193--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/einsteinsgod/unheardcuts.shtml |title = Einstein's God (NPR) |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080105183119/http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/einsteinsgod/unheardcuts.shtml |archive-date = 5 January 2008 |access-date = 31 March 2018 |work = [[Speaking of Faith]] |last = Tippett |first = Krista |author-link = Krista Tippett |publisher = [[American Public Media]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===

In [[physical cosmology]], the present time in the [[chronology of the universe]] is estimated at 13.8 billion years after the [[Big Bang|singularity]] determining the [[arrow of time]].  
In terms of the [[metric expansion of space]], it is in the [[dark-energy-dominated era]], after the universe's matter content has become diluted enough for metric expansion to be dominated by [[vacuum energy]] ([[dark energy]]).  It is also in the universe's [[Stelliferous Era]], after enough time for [[supercluster]]s to have formed (at about 5 billion years), but before the [[accelerating expansion of the universe]] has removed the local supercluster beyond the [[cosmological horizon]] (at about 150 billion years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Krauss |first1 = Lawrence M. |last2 = Starkman |first2 = Glenn D. |year = 2000 |title = Life, the Universe, and Nothing: Life and Death in an Ever-expanding Universe |journal = Astrophysical Journal |volume = 531 |issue = 1 |pages = 22–30 |doi = 10.1086/308434 |bibcode = 2000ApJ...531...22K |arxiv = astro-ph/9902189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
In [[Grammar]], actions are classified according to one of the following twelve verb tenses: past ([[past]], [[Uses of English verb forms#Past progressive|past continuous]], [[past perfect]], or [[past perfect continuous]]), present ([[present]], [[present continuous]], [[present perfect]], or [[present perfect continuous]]), or future ([[future]], [[future continuous]], [[future perfect]], or [[future perfect continuous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present tense refers to things that are currently happening or are always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the sentence, "she walks home everyday," the verb "walks" is in the present tense because it refers to an action that is regularly occurring in the present circumstances.

Verbs in the present continuous tense indicate actions that are currently happening and will continue for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sentence, "she is walking home," the [[verb phrase]] "is walking" is in the present continuous tense because it refers to a current action that will continue until a certain endpoint (when "she" reaches home). Verbs in the present perfect tense indicate actions that started in the past and is completed at the time of speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Merriam-Webster |title=Present Perfect |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/present%20perfect |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=27 July 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the sentence, "She has walked home," the verb phrase "has walked" is in the present perfect tense because it describes an action that began in the past and is finished as of the current reference to the action. Finally, verbs in the present perfect continuous tense refer to actions that have been continuing up until the current time, thus combining the characteristics of both the continuous and perfect tenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a present perfect continuous verb phrase can be found in the sentence, "she has been walking this route for a week now," where "has been walking" indicates an action that was happening continuously in the past and continues to happen continuously in the present.

'''Psychological torture''' is a type of [[torture]] that relies primarily on [[psychological]] effects, and only secondarily on any physical harm inflicted. Although not all psychological torture involves the use of physical violence, there is a continuum between psychological torture and physical torture. The two are often used in conjunction with one another, and often overlap in practice, with the fear and [[pain]] induced by physical torture often resulting in long-term psychological effects, and many forms of psychological torture involving some form of pain or coercion.

The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (commonly known as the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]]) is an [[International human rights instruments |international human rights treaty]], under the review of the [[United Nations]], that aims to prevent [[torture]] and other acts of [[cruel and unusual punishment |cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment]] around the world. The Convention requires states to take effective measures to prevent torture in any state under their [[jurisdiction]], and forbids states to transport people to any country where there is reason to believe torture could occur.&lt;ref&gt; [http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf "White Paper "The Rule of Law and Psychological Torture: Absence of a Legal Defininion, Prospects and Problem", in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform"], edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the Convention was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 December 1984&lt;ref name="untc"&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection: [http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]. Retrieved on 13 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and, following ratification by the 20th state party, it came into force on 26 June 1987. 26 June is now recognized as the [[International Day in Support of Victims of Torture]], in honor of the Convention. As of May 2015, the Convention has 158 state parties.

The Convention gave for the first time in history a definition of psychological torture:

{{quote|Torture is any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx|title=Convention against Torture|date=10 December 1984|work=[[United Nations Human Rights Council]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Optional Protocol to such Convention (OPCAT, 2006) is an important addition to the United Nations Convention. The Committee Against Torture (CAT) is a body of independent experts that monitors implementation of the Convention by State parties. All State parties are obliged under the Convention to submit regular reports to the CAT on how the rights are being implemented. Upon ratifying the Convention, States must submit a report within one year, after which they are obliged to report every four years. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations". Under certain circumstances, the CAT may consider complaints or communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Convention have been violated. The CAT usually meets in May and November each year in Geneva.

Many forms of psychological torture methods attempt to destroy the subject's normal [[self-image]] by removing them from any kind of control over their environment, creating a state of [[learned helplessness]], [[psychological regression]] and [[depersonalization]]. Other techniques include forced [[nudity]] and [[head shaving]], [[sleep deprivation]], [[hooding]] and other forms of [[sensory deprivation]].

A strictly fear-inducing method is the [[mock execution]]. Various threats operate on the same fear-inducing principle.

Another method is indirect torture, in which a victim is forced to witness the torture of another person, often a loved one. This preys on the victim's affection for and loyalty to a partner, relative, friend, comrade-in-arms etc, whose real pain induces vicarious suffering in the targeted psychological victim, who is thus loaded with guilt but spared physical harm that might affect his or her ability to comply.

While psychological torture may not leave any lasting physical damage—indeed, this is often one of the motivations for using psychological rather than physical torture—it can result in similar levels of permanent mental damage to its victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11313-psychological-torture-as-bad-as-physical-torture.html|title=Psychological torture 'as bad as physical torture'|author=Roxanne Khamsi|publisher=New Scientist|date=5 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been alleged that some psychological torture methods may have been devised by, or in conjunction with, doctors and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2008/02/psychological_tortur.html|title=Psychological torture: a CIA history|publisher=Mind Hacks|date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] has been accused of making extensive use of psychological torture techniques at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] and other sites subsequent to the [[9/11]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;John Hickman. 2013.

'''{{lang|la|Reductio ad Hitlerum}}''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɪ|t|l|ər|əm}}; pseudo-Latin for "reduction to Hitler"; sometimes '''''argumentum ad Hitlerum''''', "argument to Hitler", '''{{lang|la|ad Nazium}}''', "to Nazism"), or '''playing the Nazi card''', is an attempt to invalidate someone else's position on the basis that the same view was held by [[Adolf Hitler]] or the [[Nazi Party]],&lt;ref name="University of Oklahoma"/&gt; for example: "Hitler was against tobacco smoking, X is against tobacco smoking, therefore X is a Nazi".

Coined by [[Leo Strauss]] in 1953, {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} borrows its name from the term used in logic, {{lang|la|[[reductio ad absurdum]]}} (reduction to the absurd).&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, ''Natural Right and History''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965 [1953], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Strauss, {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} is a form of {{lang|la|[[ad hominem]]}}, {{lang|la|[[argumentum ad misericordiam|ad misericordiam]]}}, or a {{lang|la|[[Ignoratio elenchi|fallacy of irrelevance]]}}. The suggested rationale is one of [[association fallacy|guilt by association]]. It is a tactic often used to derail arguments, because such comparisons tend to distract and anger the opponent, as Hitler and Nazism have been condemned in the modern world.&lt;ref name="FallacyFiles1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adnazium.html|title=Logical Fallacy: The Hitler Card|work=Fallacy Files|year=2004|last=Curtis|first=Gary N.|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fallacious nature==
{{lang|la|Reductio ad Hitlerum}} is a form of [[association fallacy]].&lt;ref name="FallacyFiles1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FallacyFiles2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/guiltbya.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Guilt by Association|work=Fallacy Files|year=2004|last=Curtis|first=Gary N.|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is that a policy leads to {{ndash}} or is the same as {{ndash}} one advocated or implemented by [[Adolf Hitler]] or the [[Third Reich]] and so "proves" that the original policy is undesirable.

Another instance of {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} is asking a question of the form "You know who else...?" with the deliberate intent of impugning a certain idea or action by implying Hitler held that idea or performed such action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ask.metafilter.com/71925/You-know-who-else-Origin |title=You know who else ___? Origin? - catchphrase meme |publisher=Ask MetaFilter |date= |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An invocation of Hitler or Nazism is not a {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} when it illuminates the argument instead of causing distraction from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Gabriel H. Teninbaum}}, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1445423 ''Reduction ad Hitlerum'': Trumping the Judicial Nazi Card]. Michigan State Law Review, Vol. 2009, p. 541-578, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The phrase {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} is first known to have been used in an article written by [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Leo Strauss]] for ''Measure: A Critical Journal'' in spring 1951;&lt;ref name="Hutchins1951"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchins|first=Robert Maynard|title=Measure: A Critical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6z3WAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 February 2014|year=1951|publisher=H. Regnery Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was made famous in a book by the same author published in 1953&lt;ref name="University of Oklahoma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.edu/cas/psc/bookstrauss.htm |title=Natural Right and History|work=University of Oklahoma|year=2008|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natural Right and History'', Chapter II:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In following this movement towards its end we shall inevitably reach a point beyond which the scene is darkened by the shadow of Hitler. Unfortunately, it does not go without saying that in our examination we must avoid the fallacy that in the last decades has frequently been used as a substitute for the {{lang|la|reductio ad absurdum}}: the {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}}. A view is not refuted by the fact that it happens to have been shared by Hitler.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase was derived from the legitimate [[logical argument]] called {{lang|la|reductio ad absurdum}}. The {{lang|la|argumentum}} variant takes its form from the names of many classic fallacies, such as {{lang|la|argumentum ad hominem}}. The {{lang|la|ad Nazium}} variant may be further derived, humorously, from {{lang|la|[[Ad nauseam|argumentum ad nauseam]]}}.

In 2000, [[Thomas Fleming (political writer)|Thomas Fleming]] described its use against traditional values:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Leo Strauss called it the {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}}. If Hitler liked neoclassical art, that means that classicism in every form is Nazi; if Hitler wanted to strengthen the German family, that makes the traditional family (and its defenders) Nazi; if Hitler spoke of the "nation" or the "folk", then any invocation of nationality, ethnicity, or even folkishness is Nazi ...&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fleming, editor, ''Chronicles'' (Rockford, Illinois), May 2000, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Limits to classification as a fallacy==
Some historians studying [[the Holocaust]] argue that not all comparisons to Hitler and Nazism are logical fallacies since if they all were, there would be nothing to learn from the events that led to the Holocaust. That would undermine the entire significance of studying the Holocaust to avoid future [[genocide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://search.proquest.com/openview/8690dfba45e051dab6cbf8b92ef45f3b/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=589 Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust], Daniel Jonah Goldhagen 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Eichmann was Outrageously Stupid". Hannah Arendt: The Last Interview: And Other Conversations. November 9, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of this point do make distinctions between many different categories of comparison(s) to Hitler, some of which are fallacies, some of which are not, and some of which may or may not be fallacies. This approach is also critical to strict refusal to acknowledge similarities to the Holocaust, since there were early stages leading up to it and policies today can be comparable to those without being comparable to the "final solution". Advocates of this approach argue that such early stages are those where something can really be done about it, before it is too late.&lt;ref name="Y. Michael Barilan, 2004"&gt;Y. Michael Barilan, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Categories include:
* Similarities that are not in any way related to political or institutional decision making, e.g. going on walks or wearing expensive clothes. These are invariably fallacies when used as arguments.
* Similarities that are related to politics, in the absence of centralized power. This example usually refers to political party and movements still struggling to gain power. These similarities can only be to early stages of Nazism, not to a full-blown organized genocide. These comparisons may or may not be fallacies: a detailed analysis of methods, decision-making and ideology is necessary to determine that.
* Pointing out that Hitler did some things that are often considered to be related to being good in the context of criticizing psychological assumptions of them being connected, without implying that anyone doing them are like Hitler in other ways. E.g. that Hitler's engagement for animal protection shows that treatment of animals is divorced from treatment of humans, not implying a negative connection but mere non-connection. This is not an example of the fallacy, though not directly related to the study of organized genocide either.
* Pointing out that the Nazis believed in some things that are often thought to be protection from persecution within the context of rejecting assumptions about connections between concepts and tolerance. For example, that the Nazis believed [[homosexuality]] to be innate and, far from tolerating it, extended their [[homophobia]] to relatives as well, just to show that ideas on origin of a behavior (in this case homosexuality, but also applicable to other things) is unrelated to tolerance of said behavior and not implying that an idea is Nazi-like. This is not a fallacy. It does not show what should be done to prevent repetition, but it narrows it down by eliminating irrelevancies.
* Pointing out similarities between the Nazi [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] and modern chain of command as a risk factor for genocide shared between Nazi and modern society in general without applying it to individuals specifically, e.g. that administrative and military laws are significant risk factors. It does not imply advocacy of a repetition of the [[Nuremberg trials]] to those who only follow orders/obey laws, partly since referring to that trial as a source of authority would promote the [[death penalty]] exactly as much as "superior orders is no defense" and partly since forcing individual executioners into a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation is ineffective for preventing organized genocides like the Holocaust. Instead, it is criticism of structures and laws that lead to dangerous officiousness. This is not a fallacy. It is relevant for genocide studies.&lt;ref name="Y. Michael Barilan, 2004"/&gt;

===Antecedents===
Although named for and formalized around Hitler, the logical fallacy existed prior to the [[Second World War]]. There were other individuals from history who were used as stand-ins for pure evil.&lt;ref name=palmer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/briefing/explainer/2011/10/hank_williams_jr_firing_who_was_the_rhetorical_worst_person_in_h.html |title=Before Hitler, Who Was the Stand-In for Pure Evil? |work=Slate |author=Brian Palmer |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh of the Book of Exodus]] was commonly seen as the most villainous person in history.&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; In the years prior to the Civil War, abolitionists referred to slaveholders as modern-day Pharaohs. After [[VE Day]], Pharaoh continued to appear in the speeches of social reformers like [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; [[Judas Iscariot]] and [[Pontius Pilate]] were also commonly held up as pure evil. However, there was no universal Hitler-like person and different regions and times used different stand-ins.&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; In the years after the [[American Revolution]], [[King George III]] was often vilified in the United States. [[Andrew Jackson]] was also called [[King Andrew the First]]. During the Civil War, some Southerners spoke of Lincoln in Hitler-like terms. Some Confederates even called Lincoln a "modern Pharaoh".&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt;

==Invocations==
In 1991, Michael André Bernstein alleged {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} over a full-page advertisement placed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by the [[Lubavitch]] community, following the [[Crown Heights Riot]], under the heading "This Year ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' Took Place on August 19th Right Here in Crown Heights." [[Henry Schwarzschild]], who had witnessed ''Kristallnacht'', wrote to the ''New York Times'' that "however ugly were the anti-Semitic slogans and the assaultive behavior of people in the streets [during the Crown Heights riots]... one thing that clearly did not take place was a ''Kristallnacht''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=The Lubavitcher community itself, in the form of the 'Crown Heights Emergency Fund,' placed a full-page advertisement in ''The New York Times'' on September 20, 1991, under the heading 'This Year Kristallnacht Took Place on August 19th Right Here in Crown Heights.' Their version of Leo Strauss's {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}} was rightly perceived by those who had been in Germany on Kristallnacht (November 9, 1938) as an outrageous comparison.|url=http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft3x0nb2ns|title=Foregone Conclusions|publisher=Escholarship.org|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American conservative radio and television host [[Glenn Beck]] is often criticized for his frequent use of {{lang|la|reductio ad Hitlerum}}, including a controversial statement comparing the victims of the [[2011 Norway attacks]] to members of the [[Hitler Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/07/26/glenn-beck-site-of-norway-massacre-sounds-like-the-hitler-youth/|title=Glenn Beck: Site of Norway Massacre 'Sounds like the Hitler Youth'|work=Time|date=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck has also compared the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to [[Joseph Goebbels]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Glenn Beck Show'', November 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]] to Hitler's [[Sturmabteilung|"Brown Shirts"]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Glenn Beck Show'', May 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The American Conservative]]'' accused [[Jonah Goldberg]]'s book ''[[Liberal Fascism]]'' of employing the {{lang|la|reductio}} fallacy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That Nazism and contemporary liberalism both promote healthy living is as meaningless a finding as that [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|bloody marys]] and [[martini (cocktail)|martinis]] may both be made with [[gin]]. Repeatedly, Goldberg fails to recognize a {{lang|la|reductio ad absurdum}}. ... In no case does Goldberg uncover anything more ominous than a coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/goldbergs-trivial-pursuit/|title=Goldberg's Trivial Pursuit|author=Austin Bramwell|date=January 28, 2008|work=The American Conservative|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Retrocausality''' or '''Backwards causation''' is a concept of [[cause and effect]] where the effect precedes its cause in time,&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt; so a later event in time can affect an earlier event in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barry|first1=Patrick|title=What's done is done…|journal=New Scientist|date=September 2006|volume=191|issue=2571|pages=36–39|doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(06)60613-1|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg19125710.900-whats-done-is-done-or-is-it.html|accessdate=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[quantum physics]], the distinction between cause and effect is not made at the most fundamental level, so [[T-symmetry|time-symmetric]] systems can be viewed as causal or retro-causal.&lt;ref name="Sheehan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheehan|first1=Daniel P.|title=Frontiers of Time: Retrocausation - Experiment and Theory; San Diego, California, 20-22 June 2006|date=2006|publisher=American Institute of Physics|location=Melville, New York|isbn=978-0735403611}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Philosophical considerations about the nature of time and causality often involve [[time travel]] and address the same issues as retrocausality, as do treatments of the subject in fiction, but the two terms are not universally synonymous.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Faye, Jan |title=Backward Causation |journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-backwards/ |date=2001-08-27|accessdate=2006-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason#Proposed proofs of universal validity}}
Philosophical efforts to understand causality extend back at least to [[Aristotle]]'s discussions of the [[four causes]]. It was long considered that an effect preceding its cause is an inherent self-[[contradiction]] because, as 18th century philosopher [[David Hume]] discussed, when examining two related events, the cause, by definition, is the one that precedes the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beauchamp|first1=Tom L.|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Alexander|title=Hume and the Problem of Causation|date=1981|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=9780195202366|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

In the 1950s, [[Michael Dummett]] wrote in opposition to such definitions, stating that there was no philosophical objection to effects preceding their causes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated27"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dummett|first1=A. E.|last2=Flew|first2=A.|title=Symposium: "Can An Effect Precede Its Cause?"|journal=Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume|date=11 July 1954|volume=28|issue=1|pages=27–62|doi=10.1093/aristoteliansupp/28.1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was rebutted by fellow philosopher [[Antony Flew]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated27"/&gt; and, later, by [[Max Black]]. Black's "bilking argument" held that retrocausality is impossible because the observer of an effect could act to prevent its future cause from ever occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Max|title=Why Cannot an Effect Precede Its Cause?|journal=Analysis|date=January 1956|volume=16|issue=3|page=49|doi=10.2307/3326929|jstor=3326929}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more complex discussion of how [[free will]] relates to the issues Black raised is summarized by [[Newcomb's paradox]]. [[Essentialist]] philosophers have proposed other theories, such as proposing the existence of "genuine causal powers in nature"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Brian|title=The Philosophy of Nature: A Guide to the New Essentialism|date=2002|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montréal|isbn=9780773524743}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} or by raising concerns about the role of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] in theories of causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beebee|first1=Helen|title=Hume on Causation|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415243391}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Physics==
The ability to affect the past is sometimes taken to suggest that causes could be negated by their own effects, creating a logical contradiction such as the [[grandfather paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krasnikov|first1=S. V.|title=Causality violation and paradoxes|journal=Physical Review D|date=15 March 1997|volume=55|issue=6|pages=3427–3430|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.3427|bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.3427K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradiction is not necessarily inherent to retrocausality or time travel; by limiting the initial conditions of time travel with consistency constraints, such paradoxes and others are avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Earman|first1=John|last2=Smeenk|first2=Christopher|last3=Wüthrich|first3=Christian|title=Do the laws of physics forbid the operation of time machines?|journal=Synthese|date=7 May 2008|volume=169|issue=1|pages=91–124|doi=10.1007/s11229-008-9338-2|issn=0039-7857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of modern physics, such as the hypothetical [[tachyon]] [[particle physics|particle]] and certain [[T-symmetry|time-independent]] aspects of [[quantum mechanics]], may allow particles or information to travel backward in time. Jan Faye of the [[University of Copenhagen]] has argued that logical objections to macroscopic time travel may not necessarily prevent retrocausality at other scales of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faye|first1=Jan|title=Logic and Causal Reasoning|date=1994|publisher=Akad.-Verl.|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3050025995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Even if such effects are possible, however, they may not be capable of producing effects different from those that would have resulted from normal causal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elitzur|first1=A.|last2=Dolev|first2=S.|last3=Kolenda|first3=N.|title=Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics?|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3540221883}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Feynmann Diagram Gluon Radiation.svg|300px|thumb|right|Time runs left to right in this [[Feynman diagram]] of [[electron–positron annihilation]]. When interpreted to include retrocausality, the electron (marked e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) was not destroyed, instead becoming the positron (e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and moving backward in time.]]
The [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]], proposed by [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and [[Richard Feynman]], uses retrocausality and a temporal form of [[destructive interference]] to explain the absence of a type of converging concentric [[wave]] suggested by certain solutions to [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John Archibald|last2=Feynman|first2=Richard Phillips|title=Interaction with the Absorber as the Mechanism of Radiation|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=1 April 1945|volume=17|issue=2–3|pages=157–181|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.17.157|bibcode=1945RvMP...17..157W}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advanced waves don't have anything to do with cause and effect: they are simply a different mathematical way to describe normal waves. The reason they were proposed is so that a charged particle would not have to act on itself, which, in normal classical electromagnetism, leads to an infinite self-force.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Huw|title=Time's Arrow &amp; Archimedes' Point: New Directions for the Physics of Time|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195117981|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Feynman, and earlier [[Ernst Stueckelberg]], proposed an interpretation of the [[positron]] as an electron moving backward in time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feynman|first1=R. P.|title=The Theory of Positrons|journal=Physical Review|date=15 September 1949|volume=76|issue=6|pages=749–759|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749|bibcode=1949PhRv...76..749F}}&lt;/ref&gt; reinterpreting the negative-energy solutions of the [[Dirac equation]]. Electrons moving backward in time would have a positive [[electric charge]]. Wheeler invoked this concept to explain the identical properties shared by all electrons, suggesting that "[[one-electron universe|they are all the same electron]]" with a complex, self-intersecting [[world line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |title=The Development of the Space-Time View of Quantum Electrodynamics |last=Feynman |first=Richard |date=1965-12-11 |location=Nobel Lecture |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html |accessdate=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoichiro Nambu]] later applied it to all production and [[annihilation]] of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that "the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nambu|first1=Y.|title=The Use of the Proper Time in Quantum Electrodynamics I|journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics|date=1 February 1950|volume=5|issue=1|pages=82–94|doi=10.1143/ptp/5.1.82|bibcode=1950PThPh...5...82N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backwards-in-time point of view is nowadays accepted as completely equivalent to other pictures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=Reply to "Comment to a paper of M. Villata on antigravity"|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|date=30 November 2011|volume=337|issue=1|pages=15–17|doi=10.1007/s10509-011-0940-2|arxiv=1109.1201|bibcode=2012Ap&amp;SS.337...15V}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it doesn't have anything to do with the macroscopic terms "cause" and "effect", which do not appear in a microscopic physical description.

===Relativity===
[[Closed timelike curve]]s, in which the [[world line]] of an object returns to its origin, arise from some [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions]] to the [[Einstein field equation]]. Although closed timelike curves do not appear to exist under normal conditions, extreme environments of [[spacetime]], such as a [[traversable wormhole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorne|first1=Kip S.|title=Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy|date=1995|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=978-0393312768}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} or the region near certain [[cosmic strings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gott|first1=John Richard|title=Time Travel in Einstein's Universe: The Physical Possibilities of Travel Through Time|date=2002|publisher=Mariner Books|location=Boston|isbn=978-0618257355|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} may allow their formation, implying a theoretical possibility of retrocausality. The [[exotic matter]] or [[topological defect]]s required for the creation of those environments have not been observed.  Furthermore, [[Stephen Hawking]] has suggested a mechanism he describes as the [[chronology protection conjecture]], which would destroy any such closed timelike curve before it could be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hawking|first1=S. W.|title=Chronology protection conjecture|journal=Physical Review D|date=15 July 1992|volume=46|issue=2|pages=603–611|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.46.603|bibcode=1992PhRvD..46..603H}}&lt;/ref&gt; These objections to the existence of closed timelike curves are not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Li-Xin|title=Must time machines be unstable against vacuum fluctuations?|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=1 September 1996|volume=13|issue=9|pages=2563–2568|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/13/9/019|bibcode=1996CQGra..13.2563L|arxiv=gr-qc/9703024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum physics===
Retrocausality is sometimes associated with the [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocal]] correlations that generically arise from [[quantum entanglement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rave|first1=M. J.|title=Interpreting Quantum Interference Using a Berry's Phase-like Quantity|journal=Foundations of Physics|date=22 October 2008|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1073–1081|doi=10.1007/s10701-008-9252-y|bibcode=2008FoPh...38.1073R}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the notable special case of the [[delayed choice quantum eraser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Backward Causation and the EPR Paradox |author=Wharton, William R. |date=1998-10-28 |url=https://arxiv.org/html/quant-ph/9810060 |accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, verifying nonlocal correlations requires ordinary subluminal communication: the [[no communication theorem]] prevents the superluminal transfer of information, and fundamental descriptions of matter and forces require the full framework of [[quantum field theory]] in which [[Minkowski space|spacelike]]-separated operators commute. Accounts of quantum entanglement that do not involve retrocausality emphasize how the experiments demonstrating these correlations can equally well be described from different reference frames, that disagree on which measurement is a "cause" versus an "effect", as necessary to be consistent with special relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Costa de Beauregard |first=Olivier |title=Time Symmetry and the Einstein Paradox |url=http://www.costa-de-beauregard.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/OCB-1977-5.pdf |journal=Il Nuovo Cimento |issue=42B |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Ellerman |url=http://www.ellerman.org/a-common-fallacy/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615211907/http://www.ellerman.org/a-common-fallacy/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-15 |title=A Common Fallacy in Quantum Mechanics: Why Delayed Choice Experiments do NOT imply Retrocausality |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description of such nonlocal quantum entanglements can be described in a way that is manifestly free of retrocausality if the states of the system is considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0103079 |title=Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Mechanics|journal=Found. Phys. Lett. ()|volume=14|issue=2001|pages=301–322|date= |last1= Rubin|first1=Mark A.|year=2001|bibcode = 2001quant.ph..3079R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing experiments by physicist [[John G. Cramer]] explore various proposed methods for nonlocal or retrocausal quantum communication, finding them all flawed and unable to transmit nonlocal signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Status of Nonlocal Quantum Communication Test|work=UW CENPA Annual Report 2013-14, Article 7.1|author=[[John G.

Retrocausality is also associated with the [[two-state vector formalism]] (TSVF) in quantum mechanics, where the present is characterised by quantum states of the past and the future taken in combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/~yakir/yahp/yh165.pdf |author1=Aharonov, Yakir |author2=Lev Vaidman |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Two-State Vector Formalism: An Updated Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tachyons===
Hypothetical [[faster-than-light|superluminal]] particles called [[tachyon]]s have a spacelike trajectory, and thus can appear to move backward in time, according to an observer in a conventional reference frames. Despite frequent depiction in [[science fiction]] as a method to send messages back in time, tachyons do not interact with normal [[Massive particle|tardyonic matter]] in a way that would violate standard causality. Specifically, the [[Feinberg reinterpretation principle]] means that ordinary matter cannot be used to make of a tachyon detector capable of receiving information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feinberg|first1=G.|title=Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Particles|journal=Physical Review|date=25 July 1967|volume=159|issue=5|pages=1089–1105|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.159.1089|bibcode=1967PhRv..159.1089F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parapsychology==
[[Parapsychology|Parapsychologist]] [[Helmut Schmidt (parapsychologist)|Helmut Schmidt]] presented quantum mechanical justifications for retrocausality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Helmut|title=Can an effect precede its cause?

In an experiment by psychologist [[Daryl Bem|Daryl J.

Subjects which identified as "stimulus-seeking" in the pre-screening questionnaire scored even higher — 57.6%.

In [[biology]], '''saltation''' (from [[Latin]], ''saltus'', "leap") is a sudden and large [[mutation]]al change from one generation to the next, potentially causing single-step [[speciation]]. This was historically offered as an [[alternative to Darwinism]]. Some forms of [[mutationism]] were effectively saltationist, implying large discontinuous jumps.

Speciation, such as by [[polyploidy]] in plants, can sometimes be achieved in a single and in evolutionary terms sudden step. Evidence is accumulating for various forms of saltation in a variety of organisms.

==History==
{{further|Alternatives to evolution by natural selection}}

Prior to [[Charles Darwin]] most evolutionary scientists had been saltationists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]. (1894). ''From the Greeks to Darwin: An outline of the development of the evolution idea''. New York, London, Macmillan and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] was a gradualist but similar to other scientists of the period had written that saltational evolution was possible. [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] endorsed a theory of saltational evolution that "monstrosities could become the founding fathers (or mothers) of new species by instantaneous transition from one form to the next."&lt;ref&gt;Benedikt Hallgrímsson, Brian K. Hall. (2011). ''Variation: A Central Concept in Biology''. Academic Press. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffroy wrote that environmental pressures could produce sudden transformations to establish new [[species]] instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler]]. (2003). ''Evolution: The History of an Idea''. University of California Press. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 [[Albert von Kölliker]] revived Geoffroy's theory that evolution proceeds by large steps, under the name of [[heterogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sewall Wright]]. (1984). ''Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations Volume 1''. University of Chicago Press. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 Charles Darwin had denied saltational evolution by writing that evolutionary transformation always proceeds gradually and never in jumps. Darwin insisted on slow accumulation of small steps in evolution and wrote "[[natural selection]] acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short steps". Darwin continued in this belief throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin]]. (1859). ''On the Origin of Species''. p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1860 to 1880 saltation had a minority interest but by 1890 had become a major interest to scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Radick. (2008). ''The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate about Animal Language''. University Of Chicago Press. p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; In their paper on evolutionary theories in the 20th century (Levit ''et al''. 2008) wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The advocates of saltationism deny the Darwinian idea of slowly and gradually growing divergence of character as the only source of evolutionary progress. They would not necessarily completely deny gradual variation, but claim that cardinally new ‘body plans’ come into being as a result of saltations (sudden, discontinuous and crucial changes, for example, the series of macromutations). The latter are responsible for the sudden appearance of new higher taxa including classes and orders, while small variation is supposed to be responsible for the fine adaptations below the species level.&lt;ref&gt;Levit, G. S, Meister, K. Hoßfeld, U. (2008). ''Alternative Evolutionary Theories: A Historical Survey''. Journal of Bioeconomics 10.1. pp. 71–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 20th century a mechanism of saltation was proposed as large [[mutation]]s. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo de Vries]], who along with [[Carl Correns]] helped rediscover [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of inheritance in 1900, [[William Bateson]], a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. Some of these geneticists developed it into the [[mutation theory]] of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=265–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=127–129, 157–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a debate over accounts of the [[evolution]] of [[mimicry]] and if they could be explained by gradualism or saltation. The geneticist [[Reginald Punnett]] supported a saltational theory in his book ''Mimicry in Butterflies'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Punnett]]. (1915). [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924003093162#page/n7/mode/2up ''Mimicry in Butterflies'']. Cornell University Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mutation theory of evolution held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. This mutationist view of evolution was later replaced by the reconciliation of [[Mendelian genetics]] with natural selection into a gradualistic framework for the neo-Darwinian synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler]]. (2003). ''Evolution: The History of an Idea''. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the emergence of population thinking in evolution which forced many scientists to adopt [[gradualism]] in the early 20th century. According to [[Ernst Mayr]], it wasn't until the development of [[population genetics]] in the neo-Darwinian synthesis in the 1940s that demonstrated the explanatory power of natural selection that saltational views of evolution were largely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr]]. (2007). ''What Makes Biology Unique?: Considerations on the Autonomy of a Scientific Discipline''. Cambridge University Press; 1 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Saltation was originally denied by the "[[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]" school of neo-Darwinism which favoured gradual evolution but has since been accepted due to recent evidence in [[evolutionary biology]] (see the [[Saltation (biology)#Current status|current status]] section).&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, R.

[http://www.biologydirect.com/content/4/1/46 ''Evolution by leaps: gene duplication in bacteria'']. Biology Direct 4: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years there are some prominent proponents of saltation, including [[Carl Woese]]. Woese, and colleagues, suggested that the absence of RNA signature continuum between [[domain (biology)|domains]] of [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukarya]] constitutes a primary indication that the three primary organismal lineages materialized via one or more major evolutionary saltations from some universal ancestral state involving dramatic change in cellular organization that was significant early in the evolution of life, but in complex organisms gave way to the generally accepted Darwinian mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, E., A. Sethi, J. Montoya, C.R. Woese and Z. Luthey-Schulten. (2008). [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/37/13953.full?sid=f3651397-00e9-4a57-802b-f41c6ef6cf5a ''Molecular signatures of ribosomal evolution'']. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 105: 13953–13958.&lt;/ref&gt; The geneticist [[Barbara McClintock]] introduced the idea of "[[Transposable element|jumping genes]]", chromosome transpositions that can produce rapid changes in the [[genome]].&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, B. (1984). ''The significance of responses of the genome to challenge''. Science Vol. 226, pp. 792-801.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saltational [[speciation]], also known as abrupt speciation, is the discontinuity in a lineage that occurs through genetic mutations, [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomal aberrations]] or other evolutionary mechanisms that cause reproductively isolated individuals to establish a new species population. [[Polyploid]]y, karyotypic fission, [[symbiogenesis]] and [[Horizontal gene transfer|lateral gene transfer]] are possible mechanisms for saltational speciation.&lt;ref&gt;Oladele Ogunseitan. (2004).

==Macromutation theory==
{{further|Mutationism}}

The botanist [[John Christopher Willis]] proposed an early saltationist theory of evolution. He held that species were formed by large mutations, not gradual evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Willis. (1923). ''The Origin of Species by Large, rather than by Gradual, Change, and by Guppy's Method of Differentiation''. Annals of Botany. Vol. 37, No. 148. pp. 605-628.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Beal. (1941). ''The Course of Evolution by J. C. Willis''. Botanical Gazette, Vol. 102, No. 3. p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German geneticist [[Richard Goldschmidt]] was the first scientist to use the term "hopeful monster". Goldschmidt thought that small gradual changes could not bridge the hypothetical divide between microevolution and macroevolution. In his book ''The Material Basis of Evolution'' (1940) he wrote "the change from species to species is not a change involving more and more additional atomistic changes, but a complete change of the primary pattern or reaction system into a new one, which afterwards may again produce intraspecific variation by micromutation." Goldschmidt believed the large changes in evolution were caused by macromutations (large mutations). His ideas about macromutations became known as the hopeful monster hypothesis which is considered a type of saltational evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Verne Grant. (1963). ''The Origin of Adaptations''. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldschmidt's thesis however was universally rejected and widely ridiculed within the biological community, which favored the [[neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] explanations of [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]], [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1982). "The uses of heresey; an introduction to Richard Goldschmidt's ''The Material Basis of Evolution''." [https://books.google.com/books?id=kAPLvAnp7KAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR13 pp. xiii-xlii]. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been a recent interest in the ideas of Goldschmidt in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] as some scientists are convinced he was not entirely wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Scott F. Gilbert. (2000). ''Developmental Biology'' Sinauer Associates; 6th edition. {{ISBN|0878932437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otto Schindewolf]], a German paleontologist, also supported macromutations as part of his evolutionary theory. He was known for presenting an alternative interpretation of the fossil record based on his ideas of [[orthogenesis]], saltational evolution and extraterrestrial impacts opposed to gradualism but abandoned the view of macromutations in later publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Schindewolf]]. (1969). ''Über den “Typus” in morphologischer und phylogenetischer Biologie''. Mainz: Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Søren Løvtrup]], a [[biochemist]] and [[embryologist]] from Denmark, advocated a similar hypothesis of macromutation to Goldschmidt's in 1974.&lt;ref name="Kathryn"&gt;Kathryn E. Hood, Carolyn Tucker Halpern and Gary Greenberg. (2010). ''Handbook of Developmental Science, Behavior, and Genetics''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Lovtrup believed that macromutations interfered with various [[epigenetic]] processes, that is, those which affect the causal processes in biological development. This is in contrast to the gradualistic theory of micromutations of [[Neo-Darwinism]], which claims that evolutionary innovations are generally the result of accumulation of numerous very slight modifications. Lovtrup also rejected the [[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]] of [[Stephen Jay Gould|Stephen Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]], claiming it was a form of gradualism and not a macromutation theory. Lovtrup defended many of Darwin's critics including Schindewolf, [[St. George Jackson Mivart|Mivart]], Goldschmidt, and Himmelfarb.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2O7iz2mGeSkC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=soren+lovtrup&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UcfRTZfoDMyVswbArJC4CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=soren%20lovtrup&amp;f=false Review of Lovtrup's book in the New Scientist, Oct 15, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mae Wan Ho]] described Lovtrup's theory as similar to the hopeful monster theory of [[Richard Goldschmidt]].&lt;ref name="Kathryn" /&gt;

Goldschmidt presented two mechanisms for how hopeful monsters might work. One mechanism, involved “systemic mutations”, rejected the classical [[gene]] concept and is no longer considered by modern science; however, his second mechanism involved “developmental macromutations” in “rate genes” or “controlling genes” that change early development and thus cause large effects in the adult phenotype. These kind of mutations are similar to the ones considered in contemporary [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Guenter Theissen. (2010). [http://www.palaeodiversity.org/pdf/03Suppl/Supplement_Theissen.pdf ''Homeosis of the angiosperm flower: Studies on three candidate cases of saltational evolution'']. Palaeodiversity 3, Supplement: 131-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of Goldschmidt [[Donald Prothero]] in his book ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters'' (2007) wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The past twenty years have vindicated Goldschmidt to some degree. With the discovery of the importance of regulatory genes, we realize that he was ahead of his time in focusing on the importance of a few genes controlling big changes in the organisms, not small-scales changes in the entire genome as neo-Darwinians thought. In addition, the hopeful monster problem is not so insurmountable after all. Embryology has shown that if you affect an entire population of developing embryos with a stress (such as a heat shock) it can cause many embryos to go through the same new pathway of embryonic development, and then they all become hopeful monsters when they reach reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Prothero]]. (2007). ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters''. Columbia University Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2008 evolutionary biologist [[Olivia Judson]] in her article ''The Monster Is Back, and It’s Hopeful'' listed some examples which may support the hopeful monster hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivia Judson]]. (2008). [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/the-monster-is-back-and-its-hopeful/ ''The Monster Is Back, and It’s Hopeful'']. The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; and an article published in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 2010 titled ''Evolution: Revenge of the Hopeful Monster'' reported that studies in stickleback populations in a British Columbia lake and [[bacteria]] populations in a Michigan lab have shown that large individual genetic changes can have vast effects on organisms "without dooming it to the evolutionary rubbish heap". According to the article "Single-gene changes that confer a large adaptive value do happen: they are not rare, they are not doomed and, when competing with small-effect mutations, they tend to win. But small-effect mutations still matter — a lot. They provide essential fine-tuning and sometimes pave the way for explosive evolution to follow."&lt;ref&gt;Tanguy Chouard. (2010). [http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100217/full/463864a.html ''Evolution: Revenge of the hopeful monster'']. Nature 463, 864-867.&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper by (Page ''et al.'' 2010) have written that the Mexican [[axolotl]] (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') could be classified as a hopeful monster as it exhibits an adaptive and derived mode of development that has evolved rapidly and independently among tiger salamanders. According to the paper there has been an interest in aspects of the hopeful monster hypothesis in recent years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Goldschmidt proposed that [[mutation]]s occasionally yield individuals within populations that deviate radically from the norm and referred to such individuals as "hopeful monsters". If the novel phenotypes of hopeful monsters arise under the right environmental circumstances, they may become fixed, and the population will found a new species. While this idea was discounted during the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|Modern synthesis]], aspects of the hopeful monster hypothesis have been substantiated in recent years. For example, it is clear that dramatic changes in phenotype can occur from few mutations of key developmental genes and phenotypic differences among species often map to relatively few [[genetics|genetic]] factors. These findings are motivating renewed interest in the study of hopeful monsters and the perspectives they can provide about the evolution of development. In contrast to mutants that are created in the lab, hopeful monsters have been shaped by [[natural selection]] and are therefore more likely to reveal mechanisms of adaptive evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B.

[[Günter Theißen]], a German professor of [[genetics]], has classified [[Homeosis|homeotic]] mutants as hopeful monsters and documented many examples of animal and plant lineages that may have originated as hopeful monsters.&lt;ref&gt;Guenter Theissen.

===Known mechanisms===

Examples of saltational evolution include cases of stabilized hybrids that can reproduce without crossing (such as [[allotetraploid]]s) and cases of [[symbiogenesis]]. Both [[gene duplication]] and [[Horizontal gene transfer|lateral gene transfer]] have the capacity to bring about relatively large changes that are saltational.&lt;ref&gt;Serres MH, Kerr AR, McCormack TJ, Riley M.

===Explanations===

Reviewing the history of macroevolutionary theories, the American evolutionary biologist [[Douglas J. Futuyma]] notes that since 1970, two very different alternatives to Darwinian gradualism have been proposed, both by [[Stephen Jay Gould]]: mutationism, and [[punctuated equilibria]].&lt;ref name=Futuyma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, S. J.]] (1980) Is a new and general theory of evolution emerging? Paleobiology 6:119–130&lt;/ref&gt; Gould's macromutation theory gave a nod to his predecessor with an envisaged "Goldschmidt break" between evolution within a species and speciation. His advocacy of Goldschmidt was attacked with "highly unflattering comments"&lt;ref name=Futuyma/&gt; by B. Charlesworth&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, B. (1982) "Hopeful monsters cannot fly". ''Paleobiology'' 8:469–474&lt;/ref&gt; and Templeton.&lt;ref&gt;Templeton, A. (1982) "Why read Goldschmidt?" ''Paleobiology'' 8:474–481&lt;/ref&gt; Futuyma concludes, following other biologists reviewing the field such as K.Sterelny&lt;ref&gt;Sterelny, K. (2000) "Development, evolution, and adaptation". ''Phil Sci (Proc)'' 67:S369–S387&lt;/ref&gt; and A. Minelli,&lt;ref&gt;Minelli, A. (2010) "Evolutionary developmental biology does not offer a significant challenge to the neo-Darwinian paradigm". In: Ayala FJ, Arp R (eds) ''Contemporary debates in philosophy of biology''. Wiley, Chichester, pp 213–226&lt;/ref&gt; that essentially all the claims of evolution driven by large mutations could be explained within the Darwinian evolutionary synthesis.&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book |last1=Futuyma |first1=Douglas J. |authorlink1=Douglas J.

{{Disability}}

The '''social model of disability''' is a reaction to the dominant [[medical model of disability]] which in itself is a functional analysis of the body as machine to be fixed in order to conform with normative values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paley|first=John|title=The Cartesian melodrama in nursing|journal=Nursing Philosophy|date=1 October 2002|volume=3|issue=3|pages=189–192|doi=10.1046/j.1466-769X.2002.00113.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social model of disability identifies systemic barriers, negative attitudes and exclusion by society (purposely or inadvertently) that mean society is the main contributory factor in disabling people. While [[Physiology|physical]], sensory, intellectual, or [[psychological]] variations may cause individual functional limitation or impairments, these do not have to lead to [[disability]] unless society fails to take account of and include people regardless of their individual differences. The origins of the approach can be traced to the 1960s; the specific term emerged from the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1980s.

==History==
In 1975, the UK organization [[Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation]] (UPIAS) claimed: "In our view it is society which disables physically impaired people. Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/UPIAS/fundamental%20principles.pdf |title=THE UNION OF THE PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED AGAINST SEGREGATION and THE DISABILITY ALLIANCE discuss Fundamental Principles of Disability |publisher=[[UPIAS]] |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/finkelstein/UPIAS%20Principles%202.pdf |title=Fundamental Principles of Disability - Comments on the discussion held between the Union and the Disability Alliance on 22nd November, 1975 |publisher=[[UPIAS]] |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1983, the disabled academic [[Mike Oliver (disability advocate)|Mike Oliver]] coined the phrase "social model of disability" in reference to these ideological developments.&lt;ref name="OliverSapey2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Oliver|author2=Bob Sapey|title=Social work with disabled people|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqiUQgAACAAJ|accessdate=23 October 2010|date=27 April 2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4039-1838-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver focused on the idea of an individual model (of which the medical was a part) versus a social model, derived from the distinction originally made between impairment and disability by the UPIAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/Oliver/in%20soc%20dis.pdf |author=MIKE OLIVER |title=THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL MODELS OF DISABILITY |publisher=leeds.ac.uk |date=23 July 1990 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "social model" was extended and developed by academics and activists in Australia, the UK, US and other countries, and extended to include all disabled people, including those who have [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]] / [[learning disabilities]] / or who are [[intellectually disabled]], or people with emotional, mental health or behavioural problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/education/teaching/disability/thinking/medical.html |title=Disabling Imagery? &amp;#124; Ways of thinking about disability: 'Medical Model' vs 'Social Model' &amp;#124; Learning resources&amp;#124; BFI |website=Old.bfi.org.uk |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodley|first=Dan|title='Learning Difficulties', the Social Model of Disability and Impairment: Challenging epistemologies|journal=Disability &amp; Society|date=1 March 2001|volume=16|issue=2|pages=207–231|doi=10.1080/09687590120035816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver did not intend the "social model of disability" to be an all encompassing theory of disability, rather a starting point in reframing how society views disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The social model of disability: thirty years on|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09687599.2013.818773|journal = Disability &amp; Society|pages = 1024–1026|volume = 28|issue = 7|doi = 10.1080/09687599.2013.818773|first = Mike|last = Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components and usage==

A fundamental aspect of the social model concerns equality. The struggle for equality is often compared to the struggles of other socially marginalized groups.  Equal rights are said to give empowerment and the "ability" to make decisions and the opportunity to live life to the fullest. A related phrase often used by disability rights campaigners, as with other [[social activism]], is "[[Nothing About Us Without Us]]."&lt;ref name="Charlton2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=James I. Charlton|title=Nothing about us without us: disability oppression and empowerment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohqff8DBt9gC|accessdate=23 October 2010|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22481-0|page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model of disability focuses on changes required in society. These might be in terms of:

*Attitudes, for example a more positive attitude toward certain mental traits or behaviors, or not underestimating the potential quality of life of those with impairments,
*Social support, for example help dealing with barriers; resources, aids or [[positive discrimination]] to overcome them, for example providing a buddy to explain work culture for an autistic employee,
*Information, for example using suitable formats (e.g. [[braille]]) or levels (e.g. simplicity of language) or coverage (e.g. explaining issues others may take for granted),
*Physical structures, for example buildings with sloped access and elevators, or
*Flexible work hours for people with [[circadian rhythm sleep disorders]] or, for example, for people who experience [[anxiety]]/[[panic attacks]] in rush hour traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/advice-and-guidance/your-rights/disability/disability-in-employment/examples-of-reasonable-adjustments-in-the-workplace/ |title=EHRC - Examples of reasonable adjustments in the workplace |publisher=Equalityhumanrights.com |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2012-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023033858/http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/advice-and-guidance/your-rights/disability/disability-in-employment/examples-of-reasonable-adjustments-in-the-workplace/ |archivedate=23 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model of disability implies that attempts to change, "fix" or "cure" individuals, especially when used against the wishes of the patient, can be discriminatory and prejudiced. This attitude, which may be seen as stemming from a medical model and a subjective value system, can harm the self-esteem and social inclusion of those constantly subjected to it (e.g. being told they are not as good or valuable, in an overall and core sense, as others). Some communities have actively resisted "treatments", while, for example, defending a unique culture or set of abilities. In the deaf community, sign language is valued even if most people do not know it and some parents argue against cochlear implants for deaf infants who cannot consent to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NASEO |url=http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.asp?I=261 |title=Sound from Silence - Sidebar - Cochlear Implan |work=Beyonddiscovery.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People diagnosed as being on the [[autism spectrum]] may argue against efforts to change them to be more like others. They argue instead for acceptance of [[neurodiversity]] and accommodation to different needs and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidel |first=Kathleen |url=http://www.neurodiversity.com/autistic_distinction.html |title=the autistic distinction |work=neurodiversity.com |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]] argue that they are just different and don't necessarily conform.  The [[biopsychosocial model]] of disease/disability is a holistic attempt by practitioners to address this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Engel|first=G.|title=The need for a new medical model: a challenge for biomedicine|journal=Science|date=8 April 1977|volume=196|issue=4286|pages=129–136|doi=10.1126/science.847460|pmid=847460|bibcode=1977Sci...196..129E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model implies that practices such as [[eugenics]] are founded on social values and a prejudiced understanding of the potential and value of those labeled disabled. "Over 200,000 disabled people were the first victims of the [[Holocaust]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/holocaust/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_other_victims/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_disabled___the_holocaust.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417064037/http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/holocaust/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_other_victims/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_disabled___the_holocaust.htm |date=17 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1986 article stated:  "It is important that we do not allow ourselves to be dismissed as if we all come under this one great metaphysical category 'the disabled'. The effect of this is a depersonalization, a sweeping dismissal of our individuality, and a denial of our right to be seen as people with our own uniqueness, rather than as the anonymous constituents of a category or group. These words that lump us all together -'the disabled', 'spina bifida', 'tetraplegic', 'muscular dystrophy’, - are nothing more than terminological rubbish bins into which all the important things about us as people get thrown away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brisenden|first=Simon|title=Independent Living and the Medical Model of Disability|journal=Disability, Handicap &amp; Society|date=1 January 1986|volume=1|issue=2|pages=173–178|doi=10.1080/02674648666780171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model of disability is based on a distinction between the terms "impairment" and "disability." Impairment is used to refer to the actual attributes (or lack of attributes), the abnormality, of a person, whether in terms of limbs, organs or mechanisms, including psychological. Disability is used to refer to the restrictions caused by society when it does not give equivalent attention and accommodation to the needs of individuals with impairments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/thomas%20pam/Defining%20Impairment%20within%20the%20Social%20Model%20of%20Disability.pdf |title=Defining Impairment within the Social Model of Disability |author1=Pam Thomas |author2=Lorraine Gradwell |author3=Natalie Markham |work=leeds.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model also relates to economics. It proposes that people can be disabled by a lack of resources to meet their needs. It addresses issues such as the under-estimation of the potential of people to contribute to society and add economic value to society, if given equal rights and equally suitable facilities and opportunities as others. Economic research on companies that attempt to accommodate disability in their workforce suggest they [[Return on Disability Index|outperform competitors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=8 September 2012|title=Disability and business: The new green |publisher=The Economist |access-date=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Autumn 2001, the UK Office for National Statistics identified that approximately one fifth of the working age population was disabled - 7.1 million disabled people as opposed to 29.8 million able people - and in this analysis also provided insight into some of the reasons why disabled people were unwilling to enter the labour market, such as that the reduction in disability benefits in entering the labour market would not make it worthwhile to enter into employment. A three-pronged approach was suggested: 
"incentives to work via the tax and benefit system, for example through the Disabled Person’s Tax Credit; helping people back into work, for example via the New Deal for Disabled People; and tackling discrimination in the workplace via anti-discrimination policy. Underpinning this are the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 and the Disability Rights Commission."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/labour_market_trends/People_with_disabilities_aug2002.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110074257/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/labour_market_trends/People_with_disabilities_aug2002.pdf |date=10 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and public policy==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|Disability Discrimination Act]] defines disability using the medical model - disabled people are defined as people with certain conditions, or certain limitations on their ability to carry out "normal day-to-day activities."  But the requirement of employers and service providers to make "reasonable adjustments" to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, follows the social model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/RightsAndObligations/DisabilityRights/DG_4001068 |title=Definition of disability under the Equality Act 2010 - GOV.UK |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By making adjustments, employers and service providers are removing the barriers that disable - according to the social model, they are effectively removing the person's disability. In 2006, amendments to the act called for local authorities and others to actively promote disability equality. This enforcement came in the shape of the Disability Equality Duty in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dotheduty.org/ |title=コアサーバーdotheduty.org |website=Dotheduty.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, The Disability Discrimination Act (1995) was amalgamated into the [[Equality Act 2010]] along with other pertinent discrimination legislation. It extends the law on discrimination to indirect discrimination. For example, if a carer of a person with a disability is discriminated against, this is now also unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/equality_act_2010.aspx |title=Home Office |publisher=Equalities |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since October 2010, when it came into effect, employers may not legally ask questions about illness or disability at interview for a job or for a referee to comment on such in a reference, except where there is a need to make reasonable adjustments for an interview to proceed. Following an offer of a job, an employer can lawfully ask such questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebottomlineonline.co.uk/pages/fullarticle.asp?id=222 |title=Previous Issues of The Bottom Line Online |publisher=Thebottomlineonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320201637/http://www.thebottomlineonline.co.uk/pages/fullarticle.asp?id=222 |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), revision of 2008  effective in January 2009, is a wide-ranging [[civil rights]] law that prohibits discrimination based on disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.pdf |format=PDF |title=AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990, AS AMENDED |website=Ada.gov |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which made discrimination based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[sex]], national origin, and other characteristics illegal. Certain specific conditions are excluded, such as [[alcoholism]] and [[transsexualism]].

In 2007, the [[European Court of Justice]] in the [[Chacon Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA]] court case, defined disability narrowly according to a [[medical model of disability|medical definition]] that excluded temporary illness, when considering the [[Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation]] (Council Directive 2000/78/EC). The directive did not provide for any definition of disability, despite discourse in policy documents previously in the EU about endorsing the social model of disability.  This allowed the Court of Justice to take a narrow medical definition.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

'''Sue Shelton White''' (May 25, 1887 &amp;ndash; May 6, 1943), called '''Miss Sue''', was a [[feminism|feminist]] leader and lawyer originally from [[Henderson, Tennessee|Henderson]], [[Tennessee]] who served as a national leader of the [[women's suffrage]] movement.
[[File:Sue S. White 158006v.jpg|thumb|Sue Shelton White circa 1920]]

== Background ==
Sue Shelton White was born on May 25, 1887, in Henderson, Tennessee, the second of three children of James Shelton White and Mary Calista (Swain) White. Her father, a lawyer and Methodist minister, died when she was nine. When her mother died four years later, White went to live with an aunt. When she was sixteen she took a teacher training course at Georgia Robertson Christian College (now [[Freed–Hardeman University|Freed Hardman University]]) and the following year (1904-1905) attended West Tennessee Business College.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00008|title=White, Sue Shelton, 1887-1943.

== Suffragist ==
White eventually became the recording secretary of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association, and the Tennessee state chair of the National Woman's Party.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

White joined the woman suffrage movement in 1912. She was originally active in the moderate Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association (an affiliate of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]]), and was elected [[Secretary (club)|recording secretary]] for that organization in 1913,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/08/25/unveiling-suffrage-womens-equality-day/89309856/|title=Unveiling suffrage on Women’s Equality Day|newspaper=The Jackson Sun|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but gradually concluded that [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]]' more radical [[National Woman's Party]], whose speaking tour through Tennessee by [[Maud Younger]] she had helped facilitate, was advocating policies and methods which would be more effective. She joined the NWP in 1918, became chair of the Tennessee chapter, and moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where she edited the organization's newspaper, ''The Suffragist''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With other members of the NWP, White drew national attention when on February 19, 1919, they held the latest of their [[Silent Sentinels]] series of demonstrations in front of the [[White House]] and burned a paper effigy of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (which White herself dropped into the fire) to protest Wilson's lack of energy in pressuring balky Senators of his own party. White, with others, was arrested and jailed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyaxYvSG6gAC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=Sue+Shelton+White&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBt7uc-qLQAhWGWCYKHdRfCVYQ6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Sue%20Shelton%20White&amp;f=false|title=After the Vote Was Won: The Later Achievements of Fifteen Suffragists|last=Adams|first=Katherine H.|last2=Keene|first2=Michael L.|date=2010-07-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786456475|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her release, White and others like her chartered a railroad car they called the "Prison Special," which toured the United States to keep the issue of suffrage before the public.

After Congress passed the 19th Amendment on June 4, 1919, White returned home and helped Tennessee achieve ratification.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== After the 19th Amendment ==
From 1920 to 1926, White served as an administrative secretary running the Washington office of Tennessee [[Kenneth McKellar (politician)|Kenneth McKeller]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1923, White earned a law degree from Washington College of Law.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Three years later, she returned to Jackson, TN as the city’s first female attorney and to work for her own law firm, Anderson and White.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She worked in the 1932 presidential campaign of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], and from 1934 (when she moved to [[Washington, D.C.]]) held a variety of posts in the [[New Deal]], culminating in her role as [[principal counsel]] of the [[Social Security Administration]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Systems art''' is [[art]] influenced by [[cybernetics]], and [[systems theory]], that reflects on natural systems, social systems and social signs of the [[art world]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aat-ned.nl/wwwopac.exe?database=aat&amp;language=1&amp;TAB=&amp;%250=2583 Systems art], Dutch Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, retrieved March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems art emerged as part of the first wave of the [[conceptual art]] movement extended in the 1960s and 1970s. Closely related and overlapping terms are ''[[Anti-form movement]]'', ''[[Cybernetic art]]'', ''Generative Systems'', ''[[Process art]]'', ''Systems aesthetic'', ''Systemic art'', ''Systemic painting'' and ''Systems sculptures''.

==Related fields of systems art==

=== Anti-form movement ===
By the early 1960s Minimalism had emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], [[the Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]) which rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[Abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional [[zeitgeist]] and polemics present in the arena of [[Action painting]]. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. The term '''Systematic art''' was coined by [[Lawrence Alloway]] in 1966 as a description of the method artists, such as [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]] and [[Frank Stella]],  were using for composing [[abstract painting]]s.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 694. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting, as opposed to other areas, is a modernist movement. Depending on the context, minimalism might be construed as a precursor to the postmodern movement. Seen from the perspective of writers who sometimes classify it as a postmodern movement, early minimalism began and succeeded as a modernist movement to yield advanced works, but which partially abandoned this project when a few artists changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.

In the late 1960s the term [[Postminimalism]] was coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]]&lt;ref&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, [[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]], March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others. Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their [[Late modernism|late modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

=== Cybernetic art ===
[[File:Tsai opticalpainting.jpg|thumb|right|''Optical Painting'' by [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] (1964)]] 
Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of Robert Breer and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cybernetic art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cybernetic art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1966–67), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In ''Beyond Modern Sculpture'' from 1968 Burnham builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1968, curator Jasia Reichardt organized the landmark exhibition, Cybernetic Serendipity, at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.

=== Generative systems ===
{{main|Generative art}}
[[File:Dombis 1687.jpg|thumb|Installation view of ''Irrational Geometrics'' 2008 by [[Pascal Dombis]]]]
Generative art is [[art]] that has been generated, composed, or constructed in an [[algorithmic art|algorithmic]] manner through the use of systems defined by [[computer]] [[software]] [[algorithms]], or similar [[mathematical]] or mechanical or [[random]]ised autonomous processes. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which brought artists and scientists together, was an effort at turning the artist's passive role into an active one by promoting the investigation of contemporary scientific—technological systems and their relationship to art and life. Unlike copier art, which was a simple commercial spin-off, Generative Systems was actually involved in the development of elegant yet simple systems intended for creative use by the general population. Generative Systems artists attempted to bridge the gap between elite and novice by directing the line of communication between the two, thus bringing first generation information to greater numbers of people and bypassing the entrepreneur.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"/&gt;

=== Process art ===
{{main|Process art}}
[[File:Bolognini-CIMs.JPG|thumb|right|[[Maurizio Bolognini]], ''Collective Intelligence Machines'' series (CIMs, from 2000). These are generative and interactive installations using the mobile phone network and participation technologies taken from e-democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurizio Bolognini]], "De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital" / [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], in ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique'', Edition L'Harmattan. Paris, 2011, pp. 229-239.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Process art is an [[artistic movement]] as well as a creative sentiment and world view where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'', is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, and patterning.  Process art is concerned with the actual ''doing''; art as a [[rite]], [[ritual]], and [[performance]]. Process art often entails an inherent motivation, rationale, and [[intentionality]]. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.
In the artistic discourse the work of [[Jackson Pollock]] is hailed as an antecedent. Process art in its employment of [[serendipity]] has a marked correspondence with [[Dada]]. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] states that Robert Morris in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states as "Process artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, improvisation, and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition".&lt;ref&gt;Source:  {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systemic art ===
According to Chilvers (2004) "earlier in 1966 the British art critic [[Lawrence Alloway]] had coined the term "Systemic art", to describe a type of abstract art characterized by the use of very simple standardized forms, usually geometric in character, either in a single concentrated image or repeated in a system arranged according to a clearly visible principle of organization. He considered the chevron paintings of [[Kenneth Noland]] as examples of Systemic art, and considered this as a branch of [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Systemic art." The Oxford Dictionary of Art. Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 2004. eNotes.com. 2006. 19 Mar, 2008 [http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/ systemic-art]&lt;/ref&gt;

John G. Harries considered a common ground in the ideas that underlie developments in 20th-century art such as [[Serial art]], Systems Art, [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Kinetic art]]. These kind of arts often do not stem directly from observations of things visible in the external natural environment, but from the observation of depicted shapes and of the relationship between them.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"&gt;John G. Harries, "Personal Computers and Notated Visual Art", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 14, No. 4 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 299-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Systems art, according to Harries, represents a deliberate attempt by artists to develop a more flexible frame of reference. A style in which its frame of reference is taken as a model to be emulated rather than as a cognitive systems, that only leads to the institutionalization of the imposed model. But to transfer the meaning of a picture to its location within a systemic structure does not remove the need to define the constitutive elements of the system: if they are not defined, one will not know how to build the system.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"/&gt;

=== Systemic painting ===
Systemic Painting, according to Auping (1989) "was the title of an highly influential exhibition at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in 1966 assembled and introduction written by [[Lawrence Alloway]] as curator. The show contained numerous works that many critics today would consider part of the [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Auping (1989), ''Abstraction, Geometry, Painting: Selected Geometric Abstract Painting'', Albright-Knox Art Gallery, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalogue Alloway noted, that ... "paintings, such as those in this exhibition are not, as has been often claimed, impersonal. The personal is not expunged by using a neat technique: anonymity is not a consequence of highly finishing a painting".&lt;ref name = "LA 66"&gt;Lawrence Alloway, "Systemic Painting", in: ''Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology'', by Gregory Battcock (1995). p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "systemic painting" later on has become the name for artists who employ systems make a number of aesthetic decisions before commencing 
to paint.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker (1973), ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945: Terms and Labels'', p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systems sculpture ===
According to Feldman (1987) "[[serial art]], serial painting, systems sculpture and [[ABC art]], were art styles of the 1960s and 1970s in which simple geometric configurations are repeated with little or no variation. Sequences becomes important as in mathematics and linguistic context. These works rely on simple arrangements of basic volumes and voids, mechanically produced surfaces, and algebraic permutations of form. The impact on the viewer, however, is anything but simple".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke Feldman (1987), ''Composition (Art)'', H.N. Abrams, {{ISBN|0-13-940602-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Kindness Rock Project''' is a [[Viral phenomenon|viral trend]] where people, commonly children, paint [[pebble]]s or [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]]s and leave them for others to find and collect. Photos of the painted rocks and hints of where to find them are commonly shared on [[List of Facebook features#Groups|Facebook groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/parents/rock-painting-groups-connect-families-communities-t111934|title=Why thousands of families are painting and hiding rocks... for fun|last=Peters|first=Terri|work=TODAY.com|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend originated in the [[United States|U.S.]] and has spread to the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] as well as other countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2016/08/10/one-rock-few-kind-words-and-movement-born/SQUeAzQyJZFQEOTF63d1tI/story.html|title=One rock, a few kind words, and a movement is born|last=Guerra|first=Cristela|date=August 10, 2016|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/may/06/rocking-all-over-the-world-the-painted-pebble-trend-crossing-continents|title=Rocking all over the world: the painted pebble trend crossing continents|last=Featherstone|first=Emma|date=2018-05-06|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kindness Rock Project was started by Megan Murphy in 2015 who wrote "You've got this" on a rock and left it on a beach on [[Cape Cod]]. After a friend found it, she started leaving more rocks with inspirational messages behind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thekindnessrocksproject.com/|title=The Kindness Rocks Project|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivatives ==
As the trend of painting pebbles has spread, it has many derivatives. Rocks are painted as a fun activity for kids, as well as to support particular charities, events or movements. Sometimes the name of a hashtag or the Facebook group the painter belongs to is written on it as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.familiesonline.co.uk/local/dunfermline/in-the-know/-kids-are-going-to-love-doing-this-during-the-school-holidays-60529|title=Kids Are Going to Love Doing This During the School Holidays|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en|website=www.familiesonline.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/viral/this-is-why-youre-seeing-pictures-of-really-pretty-rocks-in-your-feeds-36192892.html|title=This is why you’re seeing pictures of really pretty rocks in your feeds|last=|first=|date=October 3, 2017|work=Belfast Telegraph|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== #Islastones ===

A '''tithe''' ({{IPAc-en|t|aɪ|ð}}; from [[Old English language|Old English]]: ''teogoþa'' "tenth") is a one-tenth part of something, paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory [[tax]] to government.&lt;ref name=burg&gt;{{cite book |title=A World History of Tax Rebellions |author=David F. Burg |year=2004 |pages=viii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T91k6HAODzAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9780203500897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, tithes are normally voluntary and paid in [[money|cash]], [[cheque]]s, or [[stock]]s, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural products. Several European countries operate a formal process linked to the tax system allowing some churches to assess tithes.

Traditional [[Jewish law]] and practice has included various forms of tithing since ancient times. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] commonly practice ''ma'aser kesafim'' (tithing 10% of their income to [[Charity (practice)|charity]]). In modern Israel, Jews continue to follow the laws of agricultural tithing, e.g., ''[[ma'aser rishon]]'', ''[[Terumat Ma'aser|terumat ma'aser]]'', and ''[[ma'aser sheni]]''. 

With respect to [[Christianity]], [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] taught the Jews that "tithing must be done in conjunction with a deep concern for justice, mercy and faithfulness" (Matthew 23:23).&lt;ref name="SmithEmerson2008"/&gt; Tithing was taught at early Christian [[ecumenical council]]s, including the [[Council of Tours]] in 567, as well as the [[Synod of Mâcon]] in 585, and remains an important doctrine in many [[Christian denominations]], such as the [[Congregationalist Church]]es, [[Methodist Church]]es and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].&lt;ref name="SmithEmerson2008"/&gt;

In {{bibleref2 |Genesis |14:18–20}}, [[Abraham]], after rescuing [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]], met with [[Melchizedek]]. After Melchizedek's blessing, Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he has obtained from battle:
{{quote|"Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.”|Genesis 14:18–20}}

In {{bibleref2|Genesis|28:12–22}}, [[Jacob]], after his [[Vision (spirituality)|visionary]] [[Dream#In Abrahamic religions|dream]] of [[Jacob's Ladder]] and receiving a blessing from God, promises God a tenth:
{{quote|"Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.” And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”

So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God, and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you.”|Genesis 28:12–22}}

[[File:Monier22.JPG|thumb|''Tithing in the Temple'' by [[Pierre Monier]]]]
The tithe is specifically mentioned in the Books of [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]. The tithe system was organized in a three-year cycle, corresponding to the ''[[Shemittah]]''-cycle. These tithes were in reality more like taxes for the people of Israel and were mandatory, not optional giving. This tithe was distributed locally "within thy gates" ({{sourcetext|source=Bible (King James)|book=Deuteronomy|chapter=14|verse=28}}) to support the Levites and assist the poor.

Every year, ''[[First Fruits|Bikkurim]]'', ''[[Terumah]]'', ''Ma'aser Rishon'' and ''Terumat Ma'aser'' were separated from the grain, wine and oil ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:22 |JP}}). (As regards other fruit and produce, the Biblical requirement to tithe is a source of debate.) The ''first tithe'' is giving of one tenth of agricultural produce (after the giving of the standard ''[[terumah]]'') to the [[Levite]] (or Aaronic [[Kohen|priests]]). Historically, during the [[First Temple]] period, the first tithe was given to the [[Levite]]s.  Approximately at the beginning of the [[Second Temple]] construction, [[Ezra]] and his [[Beth din]] implemented its giving to the kohanim.&lt;ref&gt;The Talmud [[Adin Steinsaltz]] 1992 "Yet if a priest has first tithe in his possession, he need not give it to a Levite. Ezra penalized the Levites of his generation because they did not return to Eretz Israel with him, and he decreed that first tithe should be given to ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Restoration: Old Testament, Jewish, and Christian perspectives '' p. 329 James M. Scott. 2001 "One says that the Levites were punished because they did not come up to the Land of Israel during Ezra's days. The other says that the first tithe was given to the priests, so that they would have food when they were in a state of ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other offerings which were restricted to consumption within the [[tabernacle]], the ''[[second tithe]]'' could be consumed anywhere . On years one, two, four and five of the ''Shemittah''-cycle, God commanded the [[Children of Israel]] to take a second tithe that was to be brought to the place of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:23 |JP}}). The owner of the produce was to separate and bring 1/10 of his finished produce to the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] after separating ''Terumah'' and the [[first tithe]], but if the family lived too far from Jerusalem, the tithe could be redeemed upon coins ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:24–25 |JP}}). Then, the Bible required the owner of the redeemed coins to spend the tithe "to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish" ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:26 |JP}}). Implicit in the commandment was an obligation to spend the coins on items meant for human consumption.

In years three and six of the ''Shemittah''-cycle the Israelites set aside the (second) tithe instead as the ''[[poor tithe]]'', and it was given to the strangers, orphans, and widows.

The Levites, also known as the Tribe of Levi, were descendants of [[Levi]]. They were assistants to the Aaronic [[Kohen|priests]] (who were the children of [[Aaron]] and, therefore, a subset of the Tribe of Levi) and did not own or inherit a territorial [[Property|patrimony]] ({{sourcetext |source=Bible (King James) |book=Numbers |chapter=18 |verse=21 |range=-28}}). Their function in society was that of temple functionaries, teachers and trusted civil servants who supervised the weights and scales and witnessed agreements. The goods donated from the other Israeli tribes were their source of sustenance. They received from "all Israel" a tithe of food or livestock for support, and in turn would set aside a tenth portion of that tithe (known as the ''[[Terumat hamaaser]]'') for the Aaronic priests.

An additional tithe mentioned in the Book of Leviticus ({{bibleverse-nb||Lv|27:32–33|JP}}) is the [[cattle tithe]], which is to be sacrificed as a ''[[korban]]'' at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

===United Kingdom of Israel===
{{further|Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)}}
[[LMLK seal]]s may represent the oldest archaeological evidence of tithing. About 10 percent of the storage jars manufactured during [[Hezekiah]]'s reign (circa 700 BC) were stamped (Grena, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;376–78). See [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 29–31 for a record of this early worship reformation.

The [[Book of Nehemiah]] also talks about the collection of tithes to Leviim and distribution of Terumah to the priests: {{bibleverse||Nehemiah|13:5|JP}}. People were actually appointed to collect mandatory tithes and place them in specially designated chambers which eventually came to be known as storehouses: {{sourcetext |source=Bible (King James) |book=Nehemiah |chapter=12 |verse=44}}.

===Minor Prophets===
{{further|Minor Prophets}}
The [[Book of Malachi]] has one of the most quoted Biblical passages about tithing, directed to the sons of Jacob:

{{quote|For I, Jehovah, change not; therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed. From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return? "Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In your tithes and contributions. You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need. I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the Lord of hosts. Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts."|{{bibleref2 |Malachi |3:6–12}}}}

==Deuterocanonical==
{{further|Deuterocanonical books|Biblical apocrypha}}
The [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] [[Book of Tobit]] provides an example of all three classes of tithes practiced during the [[Babylonian captivity]]:
{{quote|"I would often go by myself to Jerusalem on religious holidays, as the Law commanded for every Israelite for all time. I would hurry off to Jerusalem and take with me the early produce of my crops, a tenth of my flocks, and the first portion of the wool cut from my sheep. I would present these things at the altar to the priests, the descendants of Aaron. I would give the first tenth of my grain, wine, olive oil, pomegranates, figs, and other fruit to the Levites who served in Jerusalem. For six out of seven years, I also brought the cash equivalent of the second tenth of these crops to Jerusalem where I would spend it every year. I gave this to orphans and widows, and to Gentiles who had joined Israel. In the third year, when I brought and gave it to them, we would eat together according to the instruction recorded in Moses’ Law, as Deborah my grandmother had taught me..."|{{bibleref2 |Tobit |1:6-8 |CEB}}}}

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Tithes in Judaism}}
Orthodox Jews continue to follow the laws of [[Heave offering|''Terumah'']] and [[First tithe|''Ma'aser'']] as well as the custom of tithing 10% of one's earnings to charity (''ma'aser kesafim''). Due to doubts concerning the status of persons claiming to be Kohanim or Levi'im arising after severe Roman/Christian persecutions and exile, the Hebrew Bible tithe of 10% for the Levites, and "tithe of the tithe" ({{bibleverse| |Numbers |18:26 |JP}}) of 10% of 10% (1%) for the priests are dealt with in accordance with Jewish Law.{{clarify|date=January 2016}} The [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] contain analysis of the [[Maaser Rishon|first tithe]], [[Maaser Sheni|second tithe]] and [[Maaser Ani|poor tithe]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |noicon=1|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10232-ma-aserot |title=MA'ASEROT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Tithing (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) bases its tithing on the following additional scriptures:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/manual/primary-6-old-testament/lesson-44-malachi-teaches-about-tithes-and-offerings |contribution= Lesson 44: Malachi Teaches about Tithes and Offerings |title= Primary 6: Old Testament |publisher= LDS Church |year= 1996 |pages= 196–201 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150224044120/https://www.lds.org/manual/primary-6-old-testament/lesson-44-malachi-teaches-about-tithes-and-offerings |archivedate= 24 February 2015 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tithing is currently defined by the church as payment to the church of one-tenth of one's annual income. Many LDS leaders have made statements in support of tithing.&lt;ref&gt;

The payment of tithes is mandatory for members to receive the [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] or obtain admission to [[temple (LDS Church)|temples]].

None of the funds collected from tithing is paid to church officials. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a Lay Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1993/10/combatting-spiritual-drift-our-global-pandemic?lang=eng&amp;query=lay+ministry|title=Combatting Spiritual Drift – Our Global Pandemic|author=Russell M.

The [[Moravian Church]] encourages its members to "financially support the ministry of the Church toward the goal of tithing."&lt;ref name="SmithEmerson2008"/&gt; It "deem[s] it a sacred responsibility and genuine opportunity to be faithful stewards of all God has entrusted to us: our time, our talents, [and] our financial resources".&lt;ref name="SmithEmerson2008"/&gt;

====Orthodox Churches====
Tithing in medieval Eastern Christianity did not spread so widely as in the West. A [[Constitution (Roman law)|Constitution]] of the Emperors [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]] (reigned 457–474) and [[Anthemius]] (reigned 467–472) apparently expected believers to make voluntary payments and forbade compulsion.&lt;ref&gt;

====Pentecostal Churches====
The [[Pentecostal Church of God]] teaches that "We recognize the scriptural duty of all our people, as well as ministers, to pay tithes as unto the Lord. Tithes should be used for the support of active ministry and for the propagation of the Gospel and the work of the Lord in general."&lt;ref name="SmithEmerson2008"/&gt;

====Reformed Churches====
The [[Book of Order]] of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] states, with respect to the obligation to tithe:&lt;ref name="PMA1997"/&gt;
{{quotation|“Giving has always been a mark of Christian commitment and discipleship. The ways in which a believer uses God’s gifts of material goods, personal abilities, and time should reflect a faithful response to God’s self-giving in Jesus Christ and Christ’s call to minister to and share with others in the world.

===Church collection of religious offerings and taxes===
====England and Wales====
The right to receive tithes was granted to the English churches by [[Ethelwulf of Wessex|King Ethelwulf]] in 855. The [[Saladin tithe]] was a royal tax, but assessed using ecclesiastical boundaries, in 1188. The legal validity of the tithe system was affirmed under the [[Statute of Westminster 1285|Statute of Westminster]] of 1285. The [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] led to the transfer of many rights to tithe to secular landowners and [[the Crown]] – and tithes could be extinguished until 1577 under an Act of the 37th year of [[Henry VIII]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details/C3252914-details|title=Middlesex: London City without the Walls: St Botolph without Aldgate, parish |work=The National Archives Collection IR 18/5462}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]] criticized the system in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), arguing that a fixed rent would encourage peasants to work far more efficiently.

[[Tithe#Tithes and tithe law in England before reform|See below]] for a fuller description and history, until the reforms of the 19th century, written by [[Sir William Blackstone]] and edited by other learned lawyers of the period.

[[File:Tithes poster 1837.jpg|thumb|Public notice demanding payment due on Tithes, 1837]]
The system gradually ended with the [[Tithe Commutation Act 1836]], whose long-lasting Tithe Commission replaced them with a commutation payment, land award and/or rentcharges to those paying the commutation payment and took the opportunity to map out (apportion) residual chancel liability where the rectory had been appropriated during the medieval period by a religious house or college. Its records give a snapshot of land ownership in most parishes, the Tithe Files, are a socio-economic history resource. The rolled-up payment of several years' tithe would be divided between the tithe-owners as at the date of their extinction.&lt;ref name=na&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/tithes/ How to look for records of Tithes –  The History of Tithes] The National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

This commutation reduced problems to the ultimate payers by effectively folding tithes in with rents however, it could cause transitional money supply problems by raising the transaction demand for money. Later the decline of large landowners led [[leasehold estate|tenants]] to become [[freehold (English law)|freeholders]] and again have to pay directly; this also led to renewed objections of principle by non-[[Anglican]]s.&lt;ref&gt;One account of the objections in the 1920s and 1930s appears in the book ''The Tithe War'' by [[Doreen Wallace]] (London: Gollancz, 1934).&lt;/ref&gt; It also kept intact a system of chancel repair liability affecting the minority of parishes where the rectory had been lay-appropriated. The precise land affected in such places hinged on the content of documents such as the content of deeds of merger and apportionment maps.&lt;ref name=na/&gt;

=====Tithe redemption=====
Rent charges in lieu of abolished English tithes paid by landowners were converted by a public outlay of money under the [[Tithe Act 1936]] into [[annuity (financial contracts)|annuities]] paid to the state through the Tithe Redemption Commission. Such payments were transferred in 1960 to the Board of [[Inland Revenue]], and those remaining were terminated by the [[Finance Act 1977]].

The [[Tithe Act 1951]] established the compulsory redemption of English tithes by landowners where the annual amounts payable were less than £1 so abolishing the bureaucracy and costs of collecting small sums of money.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====France====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Commanderie Coulommiers cour grange aux dimes.jpg|thumb|[[Knights Templar]] tithe barn (''la grange aux dîmes'') with red roof, [[Coulommiers, Seine-et-Marne]], France.]]
In [[France]], the tithes – called "la dîme" – were a land tax. Originally a voluntary tax, the "dîme" became mandatory in 1585. In principle, unlike the [[taille]], the "dîme" was levied on both noble and non-noble lands. The dîme was divided into a number of types, including the "grosses dîmes" (grains, wine, hay), "menues" or "vertes dîmes" (vegetables, poultry), "dîmes de charnage" (veal, lamb, pork). Although the term "dîme" comes from the Latin ''decima [pars]'' ("one tenth", with the same origin as that of the U.S. coin, the [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]]), the "dîme" rarely reached this percentage and (on the whole) it was closer to 1/13th of the agricultural production.

The "dîme" was originally meant to support the local parish, but by the 16th century many "dîmes" went directly to distant abbeys, monasteries, and bishops, leaving the local parish impoverished, and this contributed to general resentment. In the Middle Ages, some monasteries also offered the "dîme" in homage to local lords in exchange for their protection (see [[Feudalism]]) (these are called "dîmes inféodées"), but this practice was forbidden by the Lateran Council of 1179.

All religious taxes were constitutionally abolished in 1790, in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].

====Greece====
There has never been a separate church tax or mandatory tithe on Greek citizens. The state pays the salaries of the clergy of the established [[Church of Greece]], in return for use of real estate, mainly forestry, owned by the church. The remainder of church income comes from voluntary, tax-deductible donations from the faithful. These are handled by each [[diocese]] independently.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Ireland====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
From the [[English Reformation]] in the 16th century, most Irish people chose to remain [[Roman Catholic]] and had by now to pay tithes valued at about 10 per cent of an area's agricultural produce, to maintain and fund the established state church, the [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]], to which only a small minority of the population converted. [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Irish Presbyterians]] and other minorities like the [[Quaker]]s and [[Jew]]s were in the same situation.

The collection of tithes was resisted in the period 1831–36, known as the [[Tithe War]]. Thereafter, tithes were reduced and added to rents with the passing of the [[Tithe Commutation Act 1838|Tithe Commutation Act]] in 1836. With the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland by the [[Irish Church Act 1869]], tithes were abolished.

====United States====
While the federal government has never collected a church tax or mandatory tithe on its citizens, states &lt;!---such as Massachusetts, specifically--&gt; collected a tithe into the early 19th century. The United States and its governmental subdivisions also exempt most churches from payment of income tax (under Section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] and similar state statutes, which also allows donors to claim the donations as an income tax [[itemized deduction]]). Also, churches may be permitted exemption from other state and local taxes such as sales and property taxes, either in whole or in part. Clergy, such as ministers and members of religious orders (who have taken a vow of poverty) may be exempt from federal self-employment tax on income from ministerial services. Income from non-ministerial services are taxable and churches are required to withhold Federal and state income tax from this non-exempt income. They are also required to withhold employee's share of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes under [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]], and pay the employer's share for the non-exempt income.&lt;ref name="IRS517"&gt;

====Spain and Latin America====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Casa reina mora.jpg|thumb|Casa de los Diezmos, [[Canillas de Aceituno]], Málaga, Spain]]
{{Main article|Diezmo}}
Both the tithe (''diezmo''), a levy of 10 per cent on all agricultural production, and "first fruits" (''primicias''), an additional harvest levy, were collected in [[Spain]] throughout the medieval and early modern periods for the support of local [[Catholic]] parishes.

The tithe crossed the Atlantic with the [[Spanish Empire]]; however, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] who made up the vast majority of the population in colonial [[Spanish America]] were exempted from paying tithes on native crops such as corn and potatoes that they raised for their own subsistence. After some debate, Indians in colonial Spanish America were forced to pay tithes on their production of European agricultural products, including wheat, silk, cows, pigs, and sheep.

The tithe was abolished in several [[Latin America]]n countries, including [[Mexico]], soon after independence from Spain (which started in 1810). The tithe was abolished in Spain itself in 1841, and in Argentina in 1826.

===Governmental collection of Christian religious offerings and taxes===
{{Main|Church tax}}
====Austria====
In [[Austria]] a colloquially called [[church tax]] (''Kirchensteuer'', officially called ''Kirchenbeitrag'', i. e. ''church contribution'') has to be paid by members of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestant Church]]{{which|date=January 2017}}. It is levied by the churches themselves and not by the government. The obligation to pay church tax can just be evaded by an official declaration to cease church membership. The tax is calculated on the basis of personal income. It amounts to about 1.1 per cent (Catholic church) and 1.5 per cent (Protestant church).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Denmark====
All members of the [[Church of Denmark]] pay a church tax, which varies between municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/My_Constitutional_Act_with_explanations/Chapter%207.aspx|title=Chapter 7 - The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Denmark |last= |first= |date=2013-08-23 |website=Folketinget |access-date=2017-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331120111/http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/My_Constitutional_Act_with_explanations/Chapter%207.aspx|archive-date=31 March 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax is generally around 1% of the taxable income.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Finland====
Members of [[Religion in Finland|state churches]] pay a church tax of between 1% and 2% of income, depending on the municipality. In addition, 2.55 per cent of corporate taxes are distributed to the state churches. Church taxes are integrated into the common national taxation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evl.fi/EVLfi.nsf/0/F4798384ACD179A1C22572E5003ACBF9?OpenDocument |title=Verot ja muut tulot |work=EVL.fi |publisher=Suomen evankelisluterilainen kirkko |language=Finnish |accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
[[Germany]] levies a [[church tax]], on all persons declaring themselves to be Christians, of roughly 8–9% of their income tax, which is effectively (very much depending on the social and financial situation) typically between 0.2% and 1.5% of the total income. The proceeds are shared among Catholic, Lutheran, and other Protestant Churches.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

The church tax ([[Kirchensteuer]]) actually traces its roots back as far as the [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]] of 1803. It was reaffirmed in the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat of 1933]] between Nazi Germany and the Catholic Church. Today its legal basis is article 140 of the [[Grundgesetz]] (the German "constitution") in connection with article 137 of the [[Weimar constitution]]. These laws originally merely allowed the churches themselves to tax their members, but in Nazi Germany, collection of church taxes was transferred to the German government. As a result, both the German government and the employer are notified of the religious affiliation of every taxpayer. This system is still in effect today. Mandatory disclosure of religious affiliation to government agencies or employers constituted a violation of the original European data protection directives but is now permitted after the German government obtained an exemption.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Church tax (Kirchensteuer) is compulsory in Germany for those confessing members of a particular religious group. It is deducted at the [[PAYE]] level. The duty to pay this tax theoretically starts on the day one is christened. Anyone who wants to stop paying it has to declare in writing, at their local court of law (Amtsgericht) or registry office, that they are leaving the Church. They are then crossed off the Church registers and can no longer receive the sacraments, confession and certain services; a Roman Catholic church may deny such a person a burial plot.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article3544885.ece |newspaper=The Times |title=Excommunication for German Catholics who refuse church tax |date=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the government, the taxpayer also must notify his employer of his religious affiliation (or lack thereof) in order to ensure proper tax withholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19699581 |title=BBC News ''German Catholics lose church rights for unpaid tax'' 2012-09-24 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This opt-out is also used by members of "free churches" (e.g. Baptists) (non-affiliated to the scheme) to stop paying the church tax, from which the free churches do not benefit, in order to support their own church directly.

====Italy====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Originally the Italian government of [[Benito Mussolini]], under the [[Lateran treaties]] of 1929 with the [[Holy See]], paid a monthly [[salary]] to [[Catholic]] clergymen. This salary was called the ''congrua''. The eight per thousand law was created as a result of an agreement, in 1984, between the Italian Republic and the [[Holy See]].

Under this law Italian taxpayers are able to vote how to partition the 0.8% ('eight per thousand') of the total income [[tax]] [[IRPEF]] levied by Italy among some specific [[religious]] [[Confession (religion)|confessions]] or, alternatively, to a [[Welfare (financial aid)|social assistance]] program run by the Italian State. This declaration is made on the [[IRPEF]] form. This vote is not compulsory; the whole amount levied by the [[IRPEF]] [[tax]] is distributed in proportion to explicit declarations.

The last official statement of Italian Ministry of Finance made in respect of the year 2000 singles out seven beneficiaries: the Italian State, the [[Roman Catholic Church in Italy|Catholic Church]], the [[Waldenses]], the [[Italian Jews|Jewish Communities]], the [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[Assemblies of God in Italy]].

The tax was divided up as follows:
*87.17% Catholic Church
*10.35% Italian State
*1.21% Waldenses
*0.46% Jewish Communities
*0.32% Lutherans
*0.28% Adventists of the Seventh Day
*0.21% Assemblies of God in Italy

In 2000, the [[Catholic Church]] raised almost a billion [[euro]]s, while the Italian State received about €100 million euros.

====Scotland====
{{main|Teind}}
In Scotland ''teinds'' were the tenths of certain produce of the land appropriated to the maintenance of the Church and clergy. At the Reformation most of the Church property was acquired by the Crown, nobles and landowners. In 1567 the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] provided that a third of the revenues of lands should be applied to paying the clergy of the reformed [[Church of Scotland]]. In 1925 the system was recast by statute&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt; and provision was made for the standardisation of stipends at a fixed value in money. The [[Court of Session]] acted as the Teind Court. Teinds were finally abolished by section 56 of the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]].

====Sweden====
Until the year 2000, Sweden had a mandatory [[church tax]], to be paid if one did belong to the [[Church of Sweden]], which had been funneling about $500 million annually to the church. Because of change in legislation, the tax was withdrawn in the year 2000. However, the Swedish government has agreed to continue collecting from individual taxpayers the annual payment that has always gone to the church. But now the tax will be an optional checkoff box on the tax return. The government will allocate the money collected to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish and other faiths as well as the Lutherans, with each taxpayer directing where his or her taxes should go.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Switzerland====
There is no official state church in [[Switzerland]]; however, all the 26 cantons (states) financially support at least one of the three traditional denominations — [[Roman Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], or [[Protestant]] — with funds collected through taxation. Each canton has its own regulations regarding the relationship between church and state. In some cantons, the church tax (up to 2.3 per cent) is voluntary but in others an individual who chooses not to contribute to church tax may formally have to leave the church. In some cantons private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Tithes and tithe law in England before reform===
Excerpts from [[Sir William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'':

====Definition and classification and those liable to pay tithes====
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . tithes; which are defined to be the tenth part of the increase, yearly arising and renewing from the profits of lands, the stock upon lands, and the personal industry of the inhabitants:
:the first species being usually called ''predial,''&lt;ref&gt;from praedium, a farm&lt;/ref&gt; as of corn, grass, hops, and wood;
:the second ''mixed'', as of wool, milk, pigs, &amp;c, consisting of natural products, but nurtured and preserved in part by the care of man; and of these the tenth must be paid in gross:
:the third ''personal'', as of manual occupations, trades, fisheries, and the like ; and of these only the tenth part of the clear gains and profits is due.
...
in general, tithes are to be paid for every thing that yields an annual increase, as corn, hay, fruit, cattle, poultry, and the like; but not for any thing that is of the substance of the earth, or is not of annual increase, as stone, lime, chalk, and the like; nor for creatures that are of a wild nature, or ''ferae naturae'', as deer, hawks, &amp;c, whose increase, so as to profit the owner, is not annual, but casual.&lt;ref name = 'BlackstoneII'&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackstone |first=William |title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol II |date=1766 |place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====History====
&lt;blockquote&gt;We cannot precisely ascertain the time when tithes were first introduced into this country.  Possibly they were contemporary with the planting of Christianity among the Saxons, by Augustin the monk, about the end of the fifth century.  But the first mention of them, which I have met with in any written English law, is in a constitutional decree, made in a synod held A.D. 786, wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined. This canon, or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy, in their parliamentary conventions of estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the bishops, dukes, senators, and people. Which was a few years later than the time that Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous division of them into four parts ; one to maintain the edifice of the church, the second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial clergy.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Beneficiaries====
&lt;blockquote&gt;And upon their first introduction (as hath formerly been observed), though every man was obliged to pay tithes in general, yet he might give them to what priests he pleased; which were called ''arbitrary'' consecrations of tithes: or he might pay them into the hands of the bishop, who distributed among his diocesan clergy the revenues of the church, which were then in common. But, when dioceses were divided into parishes, the tithes of each parish were allotted to its own particular minister; first by common consent, or the appointment of lords of manors, and afterwards by the written law of the land.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

...It is now universally held, that tithes are due, of common right, to the [[parson]] of the [[parish]], unless there be a special exemption. This parson of the parish, we have formerly seen, may be either the actual [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]], or else the [[wikt:appropriator|appropriator]] of the [[Benefice#Church of England|benefice]]: appropriations being a method of endowing monasteries, which seems to have been devised by the regular clergy, by way of substitution to arbitrary consecrations of tithes.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Exemptions====
&lt;blockquote&gt;We observed that tithes are due to the parson of common right, unless by special exemption: let us therefore see, thirdly, who may be exempted from the payment of tithes ... either in part or totally, first, by a real composition; or secondly, by custom or prescription.

First, a real composition is when an agreement is made between the owner of the lands, and the parson or vicar, with the consent of the ordinary and the patron, that such lands shall for the future be discharged from payment of tithes, by reason of some land or other real recompence given to the parson, in lieu and satisfaction thereof.

Secondly, a discharge by custom or prescription, is where time out of mind such persons or such lands have been, either partially or totally, discharged from the payment of tithes. And this immemorial usage is binding upon all parties, as it is in its nature an evidence of universal consent and acquiescence; and with reason supposes a real composition to have been formerly made. This custom or prescription is either ''de modo decimandi'', or ''de non decimando''.

A ''modus decimandi'', commonly called by the simple name of a ''modus'' only, is where there is by custom a particular manner of tithing allowed, different from the general law of taking tithes in kind, which are the actual tenth part of the annual increase. This is sometimes a pecuniary compensation, as twopence an acre for the tithe of land : sometimes it is a compensation in work and labour, as that the parson shall have only the twelfth cock of hay, and not the tenth, in consideration of the owner's making it for him: sometimes, in lieu of a large quantity of crude or imperfect tithe, the parson shall have a less quantity, when arrived to greater maturity, as a couple of fowls in lieu of tithe eggs ; and the like. Any means, in short, whereby the general law of tithing is altered, and a new method of taking them is introduced, is called a ''modus decimandi'', or special manner of tithing.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|28–29}}

A prescription ''de non decimando'' is a claim to be entirely discharged of tithes, and to pay no compensation in lieu of them.  Thus the king by his prerogative is discharged from all tithes. So a vicar shall pay no tithes to the rector, nor the rector to the vicar, for ''ecclesia decimas non folvit ecclesiae''. But these ''personal'' to both the king and the clergy ; for their tenant or lessee shall pay tithes of the same land, though in their own occupation it is not tithable.  And, generally speaking, it is an established rule, that in ''lay'' hands, ''modus de non decimando non valet''. But spiritual persons or corporations, as monasteries, abbots, bishops, and the like, were always capable of having their lands totally discharged of tithes, by various ways: as
#By real composition :
#By the pope's [[Papal bull|bull]] of exemption :
#By unity of possession ; as when the rectory of a parish, and lands in the same parish, both belonged to a religious house, those lands were discharged of tithes by this unity of possession :
#By prescription ; having never been liable to tithes, by being always in spiritual hands :
#By virtue of their order; as the [[Knights Templars|knights templars]], [[cistercians]], and others, whose lands were privileged by the pope with a discharge of tithes. Though, upon the dissolution of abbeys by [[Henry VIII]], most of these exemptions from tithes would have fallen with them, and the lands become tithable again; had they not been supported and upheld by the statute 31 Hen. VIII. c. 13. which enacts, that all persons who should come to the possession of the lands of any abbey then dissolved, should hold them free and discharged of tithes, in as large and ample a manner as the abbeys themselves formerly held them. And from this original have sprung all the lands, which, being in lay hands, do at present claim to be tithe-free: for, if a man can shew his lands to have been such abbey lands, and also immemorially discharged of tithes by any of the means before-mentioned, this is now a good prescription ''de non decimando''. But he must shew both these requisites ; for abbey lands, without a special ground of discharge, are not discharged of course ; neither will any prescription ''de non decimando'' avail in total discharge of tithes, unless it relates to such abbeylands.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|31–32}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Islam==
{{main article|Zakāt}}
[[Zakāt]] ({{lang-ar|زكاة}} {{IPA-ar|zækæːh|}}) or "alms giving", one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], is the giving of a small percentage of one's assets to [[charity (practice)|charity]]. It serves principally as the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] contribution to poor and deprived Muslims, although others may have a rightful share. It is the duty of an Islamic state not just to collect zakat but to distribute it fairly as well.

Zakat is payable on three kinds of assets: wealth, production, and animals. The more well-known zakat on wealth is 2.5 per cent of accumulated wealth, beyond one's personal needs. Production (agricultural, industrial, renting, etc.), is subject to a 10 per cent or 5 per cent zakat (also known as Ushur (عُشر), or "one-tenth"), using the rule that if both labor and capital are involved, 5% rate is applied, if only one of the two are used for production, then the rate is 10 per cent. For any earnings, that require neither labor nor capital, like finding underground treasure, the rate is 20 per cent. The rules for zakat on animal holdings are specified by the type of animal group and tend to be fairly detailed.&lt;ref name=ghamidi&gt;The book ''Meezan'', by Javed Ahmed Ghamidi, published by Al-Mawrid, 2002, Lahore, Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims fulfill this religious obligation by giving a fixed percentage of their surplus wealth. Zakat has been paired with such a high sense of righteousness that it is often placed on the same level of importance as performing the five-daily repetitive ritualised prayer ([[salat]]).&lt;ref name=zysow&gt;{{citation |last= Zysow |first= A. Zakāt |title= Encyclopaedia of Islam |edition= Second |editor1= P. Bearman |editor2= Th. Bianquis |editor3= C.E. Bosworth |editor4= E. van Donzel |editor5= W.P. Heinrichs |publisher= Brill |year= 2009}}.{{page needed|date=October 2014}} Available from [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_COM-1377 Brill Online] (subscription).&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims see this process also as a way of purifying themselves from their greed and selfishness and also safeguarding future business.&lt;ref name=zysow/&gt; In addition, Zakat purifies the person who receives it because it saves him from the humiliation of begging and prevents him from envying the rich.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Neal. Islam; A Concise Introduction. Richmond; Curzon Press. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Because it holds such a high level of importance the "punishment" for not paying when able is very severe. In the 2nd edition of the ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'' it states, "...the prayers of those who do not pay zakat will not be accepted".&lt;ref name=zysow/&gt; This is because without Zakat a tremendous hardship is placed on the poor which otherwise would not be there. Besides the fear of their prayers not getting heard, those who are able should be practicing this third pillar of Islam because the Quran states that this is what believers should do.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 verse 155, "be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss on goods, lives, and fruits. But give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere."&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslims (able-bodied adult males of military age) living in an Islamic state are required to pay [[Jizya]], this exempts them from military service and they do not pay Zakat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5954">'''Tschandala''' (old German transcription of ''[[chandala]]'') is a term [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] borrowed from the [[Indian caste system]], where a Tschandala is a member of the lowest social class. Nietzsche's interpretation and use of the term relied on a flawed source but was used by some interpreters to connect him to [[Nazi ideology]].

== Nietzsche's use of the term ==
Nietzsche uses the term "Tschandala" in the  ''Götzen-Dämmerung'' (''Twilight of the Idols'')&lt;ref&gt;"Die ‚Verbesserer‘ der Menschheit" (KSA 6, p. 98–102)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Der Antichrist'' (''The Antichrist'').&lt;ref&gt;chapter 56 and 57 (KSA 6, p. 239–244)&lt;/ref&gt; Here he uses the "[[law of Manu]]“ with its [[Caste system in India|caste system]] as an example of one kind of morality, of "breeding", as opposed to the Christian version of morality which attempts to "tame" man. 

At first, Nietzsche describes methods of [[Christianity|Christian]] attempts to "improve" humanity. As a metaphor, he uses a trained beast in a menagerie which is said to be "improved", but which in reality has lost vitality and is only weakened. In just such a way, Nietzsche says, has Christianity "tamed" the Teutonic races.

The law of Manu, on the other hand, tries to "improve" humanity by creating 4 castes of people, while ostracizing and making life miserable for the Tschandala, the untouchables. Nietzsche deplores this type of morality, that of the "breeder," just as he does the (Christian) "animal tamer", as he is opposed to all 'morality'. However, he much prefers it to the Christian "slave-morality." In his view, the humiliating and oppressive edicts against the Tschandala are a defensive means of keeping the castes pure:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet this organization too found it necessary to be ''terrible''—this time not in the struggle with beasts, but with their counter-concept, the unbred man, the mishmash man, the chandala. And again it had no other means for keeping him from being dangerous, for making him weak, than to make him ''sick''—it was the fight with the "great number.&lt;ref name="götzendämmerung"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7203 Götzen-Dämmerung], Die "Verbesserer" der Menschheit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Nietzsche, Christianity is a product of [[Judaism]], the "Tschandala-religion". By this he means that Judaism and Christianity after it are the morality born of the hatred of the oppressed (like the Tschandala) for their oppressors:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity, sprung from Jewish roots and comprehensible only as a growth on this soil, represents the ''counter-movement'' to any morality of breeding, of race, privilege:—it is the ''anti-Aryan'' religion par excellence. Christianity, the revaluation of all Aryan values, the victory of chandala values, the gospel preached to the poor and base, the general revolt of all the downtrodden, the wretched, the failures, the less favored, against "race": the undying chandala hatred as the ''religion of love''...&lt;ref name="götzendämmerung" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', Nietzsche again cites the law of Manu, and favors it in a relative sense to the morality of Judeo-Christianity. Nietzsche describes the "most spiritual" and "strongest" men who can say "yes" to everything, even the existence of the Tschandalas; and opposed to this is the envious and revengeful spirit of the Tschandalas themselves (cf. [[master-slave morality]]). Nietzsche also uses the term Tschandala for some of his opponents, e.g. [[socialism]].

== Nietzsche's flawed source ==
Nietzsche's source for the law of Manu was the book ''Les législateurs religieux. Manou, Moïse, Mahomet'' (1876) by French writer [[Louis Jacolliot]]. According to Annemarie Etter, this translation of the [[Manusmriti]] is not reliable and differs widely from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Etter: ''Nietzsche und das Gesetzbuch des Manu'' in: ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 16 (1987), p. 340–352&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the high respect it gives to women, which Nietzsche quotes in opposition to "Christian misogyny", is in fact not contained in any of the usual texts.

In his description and interpretation of the "Tschandala", Nietzsche may have followed a long footnote by Jacolliot, which gives an "unbelievable, abstruse and scientifically completely untenable" (Etter) theory. According to Jacolliot, all [[Semitic peoples]], especially the Hebrews, are descendants of emigrated Tschandalas. Although Nietzsche never directly says this, it seems plausible that he believed in Jacolliot's theory at least to some extent, even though, as Etter points out, Nietzsche would have easily been able to falsify several of Jacolliot's [[pseudo-science|pseudo-scientific]] claims. In so doing, he may have increased the impact of Jacolliot's "effusive admiration for ancient Eastern wisdom and civilization with a more or less open and pronounced antisemitism and antichristianism" (Etter).

==Descendant uses==

=== Nazi Germany===
&lt;!--missing: real use in NS. perhaps at Alfred Baeumler --&gt;

Terms like "race", "breeding", "[[Aryan]]" and others Nietzsche used in his later works were employed by Nazi polemicists who referenced his theories.

Though Nietzsche did use the term ''[[Übermensch]]'', ''nowhere'' in his works he used the contrary ''[[Untermensch]]'' that in the 20th Century became a concept in Nazi ideology, that was used for races and individuals that it perceived ''"inferior"''. 

=== Literary influence ===

Inspired by Nietzsche, [[August Strindberg]] wrote a novel called "Tschandala" in 1889.

Since its formation in 2005, the task force has brought forth different initiatives that assist in the Counter Terrorism Strategy including the UN Counter Terrorism Handbook.  Its working groups have offered workshops and presented reports that are designed to assist important UN actors, member states and stakeholders in the fight against terrorism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalct.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/rosand_policybrief_091.pdf|title=The UN’s Role in Implementing its Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Before the CTITF was formed, the Security Council of the UN legally binded all member states through resolutions relating to the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/215035/pdf|title=The United Nations, Counter Terrorism, and Human Rights: Institutional Adaptation and Embedded Ideas|last=Foot|first=Rosemary|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolutions included;

The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267]], adopted in October 1999 requires the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan to stop providing refuge to terrorist organizations and demand that they cooperate in bringing terrorists to justice.  This resolution also imposes aviation actions and financial sanctions on the Taliban.  It also established the Security Council Committee.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sanctionsandsecurity.nd.edu/assets/110258/action_agenda_un_counterterrorism.pdf|title=An Action Agenda for Enhancing the United Nations Program on Counter-Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373]], adopted in September 2001 under Chapter VII of the [[United Nations Charter]].  The aims of this resolution is to hinder terrorist actions.  This resolution calls on states to adjust national laws to better combat terrorism and focuses on regulating immigration laws to contain the spread of terrorism.  It also place legal obligations on member states requiring them to freeze any financial assets of terrorist and supporters, deny travel means or safe havens for terrorists, and prevent their weapon supply and recruitment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These resolutions began the formation of branches in the United Nations to combat terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qBQ0jcXc2vcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=United+Nations+Counter+Terrorism+Implementation+Task+Force&amp;ots=3yj8CGAven&amp;sig=s2SJ3u__4vnA8LMF31fypu3hVUk#v=onepage&amp;q=United%20Nations%20Counter%20Terrorism%20Implementation%20Task%20Force&amp;f=false|title=Uniting Against Terror: Cooperative Nonmilitary Responses to the Global Terrorist Threat|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Secretary- General [[Kofi Annan]] created the United Nations Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force.  It was later endorsed by the General Assembly in 2006 through the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, to ensure that all terrorism units in the UN work together to increase the efficiency and range.

== Makeup ==
The Secretary General appoints a senior United Nations official to act as the chair of the task force.  The task force is divided into approximately 38 member entities including the [[World Bank]], the Youth Envoy and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opcw.org/special-sections/ctitf-report/about-the-united-nations-counter-terrorism-implementation-task-force/|title=About the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Interpol|INTERPOL]].  The CTITF is divided into 4 subgroups; the [[United Nations Security Council]], the [[United Nations Secretariat|Secretariat]], the Agencies Programmes Funds and Observers. The goal of the CTITF is to maximize each of the entity‘s comparative advantage by delivering as one to help Member States implement the four pillars of the Global Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/working-groups|title=Working Groups of the UN|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pillars of the CTITF ==
The intent of Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force is to help states in the UN enforce the 4 building blocks that make up Global Strategy.  The four Pillars are;
* Pillar 1- Methods of being aware of the circumstances that encourage possibilities of terrorism.
* Pillar 2- Methods preventing and combating terrorism.
* Pillar 3- Methods that allow states to be better equipped to fight terrorism and how the United Nations can help.
* Pillar 4- Methods that enforce the rule of law as the foundation of fighting terrorism and ensuring all have human rights.
The Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force is responsible for ensuring all needs of member states in the United Nations are met and policies are supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/about-task-force|title=Coordination and coherence of the counter-terrorism efforts of the United Nations|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status of Working Groups ==
The status of working groups has implemented a project on harmonized border management, compiling all recent international conventions, and best practices in an applicable, user-friendly format to help interested states build the institutional and procedural mechanisms for an effective border management system A working arrangement on harmonized border management has been completed by the working group. This idea will continue to be maximized through ongoing consultations with member states and international organizations.

== Entities ==
Entities of the United Nations Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force involve;

'''Mobility and processing of people'''

Because the processes that allow travel and economic and cultural exchanges is exploited by terrorists, measures that are put in place to prevent terrorism have become explicitly linked to the management and regulation of movement across borders. These measures include implementing passenger integrated border-management systems, issuing secure travel documents, promoting exchange of information among stakeholders, training, and capacity-building.  Improving in areas like this can help heighten security and immigration systems while also allowing the cross-border movement of people. Some of these measures are technologically complex, but more basic systems can be achieved in traditional areas of migration- management with a view to enhancing overall capacity&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Movement and processing of goods'''

Global trade, as well as the international supply chain are vulnerable to manipulation by terrorists. In order to minimize this vulnerability, a range of measures should be taken, including ensuring receipt of advance electronic cargo information about inbound, outbound and transit shipments; employing a consistent risk-management approach to address threats to cargo security; using non-intrusive detection equipment; promoting cooperation among customs administrations (e.g. by performing outbound inspection of high-risk containers and cargo); and establishing partnerships with the private sector for the implementation of secure practices at every stage of the supply chain, through Authorized Economic Operator (AEO). The implementation of these and other measures is key in order to maximize security in international trade and facilitate the movement of goods across borders programmes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Maritime security'''

Over 90 per cent of the total goods traded internationally is transported from source to destination along the world’s main global sea-trading routes he security of the maritime domain is therefore classified as a major problem of global importance. The aims of maritime security are to detect and deter security threats; to take preventive measures against security incidents affecting ships or port facilities; and to safeguard passengers, crews, ships and their cargoes, port facilities and the people who work and live in port areas, while still allowing for the safe and efficient movement of maritime trade.   Effective implementation of the relevant legislative and practical security measures is necessary in order to prevent unlawful acts against the passengers and crew of ships engaged in international voyages and against the port facilities that serve them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Early warning and alert systems'''

Border security is a dynamic and constantly changing process because the illegal cross-border movement of people affects not only the security, but also economic and social welfare of states. Comprehensive early-warning and alert systems are therefore key components of effective border management systems. They strengthen the collective capacity of states to detect, and combat terrorism, by facilitating inter-agency cooperation and the timely sharing and exchange of pertinent, reliable information, allow the enabling important decisions to be taken in a reasonable manner&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many international organizations with a border-control mandate and utilize early- warning and alert systems. Those tools include the [[World Customs Organization|WCO]] CEN and RILO networks; IMOSOLAS, LRIT and AIS; the Consolidated Lists of the Security Council “sanctions” committees, and the “I-24/7” secure global communications system, SLTD database and Notices regime of the International Criminal Police Organization ([[Interpol|INTERPOL]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Working Groups ==
The United Nations Secretariat, agencies, funds and programmes, and affiliated organizations contribute to the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy both through their individual mandates and through their membership in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/working-groups|title=Working Groups of the UN's Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated Assistance for Countering Terrorism is an important working group in the Task force.  The working group consists of representatives from different UN entities involved in putting the counter terrorism strategy in action for countries who wish to receive help from the UN.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2014, the inter-agency [[working group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the CTITF were reformed in 2014 to help improve efficiency and effectiveness of the entities' in achieving results.

Some of the working groups currently in place include;

'''Border Management and Law Enforcement relating to Counter-Terrorism'''

This working group strives to allow guidance to Member States on implementation of legal, institutional and practical counter-terrorism-related border control measures required. It focuses on the following areas: terrorist mobility; integrity and security of travel documents; illicit movement of cash and bearer negotiable instruments; movement and processing of goods; illicit movement of small arms, light weapons, ammunition, explosives and weapons of mass destruction; aviation and maritime security; early-warning and alert systems. This Working Group was established to help Member States strengthen their border-management and border-control systems as set out in Pillar II, in paragraphs 4,5, 7, 8, 13 to 16 and Pillar III, in paragraphs 2, 4 and 11 to 13 of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/border-management-and-law-enforcement-relating-counter-terrorism|title=Border Management and Law Enforcement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Countering the Financing of Terrorism'''

This working group incorporates various international organizations and other united nations entities to reverse the funding of various forms of terrorism.  This working group ensures the standard to countering the finance of terrorism is met according to the International Convention  for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the Financial Action Task Force.  The actions of the working group includes coordinating with different entities on the subject of repression of terrorism finances.  From February 2007 to December 2008, multiple meetings took place with banks, financial intelligence, law enforcement, criminal justice experts, national security intelligence etc. to establish how to efficiently fight the financing of terrorism.

The conclusions from these meeting as to how to suppress terrorism financially include; the criminalization of terrorist financing, the enhancement of domestic and international cooperation, value transfer systems, non-profit organizations, and the freezing of assets.  Based on the conclusions, the International Monetary Fund was able to prepare an action plan with motions for the employment of the above conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/countering-financing-terrorism|title=Countering the finance of Global Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTF)'''

This working group was formed on September 24, 2014 when Resolution 2178 was formed to monitor and control terrorism threats and foreign terrorist fighters.  The definition of Foreign terrorist fighters is people who travel to a state outside of their own to involve themselves in terrorist activities (ie. planning, preparing, perpetration terrorist acts, receiving or providing terrorism training etc.)  The Security Council has stated that terrorist groups such as the Islamic state, Al-Qaida etc. have attracted over 30,000 foreign terrorist fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/focus-areas/foreign-terrorist-fighters/|title=Foreign Terrorist Fighters|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National and Regional Counter-Terrorism Strategies'''

On June 29, 2012, the national and regional efforts to combat terrorism was expanded due to the encouragement from the General Assembly.  This working group is used to assist in unrolling national counterterrorism strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/national-and-regional-counter-terrorism-strategies|title=National and Regional Counterterrorism Strategies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preventing and Responding to WMD Terrorist Attacks'''

This working group is used to monitor the success of the UN strategies in response to terrorist attacks (nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological or any other type of weapons used). The group has formed a communal exchange of information among other UN entities and working groups such as knowledge on existing activities and emergency plans in response to WMD attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/preventing-and-responding-wmd-terrorist-attacks|title=Preventing and Responding to Terrorist Attacks|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preventing Violent Extremism and Conditions Conducive to the Spread of Terrorism'''

Since February 2015, this working group has aided in the Secretary General’s efforts to prevent violent extremism.  The working group gave input on the effects of extremism and the causes of it.  They also provided advice on how to assist member states in preventing violent extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/preventing-violent-extremism|title=Preventing Violent Extremism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Promoting and Protecting Human Rights and the Rule of Law While Countering Terrorism'''

This working group was formed by member states to assure human rights are protected and the rule of law is obeyed.  Pillar IV of the  CTITF plays a large role in the implementation.  The goal of this group is to gather information exchange on human rights and the rule of law capacity building surrounding the concept of counter terrorism.  This working group has now set in place a support and assistance function available to member states to ensure human rights and the rule of law is well established.  In April 2013, a global project was launched by this working group called Capacity Building and Training of Law Enforcement Officials on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and the Prevention of Terrorism.  The goal of this project is to properly train law enforcement officials in charge of counter terrorism on human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-and-rule-law-while-countering-terrorism|title=Promoting and Protecting Human Rights and the Rule of Law While Countering Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protection of Critical Infrastructure Including Internet, Vulnerable Targets and Tourism Security'''

This working group’s role is to uphold confidentiality, respecting human rights under international law.  Their goals are to control efforts, both regionally and internationally to counter terrorism in its various forms on the internet as well as improve security of vulnerable targets such as infrastructure and public places.  The objectives are to;
* establish ways to expedite the development and sharing of the most efficient methods on the protection of vulnerable sites, public spaces or critical infrastructure that are important to the state or internationally.
* fortify the competence of public and private sectors and to augment the development of public and private partnerships on protection of critical infrastructure, including Internet, cyber and tourism security, to prevent and react in an efficient manner to possible risks and threats to related facilities.  This includes promoting awareness and comprehension of the balance required between economic and security issues.
* improve responsiveness and flexibility by having methods in place of planning, prevention, crisis management and recovery
* promote the exchange of information.
* support states in the implementation of the provisions of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy that are relevant to the working group’s focus areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/protection-critical-infrastructure-including-vulnerable-targets-internet-and-tourism-security|title=Protection of Critical Infrastructure including Vulnerable Targets, Internet and Tourism Security|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Supporting and Highlighting Victims of Terrorism'''

The role of this working group is to provide support and aids to victims of terrorism.  They promote the rights of the victims through media platforms, workshops etc.  The mandate of this working group is stated within Pillar I and Pillar IV stating the strategy seeks to “promote international solidarity in support of victims”, stress “the need to promote and protect the rights of victims of terrorism and their families and facilitate the normalization of their lives” and sees the “dehumanization of victims of terrorism” as a major concern that leads to the spread of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/supporting-and-highlighting-victims-terrorism|title=Supporting and Highlighting Victims of Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal and Criminal Justice Responses to Terrorism'''

The three roles of this working group are;  to help coordination in the UN regarding activities of various entities in the UN that are involved in supporting legal and criminal justice in response to terrorism, developing an approach for the UN in dealing with legal and criminal justice matters with regards to terrorism and to give advice and legal assistance to member states with involving legal and criminal justice regarding terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/legal-and-criminal-justice-responses-terrorism|title=Legal and Criminal Justice Responses to Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender Sensitive Approach to Preventing and Countering Terrorism'''

This working group was created because of the fact that women began playing a more important role in the fight against terrorism as they are influential in regards to families, communities and governments.  This working group is still in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/focus-areas/womens-role/|title=Role of women in countering terrorism and violent extremism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Working Group on Communications'''

This working group examines the adequacy of a communication and is allocated by the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.  Consisting of five independent and qualified experts representing five regional groups (geographically), the members, appointed for three years, meet twice a year for five business days to judge the adequacy and quality of communication.  This includes examining if communication separately or in cooperation with other communications demonstrates a consistency of authentic and gross violations of human rights.  As of 2017, the working group consists of Mario L. Coriolano (Argentina), Mikhael Lebedev (Russian Federation), Katharina Pabel (Austria), Changrok Soh (Rebulic of Korea) and Imeru Tamrat Yigezu (Ethiopia). This working group is still in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/ComplaintProcedure/Pages/WGCommunications.aspx|title=Working Group on Communications|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ultimate attribution error''' is a group-level [[Attribution bias|attribution error]] that offers an explanation for how one person views different causes of negative and positive behavior in [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup and outgroup]] members.&lt;ref name="Pettigrew (T.F)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=T. F.|title=The ultimate attribution error: Extending Allport's cognitive analysis of prejudice|journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]|year=1979|volume=5|issue=4|pages=461–476|doi=10.1177/014616727900500407}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Definition== 
Ultimate attribution error is the tendency to internally attribute negative outgroup and positive ingroup behaviour and to externally attribute positive outgroup and negative ingroup behaviour. So in other words, ultimate attribution error arises as a way to explain an outgroup's negative behaviour as flaws in their [[personality]], and to explain an outgroup's positive behaviour as a result of chance or circumstance. It is also the belief that positive acts performed by ingroup members are as a result of their personality, whereas, if an ingroup member behaves negatively (which is believed to be rare), it is a result of situational factors.&lt;ref name="Hewstone (1989)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewstone|first=M.|title=Causal attribution: From cognitive processes to collective beliefs|year=1989|publisher=Blackwell|location=Basil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The ultimate attribution error was first established by Thomas F. Pettigrew in his 1979 publication "The Ultimate Attribution Error: Extending Allport's Cognitive Analysis of Prejudice".&lt;ref name="Pettigrew (T.F)" /&gt; As the title suggests, the ultimate attribution error is a theoretical extension of [[Gordon Allport]]'s work in [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]].

The ultimate attribution error is a systematic patterning of intergroup misattributions shaped in part by one's prejudices. Prejudiced individuals are more likely to attribute an outgroup member's negative behaviors to dispositional, internal (possibly [[Genetics|genetically]] determined), causes. These same prejudiced individuals are also more likely to attribute outgroup member's positive behaviours to (a) "exceptional case", (b) fluke or special advantage, (c) high levels of motivation, or (d) situational context causes. Through these explanations, a prejudiced individual may disassociate a positive behavior from an outgroup individual and their group. In comparison, one is more likely to attribute negative ingroup behaviors to external causes and positive ingroup behaviors to dispositional causes.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

In general, anyone may commit the ultimate attribution error. However, it is most likely to happen to individuals who possess negative prejudices and [[stereotype]]s toward an outgroup. This attribution is considered a root of prejudice, as people who commit this attribution will usually see members of other [[Race (human classification)|races]], [[religion]]s, cultures, or even [[social class]] as dispositionally inferior or flawed, while people from their own racial, cultural, or religious ingroup, upon committing the same negative behaviors, are seen as good people who are dealing with specific situations the best they can. This reduces the acceptance of outgroup members, as any positive behaviors are downplayed and negative behaviors are highlighted.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

==Explaining away positive behavior of outgroup members==
[[File:UAE-EA.png|thumb|Explaining away positive behavior in outgroup members.]]
The attribution of outgroup members' positive behavior is classically categorized into four categories, created at the intersection of perceived degree of controllability of act (low vs high) and perceived [[locus of control]] of act (internal vs external).{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Exceptional case===

The "exceptional case" explanation is created at the intersection of low controllability of act and internal locus of control. Using this mode of reasoning, an individual excludes the particular outgroup member from the outgroup. That is, they individuate the outgroup member, disassociating them from the group. This view allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs through categorizing the "good" member as an exceptional case, while the other members of their group are still seen as "bad".{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Luck or special advantage===

The "luck or special advantage" explanation is created at the intersection of low-perceived controllability of act and external locus of control. This reasoning suggest that the outgroup member's positive behavior is not rooted in their skill, ability, or hard work. Rather, their positive outcome is beyond their immediate control and therefore of little significance. "Special advantage" extends this by suggesting that their group affiliation offers some advantage, and therefore the positive outcome is again of little significance.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Highly motivated===

The "highly motivated" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and internal locus of control. Similar to the exceptional case, the highly motivated explanation individuates the outgroup member and dissociates them from their group. The outgroup member's positive behavior is rooted in their drive to be seen as anti-stereotypic, an external force. Thus, they are not seen as intrinsically exceptional, but externally motivated, and, without this motivation, they would not be able to achieve success. That is, an outgroup member's positive behavior is evidence of their response to external pressures of their interaction with ingroup other. Therefore, without an external source of motivation, the outgroup member is just like any other low-achieving, negative-behavior outgroup member.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Similar to the "exceptional case" explanation, this explanation allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs. That is, the highly motivated outgroup member is seen as hard working, so there must be something wrong with the rest of them.

===Situational===

The "situational" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and external control of the act. An outgroup member's positive outcome is not rooted in their effort or ability, but a result of external situational factors that are, at least in some part, influenced by others. Therefore, their positive behavior is not their own, and is of little consequence.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

==Evidence==
{{undue|date=February 2015}}
The ultimate attribution error is evidenced in a number of studies. Taylor and Jaggi (1974) found results supporting the ultimate attribution error in the causal attributions between religious ingroup and outgroup members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=D. M|author2=Jaggi |title=Ethnocentrism and Causal attribution in a South Indian Context|journal=[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]|year=1974|volume=5|pages=162–171|doi=10.1177/002202217400500202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2x2 [[between-group design]], [[Hindu]] or [[Muslim]] participants were asked to make casual attributions for undesirable acts performed by Hindus or Muslims. Hindus attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Hindus, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Muslims. Conversely, Muslims attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Muslims, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Hindus. While Pettigrew and many others to follow would focus on race, this study offered clear evidence that similar mechanisms are at play among religious groups.

Prior to Pettigrew's formalization of the ultimate attribution error, Birt Duncan (1976) found that [[White people|White]] participants viewed [[Black people|Black]] individuals as more violent than White individuals in an "ambiguous shove" situation, where a Black or White person accidentally shoves a White person.&lt;ref name="Duncan 1976 75–93"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first= B. L.|title= Differential social perception and attribution if intergroup violence: Testing the lower limits of stereotyping of Blacks|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|year= 1976|volume= 34|issue= 4|pages= 75–93|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.34.4.590}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2x2 between-group design, White participants viewed a Black or White individual (harm-doer) ambiguously shoving a Black or White individual (victim). In general, when a Black harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was attributed their high dispositional levels of violence (internal). On the other hand, when a White harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was generally attributed to external constraints. The results suggested that the White students participating in the experiment possessed a lower threshold for labeling a behavior as violent when the harm-doer is Black (outgroup) than when the harm-doer is White (ingroup).

Morris and Peng (1994) find support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error in a comparison of casual attributions made by ingroup and outgroup members about a murder carried out by an ingroup or outgroup assailant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Morris|first= Michael W.|last2= Peng|first2= Kaiping|date= 1994|title=Culture and cause: American and Chinese attributions for social and physical events|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 67|issue= 6|pages= 949–971|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.949}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2x2 between-group design, American or Chinese participants learned about a recent murder committed by an American or Chinese individual. They received the media coverage for the murder and were asked to weight the dispositional and situational explanations for the cause of the number. As the ultimate attribution error predicts, American participants were biased toward dispositional explanations for the Chinese murder suspect, and biased toward situational explanations for the American murder suspect. Similarly, the Chinese participants attributed dispositional causes for the American murder suspect and situational causes for the Chinese murder suspect.

Together, these three studies (Taylor and Jaggi's, Duncan's, and Morris and Peng's) establish the foundation of the ultimate attribution error and support its general prediction that negative behaviors by outgroup members are more likely to be attributed to internal causes than negative behaviors of ingroup members. Many other studies have been published using the ultimate attribution error as a theoretical foundation.

Supporting this general statement, a meta-analysis of 19 ultimate attribution error studies was published in 1990.&lt;ref name="Hewstone 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Hewstone|first= Miles|year= 1990|title= The 'ultimate attribution error'? A review of the literature on intergroup causal attribution|journal= [[European Journal of Social Psychology]]|volume= 20|pages= 311–335|doi= 10.1002/ejsp.2420200404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis offers limited support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error. Specifically, it finds support for three aspects of the ultimate attribution error:
*more internal attribution for positive acts, and less internal attribution for negative acts, by ingroup than outgroup members;
*more attribution of outgroup members' failures to lack of ability, and more explaining away of outgroup members' successes;
*a preference for ingroup-serving versus outgroup-serving attributions for group differences.

{{redirect|Understand}}

'''Understanding''' is a [[psychological]] process related to an abstract or physical object, such as a [[person]], situation, or [[message]] whereby one is able to think about it and use [[concept]]s to deal adequately with that object.
Understanding is a relation between the knower and an object of understanding. Understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect to an object of knowledge that are sufficient to support intelligent behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bereiter|first=Carl|title=Education and mind in the Knowledge Age|url=http://www.cocon.com/observetory/carlbereiter/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225000806/http://www.cocon.com/observetory/carlbereiter/|archivedate=2006-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding is often, though not always, related to learning concepts, and sometimes also the theory or theories associated with those concepts. However, a person may have a good ability to predict the behaviour of an object, animal or system—and therefore may, in some sense, understand it—without necessarily being familiar with the concepts or theories associated with that object, animal or system in their culture. They may have developed their own distinct concepts and theories, which may be equivalent, better or worse than the recognised standard concepts and theories of their culture. Thus, understanding is correlated with the ability to make [[inference]]s.

==Examples==
# One understands the weather if one is able to [[prediction|predict]] (e.g. if it is very cloudy, it may rain) and/or give an [[explanation]] of some of its features, etc.
# A [[psychiatrist]] understands another person's [[anxiety|anxieties]] if he/she knows that person's anxieties, their causes, and can give useful [[Advice (opinion)|advice]] on how to cope with the anxiety.
# One understands a piece of [[rhetoric|reasoning]] or an [[logical argument|argument]] if one can consciously reproduce the information content conveyed by the message.
# One understands a [[language]] to the extent that one can reproduce the information content conveyed by a broad range of spoken utterances or written messages in that language.

==Shallow and deep==
Someone who has a more sophisticated understanding, more predictively accurate understanding, and/or an understanding that allows them to make explanations that others commonly judge to be better, of something, is said to understand that thing "deeply". Conversely, someone who has a more limited understanding of a thing is said to have a "shallow" understanding. However, the depth of understanding required to usefully participate in an occupation or activity may vary greatly.

For example, consider [[multiplication]] of [[integer]]s. Starting from the most shallow level of understanding, we have (at least) the following possibilities:

# A small child may not understand what multiplication is, but may understand that it is a type of [[mathematics]] that they will learn when they are older at school. This is "understanding of context"; being able to put an as-yet not-understood concept into some kind of context. Even understanding that a concept is not part of one's current knowledge is, in itself, a type of understanding (see the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]], which is about people who do not have a good understanding of what they do not know).
# A slightly older child may understand that multiplication of two integers can be done, at least when the numbers are between 1 and 12, by looking up the two numbers in a [[times table]]. They may also be able to memorise and recall the relevant times table in order to answer a multiplication question such as "2 times 4 is what?". This is a simple form of operational understanding; understanding a question well enough to be able to do the operations necessary to be able to find an answer.
# A yet older child may understand that multiplication of larger numbers can be done using a different method, such as [[long multiplication]], or using a [[calculator]]. This is a more advanced form of operational understanding because it supports answering a wider range of questions of the same type.
# A teenager may understand that multiplication is repeated addition, but not understand the broader implications of this. For example, when their teacher refers to multiplying 6 by 3 as "adding 6 to itself 3 times", they may understand that the teacher is talking about two entirely equivalent things. However, they might not understand how to ''apply'' this knowledge to implement multiplication as an [[algorithm]] on a [[computer]] using only addition and [[loop (computing)|looping]] as basic constructs. This level of understanding is "understanding a definition" (or "understanding the definition" when a concept only has one definition).
# A teenager may also understand the mathematical idea of abstracting over individual whole numbers as variables, and how to efficiently (i.e. not via trial-and-error) solve algebraic equations involving multiplication by such variables, such as &lt;math&gt;2x = 6&lt;/math&gt;. This is "relational understanding"; understanding how multiplication relates to division.
# An [[undergraduate]] studying mathematics may come to learn that "the integers equipped with multiplication" is merely one example of a range of mathematical structures called [[monoid|monoids]], and that theorems about monoids apply equally well to multiplication and other types of monoids.

For the purpose of operating a [[cash register]] at [[McDonald's]], a person does not need a very deep understanding of the multiplication involved in calculating the total price of two [[Big Mac]]s. However, for the purpose of contributing to [[number theory]] research, a person would need to have a relatively deep understanding of multiplication — along with other relevant arithmetical concepts such as division and [[prime number]]s.

It is possible for a person, or a piece of "intelligent" software, that in reality only has a shallow understanding of a topic, to appear to have a deeper understanding than they actually do, when the right questions are asked of it. The most obvious way this can happen is by [[memorization]] of correct answers to known questions, but there are other, more subtle ways that a person or computer can (intentionally or otherwise) deceive somebody about their level of understanding, too. This is particularly a risk with [[artificial intelligence]], in which the ability of a piece of artificial intelligence software to very quickly try out millions of possibilities (attempted solutions, theories, etc.) could create a misleading impression of the real depth of its understanding. Supposed AI software could in fact come up with impressive answers to questions that were difficult for unaided humans to answer, without really understanding the concepts ''at all'', simply by dumbly applying rules very quickly. (However, see the [[Chinese room]] argument for a controversial philosophical extension of this argument.)

[[Test (assessment)|Examinations]] are designed to assess students' understanding (and sometimes also other things such as knowledge and writing abilities) without falling prey to these risks. They do this partly by asking multiple different questions about a topic to reduce the risk of [[measurement error]], and partly by forbidding access to reference works and the outside world to reduce the risk of someone else's understanding being passed off as one's own. Because of the faster and more accurate computation and memorization abilities of computers, such tests would arguably often have to be modified if they were to be used to accurately assess the understanding of an artificial intelligence.

Conversely, it is even easier for a person or artificial intelligence to fake a ''shallower'' level of understanding than they actually have; they simply need to respond with the same kind of answers that someone with a more limited understanding, or no understanding, would respond with — such as "I don't know", or obviously wrong answers. This is relevant for judges in [[Turing test]]s; it is unlikely to be effective to simply ask the respondents to mentally calculate the answer to a very difficult arithmetical question, because the computer is likely to simply dumb itself down and pretend not to know the answer.

==As a model==
[[Gregory Chaitin]], a noted computer scientist, propounds a view that comprehension is a kind of [[data compression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Gregory |last=Chaitin |authorlink=Gregory Chaitin |url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |title=The Limits Of Reason |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192140/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "The Limits of Reason", he argues that ''understanding'' something means being able to figure out a simple set of rules that explains it. For example, we understand why day and night exist because we have a simple [[conceptual model|model]]—the rotation of the earth—that explains a tremendous amount of data—changes in brightness, temperature, and atmospheric composition of the earth. We have compressed a large amount of information by using a simple model that [[prediction|predicts]] it. Similarly, we understand the number [[repeating decimal|0.33333...]] by thinking of it as one-third. The first way of representing the number requires five concepts ("0", "decimal point", "3", "infinity", "infinity of 3"); but the second way can produce all the data of the first representation, but uses only three concepts ("1", "division", "3"). Chaitin argues that comprehension is this ability to compress data.

==Components==
=== Cognition and affect ===
{{Main article | cognition | affect (psychology)}}
Cognition is the process by which [[sense|sensory]] inputs are transformed. Affect refers to the experience of feelings or [[emotion]]s. Cognition and affect constitute understanding.

==Religious perspectives==
In [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], understanding is one of the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]].
