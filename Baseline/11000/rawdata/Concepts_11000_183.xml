By Mary Wollstonecraft. The Second Edition. London: Printed for J. Johnson, No. 72, St. Paul's Church-Yard. M.DCC.XC."|Title page from the second edition of ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'', the first to carry [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft's]] name]]

{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}
'''''A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; Occasioned by His Reflections on the Revolution in France''''' (1790) is a political [[pamphlet]], written by the 18th-century British liberal feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Mary Wollstonecraft – Equal Rights for Women|journal=Foundation for Economic Education|url=https://fee.org/articles/mary-wollstonecraft-equal-rights-for-women/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attacks [[aristocracy]] and advocates [[republicanism]]. Wollstonecraft's was the first response in a [[Revolution Controversy|pamphlet war]] sparked by the publication of [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), a defense of [[Constitutional monarchy#Constitutional monarchy in the United Kingdom|constitutional monarchy]], aristocracy, and the [[Church of England]].

Wollstonecraft attacked not only hereditary privilege, but also the rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for [[Marie Antoinette]], but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the ''[[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]'' and the ''beautiful'', terms first established by Burke himself in ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1756), she kept his rhetoric as well as his argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar [[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia Johnson]] describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force,&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Johnson, 27; see also, Todd, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.

In her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her [[utopia]]n picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical ''tableaux''.

The ''Rights of Men'' was successful: it was reviewed by every major periodical of the day and the first edition, published anonymously, sold out in three weeks. However, upon the publication of the second edition (the first to carry Wollstonecraft's name on the title page), the reviews began to evaluate the text not only as a political pamphlet but also as the work of a female writer. They contrasted Wollstonecraft's "passion" with Burke's "reason" and spoke condescendingly of the text and its female author. This remained the prevailing analysis of the ''Rights of Men'' until the 1970s, when [[feminist literary criticism|feminist scholars]] revisited Wollstonecraft's texts and endeavoured to bring greater attention to their intellectualism.

==Historical context==

===Revolution Controversy===
{{main|Revolution Controversy}}
[[File:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=The focus of the chalk drawing is at the center, where one man is standing on a table. Below him, three men are grouped together, joining hands. Around them are dozes of men, with their hands upraised. People look in from the windows.|''Tennis Court Oath'' (1791) by [[Jacques-Louis David]]]]

''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'' was written against the backdrop of the [[French Revolution]] and the debates that it provoked in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the ''[[Revolution Controversy]]'', which lasted from 1789 until the end of 1795, British political commentators argued over the validity of monarchy. One scholar has called this debate "perhaps the last real discussion of the fundamentals of politics in [Britain]".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Butler, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of popular agitation in revolutionary France, demonstrated in events such as the [[Tennis Court Oath]] and the [[storming of the Bastille]] in 1789, reinvigorated the [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|British reform movement]], which had been largely moribund for a decade. Efforts to reform the British electoral system and to distribute the seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] more equitably were revived.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the vigorous political debate in the 1790s was sparked by the publication of [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' in November 1790. Most commentators in Britain expected Burke to support the French revolutionaries, because he had previously been part of the liberal [[British Whig Party|Whig]] party, a critic of monarchical power, a supporter of the [[American revolution]]aries, and a prosecutor of government malfeasance in India. When he failed to do so, it shocked the populace and angered his friends and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 33; Kelly, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's book, despite being priced at an expensive three [[shilling]]s, sold an astonishing 30,000 copies in two years.&lt;ref name="Butler345"&gt;Butler, 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Paine|Thomas Paine's]] famous response, ''[[The Rights of Man]]'' (1792), which became the rallying cry for thousands, however, greatly surpassed it, selling upwards of 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'' was published only weeks after Burke's ''Reflections''. While Burke supported aristocracy, monarchy, and the Established Church, liberals such as [[William Godwin]], Paine, and Wollstonecraft, argued for [[republicanism]], agrarian socialism, [[anarchy]], and religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those who came to be called radicals supported similar aims: individual liberties and [[civic virtue]]. They were also united in the same broad criticisms: opposition to the bellicose "landed interest" and its role in government corruption, and opposition to a monarchy and aristocracy who they believed were unlawfully seizing the people's power.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

1792 was the "''annus mirabilis'' of eighteenth-century radicalism": its most important texts were published and the influence of radical associations, such as the [[London Corresponding Society]] (LCS) and the [[Society for Constitutional Information]] (SCI), was at its height.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "Introductory essay", 7; see also Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xii.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until these middle- and working-class groups formed an alliance with the genteel [[Friends of the People Society|Society of the Friends of the People]] that the government became concerned. After this alliance was formed, the conservative-dominated government prohibited [[seditious]] writings. Over 100 prosecutions for sedition took place in the 1790s alone, a dramatic increase from previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government, fearing an uprising similar to the French Revolution, took even more drastic steps to quash the radicals: they made ever more political arrests and infiltrated radical groups; they threatened to "revoke the licences of publicans who continued to host politicised debating societies and to carry reformist literature"; they seized the mail of "suspected dissidents"; they supported groups that disrupted radical events; and they attacked dissidents in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Radicals saw this period, which included the [[1794 Treason Trials]], as "the institution of a system of TERROR, almost as hideous in its features, almost as gigantic in its stature, and infinitely more pernicious in its tendency, than France ever knew."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

When, in October 1795, crowds threw refuse at [[George III]] and insulted him, demanding a cessation of the [[French revolutionary wars|war with France]] and lower bread prices, Parliament immediately passed the "gagging acts" (the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1795|Seditious Meetings Act]] and the [[Treasonable Practices Act]], also known as the "Two Acts"). Under these new laws, it was almost impossible to hold public meetings and speech was severely curtailed at those that were held.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxv; Keen, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; British radicalism was effectively muted during the later 1790s and 1800s. It was not until the next generation that any [[Reform Act 1832|real reform]] could be enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "Introductory essay", 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burke's ''Reflections''===
{{main|Reflections on the Revolution in France}}

Published partially in response to [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] clergyman [[Richard Price|Richard Price's]] sermon celebrating the French revolution, Burke used the device of a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, and [[primogeniture]].&lt;ref name="Butler345"/&gt; He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In ''Reflections'', he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, the result would be anarchy.
[[File:BurkeReflections.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Page reads "Reflections on the Revolution in France, and on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to that Event. In a Letter Intended to have been sent to a Gentleman in Paris. By the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. London: Printed for J. Dodsley, in Pall-Mall. M.DCC.XC."|Title page from [[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790)]]
Burke criticizes many British thinkers and writers who welcomed the early stages of the French Revolution. While the radicals likened the revolution to Britain's own [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argues that the appropriate historical analogy was the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651), in which [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been executed in 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 1–2; 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Burke was writing, however, there had been very little revolutionary violence; more concerned with persuading his readers than informing them, he greatly exaggerated this element of the revolution in his text for rhetorical effect. In his ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', he had argued that "large inexact notions convey ideas best", and to generate fear in the reader, in ''Reflections'' he constructs the set-piece of [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] forced from their palace at sword point. When the violence actually escalated in France in 1793 with the [[Reign of Terror]], Burke was viewed as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke also criticizes the learning associated with the French ''[[philosophes]]''; he maintains that new ideas should not, in an imitation of the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society in an effort to improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.&lt;ref name="Butler345"/&gt;

===Composition and publication of the ''Rights of Men''===
In the advertisement printed at the beginning of the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft describes how and why she wrote it:
{{quote|text=
MR. BURKE'S Reflections on the French Revolution first engaged my attention as the transient topic of the day; and reading it more for amusement than information, my indignation was roused by the sophistical arguments, that every moment crossed me, in the questionable shape of natural feelings and common sense.

Many pages of the following letter were the effusions of the moment; but, swelling imperceptibly to a considerable size, the idea was suggested of publishing a short vindication of ''the Rights of Men.''

Not having leisure or patience to follow this desultory writer through all the devious tracks in which his fancy has started fresh game, I have confined my strictures, in a great measure, to the grand principles at which he has levelled many ingenious arguments in a very specious garb.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
So the pamphlet could be published as soon as she finished writing it, Wollstonecraft wrote frantically while her publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]] printed the pages. In fact, Godwin's ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Memoirs]]'' of Wollstonecraft tells that the sheets of manuscript were delivered to the press as they were written.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway through the work, however, she ceased writing. One biographer describes it as a "loss of nerve"; Godwin, in his ''Memoirs'', describes it as "a temporary fit of torpor and indolence".&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, perhaps canny enough at this point in their friendship to know how to encourage her, agreed to dispose of the book and told her not to worry about it. Ashamed, she rushed to finish.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 164; see also Johnson, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'' was published anonymously on 29 November 1790, the first of between fifty and seventy responses to Burke by various authors.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 60; Taylor, 7; Sapiro, 23; Myers, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Only three weeks later, on 18 December, a second edition, with her name printed on the title page, was issued.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft took time to edit the second edition, which, according to biographer Emily Sunstein, "sharpened her personal attack on Burke" and changed much of the text from [[First-person narrative|first person]] to [[third-person narrative|third person]]; "she also added a non-partisan code criticising hypocritical liberals who talk equality but scrape before the powers that be."&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and major arguments==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|right|thumb|Near-profile, half-length portrait of a man wearing a brown suit who has reddish-brown hair and a ruddy complexion.|[[Edmund Burke]], painted by the studio of [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] (1771)]]

Until the 1970s, the ''Rights of Men'' was typically considered disorganized, incoherent, illogical, and replete with ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks (such as the suggestion that Burke would have promoted the crucifixion of Christ if he were a Jew).&lt;ref name="W434"&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been touted as an example of "feminine" emotion tilting at "masculine" reason.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 26; Myers, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1970s scholars have challenged this view, arguing that Wollstonecraft employed 18th-century modes of writing, such as the digression, to great rhetorical effect. More importantly, as scholar Mitzi Myers argues, "Wollstonecraft is virtually alone among those who answered Burke in eschewing a narrowly political approach for a wide-ranging critique of the foundation of the ''Reflections''."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft makes a primarily moral argument; her "polemic is not a confutation of Burke's political theories, but an exposure of the cruel inequities which those theories presuppose."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's style was also a deliberate choice, enabling her to respond to Burke's ''Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful'' as well as to ''Reflections''.&lt;ref name="Johnson26"&gt;Johnson, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the ''Rights of Men'' mirrors much of Burke's own text. It has no clear structure; like ''Reflections'', the text follows the mental associations made by the author as she was writing.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 58; Kelly, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's political treatise is written, like Burke's, in the form of a letter: his to C. J. F. DePont, a young Frenchman, and hers to Burke himself.&lt;ref name="Sapiro197"&gt;Sapiro, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the same form, metaphors, and style as Burke, she turns his own argument back on him. The ''Rights of Men'' is as much about language and argumentation as it is about political theory; in fact, Wollstonecraft claims that these are inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 197; Myers, 121; Kelly, 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; She advocates, as one scholar writes, "simplicity and honesty of expression, and argument employing reason rather than eloquence."&lt;ref name="Sapiro197"/&gt; At the beginning of the pamphlet, she appeals to Burke: "Quitting now the flowers of rhetoric, let us, Sir, reason together."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rights of Men'' does not aim to present a fully articulated alternative political theory to Burke's, but instead to demonstrate the weaknesses and contradictions in his own argument. Therefore, much of the text is focused on Burke's logical inconsistencies, such as his support of the American revolution and the [[George IV of the United Kingdom#Regency crisis of 1788|Regency Bill]] (which proposed restricting monarchical power during George III's madness in 1788), in contrast to his lack of support for the French revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 26; see also, Poovey 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In criticism of Burke's contradictory support of the Regency Bill along with supporting the rule of monarchy in France, she writes:
{{quote|text=
You were so eager to taste the sweets of power, that you could not wait till time had determined, whether a dreadful delirium would settle into a confirmed madness; but, prying into the secrets of Omnipotence, you thundered out that God had ''hurled him from his throne'', and that it was the most insulting mockery to recollect that he had been a king, or treat him with any particular respect on account of his former dignity…. I have, Sir, been reading, with a scrutinizing, comparative eye, several of your insensible and profane speeches during the King's illness. I disdain to take advantage of a man's weak side, or draw consequences from an unguarded transport—A lion preys not on carcasses!&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [emphasis Wollstonecraft's]
}}
Wollstonecraft's goal, she writes, is "to shew you [Burke] to yourself, stripped of the gorgeous drapery in which you have enwrapped your tyrannic principles."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 70; see also Myers, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she does also gesture towards a larger argument of her own, focusing on the inequalities faced by British citizens because of the class system.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 82; Todd, 218; Kelly, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; As Wollstonecraft scholar Barbara Taylor writes, "treating Burke as a representative spokesman for old-regime despotism, Wollstonecraft champions the reformist initiatives of the new French government against his 'rusty, baneful opinions', and censures British political elites for their opulence, corruption, and inhumane treatment of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political theory==

===Attack against rank and privilege===
Wollstonecraft's attack on rank and hierarchy dominates the ''Rights of Men''. She chastises Burke for his contempt for the people, whom he dismisses as the "swinish multitude", and berates him for supporting the elite, most notably [[Marie Antoinette]].&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 199; Jones, 49; Johnson, 28; Myers, 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous passage, Burke had written: "I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Butler, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) and ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution'' (1794) extend the specific arguments made in the ''Rights of Men'' into larger social and political contexts.&lt;!--this sentence seems a bit out of place here--&gt;

Contrasting her middle-class values against Burke's aristocratic ones, Wollstonecraft contends that people should be judged on their merits rather than on their birthrights.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 83; Kelly, 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; As Wollstonecraft scholar [[Janet Todd]] writes, "the vision of society revealed [in] ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'' was one of talents, where entrepreneurial, unprivileged children could compete on equal terms with the now wrongly privileged."&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft emphasizes the benefits of hard work, self-discipline, frugality, and morality, values she contrasts with the "vices of the rich", such as "insincerity" and the "want of natural affections".&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 95; see also Jones, 49; 51; Poovey, 65; Myers, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; She endorses a [[commercialism|commercial]] society that would help individuals discover their own potential as well as force them to realize their civic responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; For her, commercialism would be the great equalizing force.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, several years later, in ''[[Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark]]'' (1796), she would question the ultimate benefits of commercialism to society.

While [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] clergyman [[Richard Price]], whose sermon helped spark Burke's work, is the villain of ''Reflections'', he is the hero of the ''Rights of Men''. Both Wollstonecraft and Burke associate him with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, particularly the notion that civilization could progress through rational debate, but they interpret that stance differently. Burke believed such relentless questioning would lead to anarchy, while Wollstonecraft connected Price with "reason, liberty, free discussion, mental superiority, the improving exercise of the mind, moral excellence, active benevolence, orientation toward the present and future, and the rejection of power and riches"—quintessential middle-class professional values.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 118; Kelly, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher [[John Locke|John Locke's]] definition of property (that is, ownership acquired through labour) against Burke's notion of inherited wealth. She contends that inheritance is one of the major impediments to the progress of European civilization,&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro 84; see also, Jones, 49–50; Sapiro, xx; Furniss, 60; Kelly, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems are rooted in the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal [[distribution of wealth]], she did desire one that was more equitable.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republicanism===
[[File:Shepherd-vernet.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Landscape painting, showing a mountain scene with an adoring couple surrounded by sheep in the foreground. The scene is dominated by a large, leafy green tree at the left and blue sky with white clouds, contrasted against the mountain at the top of the painting.|''Shepherd in the Alps'' by [[Claude Joseph Vernet]]; an idyllic rural life is part of the political utopia Wollstonecraft depicts in the ''Rights of Men''.]]

The ''Rights of Men'' indicts monarchy and hereditary distinctions and promotes a [[republicanism|republican]] ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue is at the core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional [[Commonwealth men|Commonwealth]] ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 43; Sapiro, xx; Johnson, 25; Kelly, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.&lt;ref name="Todd166"&gt;Todd, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft's ideas of virtue revolved around the family, distinguishing her from other republicans such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] and [[William Godwin]].&lt;ref name="Jones446"&gt;Jones, 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wollstonecraft, virtue begins in the home: private virtues are the foundation for public virtues.&lt;ref name="multiref2"&gt;Sapiro, 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's]] depictions of the ideal family and the republican [[Swiss canton]], she draws a picture of idyllic family life in a small country village.&lt;ref name="Jones446"/&gt;  One scholar describes her plan this way: "vast estates would be divided into small farms, cottagers would be allowed to make enclosures from the commons and, instead of alms being given to the poor, they would be given the means to independence and self-advancement."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals would learn and practice virtue in the home, virtue that would not only make them self-sufficient, but also prompt them to feel responsible for the citizens of their society.

===Tradition versus revolution===
One of the central arguments of Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'' is that rights should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, not because they are traditional.&lt;ref name="W434"/&gt; While Burke argued that civil society and government should rely on traditions which had accrued over centuries, Wollstonecraft contends that all civil agreements are subject to rational reassessment. Precedence, she maintains, is no reason to accept a law or a constitution. As one scholar puts it, "Burke's belief in the antiquity of the British constitution and the impossibility of improvement upon a system that has been tried and tested through time is dismissed as nonsense. The past, for Wollstonecraft, is a scene of superstition, oppression, and ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft believed powerfully in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notion of progress, and rejected the contention that ancient ideas could not be improved upon.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 164; Kelly, 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Using Burke's own architectural language, she asks, "why was it a duty to repair an ancient castle, built in barbarous ages, of Gothic materials?"&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes, pointedly, that Burke's philosophy condones [[slavery]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 209; Kelly, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=
[T]he whole tenor of his plausible arguments settles slavery on an everlasting foundation. Allowing his servile reverence for antiquity, and prudent attention to self-interest, to have the force which he insists on, the slave trade ought never to be abolished; and, because our ignorant forefathers, not understanding the native dignity of man, sanctioned a traffic that outrages every suggestion of reason and religion, we are to submit to the inhuman custom, and term an atrocious insult to humanity the love of our country, and a proper submission to the laws by which our property is secured.—Security of property! Behold, in a few words, the definition of English liberty. And to this selfish principle every nobler one is sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensibility==

She is arranging a group of pink flowers.|[[Marie Antoinette]], painted by [[Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun]] (1783); Wollstonecraft attacks Burke for his self-indulgent sympathy for the French queen.]]

In the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft not only endorses [[republicanism]], but also a social contract based on sympathy and fellow-feeling.&lt;ref name="Jones446"/&gt; She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by cohesive families, connect with others through rational sympathy.&lt;ref name="Jones446"/&gt; Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at [[Newington Green]] just a few years earlier, Wollstonecraft asserts that people should strive to imitate God by practicing universal benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embracing a reasoned [[sensibility]], Wollstonecraft contrasts her theory of civil society with Burke's, which she describes as full of pomp and circumstance and riddled with prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 48; Myers, 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt; She attacks what she perceives as Burke's false feeling, countering with her own genuine emotion. She argues that to be sympathetic to the French revolution (i.e., the people) is humane while to sympathize with the French clergy, as Burke does, is a mark of inhumanity.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 62; Kelly, 97.&lt;/ref&gt; She accuses Burke not only of insincerity, but also of manipulation, claiming that his ''Reflections'' is propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 163; Sapiro, 201–205.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the most dramatic moments of the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft claims to be moved beyond Burke's tears for [[Marie Antoinette]] and the monarchy of France to silence for the injustice suffered by slaves, a silence she represents with dashes meant to express feelings more authentic than Burke's:&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=
Man preys on man; and you mourn for the idle tapestry that decorated a gothic pile, and the dronish bell that summoned the fat priest to prayer. You mourn for the empty pageant of a name, when slavery flaps her wing, and the sick heart retires to die in lonely wilds, far from the abodes of men....Why is our fancy to be appalled by terrific perspectives of a hell beyond the grave?—Hell stalks abroad;—the lash resounds on the slave's naked sides; and the sick wretch, who can no longer earn the sour bread of unremitting labour, steals to a ditch to bid the world a long good night—or, neglected in some ostentatious hospital, breathes his last amidst the laugh of mercenary attendants.

Such misery demands more than tears—I pause to recollect myself; and smother the contempt I feel rising for your rhetorical flourishes and infantine sensibility.

&lt;nowiki&gt;---------------&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;---------------&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and aesthetics==
[[File:MaryWollstonecraft.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Half-length portrait of a woman leaning on a desk with a book and an inkstand. She is wearing a blue-striped dress and a gray, curly wig crossed by a white band of cloth.|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]], painted by [[John Opie]] (c. 1791)]]

In the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft challenges Burke's rhetoric as much as, or more, than his political theory. She begins by redefining the ''[[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]'' and the ''beautiful'', terms he had established in his ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 26; Sapiro, 121–22; Kelly, 90; 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; While Burke associates the beautiful with weakness and femininity, and the sublime with strength and masculinity, Wollstonecraft writes, "for truth, in morals, has ever appeared to me the essence of the sublime; and, in taste, simplicity the only criterion of the beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; With this sentence, she calls into question Burke's gendered definitions; convinced that they are harmful, she argues later in the ''Rights of Men'':
{{quote|text=
You may have convinced [women] that littleness and weakness are the very essence of beauty; and that the Supreme Being, in giving women beauty in the most supereminent {{sic}} degree, seemed to command them, by the powerful voice of Nature, not to cultivate the moral virtues that might chance to excite respect, and interfere with the pleasing sensations they were created to inspire. Thus confining truth, fortitude, and humanity, within the rigid pale of manly morals, they might justly argue, that to be loved, woman's high end and great distinction! they should 'learn to lisp, to totter in their walk, and nick-name God's creatures.' Never, they might repeat after you, was any man, much less a woman, rendered amiable by the force of those exalted qualities, fortitude, justice, wisdom, and truth; and thus forewarned of the sacrifice they must make to those austere, unnatural virtues, they would be authorised to turn all their attention to their persons, systematically neglecting morals to secure beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft,  ''Vindications'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
As Wollstonecraft scholar [[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia Johnson]] has written, "As feminist critique, these passages have never really been surpassed."&lt;ref name="multiref1"/&gt; Burke, Wollstonecraft maintains, describes womanly virtue as weakness, thus leaving women no substantive roles in the public sphere and relegating them to uselessness.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft applies this feminist critique to Burke's language throughout the ''Reflections''. As Johnson argues, "her pamphlet as a whole refutes the Burkean axiom 'to make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely'"; Wollstonecraft successfully challenges Burke's rhetoric of the beautiful with the rhetoric of the rational.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 27; see also Myers, 127–28; Kelly, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; She also demonstrates how Burke embodies the worst of his own ideas. He becomes the hysterical, illogical, feminine writer, and Wollstonecraft becomes the rational, masculine writer. Ironically, in order to effect this transposition, Wollstonecraft herself becomes passionate at times, for example, in her description of slavery (quoted above).&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 163; Taylor, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:WollstonecraftMacaulayLetter.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Handwritten letter reads "Madam Now I venture to send you [cut out] with a name utterly unknown to you in the [?], it is necessary to apologize for thus intruding on you—but instead of an apology shall I tell you the truth? You are the only female writer who I consider in opinion with respecting the [?] our sex ought to endeavour to attain the world. I respect Mrs. Macaulay Graham because she contends for [?] whilst most of her sex only seeks for flowers. I am Madam, Yours respectually, Mary Wollstonecraft Thursday Morning."|Letter sent by [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]] to [[Catharine Macaulay]] along with a copy of the ''Rights of Men'']]

The ''Rights of Men'' was successful, its price contributing in no small measure: at one shilling and sixpence it was half the price of Burke's book.&lt;ref name="Todd166"/&gt; After the first edition sold out, Wollstonecraft agreed to have her name printed on the title page of the second. It was her first extensive work as "a self-supporting professional and self-proclaimed intellectual", as scholar Mary Poovey writes, and:
{{quote|text=
took the form that most people would have considered the least appropriate for a woman—the political disquisition. Requiring knowledge of government (in which women had no share), analytical ability (of which women theoretically had little), and the ambition to participate directly in contemporary events (of which women were supposed to have none), political disquisition was in every sense a masculine domain.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Commentaries from the time note this; [[Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford|Horace Walpole]], for example, called her a "hyena in petticoats" for attacking Marie Antoinette. [[William Godwin]], her future husband, described the book as illogical and ungrammatical; in his ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Memoirs]]'' of Wollstonecraft, he dedicated only a paragraph to a discussion of the content of the work, calling it "intemperate".&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, 73; see also Todd, 168; Sapiro, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the major periodicals of the day reviewed the ''Rights of Men''. The ''[[Analytical Review]]'' agreed with Wollstonecraft's arguments and praised her "lively and animated remarks".&lt;ref name="Wardle1201"&gt;Wardle, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Monthly Review'' was also sympathetic, but it pointed out faults in her writing. The ''Critical Review'', the "sworn foe" of the  ''Analytical Review'',&lt;ref name="Wardle1201"/&gt; however, wrote in December 1790, after discovering that the author was a woman:
{{quote|text=
It has been observed in an old play, that minds have no sex; and in truth we did not discover this Defender of the Rights of ''Man'' to be a ''Woman''. The second edition, however, which often reveals secrets, has attributed this pamphlet to Mrs. Wollstonecraft, and if she assumes the disguise of a man, she must not be surprised that she is not treated with the civility and respect that she would have received in her own person. As the article was written before we saw the second edition, we have presented an acknowledgement of this kind to the necessary alterations. It would not have been sufficient to have corrected merely verbal errors: a Lady should have been addressed with more respect. [emphasis in original]&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Kelly, 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' followed suit, criticizing the book's logic and "its absurd presumption that men will be happier if free", as well as Wollstonecraft's own presumption in writing on topics outside of her proper domain, commenting "the ''rights of men'' asserted by a fair lady! The age of chivalry cannot be over, or the sexes have changed their ground."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Todd, 472, n.34; see also Wardle, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Rights of Men'' put Wollstonecraft on the map as a writer; from this point forward in her career, she was well known.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 113; Kelly, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft sent a copy of the book to the historian [[Catharine Macaulay]], whom she greatly admired. Macaulay wrote back that she was "still more highly pleased that this publication which I have so greatly admired from its pathos &amp; sentiment should have been written by a woman and thus to see my opinion of the powers and talents of the sex in your pen so early verified."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Todd, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Roscoe]], a Liverpool lawyer, writer, and patron of the arts, liked the book so much that he included Wollstonecraft in his satirical poem ''The Life, Death, and Wonderful Achievements of Edmund Burke'':

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|alt=Men with guns being led by a half-naked woman who is holding the French flag. She and they are walking over dead bodies. The painting is structured like a triangle, with the woman at the apex. The dead are lying at the base of the triangle.|thumb|250px|right|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1833)]]

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
And lo! an amazon stept out,
  One WOLLSTONECRAFT her name,
Resolv'd to stop his mad career,
  Whatever chance became.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sapiro, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

While most of the early reviewers of the ''Rights of Men'', as well as most of Wollstonecraft's early biographers, criticized the work's emotionalism, and juxtaposed it with Burke's masterpiece of logic, there has been a recent re-evaluation of her text. Since the 1970s, critics who have looked more closely at both her work and Burke's, have come to the conclusion that they share many rhetorical similarities, and that the masculine/logic and feminine/emotion binaries are unsupportable.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 25; 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Wollstonecraft scholars now recognize it was this work that radicalized Wollstonecraft and directed her future writings, particularly ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. It is not until after the halfway point of ''Rights of Men'' that she begins the dissection of Burke's gendered aesthetic; as Claudia Johnson contends, "it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of ''Rights of Men'' she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career."&lt;ref name="Johnson26"/&gt;

Two years later, when Wollstonecraft published the ''Rights of Woman'', she extended many of the arguments she had begun in ''Rights of Men''. If all people should be judged on their merits, she wrote, women should be included in that group.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.&lt;ref name="multiref2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23358">The term '''abjection''' literally means "the state of being cast off." The term has been explored in [[post-structuralism]] as that which inherently disturbs conventional identity and cultural concepts.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular interpretations of abjection is [[Julia Kristeva]]'s (pursued particularly in her work ''[[Powers of Horror]]''). Kristeva describes subjective horror (abjection) as the feeling when an individual experiences, or is confronted by (both mentally and as a body), what Kristeva terms one's "corporeal reality", or a breakdown in the distinction between what is [[Self (philosophy)|self]] and what is [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of abjection is best described as the process by which one separates one's sense of self from that which immediately threatens one's sense of life. Abjection prevents the absolute realization of existence, completing the course of biological, social, physical, and spiritual cycles. The best representation of this concept can be imagined as one's reaction to gazing at a human cadaver, or corpse, as a direct reminder of the inevitability of death.

The abject is, as such, the process that separates from one's environment what "is not me."

Kristeva's concept of abjection is utilized commonly to explain popular cultural narratives of horror, and discriminatory behavior manifesting in [[misogyny]], [[misandry]], [[homophobia]], and [[genocide]]. The concept of abjection builds on the traditional psychoanalytic theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012) p. 92; Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literary critical theory==
Drawing on the French tradition of interest in the monstrous (e.g., novelist [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]),&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Brereton, ''A Short History of French Literature'' (1954), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] as grounded in "filth" (e.g., psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]),&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Kristeva]] developed the idea of the abject as that which is rejected by/disturbs social reason{{snd}}the communal consensus that underpins a social order.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kristeva, ''Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection'' (1982)m p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The "abject" exists accordingly somewhere between the concept of an [[object (philosophy)|object]] and the concept of the subject, representing [[taboo]] elements of the self barely separated off in a [[Liminality|liminal]] space.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Kristeva claims that within the boundaries of what one defines as subject{{snd}}a part of oneself{{snd}}and object{{snd}}something that exists independently of oneself{{snd}}there resides pieces that were once categorized as a part of oneself or one's identity that has since been rejected{{snd}}the abject.

It is important to note, however, that Kristeva created a distinction in the true meaning of abjection: it is not the lack of "cleanliness or health" that causes abjection, but that which disturbs identity, system, and order.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror", p. 4; Guberman, "Julia Kristeva Interviews", (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the abject is situated outside the [[symbolic order]], being forced to face it is an inherently traumatic experience, as with the repulsion presented by confrontation with filth, waste, or a corpse{{snd}}an object which is violently cast out of the cultural world, having once been a subject.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/10269033/-Kristeva-Abjection-Short-Version Julia Kristeva, 'Approaching Abjection'].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the sense of the abject complements the existence of the [[superego]]{{snd}}the representative of culture, of the symbolic order:&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; in Kristeva's aphorism, "To each ego its object, to each superego its abject".&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kristeva's psychoanalytic perspective, abjection is done to the part of ourselves that we exclude: the mother. We must abject the maternal, the object which has created us, in order to construct an identity.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; Abjection occurs on the micro level of the speaking being, through their subjective dynamics, as well as on the macro level of society, through "language as a common and universal law". We use [[ritual]]s, specifically those of defilement, to attempt to maintain clear boundaries between nature and society, the semiotic and the symbolic, paradoxically both excluding and renewing contact with the abject in the ritual act.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Creed, in Ken Gelder, ''The Horror Reader'' (2000), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of abjection is often coupled (and sometimes confused) with the idea of [[The Uncanny (Freud)|the uncanny]], the concept of something being "un-home-like", or foreign, yet familiar.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The abject can be uncanny in the sense that we can recognize aspects in it, despite its being "foreign": a corpse, having fallen out of the symbolic order, creates abjection through its uncanniness&lt;ref&gt;Winifred Menninghaus, ''Disgust'' (2003), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}creates a [[cognitive dissonance]].

===Cases===
* Abjection is a major theme of the 1949 work ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'' (Journal du Voleur) by French author [[Jean Genet]], a fictionalised account of his wanderings through Europe in the 1930s, wherein he claims as a criminal outcast to actively seek abjections as an [[existentialist]] form of 'sainthood'&lt;ref&gt;Gene A. Plunka, ''The Rites of Passage of Jean Genet'' (1992), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) has been analysed as an example of how in [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]] monstrous representations of the female resonate with the abject archaic figure of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Creed]], ''The Monstrous Feminine'' (1993), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodily dismemberment, forcible impregnation, and the chameleon nature of the alien itself may all be seen as explorations of phantasies of the [[primal scene]], and of the encounter with the boundaryless nature of the original abject mother.&lt;ref&gt;Creed, p. 17 and p. 26–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1990s-era Australian literary genre [[grunge lit]] often focuses on young adult characters with "abject" bodies &lt;ref&gt;Gelder K. and Salzman P.

For example, the male and female lead characters in [[Andrew McGahan]]'s book ''[[Praise]]'', Gordon Buchanan and Cynthia Lamonde, both have diseased bodies, with Cynthia facing skin that breaks out in rashes. Karen Brooks states that Clare Mendes'  ''Drift Street'', Edward Berridge's ''[[The Lives of the Saints (fiction)|The Lives of the Saints]]'', and ''[[Praise]]'' "...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other" and "opening up" new "limnal [boundary] spaces" where the concept of an abject human body can be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that the marginalized characters in ''The Lives of the Saints'', ''Drift Street'' and ''Praise'') are able to stay in "shit creek" (an undesirable setting or situation) and "diver[t]... flows" of these "creeks", thus claiming their rough settings' "limnality" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own "abjection" (having "abject bodies" with health problems, disease, etc.) as "sites of symbolic empowerment and agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social critical theory==
"Abjection" is often used to describe the state of often-[[marginalized]] groups, such as women, unwed mothers, people of minority religious faiths, sex workers, convicts, poor and disabled people. From a deconstruction of sexual discourses and gender history Ian McCormick has outlined the recurring links between pleasurable transgressive desire, deviant categories of behaviour and responses to body fluids in 18th and 19th-century discussions of prostitution, sodomy, and masturbation (self-pollution, impurity, uncleanness).&lt;ref&gt;''Sexual Outcasts''. 4 vols., edited with introductions by Ian McCormick (London and New York: Routledge, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In organizational studies===
[[Organizational theory]] literature on abjection has attempted to illuminate various ways in which institutions come to silence, exclude or disavow feelings, practices, groups or discourses within the workplace. Studies have examined and demonstrated the manner in which people adopt roles, identities and discourses to avoid the consequences of social and organizational abjection.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny (2010); Bulter (2004); cited in Risque, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279–80.&lt;/ref&gt; In such studies the focus is often placed upon a group of people within an organization or institution that fall outside of the norm, thus becoming what Kristeva terms "the one by whom the abject exists," or "the deject" people.&lt;ref&gt;"Powers of Horror", p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions and organizations typically rely on rituals and other structural practices to protect symbolic elements from the [[semiotic]], both in a grander organizational focus that emphasizes the role of policy-making, and in a smaller interpersonal level that emphasizes social rejection. Both the organizational and interpersonal levels produce a series of exclusionary practices that create a "zone of inhabitability" for staff perceived to be in opposition to the organizational norms.

One such method is that of "collective instruction," which refers to a strategy often used to defer, render abject and hide the inconvenient "dark side" of the organization, keeping it away from view through corporate forces.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson, "Changing the memory of suffering: An organizational aesthetics on the dark side" (2014), p. 281–3.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the process by which an acceptable, unified meaning is created{{snd}}for example, a corporation's or organization's [[mission statement]]. Through the controlled release of information and belief or reactionary statements, people are gradually exposed to a firm's persuasive interpretation of an event or circumstance, that could have been considered abject. This [[spin (public relations)|spun meaning]] developed by the firm becomes shared throughout a community. That event or circumstance comes to be interpreted and viewed in a singular way by many people, creating a unified, accepted meaning. The purpose such strategies serve is to identify and attempt to control the abject, as the abject ideas become ejected from each individual memory.

Organizations such as hospitals must negotiate the divide between the symbolic and the semiotic in a unique manner.&lt;ref&gt;Risq, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nurses, for example, are confronted with the abject in a more concrete, physical fashion due to their proximity to the ill, wounded and dying. They are faced with the reality of death and suffering in a way not typically experienced by hospital administrators and leaders. Nurses must learn to separate themselves and their emotional states from the circumstances of death, dying and suffering they are surrounded by. Very strict rituals and power structures are used in hospitals, which suggests that the dynamics of abjection have a role to play in understanding not only how anxiety becomes the work of the health team and the organization, but also how it is enacted at the level of hospital policy.

===In sociological studies===
The abject is a concept that is often used to describe bodies and things that one finds repulsive or disgusting, and in order to preserve one's identity they are cast out. Kristeva used this concept to analyze xenophobia and anti-Semitism, and was therefore the first to apply the abject to cultural analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Imogen Tyler&lt;ref&gt;"Revolting subjects: Social abjection and resistance in neoliberal Britain" (2013), p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; sought to make the concept more social in order to analyze abjection as a social and lived process and to consider both those who abject and those who find themselves abjected, between representation of the powerful and the resistance of the oppressed. Tyler conducted an examination into the way that contemporary Britain had labelled particular groups of people{{snd}}mostly minority groups{{snd}}as revolting figures, and how those individuals revolt against their abject identity, also known as marginalization, stigmatizing and/or social exclusion.

There has also been exploration done into the way people look at others whose bodies may look different from the norm due to illness, injury or birth defect. Researchers such as Frances&lt;ref&gt;"Damaged or unusual bodies: Staring, or seeing and feeling" (2014), p. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize the importance of the interpersonal consequences that result from this looking. A person with a disability, by being similar to us and also different, is the person by whom the abject exists and people who view this individual react to that abjection by either attempting to ignore and reject it, or by attempting to engage and immerse themselves in it. In this particular instance, Frances claims, the former manifests through the refusal to make eye contact or acknowledge the presence of the personal with a disability, while the latter manifests through intrusive staring. The interpersonal consequences that result from this are either that the person with a disability is denied and treated as an 'other'{{snd}}an object that can be ignored{{snd}}or that the individual is clearly identified and defined as a deject.

==In psychotherapy==
By bringing focus onto concepts such as abjection, psychotherapists may allow for the exploration of links between lived experience and cultural formations in the development of particular psychopathologies. Bruan Seu&lt;ref&gt;cited in Dryden, Ussher and Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014), p. 1343.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the critical importance of bringing together Foucauldian ideas of self-surveillance and positioning in discourse with a psychodynamic theorization in order to grasp the full significance of psychological impactors, such as shame.

Concerning psychopathologies such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), the role of the other{{snd}}actual, imagined or fantasized{{snd}}is central, and ambivalence about the body, inflated by shame, is the key to this dynamic. Parker&lt;ref&gt;"Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014), p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that individuals suffering from BDD are sensitive to the power, pleasure and pain of being looked at, as their objective sense of self dominates any subjective sense. The role of the other has become increasingly significant to developmental theories in contemporary psychoanalysis, and is very evident in body image as it is formed through identification, projection and introjection. Those individuals with BDD consider a part of their body unattractive or unwanted, and this belief is exacerbated by shame and the impression that others notice and negatively perceive the supposed physical flaw, which creates a cycle. Over time, the person with BDD begins to view that part of their body as being separate from themselves, a rogue body part{{snd}}it has been abjected. Consider also those who experience social anxiety, who experience the subjectification of being abject is a similar yet different way to those with Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Abject, here, refers to marginally objectionable material that does not quite belong in the greater society as a whole{{snd}}whether this not-belonging is real or imagined is irrelevant, only that it is perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; For those with social anxiety, it is their entire social self which is perceived to be the deject, straying away from normal social rituals and capabilities.

Studying abjection has proven to be suggestive and helpful for considering the dynamics of self and body hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, Ussher &amp; Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014); Parker, "Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014); Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This carries interesting implications for studying such disorders as separation anxiety, biologically centered phobias, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

==In art==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}

The roots of abject art go back a long way. The Tate defines abject art as that which "explore themes that transgress and threaten our sense of cleanliness and propriety[,] particularly referencing the body and bodily functions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art |title=Abject Art |work=[[Tate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painters expressed a fascination for blood long before the Renaissance but it was not until the [[Dada]] movement that the fascination with transgression and taboo made it possible for abject art, as a movement, to exist. It was influenced by [[Antonin Artaud]]'s ''[[Theatre of Cruelty]]''. The [[Whitney Museum]] in [[New York City]] identified abject art in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Hal. "Obscene, abject, traumatic." October (1996): 107–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kutzbach, Konstanze | author2=Mueller, Monika | title=The abject of desire : the aestheticization of the unaesthetic in contemporary literature and culture | publication-date=2007 | publisher=Rodopi | isbn=978-90-420-2264-5 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was preceded by the films and performances of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese actionists]], in particular, [[Hermann Nitsch]], whose interest in Schwitter's idea of a [[gesamtkunstwerk]] (total artwork) led to his setting up the radical theatre group, known as the [[Orgien-Mysterien-Theater]]. The group used animal carcasses and bloodshed in a ritualistic way. Nitsch served time in jail for blasphemy before being invited to New York in 1968 by Jonas Mekas. Nitsch organised a series of performances which influenced the radical New York art scene. Other members of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]], [[Gunter Brus]], who began as a painter, and [[Otto Muehl]] collaborated on performances. The performances of [[Gunter Brus]] involved publicly urinating, defecating and cutting himself with a razor blade. [[Rudolf Schwarzkogler]] is known for his photos dealing with the abject.  
In the late 1960s, [[performance art]] become popular in New York, including by [[Carolee Schneemann]]. [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], [[Genesis P. Orridge]] and [[GG Allin]] did this type of art.

In the 1980s and 1990s, fascination with the ''[[Powers of Horror]]'', the title of a book by [[Julia Kristeva]], led to a second wave of radical performance artists working with bodily fluids including [[Ron Athey]], [[Franko B]], [[Lennie Lee]] and [[Kira O' Reilly]]. Kristeva herself associated aesthetic experience of the abject, such as art and literature, with poetic catharsis{{snd}}an impure process that allows the artist or author to protect themselves from the abject only by immersing themselves within it.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror" (1982), p. 15; Spittle, "'Did this game scare you? Because it sure as hell scared me!' F.E.A.R., the abject and the uncanny" (2011); Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the abject became a theme of radical Chinese performance artists [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]] and [[Yang Zhichao]]. The abject also began to influence mainstream artists including [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Gilbert and George]], [[Robert Gober]], [[Kiki Smith]] and [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]] who were all included in the 1993 Whitney show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art "Abject Art"] Retrieved on 2010-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists working with abjection include New York photographers, [[Joel Peter Witkin]], whose book ''[[Love and Redemption]]'' and [[Andres Serrano]] whose piece entitled ''[[Piss Christ]]'' caused a scandal in 1989.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2016}}
'''Altermodern''', a [[portmanteau word]] defined by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]], is an attempt at contextualizing art made in today's global context as a reaction against standardisation and commercialism. It is also the title of the [[Tate Britain]]'s fourth Triennial exhibition curated by Bourriaud.

==Concept==
In his keynote speech to the 2005 Art Association of Australia &amp; New Zealand Conference, Nicolas Bourriaud explained:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/aaanz05/abstracts/nicolas_bourriaud ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723130718/http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/aaanz05/abstracts/nicolas_bourriaud |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Artists are looking for a new modernity that would be based on translation: What matters today  is to translate the cultural values of cultural groups and  to connect them to the world network. This “reloading process” of  modernism according to the twenty-first-century issues could be called altermodernism, a movement connected to the creolisation of cultures and the fight for autonomy, but also the possibility of producing singularities in a more and more standardized world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Altermodern can essentially be read as an artist working in a [[hypermodernity|hypermodern]] world or with supermodern ideas or themes.

==Exhibitions==

===Tate Britain 2009===
The Tate exhibition includes a series of four one-day events (called "Prologues"), aiming to "introduce and provoke debate" around the Triennial’s themes. Each Prologue includes lectures, performances, film and a manifesto text and attempts to define what the curator sees as the four main facets of Altermodern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tate-triennial-2009-prologue-1-okwui-enwezor-specious-modernity-speculations]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Argument from authority]] ([[Latin]]: ''argumentum ab auctoritate'') is a common form of argument which leads to a [[logical fallacy]] when misused. In informal reasoning, the appeal to authority is a form of argument attempting to establish a [[statistical syllogism]].&lt;ref name="salmon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salmon |first=M. H. |title=Introduction to Critical Reasoning |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Mason, OH |year=2006 |pages=118–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal to authority relies on an argument of the form:
: A is an authority on a particular topic
: A says something about that topic
: A is probably correct

Fallacious examples of using the appeal include any appeal to authority used in the context of [[logical]] reasoning and appealing to the position of an authority or authorities to dismiss evidence as while authorities can be correct in judgments related to their area of expertise more often than laypersons, they can still come to the wrong judgments through error, bias, dishonesty, or falling prey to [[groupthink]]. Thus, the appeal to authority is not a generally reliable argument for establishing facts. Influential anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] thought the following: "Does it follow that I reject all authority? Far from me such a thought. In the matter of boots, I refer to the authority of the bootmaker; concerning houses, canals, or railroads, I consult that of the architect or the engineer. For such or such special knowledge I apply to such or such a savant. But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor savant to impose his authority upon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure. I do not content myself with consulting a single authority in any special branch; I consult several; I compare their opinions, and choose that which seems to me the soundest. But I recognise no infallible authority, even in special questions; consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such individual, I have no absolute faith in any person".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/authrty.htm "What is Authority?" by Mikhail Bakunin]&lt;/ref&gt; He saw that "there is no fixed and constant authority, but a continual exchange of mutual, temporary, and, above all, voluntary authority and subbordination. This same reason forbids me, then, to recognise a fixed, constant and universal authority, because there is no universal man, no man capable of grasping in all that wealth of detail, without which the application of science to life is impossible, all the sciences, all the branches of social life".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

After [[World War II]], there was a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on [[anti-fascism]] in Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from [[German-occupied Europe|occupation]] and to fears arising from the development of [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="swcjsb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sign Wars: The Culture Jammers Strike Back! |last=Cox |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=LedaTape Organisation |isbn=978-0-9807701-5-5 |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKo8DrmamAwC |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-authoritarianism has also been associated with [[countercultural]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] movements. In the 1950s, the [[Beat Generation]] were politically radical and to some degree their anti-authoritarian attitudes were taken up by activists in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/beatgeneration.html "The American Novel" at [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] website]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hippie movement|hippie]] and larger [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] movements of the 1960s carried out a way of life and activism which was ideally carried through anti-authoritarian and [[non-violent]] means. It was observed as such: "The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe".&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "The Way of the Hippy"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, anti-authoritarianism became associated with the [[punk subculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McLaughlin | first = Paul | title = Anarchism and Authority | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-7546-6196-2 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6833">In the mathematical subject of [[geometric group theory]], the '''Baumslag–Gersten group''', also known as the '''Baumslag group''', is a particular [[one-relator group]] exhibiting some remarkable properties regarding its finite [[quotient group]]s, its [[Dehn function]] and the complexity of its [[word problem for groups|word problem]].

The group is given by the [[group presentation|presentation]]

: &lt;math&gt; G=\langle a,t \mid a^{a^t}=a^2\rangle =\langle a, t \mid (t^{-1}a^{-1}t) a (t^{-1} at)=a^2 \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

Here exponential notation for group elements denotes conjugation, that is, for &lt;math&gt;g, h\in G, g^h=h^{-1}gh.&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
The Baumslag–Gersten group ''G'' was originally introduced in a 1969 paper of [[Gilbert Baumslag]],&lt;ref name=B&gt; Gilbert Baumslag, ''A non-cyclic one-relator group all of whose finite factor groups are cyclic'', [[Journal of the Australian Mathematical Society]] '''10''' (1969) 497–498. {{MR|0254127}} &lt;/ref&gt; as an example of a non-[[residually finite]] [[one-relator group]] with an additional remarkable property that all finite [[quotient group]]s of this group are cyclic. Later, in 1992, Gersten&lt;ref name=Ger&gt;S. M. Gersten, ''Dehn functions and &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt;-norms of finite presentations''. Algorithms and classification in combinatorial group theory (Berkeley, CA, 1989), 195–224, Math. Sci. Res. Inst. Publ., 23, Springer, New York, 1992. {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4613-9730-4_9}} {{MR|1230635}} &lt;/ref&gt; showed that ''G'', despite being a one-relator group given by a rather simple presentation, has the [[Dehn function]] growing very quickly, namely faster than any fixed iterate of the exponential function. This example remains the fastest known growth of the Dehn function among one-relator groups. In 2011 Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won proved that ''G'' has the [[word problem for groups|word problem]] solvable in polynomial time.

==Baumslag-Gersten group as an HNN extension==

The Baumslag–Gersten group ''G'' can also be realized as an [[HNN extension]] of the [[Baumslag–Solitar group]] &lt;math&gt;BS(1,2)=\langle a, b\mid a^b=a^2\rangle &lt;/math&gt; with stable letter ''t'' and two cyclic associated subgroups&lt;math&gt;\langle a\rangle, \langle b\rangle &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;G=\langle a,t \mid a^{a^t}=a^2\rangle=\langle a,b,t \mid a^b=a^2, a^t=b\rangle.  &lt;/math&gt;

==Properties of the Baumslag–Gersten group ''G''==

*Every finite [[quotient group]] of ''G'' is [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. In particular, the group ''G'' is not [[residually finite group|residually finite]].&lt;ref name=B/&gt;
*An endomorphism of ''G'' is either an automorphism or its image is a cyclic subgroup of ''G''. In particular the group ''G'' is [[Hopfian group|Hopfian]] and [[co-Hopfian group|co-Hopfian]].&lt;ref name=Br&gt;

*The [[outer automorphism group]] Out(''G'') of ''G'' is isomorphic to the additive group of dyadic rationals &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z\left[\frac{1}{2}\right]&lt;/math&gt; and in particular is not finitely generated.&lt;ref name=Br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3271">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bing–Borsuk conjecture''' states that every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] [[absolute neighborhood retract]] space is a [[topological manifold]]. The conjecture has been proved for dimensions 1 and 2, and it is known that the 3-dimensional version of the conjecture implies the [[Poincaré conjecture]].

==Definitions==

A [[topological space]]  is ''homogeneous'' if, for any two points &lt;math&gt;m_1, m_2 \in M&lt;/math&gt;, there is a [[homeomorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; which takes &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt;. 

A [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an ''absolute neighborhood retract'' (ANR) if, for every closed embedding &lt;math&gt;f: M \rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space), there exists an [[open neighbourhood]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the image &lt;math&gt;f(M)&lt;/math&gt; which [[retract]]s to &lt;math&gt;f(M)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.|first1=Halverson, Denise|last2=Dušan|first2=Repovš,|title=The Bing–Borsuk and the Busemann conjectures|journal=Mathematical Communications|date=23 December 2008|volume=13|issue=2|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/30884|language=en|issn=1331-0623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an alternate statement of the Bing–Borsuk conjecture: suppose &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[embedding|embedded]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{m+n}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;m \geq 3&lt;/math&gt; and this embedding can be extended to an embedding of &lt;math&gt;M \times (-\varepsilon, \varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==

The conjecture was first made in a paper by [[R. H. Bing]] and [[Karol Borsuk]] in 1965, who proved it for &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; and 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bing|first1=R. H.|last2=Armentrout|first2=Steve|title=The Collected Papers of R. H.

Włodzimierz Jakobsche showed in 1978 that, if the Bing–Borsuk conjecture is true in dimension 3, then the Poincaré conjecture must also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakobsche|first1=W.|title=The Bing–Borsuk conjecture is stronger than the Poincaré conjecture|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|volume=106|issue=2|url=https://eudml.org/doc/211089|language=en|issn=0016-2736}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Busemann conjecture]] states that every [[Busemann G-space|Busemann &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-space]] is a topological manifold. It is a special case of the Bing–Borsuk conjecture. The Busemann conjecture is known to be true for dimensions 1 to&amp;nbsp;4.

'''Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage''' ('''BECCS''') is a potential [[climate change mitigation|greenhouse gas mitigation]] technology which produces [[negative carbon dioxide emission]]s by combining [[bioenergy]] (energy from [[biomass]]) use with [[Geology|geologic]] [[carbon capture and storage]].&lt;ref name=Obersteiner&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.294.5543.786b |title=Managing Climate Risk |year=2001 |last1=Obersteiner |first1=M. |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5543 |pages=786–7 |pmid=11681318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of BECCS is drawn from the integration of trees and crops, which extract [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the atmosphere as they grow, the use of this biomass in processing industries or power plants, and the application of [[carbon capture and storage]] via CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection into geological formations.&lt;ref name="Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010"&gt;{{Cite web

In the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), BECCS was indicated as a key technology for reaching low carbon dioxide atmospheric concentration targets.&lt;ref name=IPCC2007&gt;{{cite book |first1=Brian |last1=Fisher |first2=Nebojsa |last2=Nakicenovic |first3=Knut |last3=Alfsen |first4=Jan Corfee |last4=Morlot |first5=Francisco |last5=de la Chesnaye |first6=Jean-Charles |last6=Hourcade |first7=Kejun |last7=Jiang |first8=Mikiko |last8=Kainuma |first9=Emilio |last9=La Rovere |chapter=Issues related to mitigation in the long-term context |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter3.pdf |pages=169–250 |editor1-first=Bert |editor1-last=Metz |title=Climate Change 2007: Mitigation of Climate Change |series=Working Group III contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC |isbn=978-0-521-88011-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The negative emissions that can be produced by BECCS has been estimated by the [[Royal Society]] to be equivalent to a 50 to 150 [[Parts per million|ppm]] decrease in [[Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere|global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations]]&lt;ref name=RoyalSociety&gt;{{Cite web

==Negative emission==

[[Image:Carbon flow.jpg|thumb|400px|Carbon flow schematic for different energy systems.]]

The main appeal of BECCS is in its ability to result in negative emissions of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The capture of carbon dioxide from [[bioenergy]] sources effectively removes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=read&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2004.07.003 |title=Bio-energy with carbon storage (BECS): A sequential decision approach to the threat of abrupt climate change |year=2005 |last1=Read |first1=Peter |last2=Lermit |first2=Jonathan |journal=Energy |volume=30 |issue=14 |pages=2654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bio-energy is derived from biomass which is a [[renewable energy source]] and serves as a carbon sink during its growth. During industrial processes, the biomass combusted or processed re-releases the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere. The process thus results in a net zero emission of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, though this may be positively or negatively altered depending on the carbon emissions associated with biomass growth, transport and processing, see below under environmental considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bbb.3 |title=Food and fuel for all: Realistic or foolish? |year=2007 |last1=g. Cassman |first1=Kenneth |last2=Liska |first2=Adam J. |journal=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining |volume=1 |pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technology serves to intercept the release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere and redirect it into geological storage locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0961-9534(03)00013-8 |title=Potential market niches for biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage—Opportunities for energy supply with negative CO2 emissions |year=2003 |last1=Möllersten |first1=Kenneth |last2=Yan |first2=Jinyue |last3=r.

The BECCS technology can also be employed on such industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0360-5442(03)00002-1 |title=Potential and cost-effectiveness of CO2 reductions through energy measures in Swedish pulp and paper mills |year=2003 |last1=Möllersten |first1=K. |last2=Yan |first2=J. |last3=Westermark |first3=M. |journal=Energy |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that through the BECCS technology, carbon dioxide is trapped in geologic formations for very long periods of time, whereas for example a tree only stores its carbon during its lifetime. In its report on the CCS technology, IPCC projects that more than 99% of carbon dioxide which is stored through geologic sequestration is likely to stay in place for more than 1000 years. While other types of carbon sinks such as the ocean, trees and soil may involve the risk of [[negative feedback loop]]s at increased temperatures, BECCS technology is likely to provide a better permanence by storing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in geological formations.&lt;ref name="Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IPCC5&gt;IPCC, (2005)[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter5.pdf  "Chapter 5: Underground geological storage" IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage.] Prepared by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Metz, B., O. Davidson, H. C. De Coninck, M. Loos, and L. A. Meyer (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, pp195-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that has been released  to date is believed to be too much to be able to be absorbed by conventional sinks such as trees and soil in order to reach low emission targets.&lt;ref name=hare&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10584-005-9027-9 |title=How Much Warming are We Committed to and How Much can be Avoided? |year=2006 |last1=Hare |first1=Bill |last2=Meinshausen |first2=Malte |journal=Climatic Change |volume=75 |pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the presently accumulated emissions, there will be significant additional emissions during this century, even in the most ambitious low-emission scenarios. BECCS has therefore been suggested as a technology to reverse the emission trend and create a global system of net negative emissions.&lt;ref name=Obersteiner/&gt;&lt;ref name=IPCC2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=hare/&gt;&lt;ref name=Azar&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10584-005-3484-7 |title=Carbon Capture and Storage from Fossil Fuels and Biomass – Costs and Potential Role in Stabilizing the Atmosphere |year=2006 |last1=Azar |first1=Christian |last2=Lindgren |first2=Kristian |last3=Larson |first3=Eric |last4=Möllersten |first4=Kenneth |journal=Climatic Change |volume=74 |pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2007.09.005 |title=System study of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture in bio-based motor fuel production |year=2008 |last1=Lindfeldt |first1=Erik G. |last2=Westermark |first2=Mats O. |journal=Energy |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the emissions would not only be zero, but negative, so that not only the emissions, but the absolute amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere would be reduced.

==Technology==
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}
The main technology for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture from biotic sources generally employs the same technology as carbon dioxide capture from conventional fossil fuel sources. Broadly, three different types of technologies exist: [[post combustion capture|post-combustion]], [[pre-combustion]], and [[Oxy-fuel combustion process|oxy-fuel combustion]].&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, (2005)[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter3.pdf "Chapter 3: Capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage.] Prepared by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Metz, B., O. Davidson, H. C. De Coninck, M. Loos, and L. A. Meyer (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, pp 105-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==

The [[sustainability|sustainable]] technical potential for net negative emissions with BECCS has been estimated to 10 [[Gigatonne|Gt]] of {{CO2}} equivalent annually, with an economic potential of up to 3.5 Gt of {{CO2}} equivalent annually at a cost of less than 50 €/tonne, and up to 3.9 Gt of {{CO2}} equivalent annually at a cost of less than 100 €/tonne.&lt;ref name="IEA-GHG Ecofys BECCS report"&gt;{{citation

Currently, most schematic BECCS systems are not cost-efficient compared to normal CCS. The IPCC states that estimations for BECCS cost range from $60-$250 per ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-ccs-idUSBREA2P1LK20140326|title=Extracting carbon from nature can aid climate but will be costly: U.N.|date=2017-03-26|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "normal" CCS (from coal and natural gas processing) costs have been decreasing to less than $35 per ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.c2es.org/technology/factsheet/CCS|title=Carbon Capture Use and Storage {{!}} Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|website=www.c2es.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; With limited large-scale testing, BECCS faces many challenges to be a financially viable alternative.

==Policy==

Based on the current [[Kyoto Protocol]] agreement, carbon capture and storage projects are not applicable as an emission reduction tool to be used for the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) or for [[Joint Implementation]] (JI) projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission/index_en.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) from ec.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; Recognising CCS technologies as an emission reduction tool is vital for the implementation of such plants as there is no other financial motivation for the implementation of such systems. There has been growing support to have fossil CCS and BECCS included in the protocol. Accounting studies on how this can be implemented, including BECCS, have also been done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11027-006-9034-9 |title=Equal Opportunity for Biomass in Greenhouse Gas Accounting of CO2 Capture and Storage: A Step Towards More Cost-Effective Climate Change Mitigation Regimes |year=2006 |last1=Grönkvist |first1=Stefan |last2=Möllersten |first2=Kenneth |last3=Pingoud |first3=Kim |journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change |volume=11 |issue=5–6 |pages=1083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techno-economics of BECCS and the TESBiC Project==

The largest and most detailed techno-economic assessment of BECCS was carried out by cmcl innovations and the TESBiC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmclinnovations.com/TESBIC |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106035708/http://www.cmclinnovations.com/TESBIC/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; group (Techno-Economic Study of Biomass to CCS) in 2012. This project recommended the most promising set of biomass fueled power generation technologies coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The project outcomes lead to a detailed “biomass CCS roadmap” for the U.K..

== Environmental considerations==
{{See also|Issues relating to biofuels}}
Some of the environmental considerations and other concerns about the widespread implementation of BECCS are similar to those of CCS. However, much of the critique towards CCS is that it may strengthen the dependency on depletable fossil fuels and environmentally invasive coal mining. This is not the case with BECCS, as it relies on renewable biomass. There are however other considerations which involve BECCS and these concerns are related to the possible increased use of [[biofuels]].

Biomass production is subject to a range of sustainability constraints, such as: scarcity of arable land and fresh water, [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], competition with food production, [[deforestation]] and scarcity of phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacy, S.: (2007) [http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/ditcted200712_en.pdf  "The Biofuels Controversy"], United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 12&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to make sure that biomass is used in a way that maximizes both energy and climate benefits. There has been criticism to some suggested BECCS deployment scenarios, where there would be a very heavy reliance on increased biomass input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=https://news.mongabay.com/2007/11/carbon-negative-bioenergy-to-cut-global-warming-could-drive-deforestation/

Large areas of land would be required to operate BECCS on an industrial scale. To remove 10 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, upwards of 300 million hectares of land area (larger than India) would be required.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, BECCS risks using land that could be better suited to agriculture and food production, especially in developing countries.

These systems may have other negative side effects. There is however presently no need to expand the use of biofuels in energy or industry applications to allow for BECCS deployment. There is already today considerable emissions from point sources of biomass derived CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which could be utilized for BECCS. Though, in possible future bio-energy system upscaling scenarios, this may be an important consideration.

The BECCS process allows CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be collected and stored directly from the atmosphere, rather than from a fossil source. This implies that any eventual emissions from storage may be recollected and restored simply by reiterating the BECCS-process. This is not possible with CCS alone, as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted to the atmosphere cannot be restored by burning more fossil fuel with CCS.

== Current projects ==
Most CCS projects include adding capture to an existing power plant, usually coal or another fossil fuel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-negative-emissions-tested-worlds-first-major-beccs-facility|title=Analysis: Negative emissions tested at world's first major BECCS facility {{!}} Carbon Brief|date=2016-05-31|work=Carbon Brief|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With complete capture, these processes would be carbon neutral. Decatur, Illinois in the United States has many corn plants run by [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM), where corn is processed into syrups and ethanol.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The plant emits high amounts of carbon dioxide as a byproduct of the process. With the CCS fitting, the plant ideally becomes carbon negative, since corn absorbs carbon dioxide when it grows, and all the carbon dioxide produced during processing is being captured and sequestered in the [[Mount Simon Sandstone|Mount Simon]] sandstone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The project cannot be completely carbon negative, as carbon dioxide is produced during the combustion of the ethanol that is being produced. The project is one of the only CCS projects in use to not be coupled with [[Enhanced oil recovery|EOR]]. The Southern Illinois Basin is considered one of the best injection sites, due to its sandstone composition and depth (injection site is 2,000 meters below the surface),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-beccs-projects-2010/5-decatur-illinois-united-states|title=5.

'''Brithenig''' is an invented language, or [[constructed language]] ("conlang"). It was created as a hobby in 1996 by Andrew Smith from [[New Zealand]], who also invented the [[alternate history]] of [[Ill Bethisad]] to "explain" it.

Brithenig was not developed to be used in the real world, like [[Esperanto]] or [[Interlingua]], nor to provide detail to a work of fiction, like [[Klingon language|Klingon]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' scenarios. Rather, Brithenig started as a thought experiment to create a [[Romance languages|Romance]] language that might have evolved if [[Latin]] had displaced the native [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language as the spoken language of the people in [[Great Britain]].

The result is an artificial sister language to [[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] which differs from them by having sound-changes similar to those that affected the [[Welsh language]], and words that are borrowed from the [[Brittonic languages]] and from [[English language|English]] throughout its pseudo-history. One important distinction between Brithenig and Welsh is that while Welsh is [[Gallo-Brittonic languages|P-Celtic]], Latin was a [[Osco-Umbrian_languages#Differences_from_Latin|Q-Italic language]] (as opposed to [[Osco-Umbrian_languages#Differences_from_Latin|P-Italic]], like [[Oscan language|Oscan]]), and this trait was passed onto Brithenig.

Similar efforts to extrapolate Romance languages are ''Breathanach'' (influenced by the other branch of Celtic), ''Judajca'' (influenced by Hebrew), ''Þrjótrunn'' (a non-Ill Bethisad language influenced by Icelandic), ''[[Wenedyk]]'' (influenced by Polish), and ''Xliponian'' (which experienced a [[Grimm's law]]-like sound shift). It has also inspired ''Wessisc'', a hypothetical Germanic language influenced by contact with Old Celtic.

Brithenig was granted the code BZT as part of [[ISO 639:b#bzt|ISO 639-3]].

Andrew Smith was one of the conlangers featured in the exhibit "Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond: The World of Constructed Languages" displayed at the [[Cleveland Public Library]] from May through August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/26418663@N05/2478687117/ |title=Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond |website=[[Flickr]] |access-date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's creation of Brithenig was cited as the reason for his inclusion in the exhibit (which also included the Babel Text&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.langmaker.com/babelintro.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514232430/http://www.langmaker.com/babelintro.htm |title=Babel Text Introduction |archive-date=2011-05-14 |website=Langmarker |access-date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Smith's language).

==Vocabulary==
Most of Brithenig's vocabulary is distinctively Romance, even though it is disguised as Welsh. The following list of 30 words gives an impression of what Brithenig looks like in comparison to nine other Romance languages including Wenedyk, and to Welsh. The similarity of about one-quarter of the Welsh words to Brithenig words (indicated by not being bracketed) is due to their common [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] background, although a few others, such as ''ysgol'', were borrowings from Latin into Welsh.

'''Cartoon violence''' is the representation of [[Violence|violent actions]] involving [[animation|animated]] characters and situations. This may include violence where a character is unharmed after the action has been inflicted.

==Debates==
People have different views about cartoons and the violence within them. Some researchers believe that high level of [[violence in cartoons]] can make children more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1159766/Cartoon-violence-makes-children-aggressive.html |title=Cartoon violence 'makes children more aggressive' |last=Clark |first=Laura |publisher=Associated Newspapers |location=London |date=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their studies also found that young children tend to mimic the negative behavior they see on television. Output aimed at children as young as seven, which include a number of cartoons, had the highest levels of violence.

Some researches on the other hand believe that people need to consider the ways in which children process information, the amount of mental effort they invest, and their own life experience to gain an understanding of how television violence affects children. For instance recent research has indicated that children do not appear to mimic acts of violence in the media, whether television or cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Ferguson, (2010) "[http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Video%20Games%201%20Year.pdf Video Games and Youth Violence: A Prospective Analysis in Adolescents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525061300/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Video%20Games%201%20Year.pdf |date=May 25, 2012 }}", ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence''&lt;/ref&gt;
Blumberg, Bierwirth and Schwartz argue that children possess the ability to differentiate real life from animation, as well as the ability to understand right from wrong. They know that violent acts qualify as immoral and infringe on the welfare of others, therefore the violence witnessed in cartoons will register as "make believe" to children and will not be applied into their real lives.&lt;ref name=Blumberg&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blumberg, Bierwirth and Schwartz|title=Does Cartoon Violence Beget Aggressive Behavior in Real Life? An Opposing View|doi=10.1007/s10643-008-0280-1|journal=Early Childhood Educ J|date=26 August 2008|pages=102|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|subscription =yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Options for Parents and Restriction==
There are a number of ways parents can control their children’s exposure to violence. One of the most effective and common ways of prevention is restricting the amount and types of programs children watch. With older children, parents might want to discuss, and explain television. This can help children to understand television material and overcome the effect [[Television violence|TV violence]] has on their outlook and behaviors.

Three initiatives have been put in place to combat violence in cartoons (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cartoon Violence: Is it as Detrimental to Preschoolers as we Think?|journal=Early Childhood Education Journal|date=2002-03-01|first=Kristen|last=Peters|author2=Fran Blumberg|volume=29|issue=3|pages=143–149|id= |url=|type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The first is The [[Children's Television Act]] which requires [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]]s to air shows which are [[education]]al and provide information for the children. The second initiative is the [[V-chip]] [[legislation]] that gives parents the opportunity to block out violent shows from their television. The third legislation against violent cartoons is the National Cable Television Association’s [[TV Parental Guidelines]], which is a system that rates the [[Television show]]s based on their contents

In [[Action (fiction)|action]]-[[Adventure (genre)|adventure]] oriented cartoons, the most consistent avenue of addressing violence is the use of a form of [[fantasy violence]] in which no one is injured or killed onscreen. In science fiction cartoons, for example, enemy forces are typically said to be [[robot]]s so that they may be destroyed in bulk by the heroes without concern over killing living beings. In cases where vehicles are known to be piloted by living beings, [[tank]]s, [[aircraft]], and other war vehicles that are destroyed in combat always allow time for the [[aviatior|pilot]] to escape or bail out. Realistic [[firearm]]s are often replaced with futuristic [[beam weapon]]s which still seldom hit anyone. Swords and other [[bladed weapon]]s may be prohibited from being used as offensive weapons but may be used defensively or be depicted as magical weapons. Direct violence is frequently limited to [[hand to hand combat]] where directly kicking or punching another character may or may not be allowed. The majority of action adventure cartoons over the past decades have used these methods of depicting dynamic action scenes although their use has been heavily criticized as "sanitized violence". Cartoons based on the [[Voltron]], [[Transformers]], [[G.I. Joe]], and [[Masters of the Universe]] franchises (especially the versions produced during the 1980s) are notable examples using variations on fantasy violence.

Additionally, parents should limit the total screen time for children older than two years of age to no more than one to two hours per day. Children under two years of age should avoid watching television altogether. Televisions should be kept out of children’s bedrooms and parents should watch television with their children and discuss the content.&lt;ref name=Strasburger&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strasburger, V. |author2=Jordan, A. |author3=Donnerstein |last-author-amp=yes |title=Health Effects of Media on Children and Adolescents|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health practitioners can also play their part by taking the time to ask their young patients how much time per day they spend with entertainment media and if there is a television or computer with Internet access in their bedroom.&lt;ref name=Strasburger/&gt;

==Effects==
{{Main|Media violence research}}
Effects of cartoon violence on youth remain controversial.  Research has generally been divided on this issue with no consensus reached regarding the effects of violence on behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Kirsh, (2006) "[Cartoon violence and aggression in youth]", ''Aggression and Violent Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, the impact of exposure to violence may remain regardless of whether children choose to imitate it.&lt;ref name=Blumberg/&gt;

'''''Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge''''' ({{lang-es|Emporio celestial de conocimientos benévolos}}) is a fictitious [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of animals described by the writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his 1942 essay "[[The Analytical Language of John Wilkins]]" (''El idioma analítico de John Wilkins'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | page = 231 | contribution = John Wilkins' Analytical Language | others = Eliot Weinberger, transl. | title = Selected nonfictions | first = Jorge Luis | last = Borges | editor-first = Eliot | editor-last = Weinberger | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | ISBN = 0-14-029011-7}}.  The essay was originally published as {{Citation | contribution = El idioma analítico de John Wilkins | title = [[La Nación]] | date = 8 February 1942 | place = Argentina | language = Spanish}}, and republished in ''Otras inquisiciones''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[John Wilkins|Wilkins]], a 17th-century philosopher, had proposed a [[universal language]] based on a classification system that would encode a description of the thing a word describes into the word itself—for example, ''Zi'' identifies the genus ''beasts''; ''Zit'' denotes the "difference" ''rapacious beasts of the dog kind''; and finally ''Zitα'' specifies ''dog''.

In response to this proposal and in order to illustrate the arbitrariness and cultural specificity of any attempt to categorize the world, Borges describes this example of an alternate taxonomy, supposedly taken from an ancient Chinese encyclopædia entitled ''Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge''.

The list divides all animals into 14 categories:
* Those that belong to the emperor
* [[Embalming|Embalmed]] ones
* Those that are trained
* Suckling pigs
* Mermaids (or [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s)
* Fabulous ones
* Stray dogs
* Those that are included in this classification
* Those that tremble as if they were mad
* Innumerable ones
* Those drawn with a very fine [[camel hair brush]]
* ''[[Et cetera]]''
* Those that have just broken the flower vase
* Those that, at a distance, resemble flies

Borges claims that the list was discovered in its Chinese source by the translator [[Franz Kuhn]].&lt;ref&gt;A slightly different English translation is at: {{Citation | first =Jorge | last = Luis Borges | url= http://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/language/johnWilkins.html | title = The Analytical Language of John Wilkins | others = Lilia Graciela Vázquez, transl. | date = April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = esen&gt;{{Citation | first = Jorge Luis | last = Borges | url= http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/wilkins.html | title= El idioma analítico de John Wilkins | date =April 8, 2006 | language = Spanish, English| publisher = Crockford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = RJ Ohara | url = http://rjohara.net/darwin/logs/1996/9609a | title = Darwin-L | type = mailing list archive | contribution = Borges | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences of the list ==
This list has stirred considerable philosophical and literary commentary.

[[Michel Foucault]] begins his preface to ''[[The Order of Things]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Michel Foucault | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title=The Order of Things : An Archaeology of Human Sciences | publisher=Vintage | year= 1994 | origyear = 1966 | page=XVI|isbn=0-679-75335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |This book first arose out of a passage in Borges, out of the laughter that shattered, as I read the passage, all the familiar landmarks of thought—''our'' thought, the thought that bears the stamp of our age and our geography—breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame the wild profusion of existing things and continuing long afterwards to disturb and threaten with collapse our age-old definitions between the Same and the Other.}}

Foucault then quotes Borges' passage.

[[Louis Sass]] has suggested, in response to Borges' list, that such "Chinese" thinking shows signs of typical schizophrenic thought processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Louis Sass | first = Louis | last =Sass | title = Madness and Modernism: Insanity in the Light of Modern Art, Literature and Thought | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1994 | origyear = 1992 | isbn= 0-674-54137-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the linguist [[George Lakoff]] has pointed out that while Borges' list is not possibly a human categorization, many categorizations of objects found in nonwestern cultures have a similar feeling to Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = George Lakoff | first = George | last = Lakoff | title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1987 | isbn=0-226-46804-6 | url = http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/SocialConstruction/LakoffWomenFireDanger.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Windschuttle]], an Australian historian, cited alleged acceptance of the authenticity of the list by many academics as a sign of the degeneration of the Western academy&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author-link=Keith Windschuttle |first=Keith |last=Windschuttle|title=Absolutely Relative |publisher=National Review |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/15sept97/windschuttle091597.html |contribution=Academic Questions |date=September 15, 1997 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308191710/http://www.nationalreview.com/15sept97/windschuttle091597.html |archive-date=March 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a terminal lack of humor.

== Attribution ==

Scholars have questioned whether the attribution of the list to [[Franz Kuhn]] is genuine. While Kuhn did indeed translate Chinese literature, Borges' works often feature many learned pseudo-references resulting in a mix of facts and fiction. To date, no evidence for the existence of such a list has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/7/7-1446.html |title=LINGUIST List 7.1446: Borgesian joke |publisher=Linguistlist.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borges himself questions the veracity of the quote in his essay, referring to "the unknown (or false) Chinese encyclopaedia writer".&lt;ref name=esen/&gt;

'''''Character Strengths and Virtues''''' ('''CSV''') is a book by [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]] (2004) that attempts
to present a  measure of [[humanism|humanist]] ideals of [[virtue]] in an empirical,  rigorously scientific manner.
 
In the same way that the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' is used to assess and facilitate research on [[mental disorders]],  CSV  is intended to provide a theoretical framework to assist in developing practical applications for [[positive psychology]].&lt;ref name="CSV"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Peterson
  | first = Christopher
  |author2=Seligman, Martin E. P. |authorlink2=Martin Seligman 
  | title = Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification.
  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]
  | year = 2004
  | location = Oxford
  | isbn = 0-19-516701-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of strengths and virtues ==
CSV identifies 6 classes of virtue (i.e., "core virtues"), made up of 26 measurable "character strengths":
The organization of the 6 virtues and 26 strengths is as follows:
# '''Wisdom and Knowledge:''' [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], [[Toleration|open-mindedness]], [[love of learning]], [[wisdom|perspective]], [[innovation]]
# '''Courage:''' [[bravery]], [[persistence (psychology)|persistence]], [[integrity]], [[vitality]], [[Zest (positive psychology)|zest]]
# '''Humanity:''' [[love]], [[kindness]], [[social intelligence]]
# '''Justice:''' [[active citizenship|citizenship]], fairness, [[leadership]]
# '''Temperance:''' [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]], [[humility]], [[prudence]], [[self-control|self control]]
# '''Transcendence:''' [[appreciation of beauty]] and [[excellence]], [[gratitude]], [[hope]], [[humor]], [[spirituality]]

CSV defined character strengths as satisfying most of the ten following criteria. Character strengths are fulfilling; [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically valuable]], in an ethical sense ([[Intellectual giftedness|gifts]], [[skill]]s, [[aptitude]]s, and [[expert]]ise can be squandered, but character strengths and [[virtue]]s cannot); non-[[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]]; not the opposite of a desirable trait (a counterexample is steadfast and flexible, which are opposites but are both commonly seen as desirable); [[Trait theory|trait-like]] (habitual patterns that are relatively stable over time); not a combination of the other character strengths in the CSV; personified (at least in the popular imagination) by people made famous through story, song, etc.; observable in [[child prodigy|child prodigies]] (though this criterion is not applicable to all character strengths); absent in some individuals; and nurtured by societal [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[institution]]s.

The introduction of CSV suggests that these six virtues are considered good by the vast majority of cultures and throughout history and that these traits lead to increased happiness when practiced. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints that in addition to trying to broaden the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging [[moral relativism]] and suggesting that virtue has a biological basis.&lt;ref name="CSV" /&gt; These arguments are in line with the [[science of morality]].

Each of the 26 character traits is defined [[Behaviorism|behaviorally]], with [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] evidence demonstrating that it can be [[Reliability (statistics)|reliably]] measured.
The book shows that "empirically minded [[Humanism|humanists]] can measure character strengths and virtues in a rigorous scientific manner."&lt;ref name="Cloninger"&gt;{{cite journal

Practical applications of positive psychology include helping individuals and organizations correctly identify their strengths and use them to increase and sustain their respective levels of well-being. Each trait "provides one of many alternative paths to virtue and well-being."&lt;ref name="Cloninger" /&gt; Therapists, counselors, coaches, and various other psychological professionals can use the new methods and techniques to build and broaden the lives of individuals who are not necessarily suffering from [[Mental disorder|mental illness or disorder]].

Finally, other researchers have advocated grouping the 26 identified character traits into just four classes of strength (Intellectual, Social, Temperance, Transcendent) or even just three classes (without Transcendence). Not only is this easier to remember, but additionally there is evidence that these adequately capture the components of the 26 original traits.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F. Krueger, Christopher S. Kallie. 2010. The structure of virtue: An empirical investigation of the dimensionality of the virtues in action inventory of strengths. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to virtue ethics==
The virtues presented to some extent mirror the [[cardinal virtue]]s and [[theological virtue]]s of [[Aristotle]] and [[Aquinas]]: hope, faith, [[charity (virtue)|charity]], [[prudence]], [[justice (virtue)|justice]], [[courage|fortitude]] and [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]], and their respective parts.

In [[philology]], '''decipherment''' is the discovery of the meaning of texts written in ancient or obscure languages or scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, R.L (2000). ''The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics''. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, p. 82 ("The process of determining the relation between an extinct and unknown writing system and the language it represents. Strictly, decipherment is the elucidation of the ''script''—that is, determining the values of the written characters")&lt;/ref&gt;  Decipherment in [[cryptography]] refers to [[decryption]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaudenay, Serge (2006). ''A Classical Introduction to Cryptography''. Springer, p.3. ("Action to transform a ciphertext into a plaintext by an ''authorized party'' [emphasis added]")&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used sardonically in everyday language to describe attempts to read poor handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decipherment&lt;/ref&gt; In [[genetics]], decipherment is the successful attempt to understand [[DNA]], which is viewed metaphorically as a text containing word-like units.&lt;ref&gt;Snustad, D. Peter, et al. (2016). ''Principles of Genetics''. Wiley, p.302&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout science the term decipherment is synonymous with the understanding of biological and chemical phenomena.

==Ancient languages==
In a few cases, a multilingual artifact has been necessary to facilitate decipherment, the [[Rosetta Stone]] being the classic example. Statistical techniques provide another pathway to decipherment, as does the analysis of modern languages derived from ancient languages in which undeciphered texts are written. Archaeological and historical information is helpful in verifying hypothesized decipherments.

*The government manufactures or overemphasizes a [[national security]] threat to create "a sense of crisis", allowing the government "to malign critics as weak-willed or unpatriotic" and to depict defenders of democratic institutions "as representatives of a tired, insulated elite".&lt;ref name="HuqGinsburgVox"/&gt;

==Analysis==
{{Anchor|History}}
Aziz Huq and [[Tom Ginsburg]] of the [[University of Chicago Law School]] argue that many threats to democracy are stealthy.&lt;ref name="DemDigest"/&gt; [[Pippa Norris]] of the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] and [[University of Sydney]] argues, in an article published by the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'' in 2017, that two "twin forces" that pose the greatest contemporary threat to [[Western world|Western]] [[liberal democracy]]: "sporadic and random [[terrorist attack]]s on domestic soil, which damage feelings of security, and the rise of populist-authoritarian forces, which feed parasitically upon these fears."&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/media/Journal%20of%20Democracy%20Web%20Exchange%20-%20Norris_0.pdf |title=Is Western Democracy Backsliding? Diagnosing the Risks |last=Norris |first=Pippa |authorlink=Pippa Norris |date=April 2017 |website=Journal of Democracy |series=Online Exchange on “Democratic Deconsolidation”|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |language=en |type=Scholarly response to column published online |access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris argues that the latter risk is especially pronounced in the United States during the [[presidency of Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="Norris" /&gt;

The scholarly recognition of the concept of democratic backsliding reflects a reversal from older views, which held "that democracy, once attained in a fairly wealthy state, would become a permanent fixture."&lt;ref name="DemDigest"/&gt; This older view came to be realized as erroneous beginning in the mid-2000s, as (in Huq and Ginsburg's words) "an increasing number of seemingly stable, reasonably wealthy democracies have retreated from previously robust democratic regimes toward autocracy" in a variety of regions across the world, including [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]] in Europe; [[Turkey]] in the [[Mediterranean]]; and [[Bolivia]] and [[Venezuela]] in Latin America.&lt;ref name="HuqGinsburgVox"/&gt; More broadly, Huq and Ginsburg identified in an academic paper "37 instances in 25 different countries in the postwar period in which democratic quality declined significantly (though a fully [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime didn't emerge)".&lt;ref name="HuqGinsburgVox"/&gt;  Huq and Ginsburg note that [[coup]]s have decreased at the same time that democratic backsliding has increased.&lt;ref name="HuqGinsburgVox"/&gt; 

In 2017, the U.S.-based research group [[Freedom House]] published a report indicating that 25% of countries that suffered "backward moves on democracy" in the previous year were in European democracies, including the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Spain]]. The report also listed the United States as having regressed democratically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Esther King|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/democratic-backsliding-threatens-international-order-report/|title=Democratic backsliding threatens international order: report|date=January 31, 2017|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chavismo]] in Venezuela is viewed as having propelled democratic backsliding in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kirk |last=Hawkins |ssrn=2779566 |title=Chavismo, Liberal Democracy, and Radical Democracy |journal=Annual Review of Political Science |volume=19 |year=2016 |pages=311–329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

'''Denial''', in ordinary English usage, is asserting that a statement or allegation is not true.&lt;ref name= "OED denial"&gt;{{cite book |title= Oxford English Dictionary |edition= Online, U.S. English |chapter= denial |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/denial |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate= 2014-05-24 |via= oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same word, and also '''abnegation''' ({{lang-de|Verneinung}}), is used for a [[psychological]] [[defense mechanism]] postulated by [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]], in which a person is faced with a fact that is too uncomfortable to accept and rejects it instead, insisting that it is not true despite what may be overwhelming [[evidence]].&lt;ref name= "OED denial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Niolon |first= Richard |date= April 8, 2011 |url=http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/counseling/defenses.html |title= Defenses |website= psychpage.com |accessdate= 2014-05-24 |publisher= Richard Niolon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund (1925). [http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/die-verneinung-915/1 "Die Verneinung"].&lt;/ref&gt; An individual that exhibits such behavior is described as a denialist&lt;ref&gt;2005, The Cape Times 2005-03-11&lt;/ref&gt; or [[True-believer syndrome|true believer]]. Denial also could mean denying the happening of an event or the reliability of information, which can lead to a feeling of aloofness and to the ignoring of possibly beneficial information. 

The subject may use:
* simple denial: deny the [[reality]] of the unpleasant fact altogether
* [[minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]]: admit the fact but deny its seriousness (a combination of denial and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]])
* [[psychological projection|projection]]: admit both the fact and seriousness but deny [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] by [[blaming]] somebody or something else

==In psychoanalysis==
The concept of denial is particularly important to the study of [[Substance dependence|addiction]].

The theory of denial was first researched seriously by [[Anna Freud]].  She classified denial as a mechanism of the [[(psychological)|immature]] mind, because it conflicts with the ability to learn from and cope with reality.  Where denial occurs in mature minds, it is most often associated with death, dying and [[rape]].  More recent research has significantly expanded the scope and utility of the concept.  [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] used denial as the first of [[Kübler-Ross model|five stages in the psychology of a dying patient]], and the idea has been extended to include the reactions of survivors to news of a death.&lt;ref name="Bonanno2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonanno|first=George A.|title=The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us about Life After Loss|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0465019943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary psychoanalysts treat denial as the first stage of a [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] cycle. When an unwelcome change occurs, a trauma of some sort, the first impulse to disbelieve begins the process of coping. That denial, in a healthy mind, slowly rises to greater consciousness. Gradually becoming a subconscious pressure, just beneath the surface of overt awareness, the mechanism of coping then involves repression, while the person accumulates the emotional resources to fully face the trauma. Once faced, the person deals with the trauma in a stage alternately called acceptance or enlightenment, depending on the scope of the issue and the therapist's school of thought. After this stage, once sufficiently dealt with, or dealt with for the time being, the trauma must sink away from total conscious awareness again. Left out of the conscious mind, the process of [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] involves a balance of neither quite forgetting nor quite remembering. This allows the trauma to re-emerge in consciousness if it involves an ongoing process such as a protracted illness. Alternately, sublimation may begin the full resolution process, where the trauma finally sinks away into eventual forgetfulness. Occasionally this entire cycle has been referred to in modern parlance as ''denial'', confusing the full cycle with only one stage of it.&lt;ref name="pmid6853047"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dorpat |first= T.L. | title = The cognitive arrest hypothesis of denial | journal = [[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]] | volume = 64 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 47–58 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6853047 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To further muddy discourse, the terms ''denial'' and ''cycle of denial'' sometimes get used to refer to an unhealthy, dysfunctional cycle of unresolved coping, particularly with regard to addiction and compulsion.

Unlike some other defense mechanisms postulated by [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theory]] (for instance, [[Psychological repression|repression]]), the general existence of denial is fairly easy to verify, even for non-specialists.  However, denial is one of the most controversial defense mechanisms, since it can be easily used to create [[unfalsifiable]] theories:  anything the subject says or does that appears to disprove the interpreter's theory is explained, not as evidence that the interpreter's theory is wrong, but as the subject's being "in denial". However, researchers note that in some cases of corroborated [[child sexual abuse]], the victims sometimes make a series of partial confessions and recantations as they struggle with their own denial and the denial of [[abusers]] or family members. Use of denial theory in a legal setting, therefore, is carefully regulated and experts' credentials verified. "Formulaic [[guilt (law)|guilt]]" simply by "being a denier" has been castigated by English judges and academics. The main objection is that denial theory is founded on the premise that that which the supposed denier is denying is truth. This usurps the judge (and jury) as triers of fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= London |first1= K. |last2= Bruck |first2= M. |last3= Ceci |first3= S.J. |last4= Shuman |first4= D.W. |title= Disclosure of child sexual abuse: What does the research tell us about the ways that children tell? |journal= [[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]] |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 194–226 |year= 2005 |doi= 10.1037/1076-8971.11.1.194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What makes denial denial and not just a refusal to admit to or accept a truth or fact rests in the degree of an individual's awareness of the existence of the truth or fact. In denial, an individual does not see or is mostly unconscious of existence of the truth or fact.  The choice to refuse reality, then, is unconscious as well.  Refusal to admit to or accept a truth or fact differs from denial in that the individual recognizes or is conscious of the existence of the truth or fact but consciously refuses to accept it as such.{{cn|date=November 2014}}
===Denial and disavowal&lt;!--'Disavowal' and 'Disavowal (psychoanalysis)' redirect here--&gt;===
Freud employs the term  ''{{lang|de|Verleugnung}}'' (usually translated either as "disavowal" or as "denial") as distinct from ''{{lang|de|Verneinung}}'' (usually translated as "denial" or as "abnegation"). In ''Verleugnung'', the defense consists of denying something that affects the individual and is a way of affirming what he or she is apparently denying. For Freud, ''Verleugnung'' is related to [[Psychosis|psychoses]], whereas ''[[Psychological repression|Verdrängung]]'' is a [[Neurosis|neurotic]] defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Salomon Resnik|Salomon Resnik]], ''The Delusional Person: Bodily Feelings in Psychosis'', Karnac Books, 2001, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freud uses the term ''verleugnen'' in "The Loss of Reality in Neurosis and Psychosis" (1924).&lt;/ref&gt; Freud broadened his clinical work on disavowal beyond the realm of psychosis. In "Fetishism" (1927), he reported a case of two young men each of whom denied the death of his father. Freud notes that neither of them developed a psychosis, even though "a piece of reality which was undoubtedly important has been disavowed [''verleugnet''], just as the unwelcome fact of women's castration is disavowed in fetishists."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain de Mijolla]] (ed.). ''International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'', 1st vol.: [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3435300366.html "Disavowal"], Macmillan Reference Books, {{ISBN|0-02-865924-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The concept of denial is important in [[twelve-step program]]s, where the abandonment or reversal of denial forms the basis of the first, fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth steps.  The ability to deny or minimize is an essential part of what enables an addict to continue his or her behavior despite evidence that—to an outsider—appears overwhelming.  This is cited as one of the reasons that compulsion is seldom effective in treating addiction—the habit of denial remains.

Understanding and avoiding denial is also important in the treatment of various diseases.  The [[American Heart Association]] cites denial as a principal reason that treatment of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] is delayed.  Because the symptoms are so varied, and often have other potential explanations, the opportunity exists for the patient to deny the emergency, often with fatal consequences.  It is common for patients to delay mammograms or other tests because of a fear of cancer, even though this is clearly maladaptive.  It is the responsibility of the care team, and of the nursing staff in particular, to train at-risk patients to avoid this behavior.

==Types==
===Denial of fact===
In this form of denial, someone avoids a fact by utilizing deception.  This lying can take the form of an outright falsehood (commission), leaving out certain details to tailor a story (omission), or by falsely agreeing to something (assent). Someone who is in denial of fact is typically using lies to avoid facts they think may be painful to themselves or others.

===Denial of responsibility===
This form of denial involves avoiding personal responsibility by:
* ''[[blaming]]'': a direct statement shifting culpability and may overlap with denial of fact

Someone using denial of responsibility is usually attempting to avoid potential harm or pain by shifting [[attention]] away from themselves.

===Denial of impact===
Denial of impact involves a person's avoiding thinking about or understanding the harms of his or her behavior has caused to self or others, i.e. denial of consequences. Doing this enables that person to avoid feeling a sense of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and it can prevent him or her from developing remorse or empathy for others. Denial of impact reduces or eliminates a sense of pain or harm from poor decisions.&lt;ref name="SirriFava2013"/&gt;

===Denial of cycle===
Many who use this type of denial will say things such as, "[[Just-world hypothesis|it just happened]]". Denial of cycle is where a person avoids looking at their decisions leading up to an event or does not consider their pattern of decision making and how harmful behavior is repeated. The pain and harm being avoided by this type of denial is more of the effort needed to change the focus from a singular event to looking at preceding events. It can also serve as a way to blame or justify behavior (see above).

=== Denial of awareness ===
This form of denial attempts to divert pain by claiming that the level of [[awareness]] was inhibited by some mitigating variable. This is most typically seen in [[addiction]] situations where drug or alcohol abuse is a factor, though it also occasionally manifests itself in relation to [[mental health]] issues or the pharmaceutical substances used to treat mental health issues. This form of denial may also overlap with denial of responsibility.&lt;ref name="pmid11494588"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ino |first1= A. |last2= Tatsuki |first2= S. |last3= Nishikawa |first3= K. | title = The Denial and Awareness Scale (DAS) | language = Ja | journal = Nihon Arukoru Yakubutsu Igakkai Zasshi [Japanese Journal of Alcohol Studies and Drug Dependence] | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–34 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11494588 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial of denial===
This can be a difficult concept for many people to identify with in themselves, but is a major barrier to changing hurtful behaviors. Denial of denial involves thoughts, actions and behaviors which bolster confidence that nothing needs to be changed in one's personal behavior. This form of denial typically overlaps with all of the other forms of denial, but involves more self-delusion. Denial at this level can have significant consequences both personally and at a societal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Jeremy Griffith |last= Griffith |first= Jeremy | title= A Species in Denial | year= 2003 |url= http://www.worldtransformation.com/asid-cover/ |publisher= WTM Publishing &amp; Communications |isbn= 9781741290004 |via= worldtransormation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayson2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rayson |first1= D. |title= On denying denial |journal= [[Journal of Clinical Oncology]] |volume= 31 |issue= 34 |year= 2013 |pages= 4371–2 |pmid= 24166521 |doi= 10.1200/JCO.2013.52.6228 |url= http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/31/34/4371.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DARVO===
[[Harassment]] covers a wide range of offensive behaviour. It is commonly understood as behaviour intended to disturb or upset. In the legal sense, it is behaviour which ''is'' found threatening or disturbing.

''DARVO'' is an [[acronym]] used to describe a common strategy of abusers: '''''d'''''eny the abuse, then '''''a'''''ttack the victim for attempting to make them accountable for their offense, thereby '''''r'''''eversing '''''v'''''ictim and '''''o'''''ffender. This may involve [[gaslighting]] and [[victim blaming]].

Psychologist [[Jennifer Freyd]] writes:

{{bq |1=...I have observed that actual abusers threaten, bully and make a nightmare for anyone who holds them accountable or asks them to change their abusive behavior. This attack, intended to chill and terrify, typically includes threats of law suits, overt and covert attacks on the whistle-blower's credibility, and so on.  The attack will often take the form of focusing on ridiculing the person who attempts to hold the offender accountable. [...] [T]he offender rapidly creates the impression that the abuser is the wronged one, while the victim or concerned observer is the offender. Figure and ground are completely reversed. [...] The offender is on the offense and the person attempting to hold the offender accountable is put on the defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Freyd |first= J.J. |title= II.

'''Distinction''', the fundamental philosophical [[abstraction]], involves the recognition of difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|date=1998-01-01|title=The Method of Philosophy: Making Distinctions|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SOKTMO|journal=Review of Metaphysics|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical philosophy, there were various ways in which things could be distinguished. The merely logical or virtual distinction, such as the difference between concavity and convexity, involves the mental apprehension of two definitions, but which cannot be realized outside the mind, as any concave line would be a convex line considered from another perspective. A real distinction involves a level of [[Ontology|ontological]] separation, as when squirrels are distinguished from llamas (for no squirrel is a llama, and no llama is a squirrel).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmhCGt9hKC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=copleston+history+of+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKq8HBtozTAhUIRCYKHecUDC8Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=formal%20distinction&amp;f=false|title=History of Philosophy Volume 2: Medieval Philosophy|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|date=2003-06-12|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826468963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A real distinction is thus different than a merely conceptual one, in that in a real distinction, one of the terms can be realized in reality without the other being realized.

Later developments include [[Duns Scotus|Duns Scotus's]] [[formal distinction]], which developed in part out of the recognition in previous authors that there need to be an intermediary between logical and real distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wengert|first=R.

Some relevant distinctions to the history of Western philosophy include:

* [[Inductive reasoning|Inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|Deductive]]

== Distinctions in Contemporary Thought ==

=== [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]] ===
While the there are anticipation of this distinction prior to Kant in the British [[Empiricism|Empiricists]] (and even further in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thought), it was Kant who introduced the terminology. The distinction concerns the relation of a subject to its predicate: analytic claims are those in which the subject contains the predicate, as in "All bodies are extended." Synthetic claims bring two concepts together, as in "All events are caused." The distinction was recently called into question by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], in his paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]."

=== [[A priori and a posteriori|''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'']] ===
The origins of the distinction are less clear, and it concerns the origins of [[knowledge]]. ''A posteriori'' knowledge arises from, or is caused by, experience. ''A priori'' knowledge may come temporally after experience, but its certainty is not derivable from the experience itself. [[Saul Kripke]] was the first major think to propose that there are analytic ''a posteriori'' knowledge claims.

== Notable Distinctions in Historical Authors ==

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] makes the distinction between [[Potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Cohen|first=S. Marc|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actuality is a realization of the way a thing could be, while potency refers simply to the way a thing could be. There are two levels to each: matter itself can be anything, and becomes something actually by [[Four causes|causes]], making it something which then has the ability to be in a certain way, and that ability can then be realized. The matter of an ax can be an ax, then is made into an ax. The ax thereby is able to cut, and reaches a new form of actuality in actually cutting.

=== Aquinas ===
The major distinction [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] makes is that of [[essence]] and [[existence]]. It is a distinction already in [[Avicenna]], but Aquinas maps the distinction onto the actuality/potentiality distinction of Aristotle, such that the essence of a thing is in potency to the existence of a thing, which is that thing's actuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aq-meta/#H2|title=Aquinas: Metaphysics {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the distinction between appearance and thing-in-itself is foundational to his entire philosophical project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colin|first=Marshall,|title=Kant’s One Self and the Appearance/Thing-in-itself Distinction|url=https://www.academia.edu/2573493/Kants_one_self_and_the_appearance_thing-in-itself_distinction|journal=Kant-Studien|language=en|volume=104|issn=0022-8877}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction separates the way a thing appears to us on the one hand, and the way a thing really is.

{{Psychology sidebar}}

In the field of [[psychology]], the '''Dunning–Kruger effect''' is a [[cognitive bias]] in which people of low ability have [[illusory superiority]] and mistakenly assess their [[cognition|cognitive ability]] as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority comes from the inability of low-ability people to recognize their lack of ability. Without the [[self-awareness]] of [[metacognition]], low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt;

As described by social psychologists [[David Dunning]] and [[Justin Kruger]], the cognitive bias of illusory superiority results from an internal illusion in people of low ability and from an external misperception in people of high ability; that is, "the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others."&lt;ref name="Kruger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kruger|first=Justin|author-link=Justin Kruger|last2=Dunning|first2=David|author2-link=David Dunning|date=1999|title=Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|volume=77|issue=6|pages=1121–1134|citeseerx=10.1.1.64.2655|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121|pmid=10626367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original study==
The psychological phenomenon of illusory superiority was identified as a form of cognitive bias in Kruger and Dunning's 1999 study "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments".&lt;ref name="Kruger" /&gt; The identification derived from the cognitive bias evident in the criminal case of McArthur Wheeler, who robbed banks with his face covered with lemon juice, which he believed would make it invisible to the surveillance cameras. This belief was based on his misunderstanding of the chemical properties of lemon juice as an [[invisible ink]].&lt;ref name="post2010"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/05/23/why-losers-have-delusions-of-grandeur/|title=Why losers have delusions of grandeur|date=23 May 2010|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other investigations of the phenomenon, such as "Why People Fail to Recognize Their Own Incompetence" (2003), indicate that much incorrect self-assessment of competence derives from the person's ignorance of a given activity's standards of performance.&lt;ref name=psymq&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunning|first=David|author-link=David Dunning|last2=Johnson|first2=Kerri|last3=Ehrlinger|first3=Joyce|last4=Kruger|first4=Justin|author4-link=Justin Kruger|date=1 June 2003|title=Why People Fail to Recognize Their Own Incompetence|journal=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=83–87|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunning and Kruger's research also indicates that training in a task, such as solving a logic puzzle, increases people's ability to accurately evaluate how good they are at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/11/revisiting-why-incompetents-think-theyre-awesome/|title=Revisiting why incompetents think they’re awesome|last=Lee|first=Chris|date=5 November 2016|work=[[Ars Technica]]|page=3|accessdate=11 January 2014|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Self-insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself'' (2005), Dunning described the Dunning–Kruger effect as "the [[anosognosia]] of everyday life", referring to a neurological condition in which a disabled person either denies or seems unaware of his or her disability. He stated: "If you're incompetent, you can't know you're incompetent&amp;nbsp;... The skills you need to produce a right answer are exactly the skills you need to recognize what a right answer is."&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/the-anosognosics-dilemma-1/|title=The Anosognosic's Dilemma: Something's Wrong but You'll Never Know What It Is (Part 1)|last=Morris|first=Errol|author-link=Errol Morris|date=20 June 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="selfinsight"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56066405|title=Self-insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself|last=Dunning|first=David|author-link=David Dunning|date=2005|pages=14–15|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=1841690740|location=New York|oclc=56066405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later studies==
Dunning and Kruger tested the hypotheses of the cognitive bias of illusory superiority on undergraduate students of introductory courses in psychology by examining the students' self-assessments of their intellectual skills in [[logical reasoning]] ([[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], [[deductive]], [[abductive]]), English grammar, and personal sense of humor. After learning their self-assessment scores, the students were asked to estimate their ranks in the psychology class. The competent students underestimated their class rank, and the incompetent students overestimated theirs, but the incompetent students did not estimate their class rank as higher than the ranks estimated by the competent group. Across four studies, the research indicated that the study participants who scored in the bottom quartile on tests of their sense of humor, knowledge of grammar, and logical reasoning overestimated their test performance and their abilities; despite test scores that placed them in the 12th percentile, the participants estimated they ranked in the 62nd percentile.&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2010/07/07/What-the-Dunning-Kruger-effect-Is-and-Isnt/|title=What the Dunning-Kruger effect Is and Isn't|last=Yarkoni|first=Tal|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, competent students tended to underestimate their own competence, because they erroneously presumed that tasks easy for them to perform were also easy for other people to perform. Incompetent students improved their ability to correctly estimate their class rank after receiving minimal tutoring in the skills they previously lacked, regardless of any objective improvement gained in said skills of perception.&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt; The study ''Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-estimated Ability'' (2004) extended the cognitive-bias premise of [[illusory superiority]] to test the subjects' emotional sensitivity toward other people and their perceptions of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ames|first=Daniel R.|last2=Kammrath|first2=Lara K.|date=September 2004|title=Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-Estimated Ability|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~da358/publications/ames_kammrath_mindreading.pdf|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=187–209|doi=10.1023/b:jonb.0000039649.20015.0e|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''How Chronic Self-Views Influence (and Potentially Mislead) Estimates of Performance'' (2003) indicated a shift in the participants' view of themselves when influenced by external cues. The participants' knowledge of geography was tested; some tests were intended to positively affect the participant's self-view and some were intended to affect it negatively. The participants then were asked to rate their performances; the participants given tests with a positive intent reported better performance than did the participants given tests with a negative intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ehrlinger|first=Joyce|last2=Dunning|first2=David|author2-link=David Dunning|title=How chronic self-views influence (and potentially mislead) estimates of performance.|date=January 2003|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher=American Psychological Association|volume=84|issue=1|pages=5–17|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.5|pmid=12518967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test Dunning and Kruger's hypotheses, "that people, at all performance levels, are equally poor at estimating their relative performance", the study ''Skilled or Unskilled, but Still Unaware of It: How Perceptions of Difficulty Drive Miscalibration in Relative Comparisons'' (2006) investigated three studies that manipulated the "perceived difficulty of the tasks, and, hence, [the] participants' beliefs about their relative standing". The investigation indicated that when the experimental subjects were presented with moderately difficult tasks, there was little variation among the best performers and the worst performers in their ability to accurately predict their performance. With more difficult tasks, the best performers were less accurate in predicting their performance than were the worst performers.

In testing alternative explanations for the cognitive bias of illusory superiority, the study ''Why the Unskilled are Unaware: Further Explorations of (Absent) Self-insight Among the Incompetent ''(2008) reached the same conclusions as previous studies of the Dunning–Kruger effect: that, in contrast to high performers, "poor performers do not learn from feedback suggesting a need to improve".&lt;ref name="unskilledunaware"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrlinger|first=Joyce|last2=Johnson|first2=Kerri|last3=Banner|first3=Matthew|last4=Dunning|first4=David|author4-link=David Dunning|last5=Kruger|first5=Justin|author5-link=Justin Kruger|title=Why the unskilled are unaware: Further explorations of (absent) self-insight among the incompetent|year=2008|journal=[[Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes]]|volume=105|issue=1|pages=98–121|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2007.05.002|pmc=2702783|pmid=19568317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying issues of ''Numeracy'' ==
Two unique papers in ''[[National Numeracy Network|Numeracy]]'' reveal problems with the graphic introduced in the 1999 Kruger and Dunning paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuhfer|first=Edward|last2=(retired)|first2=California State University|last3=Cogan|first3=Christopher|last4=Fleischer|first4=Steven|last5=Gaze|first5=Eric|last6=Wirth|first6=Karl|last7=Consultant|first7=Independent|last8=Islands|first8=California State University - Channel|last9=College|first9=Bowdoin|date=2016|title=Random Number Simulations Reveal How Random Noise Affects the Measurements and Graphical Portrayals of Self-Assessed Competency|journal=Numeracy|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.5038/1936-4660.9.1.4|issn=1936-4660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuhfer|first=Edward|last2=(retired)|first2=California State University|last3=Fleischer|first3=Steven|last4=Cogan|first4=Christopher|last5=Wirth|first5=Karl|last6=Gaze|first6=Eric|last7=Islands|first7=California State University - Channel|last8=College|first8=Ventura|last9=College|first9=Macalester|date=2017|title=How Random Noise and a Graphical Convention Subverted Behavioral Scientists' Explanations of Self-Assessment Data: Numeracy Underlies Better Alternatives|journal=Numeracy|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.5038/1936-4660.10.1.4|issn=1936-4660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent researchers used it, (''y'' − ''x'') ''versus'' (''x'') scatter plots, and related variants for nearly two decades. The authors show how a major part of the body of literature that used these approaches seem to have mistaken and interpreted mathematical artifacts as the products of human behavior. The two papers employed paired, well-aligned instruments of known reliability to examine the evaluation of self-assessment measures from the perspective of signal and noise. They show how the mathematical problems inherent in the Kruger–Dunning type graph can be overcome by other kinds of graphing that attenuate noise or employ categorical data from known novices and experts. When artifacts are eliminated, the evidence is strong that humans are generally correct in their self-assessments, with only a small percentage of the participants who were studied exhibiting performance that might merit the label "unskilled and unaware of it". The authors' findings refute the claim that humans, in general, are prone to having greatly inflated views of their abilities, but they support two other tenets of the original Kruger and Dunning research: (1) that self-assessment skill can be learned and (2) experts usually self-assess themselves with better accuracy than do novices. The researchers noted that metacognitive self-assessment skill is of great value, and that it can be taught together with any disciplinary content in college courses.

==Cultural differences in self-perception==
Studies of the Dunning–Kruger effect usually have been of North Americans, but studies of Japanese people suggest that cultural forces have a role in the occurrence of the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/overestimate.aspx|title=Why We overestimate Our Competence|last=DeAngelis|first=Tori|date=February 2003|journal=Monitor on Psychology|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|volume=34|issue=2|page=60|issn=1529-4978|access-date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study ''Divergent Consequences of Success and Failure in Japan and North America: An Investigation of Self-improving Motivations and Malleable Selves'' (2001) indicated that Japanese people tended to underestimate their abilities, and tended to see underachievement (failure) as an opportunity to improve their abilities at a given task, thereby increasing their value to the social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heine|first=S.

==Historical antecedents==

[[Image:Sharav.gif|thumb|250px|Sharav Sluice Energy Tower]]

The '''energy tower''' is a device for producing [[electric power|electrical power]]. The brainchild of Dr. Phillip Carlson,{{Ref|Carlson}} expanded by Professor Dan Zaslavsky and Dr. Rami Guetta from the [[Technion]].{{Ref|ET-brochure}} Energy towers spray water on hot air at the top of the tower, making the cooled air fall through the tower and drive a turbine at the tower's bottom.

== Concept ==

An energy tower (also known as a downdraft energy tower, because the air flows down the tower) is a tall (1,000 meters) and wide (400 meters) hollow cylinder with a water spray system at the top. Pumps lift the water to the top of the tower and then spray the water inside the tower. Evaporation of water cools the hot, dry air hovering at the top. The cooled air, now denser than the outside warmer air, falls through the cylinder, spinning a turbine at the bottom. The turbine drives a generator which produces the electricity.

The greater the temperature difference between the air and water, the greater the energy efficiency. Therefore, downdraft energy towers should work best in a hot dry climate. Energy towers require large quantities of water. Salt water is acceptable, although care must be taken to prevent corrosion, so that [[desalination]] is an example to solve this problem.

The energy that is extracted from the air is ultimately derived from the sun, so this can be considered a form of [[solar power]]. Energy production continues at [[night]], because air retains some of the day's heat after dark. However, power generation by the energy tower is affected by the [[weather]]: it slows down each time the [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|ambient]] [[humidity]] increases (such as during a [[rain]]storm), or the [[temperature]] falls.

A related approach is the [[solar updraft tower]], which heats air in glass enclosures at ground level and sends the heated air up a tower driving turbines at the base. Updraft towers do not pump water, which increases their efficiency, but do require large amounts of land for the collectors. Land acquisition and collector construction costs for updraft towers must be compared to pumping infrastructure costs for downdraft collectors. Operationally, maintaining the collector structures for updraft towers must be compared to pumping costs and pump infrastructure maintenance.

== Cost/efficiency ==

Zaslavsky and other authors estimate that depending on the site and financing costs, energy could be produced in the range of 1-4 cents per kWh, well below alternative energy sources other than hydro. Pumping the water requires about 50% of the turbine's output. Zaslavsky claims that the Energy Tower would achieve up to 70-80% {{Ref|PhysicaPlus}} of the [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot limit]]. If the conversion efficiency turns out to be much lower, it is expected to have an adverse impact on projections made for cost of energy.

Projections made by Altmann{{Ref|Altmann}} and by Czisch{{Ref|Czisch}}{{Ref|Czisch_slides}} about conversion efficiency and about cost of energy (cents/kWh) are based only on model calculations{{Ref|Gutman}}, no data on a working pilot plant have ever been collected.

Actual measurements on the 50&amp;nbsp;kW [[Manzanares, Ciudad Real|Manzanares]] pilot solar updraft tower found a conversion efficiency of 0.53%, although [[Schlaich Bergermann &amp; Partner|SBP]] believe that this could be increased to 1.3% in a large and improved 100&amp;nbsp;MW unit.{{Ref|Mills}} This amounts to about 10% of the theoretical limit for the [[Carnot cycle#The Carnot cycle 2|Carnot cycle]]. It is important to note a significant difference between the up-draft and down-draft proposals. The usage of water as a working-medium dramatically increases the potential for thermal energy capture, and electrical generation, due to its specific heat capacity. While the design may have its problems (see next section) and the stated efficiency claims has yet to be demonstrated, it would be an error to extrapolate performance from one to the other simply because of similarities in the name.

== Potential problems ==

* In salty humid air corrosion rates can be very high. This concerns the tower and the turbines.{{Ref|Zwirn}}
* The technology requires a hot and arid climate. Such locations include the coast of [[West Africa]], [[Western Australia]], northern [[Chile]], [[Namibia]], the [[Red Sea]], [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Gulf of California]]. Most of these regions are remote and thinly populated, and would require power to be [[HVDC|transported over long distances]] to where it is needed. Alternatively, such plants could provide captive power for nearby industrial uses such as [[desalination plant]]s, [[aluminium production]] via the [[Hall-Héroult process]], or to generate [[hydrogen]] for [[ammonia production]].
* Humidity as a result of plant operation may be an issue for nearby communities. A 400 meter diameter powerplant producing wind velocity of 22 meters per second, must add about 15 grams of water per kilogram of air processed. This is equal to 41 tons of water per second.&lt;ref&gt;Pluvinergy&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of humid air, this is 10 cubic kilometers of very humid air each hour. Thus, a community even 100 kilometers away may be unpleasantly affected.  
* Brine is a problem in proportion to the humidity created, since water's vapor pressure decreases with salinity, it is reasonable to expect at least as much brine as water in humidity. This means that a river of brine flows away from the powerplant at 41 tons (m3s-1) per second, along with a river of saline water flowing in with 82 tons of water per second (m3s-1).

Large industrial consumers often locate near cheap sources of electricity. However, many of these desert regions also lack necessary [[infrastructure]], increasing capital requirements and overall risk.

== Demonstration project ==

In 2014 Maryland-based Solar Wind Energy, Inc. proposed to build a {{convert|685|m}} tower. Wind speeds were expected to reach {{convert|80|kph}}. The company claims that a tower near [[San Luis, Arizona]] would produce up to 1,250 MW on sunny days and a yearly average of 435 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.solarwindenergytower.com/the-tower.html | title=About the Tower | accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company claims to have entitlements for a San Luis site and financing agreement (with JDF Capital Inc.) for up to US$1,585,000.{{ref|Giz1406}}

'''Execution by elephant''' was a common method of [[capital punishment]] in [[south Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], particularly in [[India]], where [[Asian elephant]]s were used to [[Crushing (execution)|crush]], dismember or torture captives in [[public execution]]s. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's [[absolute monarchy|absolute power]] and his ability to control wild animals.

The sight of elephants executing captives both horrified and attracted the interest of European travellers and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the [[European colonialism|European empires]] that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by [[Western world|Western]] powers, such as [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Carthage]], particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.

== Cultural aspects ==
The intelligence, domesticability and versatility of the elephant gave it considerable advantages over other wild animals such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than [[horse]]s: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of [[war elephant]]s with generals such as [[Hannibal]]. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners in a variety of ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.

Historically, the elephants were under the constant control of a driver or ''[[mahout]]'', thus enabling a ruler to grant a last-minute reprieve and display merciful qualities.&lt;ref name="allsen"&gt;Allsen, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Several such exercises of [[pardon|mercy]] are recorded in various Asian kingdoms. The kings of [[Siam]] trained their elephants to roll the convicted person "about the ground rather slowly so that he is not badly hurt". The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Emperor]] [[Akbar the Great]] is said to have "used this technique to chastise 'rebels' and then in the end the prisoners, presumably much chastened, were given their lives".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; On one occasion, Akbar was recorded to have had a man thrown to the elephants to suffer five days of such treatment before pardoning him.&lt;ref name="Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants were occasionally used in [[trial by ordeal]] in which the condemned prisoner was released if he managed to fend off the elephant.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;

The use of elephants in such fashion went beyond the common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as [[Thailand]], where [[White elephant (pachyderm)|white elephants]] are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent the message that the ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;

== Geographical scope ==
[[File:Execution by elephant distribution map.svg|thumb|right|350px|Geographical scope of executions by elephant]]
Execution by elephant has been done in many parts of the world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]]. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While [[African elephant]]s are significantly larger than [[Asian elephant]]s, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.

=== Asian powers ===

==== Southeast Asia ====
Elephants are widely reported to have been used to carry out executions in Southeast Asia, and were used in [[Burma]] and [[Malaysia]] from the earliest historical times&lt;ref&gt;Chevers, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the kingdom of [[Champa]] on the other side of the [[Indochina|Indochinese]] Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Edward H. "The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics". University of California Press, 1985. p. 80. ASIN: B0000CLTET&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Siam]], elephants were trained to throw the condemned into the air before trampling them to death.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]] provides the following account from Siam:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|pages=181–182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YCoCwtJd1gC&amp;pg=181|title=A new account of the East Indies|publisher=John Mosman|volume=2|year=1727|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For Treason and Murder, the Elephant is the Executioner. The condemned Person is made fast to a Stake driven into the Ground for the Purpose, and the Elephant is brought to view him, and goes twice or thrice round him, and when the Elephant's Keeper speaks to the monstrous Executioner, he twines his Trunk round the Person and Stake, and pulling the Stake from the Ground with great Violence, tosses the Man and the Stake into the Air, and in coming down, receives him on his Teeth, and making him off again, puts one of his fore Feet on the Carcase, and squeezes it flat.}}

The journal of [[John Crawfurd]] records another method of execution by elephant in the kingdom of [[Cochinchina]] (modern south [[Vietnam]]), where he served as a British envoy in 1821. Crawfurd recalls an event where "the criminal is tied to a stake, and [Excellency's favourite] elephant runs down upon him and crushes him to death."&lt;ref&gt;Crawfurd, John. "Journal of an Embassy from the Governor-general of India to the Courts of Siam and Cochin China". H. Colburn and R. Bentley, 1830. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y53maIltQQwC&amp;pg=PA419&amp;dq=%22On%20these%20occasions%20the%20criminal%20is%20tied%20to%20a%20stake,%20and%20the%20elephant+runs+down+upon+him%20and%20crushes%20him%20to%20death%22&amp;ei=TUotStT_DaHSkATLqPT2Bg p. 419].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Asia ====

===== India =====
Elephants were used as executioners of choice in India for many centuries. Hindu and Muslim rulers executed tax evaders, rebels and enemy soldiers alike "under the feet of elephants".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; The Hindu ''[[Manu Smriti]]'' or Laws of Manu, written down around AD 200, prescribed execution by elephants for a number of offences. If property was stolen, for instance, "the king should have any thieves caught in connection with its disappearance executed by an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1305, the [[Delhi Sultanate|sultan of Delhi]] turned the deaths of [[Mongol]] prisoners into public entertainment by having them crushed by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford-Genghis Khan, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] era, "it was a common mode of execution in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Natesan, G.A. ''The Indian Review'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]], writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler [[Shah Jahan]] ordered an offending military commander to be carried "to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]] ordered the crushing by elephant of an [[imam]] he mistakenly believed to be critical of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor [[Jahangir]], is said to have ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The [[France|French]] traveler [[François Bernier]], who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment.&lt;ref name="Schimmel" /&gt; Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of [[Delhi]], elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces "with pointed blades fitted to their tusks".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;
The Muslim traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], visiting [[Delhi]] in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:&lt;ref&gt;Battuta, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ5CAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:The+intitle:travels+intitle:of+intitle:Ibn+intitle:Battuta&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8K36UOuaLImF4gTe4YDoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The travels of Ibn Battuta]", transl. Lee, S, London 1829, pp. 146-47&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Upon a certain day, when I myself was present, some men were brought out who had been accused of having attempted the life of the Vizier. They were ordered, accordingly, to be thrown to the elephants, which had been taught to cut their victims to pieces. Their hoofs were cased with sharp iron instruments, and the extremities of these were like knives. On such occasions the elephant-driver rode upon them: and, when a man was thrown to them, they would wrap the trunk about him and toss him up, then take him with the teeth and throw him between their fore feet upon the breast, and do just as the driver should bid them, and according to the orders of the Emperor. If the order was to cut him to pieces, the elephant would do so with his irons, and then throw the pieces among the assembled multitude: but if the order was to leave him, he would be left lying before the Emperor, until the skin should be taken off, and stuffed with hay, and the flesh given to the dogs.}}
Other Indian polities also carried out executions by elephant. The [[Maratha]] [[Chatrapati]]  [[Sambhaji]] ordered this form of death for a number of conspirators, including the Maratha official Anaji Datto in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Maratha leader, the general [[Santaji]], inflicted the punishment for breaches in military discipline. The contemporary historian Khafi Khan reported that "for a trifling offense he [Santaji] would cast a man under the feet of an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Le Toru Du MOnde.jpg|thumbnail|[[Louis Rousselet]] described this execution in ''Le Tour du Monde'' in 1868.]]
The early 19th century writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] relates how the king of [[Goa]] "keeps certain elephants for the execution of malefactors. When one of these is brought forth to dispatch a criminal, if his keeper desires that the offender be destroyed speedily, this vast creature will instantly crush him to atoms under his foot; but if desired to torture him, will break his limbs successively, as men are [[breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] cited this flexibility of purpose as evidence that elephants were capable of "human reasoning, [rather] than a simple, natural instinct".&lt;ref&gt;Buffon, Georges Louis Leclerc. "Natural history of man, the globe, and of quadrupeds". vol. 1. Leavitt &amp; Allen, 1857. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such executions were often held in public as a warning to any who may transgress. To that end, many of the elephants were especially large, often weighing in excess of nine tons. The executions were intended to be gruesome and often were. They were sometimes preceded by torture publicly inflicted by the same elephant used for the execution. An account of one such torture-and-execution at [[Baroda]] in 1814 has been preserved in ''The Percy Anecdotes'':

{{quote|The man was a slave, and two days before had murdered his master, brother to a native chieftain, called Ameer Sahib. About eleven o'clock the elephant was brought out, with only the driver on his back, surrounded by natives with bamboos in their hands. The criminal was placed three yards behind on the ground, his legs tied by three ropes, which were fastened to a ring on the right hind leg of the animal. At every step the elephant took, it jerked him forward, and every eight or ten steps must have dislocated another limb, for they were loose and broken when the elephant had proceeded five hundred yards. The man, though covered in mud, showed every sign of life, and seemed to be in the most excruciating torments. After having been tortured in this manner for about an hour, he was taken to the outside of the town, when the elephant, which is instructed for such purposes, was backed, and put his foot on the head of the criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Ryley Scott, George. "The Percy Anecdotes vol. VIII". ''The History of Torture Throughout the Ages''. Torchstream Books, 1940. pp. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The use of elephants as executioners continued well into the latter half of the 19th century. During an expedition to central India in 1868, [[Louis Rousselet]] described the execution of a criminal by an elephant. A sketch depicting the execution showed the condemned being forced to place his head upon a pedestal, and then being held there while an elephant crushed his head underfoot. The sketch was made into a [[woodcut]] and printed in "[[Le Tour du Monde]]", a widely circulated French journal of travel and adventure, as well as foreign journals such as ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Harper's Weekly'', February 3, 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing power of the [[British Empire]] led to the decline and eventual end of elephant executions in India. Writing in 1914, Eleanor Maddock noted that in [[Kashmir]], since the arrival of Europeans, "many of the old customs are disappearing – and one of these is the dreadful custom of the execution of criminals by an elephant trained for the purpose and which was known by the hereditary name of 'Gunga Rao'."&lt;ref&gt;Maddock, Eleanor. "What the Crystal Revealed". ''American Theosophist Magazine'', April to September 1914. p. 859.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Sri Lanka =====
[[File:Crushed by elephant.png|thumb|right|A condemned prisoner being dismembered by an elephant in [[Ceylon]]. Illustration from ''[[An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon]]'' by Robert Knox (1681).]]
Elephants were widely used across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and South Asia as a method of execution. The English sailor [[Robert Knox (sailor)|Robert Knox]], writing in 1681, described a method of execution by elephant which he had witnessed while being held captive in [[Sri Lanka]]. Knox says the elephants he witnessed had their [[tusk]]s fitted with "sharp Iron with a socket with three edges". After impaling the victim's body with its tusks, the elephant would "then tear it in pieces, and throw it limb from limb".&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Robert. "[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14346 An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon]". London, 1681.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century traveler [[James Emerson Tennent]] comments that "a Kandyan [Sri Lankan] chief, who was witness to such scenes, has assured us that the elephant never once applied his tusks, but, placing his foot on the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden movement of his trunk."&lt;ref&gt;Tennent, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's book depicts exactly this method of execution in a famous drawing, ''An Execution by an Eliphant''.

Writing in 1850, the British diplomat [[Henry Charles Sirr]] described a visit to one of the elephants that had been used by [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last king of [[Kandy]], to execute criminals. Crushing by elephant had been abolished by the British after they overthrew the Kandyan kingdom in 1815 but the king's execution elephant was still alive and evidently remembered its former duties. Sirr comments:&lt;ref&gt;Sirr, Sir Charles Henry, quoted in Barrow, George. "Ceylon: Past and Present". John Murray, 1857. pp. 135–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During the native dynasty it was the practice to train elephants to put criminals to death by trampling upon them, the creatures being taught to prolong the agony of the wretched sufferers by crushing the limbs, avoiding the vital parts. With the last tyrant king of Candy, this was a favourite mode of execution and as one of the elephant executioners was at the former capital during our sojourn there we were particularly anxious to test the creature's sagacity and memory. The animal was mottled and of enormous size, and was quietly standing there with his keeper seated upon his neck; the noble who accompanied us desired the man to dismount and stand on one side.

The chief then gave the word of command, ordering the creature to 'slay the wretch!' The elephant raised his trunk, and twined it, as if around a human being; the creature then made motions as if he were depositing the man on the earth before him, then slowly raised his back-foot, placing it alternately upon the spots where the limbs of the sufferer would have been. This he continued to do for some minutes; then, as if satisfied that the bones must be crushed, the elephant raised his trunk high upon his head and stood motionless; the chief then ordered him to 'complete his work,' and the creature immediately placed one foot, as if upon the man's abdomen, and the other upon his head, apparently using his entire strength to crush and terminate the wretch's misery.}}

==== West Asia ====
During the [[medieval]] period, executions by elephants were used by several West Asian imperial powers, including the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] and [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] empires.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; When the Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]], who had a harem of 3,000 wives and 12,000 female slaves, demanded as a wife Hadiqah, the daughter of the Christian Arab [[Al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir|Na'aman]], Na'aman refused to permit his Christian daughter to enter the harem of a [[Zoroastrian]]; for this refusal, he was trampled to death by an elephant.

The practice appears to have been adopted in parts of the Muslim Middle East. [[Rabbi]] [[Petachiah of Ratisbon]], a twelfth-century Jewish traveler, reported an execution by this means during his stay in [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]]-ruled northern [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]):&lt;ref&gt;Benisch, A. (trans). "Travels of Petachia of Ratisbon". London, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Execution of Prisonsers Belgrade-Suleymanname.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] miniature depicting the execution of prisoners of war in [[Belgrade|Nándorfehérvár]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matrakci |last=Nasuh |url=http://warfare.atwebpages.com/Ottoman/Suleymanname/Execution_of_Prisonsers_Belgrade-Suleymanname.htm |title=Execution of Prisoners, Belgrade |date=1588 |work=Süleymanname, Topkapi Sarai Museum, Ms Hazine 1517}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{quote|At [[Nineveh]] there was an elephant. Its head is not protruding. It is big, eats about two wagon loads of straw at once; its mouth is in its breast, and when it wants to eat it protrudes its lip about two [[cubit]]s, takes up the straw with it, and puts it in its mouth. When the sultan condemns anyone to death, they say to the elephant, "this person is guilty." It then seizes him with its lip, casts him aloft and slays him.}}

=== Western empires ===
The [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and [[ancient Macedonians]] occasionally used elephants for executions while also making use of [[war elephant]]s for military purposes, most famously in the case of [[Hannibal]]. Deserters, prisoners of war and military criminals are recorded by ancient chroniclers to have been put to death under the foot of an elephant. [[Perdiccas]], who became regent of [[Macedon]] on the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, had mutineers from the faction of [[Meleager (general)|Meleager]] thrown to the elephants to be crushed in the city of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Robin Lane. "Alexander the Great". Penguin, 2004. p. 474. {{ISBN|0-14-008878-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman writer [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] relates the story in his Historiae Alexandri Magni: "Perdiccas saw that they [the mutineers] were paralyzed and at his mercy. He withdrew from the main body some 300 men who had followed Meleager at the time when he burst from the first meeting held after Alexander's death, and before the eyes of the entire army he threw them to the elephants. All were trampled to death beneath the feet of the beasts...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/aa/source22.htm Curt. 10.6-10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103055130/http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/aa/source22.htm |date=2006-01-03 }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Roman writer [[Valerius Maximus]] records how the general [[Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus]] "after King [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] was vanquished [in 167 BC], for the same fault (desertion) threw men under elephants to be trampled ... And indeed military discipline needs this kind of severe and abrupt punishment, because this is how strength of arms stands firm, which, when it falls away from the right course, will be subverted."&lt;ref&gt;Futrell, Alison (Quoted by) (ed.). "A Sourcebook on the Roman Games". Blackwell Publishing, 2006. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are fewer records of elephants being used as straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by [[Josephus]] and the [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]] of [[3 Maccabees]] in connection with the [[Egyptian Jews]], though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of [[Dionysus]]. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;3 Maccabees 5&lt;/ref&gt; The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;3 Maccabees 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fighting Fantasy''''' is a series of single-player [[role-playing]] [[gamebook]]s created by [[Steve Jackson (UK game designer)|Steve Jackson]] and [[Ian Livingstone]]. The first volume in the series was published in [[paperback]] by [[Puffin Books|Puffin]] in 1982.

The series distinguished itself by mixing [[Choose Your Own Adventure]]-style storytelling with a dice-based role-playing element included within the books themselves. The caption on many of the covers claimed each title was an adventure "in which YOU are the hero!" The majority of the titles followed a fantasy theme, although [[science fiction]], [[post-apocalyptic]], [[superhero]], and modern [[Horror fiction|horror]] gamebooks were also published. The popularity of the series led to the creation of merchandise such as [[action figure]]s, [[board game]]s, role-playing game systems, magazines, [[novel]]s, and [[video game]]s.

Puffin ended the series in 1995, but the rights to the series were eventually purchased by Wizard Books in 2002. Wizard published new editions of the original books and also commissioned six new books over two series, ending in 2012. The rights were then acquired by Scholastic in 2017, which has since published two new titles and reissued ten of the original books with new artwork.

==Overview==
The main text of each gamebook does not progress in a linear fashion, but rather is divided into a series of numbered sections (usually 400, though a few are shorter or longer). Beginning at the first section, the reader typically must pick one of a series of options provided by the text, each option being detailed at a separate non-sequential numbered section (e.g. the reader may be presented with a choice to turn from Section 1 directly to either Section 83 or Section 180) which in turn provides an outcome for the option chosen. The book continues in this fashion until their character is killed in combat, is stopped by the story, or completes the story.  “''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebooks empower the reader, who felt the anxiety or joy of being fantasy heroes themselves – they lived or died by their decisions. And if at first you don’t succeed, try and try again,” said Ian Livingstone of the format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://damiengwalter.com/2012/08/28/fighting-fantasy-interview-with-ian-livingstone/|title=I interviewed Ian Livingstone creator of Fighting Fantasy about the future of gaming|last=Walter|first=Damien G.|date=2012-08-28|website=Nomad Writer|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical ''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebook tasks players with completing a quest. A successful play usually ends with the player reaching the final numbered section of the book. In some cases this can only be achieved by obtaining various story items (e.g. gems in ''[[Deathtrap Dungeon]]'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasygamebooks.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=9 |title=FF3: Deathtrap Dungeon |publisher=Fightingfantasygamebooks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of the titles only feature one path to the solution.

All ''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebooks are illustrated, including full-page pieces and smaller, repeated images scattered throughout the book as breaks or space fillers between sections. Regular contributors (excluding Scholastic editions) included [[Les Edwards]], Terry Oakes, [[Russ Nicholson]], Leo Hartas, [[Ian Miller (illustrator)|Ian Miller]], [[John Blanche]], Martin McKenna, and [[Iain McCaig]].

=== System ===
Each ''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebook requires the reader to create their character, randomly assigning scores to three statistics (Skill, Stamina, and Luck). These, in conjunction with rolling six-sided dice, are used to resolve skill challenges and the combat sections. Some titles use additional statistics or conflict resolution mechanics; most also require the reader to keep an inventory of items.

=== Setting ===
Most early ''Fighting Fantasy'' titles were set in locations later revealed to be on the same continent called Allansia. Later on a whole world named Titan was developed with subsequent gamebooks set on three main continents - Allansia, Khul and the Old World. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www.fightingfantasy.com/ffbadv2.htm |title=Titan |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901091834/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/ffbadv2.htm |archivedate=September 1, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other titles are set in unrelated fantasy, horror, modern day, and sci-fi environments.

==Publication history==
In 1980, Steve Jackson (not to be confused with the [[Steve Jackson (US game designer)|US-based game designer of the same name]]) and Ian Livingstone attended a [[Games Day]], and after meeting with a [[Penguin Books]] editor Geraldine Cook decided to create a series of single-player gamebooks. Their first submission, ''The Magic Quest'', was a short adventure intended to demonstrate the style of game. ''The Magic Quest'' was eventually accepted by Penguin, although the authors devoted a further six months to expanding and improving upon their original concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#format |title=Fighting Fantasy FAQ |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127132716/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#format |archivedate=November 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/ian_livingstone_and_steve_jackson_interview/|title=Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson interview|last=Hamblin|first=Jon|date=2007-08-24|website=Gamesradar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puffin Books (1982–1995)===
The end result was ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'' and, after several rewrites, the book was accepted and published in 1982 under Penguin's children's imprint, Puffin Books. Following the success of this title,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#sold |title=Fighting Fantasy FAQ |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127132716/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#sold |archivedate=November 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson and Livingstone began writing individually to create additional ''Fighting Fantasy'' gamebooks. In 1983, ''[[The Citadel of Chaos]]'' and ''[[The Forest of Doom]]'' were published, by Jackson and Livingstone respectively. Four more titles followed: ''[[Starship Traveller]]'' (the first title with a [[science fiction]] setting), ''[[City of Thieves (gamebook)|City of Thieves]]'', ''[[Deathtrap Dungeon]]'' and ''[[Island of the Lizard King]]''. In 1984, a decision was made to hire more writers to continue the series: Steve Jackson (the U.S.-based founder and owner of [[Steve Jackson Games]]) was the first, followed by others such as Andrew Chapman, [[Carl Sargent]] (aka Keith Martin), [[Marc Gascoigne]], and [[Peter Darvill-Evans]]. Jackson and Livingstone, however, continued to be involved and approved all cover and internal illustrations within the UK.&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#version |title=Fighting Fantasy FAQ |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127132716/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#version |archivedate=November 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{main|Steve Jackson's Sorcery!}}
Jackson wrote a self-contained four-part series titled ''Steve Jackson's Sorcery!'' (1983-1985), which combined the use of combat and sorcery, and introduced the continent later known as the Old World. These featured dice images at the bottom of each page, making it possible for the player to randomly flip through the pages for the equivalent of a dice roll (the ''Fighting Fantasy'' titles published by Wizard Books used the same device). 

Andrew Chapman and Martin Allen also wrote a two-book, two-player adventure titled ''[[Clash of the Princes]]'' (1986). There were also [[List of Fighting Fantasy gamebooks|several supplemental books]] produced that provided more information about the ''Fighting Fantasy'' universe, including a comprehensive bestiary of monsters and a sample adventure. 

Although the ''Fighting Fantasy'' titles had successful sales&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#Concept |title=created |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127132716/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/fffaq.htm#Concept |archivedate=November 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the increasing dominance of [[video game]]s in the 1990s caused a gradual decline. The series was scheduled to conclude with ''[[Return to Firetop Mountain]]'' (book 50, Livingstone, 1992), but due to strong sales of that volume, ten more books were scheduled. Nine were published, the series ending with ''[[Curse of the Mummy]]'' (1995). ''[[Bloodbones]]'', the tenth scheduled title (meant to have been book 60 in the series) was cancelled, but was eventually published by Wizard Books as part of their later reprinting efforts.

===Wizard Books===
====Series 1 (2002–2007)====
In 2002, Wizard Books acquired the rights to the ''Fighting Fantasy'' series and reprinted many of the original titles in a revised order (initially only the gamebooks actually written by Jackson and/or Livingstone were published), starting with ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain''. They also incorporated the ''Sorcery!'' miniseries, as books 9, 11, 13, and 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasycollector.co.uk/wizard_covers.htm |title=Wizard Covers |publisher=Fightingfantasycollector.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new title, ''[[Eye of the Dragon]]'' (by Ian Livingstone) was released in 2005, followed by ''Bloodbones'' in 2006 and ''Howl of the Werewolf'' in 2007. This series used a new logo, the rationale being that the old covers did not suit the modern market.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title=Interview with Simon Flynn on the official Fighting Fantasy website
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

2007 also marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of ''Fighting Fantasy'', and to commemorate the event Wizard Books published a special hardcover edition of ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'' that used the original 1982 cover image and contained extra material such as the dungeon solution and a commentary on ''Fighting Fantasy'' by Livingstone. This series concluded that same year, ending with 29 books.

====Series 2 (2009–2012)====
Wizard Books then began again with a new series of reprints in 2009, again featuring a different cover art style, and again starting with ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain''. These books were physically larger than prior releases, being produced in [[Paperback#Types|B-format]] (like the original ''Advanced Fighting Fantasy'' volumes). Three other original titles were added during this run,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingfantasy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=9 |title=Gamebooks |publisher=Fighting Fantasy |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''Blood of the Zombies'' by Ian Livingstone to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Blood-Zombies-Fighting-Fantasy-Livingstone/dp/1848314051/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347829123&amp;sr=1-1 |title=Blood of the Zombies |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series was 17 books long, although ''Blood of the Zombies'', the last volume released, is unnumbered and packaged differently than the rest.

===Scholastic Books (2017–    )===
A new Fighting Fantasy book by Ian Livingstone, ''The Port of Peril'', was published in August 2017 by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fightingfantasy.com/copy-of-ff-gamebooks-1|title=FF Press Releases|last=|first=|date=|website=Fighting Fantasy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic also released five of the original books. Instead of reusing the original artwork or its style, Scholastic commissioned new artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beastsofwar.com/fighting-fantasy/books-relaunching-scholastic/ Beastsofwar.com] (Retrieved 3 August 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018 a further six titles were published, including a new adventure by author [[Charlie Higson]], entitled ''The Gates of Death''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fightingfantasy.com/charlie-higson-interview|title=Interview with Charlie Higson bestselling author of The Gates of Death|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Fighting Fantasy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/04/fighting-fantasy-game-books-charlie-higson-interview|title=Dare YOU face the orcs? 80s game books Fighting Fantasy return|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2018-04-04|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
=== Printed ===
''[[Warlock (magazine)|Warlock]]'' magazine (first published by Puffin Books and later Games Workshop) provided additional information on the ''Fighting Fantasy'' universe, and each issue featured a short gamebook adventure, new rules, monsters, reviews and comic strips. It was published from 1983 to 1986 and ran for 13 issues in the UK. It was also published in other countries, and continued in Japan until 1997.

In 1984, Steve Jackson published a [[tabletop roleplaying game|roleplaying game]], ''Fighting Fantasy – The Introductory Role-playing Game''. A second game was published in 1989: ''[[Advanced Fighting Fantasy]]'' (AFF). AFF was re-released as a new and further expanded edition by Arion Games in 2011.

In 1985, Steve Jackson wrote a picture gamebook with the title ''Tasks of Tantalon'', in which the player was required to solve a series of puzzles which were presented as large, full-colour pictures containing hidden clues to be located and assembled.

''[[The Warlock of Firetop Mountain (board game)|The Warlock of Firetop Mountain]]'' (1986) and ''[[Legend of Zagor#Other references|Legend of Zagor]]'' (1993) were released as [[board game]]s by [[Games Workshop]] and [[Parker Brothers]] respectively.

In 1992, the ''Fighting Fantasy 10th Anniversary Yearbook'' (a diary with articles, trivia and a gamebook) complete with a boxed set of dice and character sheets was published.

In 2003, Jamie Wallis (not to be confused with [[James Wallis (games designer)|James Wallis]]) adapted eight ''Fighting Fantasy'' and ''Sorcery!'' gamebooks to the ''[[D20 System]]''. These adventures were published by Myriador (now defunct, though PDFs are still available for purchase from Greywood Publishing via third-party online retailers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfandfantasy.co.uk/php/gallery2a.php?subsection=38 |title=Fighting Fantasy: d20 Role Playing Game Conversions |publisher=SFandFantasy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video game ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain: Goblin Scourge Edition'' was released by Tin Man Games for the Nintendo Switch on Sep 13, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-warlock-of-firetop-mountain-goblin-scourge-edition-switch&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile ===
On December 5, 2006, it was announced that Jackson and Livingstone were planning to release a new series of handheld games based on ''Fighting Fantasy'' for [[Nintendo DS]] and Sony's [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=21532 |title=Fighting Fantasy gamebooks to come to handhelds // News |publisher=Gamesindustry.biz |date= |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, ''[[Fighting Fantasy: The Warlock of Firetop Mountain]]'', was released for the DS in the United States on November 25, 2009, and for the [[Apple iPhone]] and [[iPod]] in early January 2010.

On February 10, 2011 an [[Amazon Kindle]] edition of ''The Warlock of Firetop Mountain'' was launched by UK developer [[Worldweaver Ltd]], for the US market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweaver.com/Gamebooks.aspx |title=Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf gamebooks at Worldweaver Ltd.|publisher=worldweaver.com|date= |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Warlock'' and four other gamebooks were released on iOS by Big Blue Bubble, but were removed from the app store in 2012 when they lost the licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://toucharcade.com/2012/08/07/fighting-fantasy-series-delisting-august-14th-entire-gamebook-adventures-series-currently-on-sale/ | title='Fighting Fantasy' Series Delisting August 14th | accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shamutanti Hills goes live]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sorcery! (video game)|Inkle's Sorcery! series]] is available on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.

==Reception==
The series sold 20 million copies in the 80s and 90s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/04/fighting-fantasy-game-books-charlie-higson-interview ''Dare YOU face the orcs? 80s game books Fighting Fantasy return'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fighting Fantasy'' was ranked 47th in the 1996 reader poll of ''Arcane'' magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time.  The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: "To say that it is basic would be a huge understatement – ''Fighting Fantasy'' has just a couple of stats from which a character is created, and combat is a simple case of rolling six-sided dice, pitching one creature's slats against another. It's fun, quick and easy, which explains its popularity."&lt;ref name="Arcane14"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Pettengale|first=Paul|date= Christmas 1996 |title=Arcane Presents the Top 50 Roleplaying Games 1996|journal=Arcane|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=14|pages=25-35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geopolitics South Russia2.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Geopolitics of Eastern Europe, early-2014, showing the frozen conflict zones of [[Transnistria]], [[Crimea]], [[Abkhazia]], and [[South Ossetia]] (numbered 1–4), as well as [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] (shown as darker shaded region within Azerbaijan), [[Northern Cyprus]] (lighter region within Cyprus), and [[Kosovo]] (beige region within Serbia). [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], and the [[Golan Heights]] also appear on the map, although they are not highlighted. Frozen conflict zones elsewhere in the world do not appear.]]
In [[international relations]], a '''frozen conflict''' is a situation in which [[war|active armed conflict]] has been brought to an end, but no [[peace treaty]] or other political framework resolves the conflict to the satisfaction of the combatants. Therefore, legally the conflict can start again at any moment, creating an environment of insecurity and instability.

The term has been commonly used for [[post-Soviet conflicts]], but it has also often been applied to other perennial [[territorial dispute]]s.&lt;ref name="tisdall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/22/frozen-conflict-spreads-across-globe |title=This dangerous new world of self-interested nations |author=Simon Tisdall |publisher=The Guardian |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots591=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=133740 |title=North and South Korea: A Frozen Conflict on the Verge of Unfreezing? |publisher=Isn.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12494503 |title=Europe: Frozen conflicts |publisher=The Economist |date=2008-11-19 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[de facto]]'' situation that emerges may match the ''[[de jure]]'' position asserted by one party to the conflict; for example, [[Russia]] claims and effectively controls [[Crimea]] following the [[2014 Crimean crisis]] despite [[Ukraine]]'s continuing claim to the region. Alternatively, the ''de facto'' situation may not match either side's official claim. The [[division of Korea]] is an example of the latter situation: both the [[Republic of Korea]] and the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] officially assert claims to the entire peninsula; however, there exists a well-defined border between the two countries' areas of control.

Frozen conflicts sometimes result in [[partially recognized state]]s. For example, the [[Republic of South Ossetia]], a product of the frozen [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict]], is [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|recognized]] by eight other states, including five UN members; the other three of these entities are partially recognized states themselves.

==Examples==
{{History Of The Cold War}}
===In post-Soviet territories===
{{main|Post-Soviet conflicts}}
Following the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, a number of [[Post-Soviet conflicts|conflicts]] arose in areas of some of the [[post-Soviet states]], usually where the new international borders did not match the [[ethnic]] affiliations of local populations. These conflicts have largely remained "frozen", with disputed areas under the ''de facto'' control of entities other than the countries to which they are internationally recognized as belonging, and which still consider those areas to be part of their territory.

Since the ceasefire which ended the [[Transnistria War]] (1990–1992), the [[Russia]]n-influenced breakaway republic of [[Transnistria]] has controlled the easternmost strip of the territory of [[Moldova]]. The republic is internationally unrecognized, and Moldova continues to claim the territory.

Nagorno-Karabakh is a [[List of territorial disputes|disputed territory]], internationally recognized as part of [[Azerbaijan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.un.org/press/en/2008/ga10693.doc.htm|title=General Assembly adopts resolution reaffirming territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, demanding withdrawal of all Armenian forces|publisher=United Nations| date=14 March 2008| accessdate =30 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the region is governed by the [[Republic of Artsakh]] (formerly named Nagorno-Karabakh Republic), a ''de facto'' independent state with Armenian ethnic majority established on the basis of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Azerbaijan has not exercised political authority over the region since the advent of the [[Karabakh movement]] in 1988. Since the end of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] in 1994, representatives of the governments of [[Armenia]] and Azerbaijan have been holding peace talks mediated by the [[OSCE Minsk Group]] on the region's disputed status.

The [[Abkhaz–Georgian conflict]] and [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict]] have led to the creation of two largely unrecognized states within the internationally recognized territory of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The [[1991–92 South Ossetia War]] and the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)]], followed by the [[Russo-Georgian War]] of August 2008, have left the Russian-backed [[Republic of South Ossetia]] and [[Republic of Abkhazia]] in ''de facto'' control of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions in north and northwest Georgia.

In 2014, [[Crimea]] was occupied by the Russian troops without insignia while [[Ukraine]] was still recovering from large scale violence in the capital, and soon afterwards was admitted into the [[Russian Federation]]. This is widely regarded as an [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of the peninsula by Russia]], and is considered likely to result in another post-Soviet frozen conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/27/opinion/ukraine-crimea-russia/ Will Ukraine's Crimea region be Europe's next 'frozen' conflict?], CNN, Feb 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While there are similarities between Transnistria, Abkhazia and the 2014–2015 [[War in Donbass]], where the unrecognized [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Lugansk People's Republic]] have taken ''de facto'' control of areas in the [[Donbass]] region in eastern Ukraine, the conflict in Donbass is not a frozen conflict yet as ceasefire violations are keeping the fighting on a low burner. However, some experts predict a frozen future for this conflict as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepoliticon.net/analytics/291-ukraine-towards-a-frozen-future.html Rusif Huseynov.

[[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have fought at least three wars over the disputed region of [[Kashmir]] in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1999|1999]]. India claims the entire area of the former princely state of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Kashmir and Jammu]], of which it administers approximately 43%. Its claims are contested by Pakistan, which controls approximately 37% of the region and urges for plebiscite in Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1209319 | title=PM Nawaz urges Ban Ki-moon for plebiscite in Kashmir | date=28 September 2015 | work=Dawn | accessdate=23 March 2017 | author=Irfan Haider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pkkh"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.defence.pk/forums/central-south-asia/233237-pak-india-dialogue-single-point-agenda-kashmir-pkkh-tv.html| title=PAK-INDIA Dialogue: Single-Point-Agenda: KASHMIR | date=4 February 2013 | agency=PKKH | accessdate=18 August 2013 | author=Durrani, Atiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining territory is controlled by the People's Republic of China, with which India is again in dispute and have fought the [[Sino-Indian War]].

The [[Cross-Strait relations|conflict between mainland China and Taiwan]] remains frozen since 1949. Both the [[People's Republic of China]] in the Mainland and the [[Republic of China]] in [[Taiwan]] consider the other to be part of its territory. While the latter especially is not recognized by a majority of countries and states internationally, it remains a ''de facto'' independent administration in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, and PRC's ''de facto'' administration remains in the Mainland.

The [[division of Korea]] was frozen from 1953, when a ceasefire ended the [[Korean War]]; until 27 April 2018, when the two countries agreed to [[April 2018 inter-Korean summit|end the war]] formally. Both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] governments claim the entire peninsula, while ''de facto'' control is divided along the military demarcation line in the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]].

Hostilities of the 1991 [[Gulf War]] ended when the [[United Nations]] and [[Iraq]] signed a [[ceasefire]] agreement on April 3, 1991; Kuwait was liberated from being annexed by Iraq and its sovereignty was recognized by the latter. Due to sporadic conflicts through the [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], the war remained frozen for the time being until 12 years later when the [[United States]] and its "[[Coalition of the willing]]" launched the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] and removed dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] from power over the non-compliance with [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq|UN Resolutions passed against Iraq]] following the 1991 war.

The [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] is a perennial conflict between [[Israel]] and its Arab neighbours, including the [[Palestinian territories]]. Israel refuses to recognize [[Palestinian statehood]] without an assured peace deal, while some Arab countries and groups refuse to recognize Israel. Israel has ''de facto'' control of [[East Jerusalem]] and claims it as its integral territory, although it is not internationally recognized as such. Similarly most of the [[Golan Heights]] are currently under ''de facto'' Israeli control and civil administration, whereas the international community rejects that claim.

The dispute over the [[Kosovo status process|status of Kosovo]] remains frozen since the end of the [[Kosovo War]], fought in 1998–1999 between Yugoslav forces ([[Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslavia]]) and the ethnically Albanian [[Kosovo Liberation Army]]. The [[Kosovo]] region has been administered independently since the war, and the Republic of Kosovo declared its independence from [[Serbia]] in 2008, but it is not recognized by all countries worldwide, and Serbia still considers Kosovo part of its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/09/kosovo.eu|title=Ian Bancroft: A new frozen conflict in Kosovo?|last=Bancroft|first=Ian|date=2008-06-09|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jamestown.org/program/kosovo-russias-fifth-frozen-conflict/|title=KOSOVO: RUSSIA'S FIFTH FROZEN CONFLICT? - Jamestown|work=Jamestown|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GIF art''', is a form of [[digital art]], first emerging in 1987. The technology for the animated [[GIF]] has become more and more advanced through the years. After 2010, a new generation of artists focused on experimenting with its potential for presenting creativity on the [[World Wide Web]]. Mass access to the [[Internet]] allowed their GIFs to travel rapidly and [[Viral phenomenon|virally]] online, through social platforms such as [[Tumblr]] and [[Giphy]], and to be recognized as a new form of art.

GIF art has been around since the year 1987, increasingly gaining attention from the audience some years after 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/augmented-reality-brings-gif-art-to-a-subway-platform Augmented Reality Brings GIF Art to a Subway Platform Near You&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary art galleries &lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacesgallery.org/project/the-vault-november--january-2015 GIF art Exhibition "The Invasion Has Begun"&lt;/ref&gt; and institutions like the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)]] are popular among many young artists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/14/3019468/GIF-exhibit-We-Tripped-El-Hadji-Diouf-museum-of-the-moving-image When GIFs become art: a trip to the Museum of the Moving Image&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.movingimage.us/films/2015/01/09/detail/first-look-gifs-2/ 7 GIF artist at Museum of the Moving Image New York&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green computing''', '''green ICT''' as per International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT", '''green IT''', or '''ICT sustainability''', is the study and practice of [[environmentally sustainable]] computing or IT.

The goals of green computing are similar to [[green chemistry]]: reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] during the product's lifetime,  the [[recycling|recyclability]] or [[Biodegradation|biodegradability]] of defunct products and factory waste. Green computing is important for all classes of systems, ranging from handheld systems&lt;ref&gt;S.

[[File:Energy Star logo.svg|thumb|right|Energy Star logo|100px]]
In 1992, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] launched [[Energy Star]], a voluntary labeling program that is designed to promote and recognize the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in monitors, climate control equipment, and other technologies. This resulted in the widespread adoption of [[sleep mode]] among consumer electronics. Concurrently, the Swedish organization TCO Development launched the [[TCO Certification]] program to promote low magnetic and electrical emissions from [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based [[computer display]]s; this program was later expanded to include criteria on energy consumption, [[ergonomics]], and the use of hazardous materials in construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TCO takes the initiative in comparative product testing |accessdate=May 3, 2008 |date=May 3, 2008 |url=http://www.boivie.se/index.php?page=2&amp;lang=eng |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723060821/http://www.boivie.se/index.php?page=2&amp;lang=eng |archive-date=July 23, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations and industry initiatives==
The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) has published a survey of over 90 government and industry initiatives on "Green ICTs", i.e. information and communication technologies, the environment and climate change. The report concludes that initiatives tend to concentrate on the greening ICTs themselves rather than on their actual implementation to tackle global warming and environmental degradation. In general, only 20% of initiatives have measurable targets, with government programs tending to include targets more frequently than business associations.&lt;ref&gt;Full report: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/47/12/42825130.pdf|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|title=Towards Green ICT strategies: Assessing Policies and Programmes on ICTs and the Environment|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317103746/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/47/12/42825130.pdf|archive-date=March 17, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}} Summary: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/43044065.pdf|title=Executive summary of OECD report|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317102750/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/43044065.pdf|archive-date=March 17, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
Many [[governmental]] agencies have continued to implement standards and regulations that encourage green computing. The [[Energy Star]] program was revised in October 2006 to include stricter efficiency requirements for computer equipment, along with a tiered ranking system for approved products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EPA Announces New Computer Efficiency Requirements |date=October 23, 2006 |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a8f952395381d3968525701c005e65b5/113b0c0647fee41585257210006474f1!OpenDocument |last=Jones |first=Ernesta |publisher=U.S. EPA |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212022429/http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a8f952395381d3968525701c005e65b5/113b0c0647fee41585257210006474f1!OpenDocument |archive-date=February 12, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2097558,00.asp |title=How Important Will New Energy Star Be for PC Makers? |last=Gardiner |first=Bryan |date=February 22, 2007 |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826193654/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2097558,00.asp |archive-date=August 26, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, 26 US states established statewide recycling programs for obsolete computers and consumer electronics equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-takeback.org/docs%20open/Toolkit_Legislators/state%20legislation/state_leg_main.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306222713/http://www.e-takeback.org/docs%20open/Toolkit_Legislators/state%20legislation/state_leg_main.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |title= State Legislation on E-Waste |date=March 20, 2008 |publisher=Electronics Take Back Coalition |accessdate=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statutes either impose an "advance recovery fee" for each unit sold at retail or require the manufacturers to reclaim the equipment at disposal.

In 2010, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) was signed into legislation by President Obama. The bill allocated over $90 billion to be invested in green initiatives (renewable energy, smart grids, energy efficiency, etc.) In January 2010, the U.S. Energy Department granted $47 million of the ARRA money towards projects that aim to improve the energy efficiency of data centers. The projects provided research to optimize data center hardware and software, improve power supply chain, and [[computer cooling|data center cooling technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.energy.gov/news2009/8491.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527141406/http://www.energy.gov/news2009/8491.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |title=Secretary Chu Announces $47 Million to Improve Efficiency in Information Technology and Communications Sectors |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was started on 2007-06-12. The name stems from the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s Climate Savers program, which was launched in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215151042/http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/index.html |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |title=What exactly is the Climate Savers Computing Initiative? |publisher=Climate Savers Computing Initiative |year=2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WWF is also a member of the Computing Initiative.&lt;ref name="CSCI_pressrel_launch" /&gt;
* The [[Green Electronics Council]] offers the [[Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool]] (EPEAT) to assist in the purchase of "greener" computing systems. The Council evaluates computing equipment on 51 criteria - 23 required and 28 optional - that measure a product's efficiency and sustainability attributes. Products are rated Gold, Silver, or Bronze, depending on how many optional criteria they meet. On 2007-01-24, President [[George W. Bush]] issued Executive Order 13423, which requires all United States Federal agencies to use EPEAT when purchasing computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20(1-24-07).pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qCuJd6am?url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20%281-24-07%29.pdf |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |title=President Bush Requires Federal Agencies to Buy EPEAT Registered Green Electronic Products |publisher=Green Electronics Council |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |title=Executive Order: Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management |publisher=The White House: Office of the Press Secretary |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831005045/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |archive-date=August 31, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Green Grid]] is a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy efficiency in data centers and business computing ecosystems. It was founded in February 2007 by several key companies in the industry&amp;nbsp;– [[AMD]], [[American Power Conversion|APC]], [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Rackable Systems]], [[SprayCool]] (purchased in 2010 by [http://www.parker.com/portal/site/Market-Tech/menuitem.e9f921bc8ae21676de92b210237ad1ca/?vgnextoid=e7bfa7bee4a70310VgnVCM10000048021dacRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default Parker]), [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[VMware]]. The Green Grid has since grown to hundreds of members, including end-users and government organizations, all focused on improving [[data center infrastructure efficiency]] (DCIE).
* The [[Green500]] list rates supercomputers by energy efficiency ([[megaflops]]/[[watt]]), encouraging a focus on efficiency rather than absolute performance.
* [[Green Comm Challenge]] is an organization that promotes the development of energy conservation technology and practices in the field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT).
* The [[Transaction Processing Performance Council]] (TPC) Energy specification augments existing TPC benchmarks by allowing optional publications of energy metrics alongside performance results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Energy benchmarks: a detailed analysis (e-Energy 2006) |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1791314.1791336|publisher=ACM. {{ISBN|978-1-4503-0042-1}}.

Other benchmarks which measure energy efficiency include [[SPECweb]], [[SPECvirt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spec.org/power/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412195835/http://www.spec.org/power/ |archivedate=April 12, 2013 |title=SPEC Power and Performance Committee |publisher=SPEC |year=2013 |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[VMmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vmmark.com |title=www.vmmark.com |publisher=VMware |year=2013 |accessdate=May 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430182231/http://www.vmmark.com/ |archive-date=April 30, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Modern [[Information technology|IT]] systems rely upon a complicated mix of people, networks, and hardware; as such, a green computing initiative must cover all of these areas as well. A solution may also need to address end user satisfaction, management restructuring, regulatory compliance, and return on investment (ROI). There are also considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power consumption; "of the power management tools available, one of the most powerful may still be simple, plain, common sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Green-and-lean-it-data-centre-efficiency.cfm |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100706131340/http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Green-and-lean-it-data-centre-efficiency.cfm |archivedate =July 6, 2010 |title=The common sense of lean and green IT |work=Deloitte Technology Predictions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product longevity===
[[Gartner]] maintains that the PC manufacturing process accounts for 70% of the natural resources used in the life cycle of a PC.&lt;ref&gt;InfoWorld July 6, 2009;
{{cite web |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/used-pc-strategy-passes-toxic-buck-300?_kip_ipx=1053322433-1267784052&amp;_pxn=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121223HCFSDBIFBWETHVYUSDVFSDJB CFSDBVGZDGFCHGSDVYUFSDYVGASJDVG315/http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/used-pc-strategy-passes-toxic-buck-300?_kip_ipx=1053322433-1267784052&amp;_pxn=0 |archivedate=January 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fujitsu released a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a desktop that show that manufacturing and end of life accounts for the majority of this desktop's ecological footprint.&lt;ref&gt;GreenIT.fr Feb. 2011; http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/pc-de-bureau/quelle-est-l-empreinte-carbone-d-un-ordinateur-3478 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424020904/http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/pc-de-bureau/quelle-est-l-empreinte-carbone-d-un-ordinateur-3478 |date=April 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the biggest contribution to green computing usually is to prolong the equipment's lifetime. Another report from Gartner recommends to "Look for product longevity, including upgradability and modularity."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Mingay, Gartner: 10 Key Elements of a 'Green IT' Strategy;
{{cite web |url=http://www.onsitelasermedic.com/pdf/10_key_elements_greenIT.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730120749/http://www.onsitelasermedic.com/pdf/10_key_elements_greenIT.pdf |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, manufacturing a new PC makes a far bigger [[ecological footprint]] than manufacturing a new [[RAM]] module to upgrade an existing one.

===Data center design===
Data center facilities are heavy consumers of energy, accounting for between 1.1% and 1.5% of the world’s total energy use in 2010 [1]. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that data center facilities consume up to 100 to 200 times more energy than standard office buildings.&lt;ref name="https://energy.gov"&gt;“Best Practices Guide for Energy-Efficient Data Center Design”, prepared by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy, Federal Energy Management Program, March 2011.[https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220151305/https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf |date=December 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficient data center design should address all of the energy use aspects included in a data center: from the IT equipment to the HVAC(Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) equipment to the actual location, configuration and construction of the building.

The U.S. Department of Energy specifies five primary areas on which to focus energy efficient data center design best practices:&lt;ref&gt;Koomey, Jonathon. “Growth in data center electricity use 2005 to 2010,” Oakland, CA: Analytics Press. August 1. {{cite web |url=http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111082558/http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Information technology (IT) systems
* Environmental conditions
* Air management
* Cooling systems
* Electrical systems

Additional energy efficient design opportunities specified by the U.S. Department of Energy include on-site electrical generation and recycling of waste heat.&lt;ref&gt;Junaid Shuja, Abdullah Gani, Shahaboddin Shamshirband, Raja Wasim Ahmad, Kashif Bilal, Sustainable Cloud Data Centers: A survey of enabling techniques and technologies, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Volume 62, September 2016, Pages 195-214, ISSN 1364-0321, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.034&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficient data center design should help to better utilize a data center’s space, and increase performance and efficiency.

In 2018, three new US Patents make use of facilities design to simultaneously cool and produce electrical power by use of internal and external waste heat. The three patents use silo design for stimulating use internal waste heat, while the recirculation of the air cooling the silo's computing racks. US Patent  [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=4&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 9,510,486], uses the recirculating air for power generation, while sister patent, US Patent [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=2&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 9,907,213], forces the recirculation of the same air, and sister patent, US Patent [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 10,020,436], uses thermal differences in temperature resulting in negative power usage effectiveness.  Negative power usage effectiveness, makes use of extreme differences between temperatures at times running the computing facilities, that they would run only from external sources other than the power use for computing. 

===Software and deployment optimization===

====Algorithmic efficiency====
{{Main article|Algorithmic efficiency}}
{{Further|Analysis of algorithms}}
The efficiency of algorithms affects the amount of computer resources required for any given computing function and there are many efficiency trade-offs in writing programs.  Algorithm changes, such as switching from a slow (e.g. linear) search algorithm to a fast (e.g. hashed or indexed) search algorithm can reduce resource usage for a given task from substantial to close to zero. &lt;!-- algorithmic efficiency personal example: I re-coded a SQL report query (that was run several times a day) that took 30 minutes to run in 15 seconds.  Impressive?  Sure!  Unusual?  Hardly.  I'm sure there are citeable examples.--&gt; In 2009, a study by a physicist at [[Harvard]] estimated that the average Google search released 7&amp;nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide (CO₂).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479127,00.html | title=Research reveals environmental impact of Google searches. | accessdate=January 15, 2009 | work=Fox News | date=January 12, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112195017/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479127,00.html | archive-date=January 12, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Google disputed this figure, arguing instead that a typical search produced only 0.2&amp;nbsp;grams of CO₂.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html | title=Powering a Google search | accessdate=October 1, 2009 | work=Official Google Blog | publisher=Google | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729054622/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html | archive-date=July 29, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resource allocation====
{{Main article|Resource allocation}}
Algorithms can also be used to route data to data centers where electricity is less expensive. Researchers from MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and Akamai have tested an energy allocation algorithm that successfully routes traffic to the location with the cheapest energy costs. The researchers project up to a 40 percent savings on energy costs if their proposed algorithm were to be deployed. However, this approach does not actually reduce the amount of energy being used; it reduces only the cost to the company using it. Nonetheless, a similar strategy could be used to direct traffic to rely on energy that is produced in a more environmentally friendly or efficient way. A similar approach has also been used to cut energy usage by routing traffic away from data centers experiencing warm weather; this allows computers to be shut down to avoid using air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rear don |first= Marguerite |title= Energy-aware Internet routing coming soon |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10312408-54.html |date= August 18, 2009 |accessdate= August 19, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110617075237/http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10312408-54.html |archive-date= June 17, 2011 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger server centers are sometimes located where energy and land are inexpensive and readily available. Local availability of renewable energy, climate that allows outside air to be used for cooling, or locating them where the heat they produce may be used for other purposes could be factors in green siting decisions.

Approaches to actually reduce the energy consumption of network devices by proper network/device management techniques are surveyed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author1=Aruna Prem Bianzino |author2=Claude Chaudet |author3=Dario Rossi |author4=Jean-Louis Rougier|title=A Survey of Green Networking Research |arxiv= 1010.3880 |class=cs.NI|date= October 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors grouped the approaches into 4 main strategies, namely (i) Adaptive Link Rate (ALR), (ii) Interface Proxying, (iii) Energy Aware Infrastructure, and (iv) Max Energy Aware Applications.

====Virtualizing====
{{Main article|Platform virtualization}}
{{See also|Comparison of platform virtualization software}}
Computer virtualization refers to the abstraction of computer resources, such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware. The concept originated with the IBM [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] operating systems of the 1960s, but was commercialized for [[x86 architecture|x86]]-compatible computers only in the 1990s. With virtualization, a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single, powerful system, thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption. Virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state. Several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing. [[Intel Corporation]] and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] have also built proprietary [[x86 virtualization#Hardware support|virtualization enhancements]] to the x86 [[instruction set]] into each of their CPU product lines, in order to facilitate virtual computing.

New virtual technologies, such as [[Linux Containers]] can also be used to reduce energy consumption. These technologies make a ore efficient use of resources, thus reducing energy consumption by design. Also, the consolidation of virtualized technologies is more efficient than the one done in [[Virtual machine|virtual machines]], so more services can be deployed in the same physical machine, reducing the amount of hardware needed. &lt;ref&gt;Ismael Cuadrado-Cordero, Anne-Cécile Orgerie, Jean-Marc Menaud., [https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01578325v2 “Comparative Experimental Analysis of the Quality-of-Service and Energy-Efficiency of VMs and Containers' Consolidation for Cloud Applications,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233816/https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01578325v2 |date=June 28, 2018 }} International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM 2017), Sep 2017, Split, Croatia. pp.1-6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminal servers====
{{Main article|Terminal server}}
Terminal servers have also been used in green computing. When using the system, users at a terminal connect to a central server; all of the actual computing is done on the server, but the end user experiences the operating system on the terminal. These can be combined with [[thin client]]s, which use up to 1/8 the amount of energy of a normal workstation, resulting in a decrease of energy costs and consumption.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} There has been an increase in using terminal services with thin clients to create virtual labs. Examples of terminal server software include [[Terminal Services]] for Windows and the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]] (LTSP) for the [[Linux operating system]]. Software-based remote desktop clients such as [[Windows Remote Desktop]] and [[RealVNC]] can provide similar thin-client functions when run on low power, commodity hardware that connects to a server.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hci.stanford.edu/cstr/reports/2011-02.pdf|title=Software or Hardware: The Future of Green Enterprise Computing|last=Kazandjieva|first=Maria|date=|work=|access-date=|last2=Heller|first2=Brandon|last3=Gnawali|first3=Omprakash|last4=Hofer|first4=Wanja|last5=Levis|first5=Philip|last6=Kozyrakis|first6=Christos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619190042/http://hci.stanford.edu/cstr/reports/2011-02.pdf|archive-date=June 19, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power management===
{{Main article|Power management}}
The [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface]] (ACPI), an open industry standard, allows an operating system to directly control the power-saving aspects of its underlying hardware. This allows a system to automatically turn off components such as [[computer display|monitors]] and [[hard drive]]s after set periods of inactivity. In addition, a system may [[Hibernation (computing)|hibernate]], when most components (including the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and the system RAM) are turned off. ACPI is a successor to an earlier Intel-Microsoft standard called [[Advanced Power Management]], which allows a computer's [[BIOS]] to control power management functions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Some programs allow the user to manually adjust the voltages supplied to the CPU, which reduces both the amount of heat produced and electricity consumed. This process is called [[undervolting]]. Some CPUs can automatically undervolt the processor, depending on the workload; this technology is called "[[SpeedStep]]" on Intel processors, "[[PowerNow!]]"/"[[Cool'n'Quiet]]" on AMD chips, [[LongHaul]] on [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] CPUs, and [[LongRun]] with [[Transmeta]] processors.

====Data center power====
Data centers, which have been criticized for their extraordinarily high energy demand, are a primary focus for proponents of green computing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceGCS9"&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/6982393/Power_Management_Techniques_for_Data_Centers_A_Survey Power Management Techniques for Data Centers: A Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114005435/http://www.academia.edu/6982393/Power_Management_Techniques_for_Data_Centers_A_Survey |date=November 14, 2017 }}", 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kurp, Patrick."Green Computing," ''Communications of the ACM''51(10):11.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a [[Greenpeace]] study, data centers represent 21% of the electricity consumed by the IT sector, which is about 382 billion kWh a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/35f0ac1a-clickclean2016-hires.pdf|title=CLICKING CLEAN: WHO IS WINNING  THE RACE TO BUILD  A GREEN INTERNET|last=Greenpeace|first=|date=2017|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706161712/https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/35f0ac1a-clickclean2016-hires.pdf|archive-date=July 6, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data centers can potentially improve their energy and space efficiency through techniques such as storage consolidation and virtualization. Many organizations are aiming to eliminate underutilized servers, which results in lower energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/green-it-over.aspx|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110211120149/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/green-it-over.aspx|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 11 February 2011|title= Is Green IT Over?|publisher=Dell.com | accessdate=21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step toward this aim will be training of data center administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sdiwc.net/digital-library/towards-green-computing-application-for-measuring-the-sustainability-of-data-centers-an-analytical-survey.html|title= Towards Green Computing Application for Measuring the Sustainability of Data Centers: An Analytical Survey, Zohreh Gandomi, Salmiah Amin|publisher= SDIWC Digital Library|access-date= November 1, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402210100/http://sdiwc.net/digital-library/towards-green-computing-application-for-measuring-the-sustainability-of-data-centers-an-analytical-survey.html|archive-date= April 2, 2015|dead-url= no|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. federal government has set a minimum 10% reduction target for data center energy usage by 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; With the aid of a self-styled ultraefficient evaporative cooling technology, Google Inc. has been able to reduce its energy consumption to 50% of that of the industry average.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Operating system support====
&lt;!-- Needs Mac and Linux coverage. Also, this may be too detailed for a summary--&gt;
Microsoft Windows, has included limited [[PC power management]] features since Windows 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810046.aspx |title=Windows 95 Power Management |access-date=April 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311193319/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810046.aspx |archive-date=March 11, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These initially provided for stand-by (suspend-to-RAM) and a monitor low power state. Further iterations of Windows added hibernate (suspend-to-disk) and support for the [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] standard. Windows 2000 was the first NT-based operating system to include power management. This required major changes to the underlying operating system architecture and a new hardware driver model. Windows 2000 also introduced [[Group Policy]], a technology that allowed administrators to centrally configure most Windows features. However, power management was not one of those features. This is probably because the power management settings design relied upon a connected set of per-user and per-machine binary registry values,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/greenit/powerdown |title=Windows power-saving options are, bizarrely, stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127034201/http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/greenit/powerdown/ |archivedate=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively leaving it up to each user to configure their own power management settings.

This approach, which is not compatible with Windows Group Policy, was repeated in Windows XP. The reasons for this design decision by Microsoft are not known, and it has resulted in heavy criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php |title=How Windows XP Wasted $25 Billion of Energy |date=November 21, 2006 |accessdate=November 21, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127051214/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php |archive-date=November 27, 2006 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this section, while quite possibly true, sounded like OR so I cut it out. In fact, the treehugger source is basically a blog... can we do better?

====Power supply====
Desktop [[computer power supply|computer power supplies]]  are in general 70–75% efficient,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/02/28/strong_showing/page38.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121216144500/http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/02/28/strong_showing/page38.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 16, 2012 |title=Strong Showing: High-Performance Power Supply Units |last=Schuhmann |first=Daniel |date=February 28, 2005 |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |publisher=Tom's Hardware }}&lt;/ref&gt; dissipating the remaining energy as heat. A certification program called [[80 Plus]] certifies PSUs that are at least 80% efficient; typically these models are drop-in replacements for older, less efficient PSUs of the same form factor. As of July 20, 2007, all new Energy Star 4.0-certified desktop PSUs must be at least 80% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=computers.pr_crit_computers |title=Computer Key Product Criteria |publisher=Energy Star |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |date=July 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074314/http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=computers.pr_crit_computers |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent case study, [[Fusion-io]], manufacturer of solid state storage devices, managed to reduce the energy use and operating costs of [[MySpace]] data centers by 80% while increasing performance speeds beyond that which had been attainable via multiple hard disk drives in Raid 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Media Galleries Temporarily Disabled |url=http://community.fusionio.com/media/p/458/download.aspx |title=Media Galleries Temporarily Disabled - Fusion-io Community Forum |publisher=Community.fusionio.com |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, MySpace was able to retire several of their servers.

As hard drive prices have fallen, storage farms have tended to increase in capacity to make more data available online. This includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage. The increase in online storage has increased power consumption. Reducing the power consumed by large storage arrays, while still providing the benefits of online storage, is a subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/1255635/IBM-chief-engineer-talks-green-storage IBM chief engineer talks green storage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502041656/http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/1255635/IBM-chief-engineer-talks-green-storage |date=May 2, 2013 }}, SearchStorage - TechTarget&lt;/ref&gt;

====Video card====
A fast [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] may be the largest power consumer in a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/power-noise.html |title=Faster, Quieter, Lower: Power Consumption and Noise Level of Contemporary Graphics Cards |publisher=X-bit labs |date=July 30, 2006 |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904054636/http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/power-noise.html |archivedate=September 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy-efficient [[video card|display]] options include:
* No video card - use a shared terminal, shared [[thin client]], or [[desktop sharing]] software if display required.
* Use motherboard video output - typically low 3D performance and low power.
* Select a GPU based on low idle power, average wattage, or [[performance per watt]].

====Display====
Unlike other display technologies, [[electronic paper]] does not use any power while displaying an image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Heikenfeld | title = A critical review of the present and future prospects for electronic paper | journal = J.

They also contain significant amounts of lead. [[LCD monitor]]s typically use a [[Cold cathode|cold-cathode fluorescent bulb]] to provide light for the display.

===Materials recycling===
{{Main article|Electronic waste | computer recycling | Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive}}

Recycling computing equipment can keep harmful materials such as lead, mercury, and hexavalent chromium out of [[landfill]]s, and can also replace equipment that otherwise would need to be manufactured, saving further energy and emissions. Computer systems that have outlived their particular function can be re-purposed, or donated to various charities and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth911.org/blog/2007/04/12/reuse-your-electronics-through-donation-to-schools-charities-and-nonprofit-organizations/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503011722/http://earth911.org/blog/2007/04/12/reuse-your-electronics-through-donation-to-schools-charities-and-nonprofit-organizations/ |archivedate=May 3, 2008 |title=Reuse your electronics through donation » Earth 911 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many charities have recently imposed minimum system requirements for donated equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=PC Magazine |volume=26 |issue=17 |date=September 4, 2007 |title=15 Ways to Reinvent Your PC |last=Delaney |first=John |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2170255,00.asp |access-date=August 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502215811/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2170255,00.asp |archive-date=May 2, 2008 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parts from outdated systems may be salvaged and recycled through certain retail outlets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.staples.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=96244&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1004542&amp;highlight= |title=Staples Launches Nationwide Computer and Office Technology Recycling Program |date=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |publisher=Staples, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth911.org/blog/2007/08/15/goodwill-teams-with-electronic-recyclers-to-recycle-ewaste/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725070137/http://earth911.org/blog/2007/08/15/goodwill-teams-with-electronic-recyclers-to-recycle-ewaste/ |archivedate=July 25, 2008 |title=Goodwill Teams with Electronic Recyclers to Recycle eWaste |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |publisher=Earth 911}}&lt;/ref&gt; and municipal or private recycling centers.

A drawback to many of these schemes is that computers gathered through recycling drives are often shipped to [[developing countries]] where environmental standards are less strict than in North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Green Tech: Reduce, Reuse, That's It |last=Segan |first=Sascha |journal=PC Magazine |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2183977,00.asp |volume=26 |issue=19 |page=56 |date=October 2, 2007 |accessdate=November 7, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025050427/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2183977,00.asp |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition]] estimates that 80% of the post-consumer e-waste collected for recycling is shipped abroad to countries such as [[China]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash |last=Royte |first=Elizabeth |pages=169–170 |year=2006 |publisher=Back Bay Books |isbn=0-316-73826-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the collection rate of e-waste is still very low, even in the most ecology-responsible countries like France. In this country, e-waste collection is still at a 14% annual rate between electronic equipment sold and e-waste collected for 2006 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/recyclage/deee-l-europe-revoit-ses-objectifs-a-la-hausse-3482 |title=e-waste take-back still very low |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011 |publisher=GreenIT.fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213031911/http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/recyclage/deee-l-europe-revoit-ses-objectifs-a-la-hausse-3482 |archive-date=February 13, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recycling of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, and credit card numbers, which can be recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if there is more than one, and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/articles/features/green-computing-and-privacy-issues.html |title=Green Computing and Privacy Issues |publisher=MySecureCyberspace |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028214220/http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/articles/features/green-computing-and-privacy-issues.html |archive-date=October 28, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud computing===
{{Main article| Cloud computing }}
Cloud computing addresses two major ICT challenges related to Green computing – energy usage and [[resource consumption]]. [[Virtualization]], [[Dynamic provisioning environment]], multi-tenancy, green data center approaches are enabling cloud computing to lower carbon emissions and energy usage up to a great extent. Large enterprises and small businesses can reduce their direct energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30% and 90% respectively by moving certain on-premises applications into the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-backed-research-suggests-big-energy-reductions-from-cloud/ |title= Microsoft-backed research suggests big energy reductions from cloud |publisher= ZDNet |date= November 4, 2010 |accessdate= September 3, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151208073045/http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-backed-research-suggests-big-energy-reductions-from-cloud/ |archive-date= December 8, 2015 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One common example includes [[Online shopping]] that helps people purchase products and services over the Internet without requiring them to drive and waste fuel to reach out to the physical shop, which, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emission related to travel.&lt;ref name="Google Scholar Citations"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=tWRIBtoAAAAJ&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=tWRIBtoAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC|title=Google Scholar Citations|website=scholar.google.com.pk|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge Computing===
{{Main article| Edge computing }}
New technologies such as [[Edge computing| Edge]] and [[Fog computing]] are a solution to reducing energy consumption. These technologies allow redistributing computation near the use, thus reducing energy costs in the network.&lt;ref&gt;Cuadrado-Cordero, Ismael, [http://www.theses.fr/2017REN1S003 “Microclouds: an approach for a network-aware energy-efficient decentralised cloud,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233846/http://www.theses.fr/2017REN1S003 |date=June 28, 2018 }} PhD thesis, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, having smaller data centers, the energy used in operations such as refrigerating and maintenance gets largely reduced. 

===Telecommuting===
{{Main article|Telecommuting}}
[[Teleconference|Teleconferencing]] and [[telepresence]] technologies are often implemented in green computing initiatives. The advantages are many; increased worker satisfaction, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related to travel, and increased profit margins as a result of lower overhead costs for office space, heat, lighting, etc.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/MISQE_SustainableIT_Intel_2012.pdf “Developing an Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel’s Journey,”] MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61–74, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The savings are significant; the average annual energy consumption for U.S. office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot, with heat, air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70% of all energy consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/sector-meeting/4bi_officebuilding.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306130237/http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/sector-meeting/4bi_officebuilding.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |format=PDF|title=EPA Office Building Energy Use Profile |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=March 17, 2008 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other related initiatives, such as [[Hoteling]], reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when they need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/what_is_green_it_data_centers.php|title=What Is Green IT?|access-date=March 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415091508/http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/what_is_green_it_data_centers.php|archive-date=April 15, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of jobs, such as sales, consulting, and field service, integrate well with this technique.

[[Voice over Internet Protocol|Voice over IP (VoIP)]] reduces the telephony wiring infrastructure by sharing the existing Ethernet copper. VoIP and phone extension mobility also made [[hot desking]] more practical.

===Telecommunication network devices energy indices===
The information and communication technologies (ICTs) energy consumption, in the USA and worldwide, has been estimated respectively at 9.4% and 5.3% of the total electricity produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/app/docs/itu-icts-for-e-environment.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507123122/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/app/docs/itu-icts-for-e-environment.pdf |archive-date=May 7, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy consumption of ICTs is today significant even when compared with other industries. Some study tried to identify the key energy indices that allow a relevant comparison between different devices (network elements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Virgilio |last1=Puglia |title=Energy indices for environmental sustainability |journal=International Journal of Technology Marketing |date=January 2013 |volume=8 |issue=1/2013 |url=http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/n2w5530544110065/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530121855/http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/n2w5530544110065/ |archivedate=May 30, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis was focused on how to optimise device and network consumption for carrier telecommunication by itself. The target was to  allow an immediate perception of the relationship between the network technology and the environmental effect. These studies are at the start and the gap to fill in this sector is still huge and further research will be necessary.

===Supercomputers===

The inaugural [[Green500]] list was announced on November 15, 2007 at SC|07. As a complement to the TOP500, the unveiling of the Green500 ushered in a new era where supercomputers can be compared by performance-per-watt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.green500.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826075608/http://www.green500.org/ |archive-date=August 26, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tsubame (supercomputer)|TSUBAME-KFC-GSIC Center]] by Tokyo Institute of Technology, Made in Japan was with a great advantage to the second, the Top 1 Supercomputer in the World with 4,503.17 MFLOPS/W and 27.78 Total Power (kW)++

Today a new supercomputer, [[L-CSC]] from the [[GSI Helmholtz Center]], Made in Germany emerged as the most energy-efficient (or greenest) supercomputer in the world. The L-CSC cluster was the first and only supercomputer on the list to surpass 5 gigaflops/watt (billions of operations per second per watt). L-CSC is a heterogeneous supercomputer that is powered by Dual Intel Xeon E5-260 and GPU accelerators, namely AMD FirePro™ S9150 GPUs. It marks the first time that a supercomputer using AMD GPUs has held the top spot. Each server has a memory of 256 gigabytes. Connected, the server via an Infiniband FDR network.

'''Homesteading''' is a lifestyle of [[self-sufficiency]]. It is characterized by [[subsistence agriculture]], home preservation of food, and may also involve the small scale production of textiles, clothing, and craftwork for household use or sale. Pursued in different ways around the world—and in different historical eras—homesteading is generally differentiated from rural village or [[commune]] living by isolation (either socially or physically) of the homestead.  Use of the term in the [[United States]] dates back to the [[Homestead Act]] (1862) and before. In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], particularly in nations formerly controlled by the [[British Empire]], a homestead is the household compound for a single extended family. In the UK, the term '[[Smallholding|smallholder]]' or '[[Crofters|crofts]]' is the rough equivalent of 'homesteader'.

Modern homesteaders often use [[renewable energy]] options including [[Solar power|solar electricity]] and [[wind power]]. Many also choose to plant and grow [[Heirloom plant|heirloom vegetables]] and to raise heritage livestock. Homesteading is not defined by where someone lives, such as the city or the country, but by the lifestyle choices they make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niemann|first1=Deborah|title=Homegrown and Handmade: A Practical Guide to More Self-Reliant Living|date=2011|publisher=New Society Publishers|isbn=978-0-86571-702-2|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As historical governmental policy==

{{further|Homestead Acts|Dominion Lands Act}}
Historically, homesteading has been used by governmental entities (engaged in national expansion) to help populate and make habitable what were previously little-desired areas; especially in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Guided by legal ''[[homestead principle]]s'', many of these "homestead acts" were instituted in the 19th and 20th centuries in order to drive the populating of specific, national areas; with most being discontinued after a set time-frame or goal were achieved.

Renewed interest in homesteading was brought about by U.S. President  [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s program of [[Subsistence Homesteads Division|Subsistence Homesteading]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==As a social movement==

The attractiveness of [[back-to-the-land]] movements dates from the Roman era, and has been noted in Asian poetry and philosophy tracts as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wholeearth.com/issue/1340/article/69/vital.cities.an.interview.with.jane.jacobs|title=Vital Cities: an interview with Jane Jacobs - Tools Ideas Environment - Whole Earth Catalog|website=www.wholeearth.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas of modern homesteading proponents, such as [[Ralph Borsodi]], gained in popularity in the 1960s in the United States. Self-sufficiency movements in the 1990s and 2000s began to apply the concept to urban and suburban settings, known as [[urban homesteading]]. According to author [[John Seymour (author)|John Seymour]], "urban homesteading" incorporates small-scale, [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[homemaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waldeneffect.org/blog/Why_homestead__63__/|title=Why homestead?|last=Anna|website=www.waldeneffect.org|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As economic choice==

In homesteading, social and government support systems are frequently eschewed in favor of [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]] and relative deprivation, in order to maximize independence and self-determination. The degree of independence occurs along a spectrum, with many homesteaders creating foodstuffs or crafts to appeal to high-end niche markets in order to meet financial needs. Other homesteaders come to the lifestyle following successful careers which provide the funding for land, [[housing]], [[taxes]], and specialized equipment such as [[Solar panel|solar panels]], [[Agricultural machinery|farm equipment]] and [[Electric generator|electricity generators]].

Modern government regulation—in the form of building codes, food safety codes, zoning regulations, minimum wage and social security for occasional labor, and town council restrictions on landscaping and animal keeping— can increase the marginal cost of home production of food in areas affected by these restrictions. Careful choice of homesteading location is essential for economic success.

Actual financial savings from adopting a homesteading lifestyle can be significant if planned and executed properly. Many homesteaders express deep satisfaction with their standard of living and feel that their lifestyle is healthier and more rewarding than more conventional patterns of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theelliotthomestead.com/2014/01/great-benefits-of-homesteading/|title=Great Benefits of Homesteading. - The Elliott Homestead|work=The Elliott Homestead|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.offthegridnews.com/how-to-2/3-priceless-benefits-of-modern-homesteading/|title=3 Priceless Benefits Of Modern Homesteading  {{!}} Off The Grid News|website=www.offthegridnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8296">[[Image:Hyperbolic coordinates.svg|thumb|400px|right|Hyperbolic coordinates plotted on the Euclidean plane: all points on the same blue ray share the same coordinate value ''u'', and all points on the same red hyperbola share the same coordinate value ''v''.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''hyperbolic coordinates''' are a method of locating points in quadrant I of the [[Cartesian plane]]

:&lt;math&gt;\{(x, y) \ :\  x &gt; 0,\ y &gt; 0\ \} = Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Hyperbolic coordinates take values in the [[hyperbolic plane]] defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;HP = \{(u, v) : u \in \mathbb{R}, v &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.

These coordinates in ''HP'' are useful for studying [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] comparisons of [[direct proportion]] in ''Q'' and measuring deviations from direct proportion.

For &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; take

:&lt;math&gt;u = \ln \sqrt{\frac{x}{y}} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{xy}&lt;/math&gt;.

The parameter ''u'' is the [[hyperbolic angle]] to (''x, y'') and ''v'' is the [[geometric mean]] of ''x'' and ''y''.

The inverse mapping is

:&lt;math&gt;x = v e^u ,\quad y = v e^{-u}&lt;/math&gt;.

The function &lt;math&gt;Q \rarr HP&lt;/math&gt; is a [[continuous mapping]], but not an [[analytic function]].

==Alternative quadrant metric==
Since ''HP'' carries the [[metric space]] structure of the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] of [[hyperbolic geometry]], the bijective correspondence 
&lt;math&gt;Q \leftrightarrow HP&lt;/math&gt; brings this structure to ''Q''. It can be grasped using the notion of [[hyperbolic motion]]s. Since [[geodesic]]s in ''HP'' are semicircles with centers on the boundary, the geodesics in ''Q'' are obtained from the correspondence and turn out to be [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|rays]] from the origin or [[petal]]-shaped [[curve]]s leaving and re-entering the origin. And the hyperbolic motion of ''HP'' given by a left-right shift corresponds to a [[squeeze mapping]] applied to ''Q''.

Since [[hyperbola]]s in ''Q'' correspond to lines parallel to the boundary of ''HP'', they are [[horocycle]]s in the metric geometry of ''Q''.

If one only considers the [[Euclidean topology]] of the plane and the topology inherited by ''Q'', then the lines bounding ''Q'' seem close to ''Q''. Insight from the metric space ''HP'' shows that the [[open set]] ''Q'' has only the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] as boundary when viewed through the correspondence. Indeed, consider rays from the origin in ''Q'', and their images, vertical rays from the boundary ''R'' of ''HP''. Any point in ''HP'' is an infinite distance from the point ''p'' at the foot of the perpendicular to ''R'', but a sequence of points on this perpendicular may tend in the direction of ''p''. The corresponding sequence in ''Q'' tends along a ray toward the origin. The old Euclidean boundary of ''Q'' is no longer relevant.

==Applications in physical science==
Fundamental physical variables are sometimes related by equations of the form ''k'' = ''x y''. For instance, ''V'' = ''I R'' ([[Ohm's law]]), ''P'' = ''V I'' ([[electrical power]]), ''P V'' = ''k T'' ([[ideal gas law]]), and ''f'' λ = ''v'' (relation of [[wavelength]], [[frequency]], and velocity in the wave medium). When the ''k'' is constant, the other variables lie on a hyperbola, which is a [[horocycle]] in the appropriate ''Q'' quadrant.

For example, in [[thermodynamics]] the [[isothermal process]] explicitly follows the hyperbolic path and [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] can be interpreted as a hyperbolic angle change. Similarly, a given mass ''M'' of gas with changing volume will have variable density &amp;delta; = ''M / V'', and the ideal gas law may be written ''P = k T'' &amp;delta; so that an [[isobaric process]] traces  a hyperbola in the quadrant of absolute temperature and gas density.

For hyperbolic coordinates in the [[theory of relativity]] see the [[#History|History]] section.

==Statistical applications==
*Comparative study of [[population density]] in the quadrant begins with selecting a reference nation, region, or [[urban density|urban]] area whose population and area are taken as  the point (1,1).
*Analysis of the [[legislator|elected representation]] of regions in a [[representative democracy]] begins with selection of a standard for comparison: a particular represented group, whose magnitude and slate magnitude (of representatives) stands at (1,1) in the quadrant.

==Economic applications==
There are many natural applications of hyperbolic coordinates in [[economics]]:
* Analysis of currency [[exchange rate]] fluctuation:
The unit currency sets &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;. The price currency corresponds to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. For

:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; y &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

we find &lt;math&gt;u &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, a positive hyperbolic angle. For a ''fluctuation'' take a new price

:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; z &lt; y&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the change in ''u'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta u = \ln \sqrt{\frac{y}{z}} &lt;/math&gt;.

Quantifying exchange rate fluctuation through hyperbolic angle provides an objective, symmetric, and consistent [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]. The quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta u&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the left-right shift in the hyperbolic motion view of the currency fluctuation.
* Analysis of inflation or deflation of prices of a [[basket of consumer goods]].
* Quantification of change in marketshare in [[duopoly]].
* Corporate [[stock split]]s versus stock buy-back.

==History==
The [[geometric mean]] is an ancient concept, but [[hyperbolic angle]] was developed in this configuration by [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent]]. He was attempting to perform [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]] with respect to the rectangular hyperbola ''y'' = 1/''x''. That challenge was a standing [[open problem]] since [[Archimedes]] performed the [[quadrature of the parabola]]. The curve passes through (1,1) where it is opposite the [[origin (mathematics)]] in a [[unit square]]. The other points on the curve can be viewed as [[rectangle]]s having the same [[area]] as this square. Such a rectangle may be obtained by applying a [[squeeze mapping]] to the square. Another way to view these mappings is via [[hyperbolic sector]]s. Starting from (1,1) the hyperbolic sector of unit area ends at (e, 1/e), where [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] is 2.71828…, according to the development of [[Leonhard Euler]] in ''[[Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite]]'' (1748).

Taking (e, 1/e) as the vertex of rectangle of unit area, and applying again the squeeze that made it from the unit square, yields &lt;math&gt;(e^2, \ e^{-2}).&lt;/math&gt; Generally n squeezes yields &lt;math&gt;(e^n, \ e^{-n}).&lt;/math&gt; [[A. A. de Sarasa]] noted a similar observation of G. de Saint Vincent, that as the abscissas increased in a [[geometric series]], the sum of the areas against the hyperbola increased in [[arithmetic series]], and this property corresponded to the '''logarithm''' already in use to reduce multiplications to additions. Euler’s work made the [[natural logarithm]] a standard mathematical tool, and elevated mathematics to the realm of [[transcendental function]]s. The hyperbolic coordinates are formed on the original picture of G. de Saint-Vincent, which provided the quadrature of the hyperbola, and transcended the limits of [[algebraic function]]s.

In [[special relativity]] the focus is on the 3-dimensional [[hypersurface]] in the future of spacetime where various velocities arrive after a given [[proper time]]. Scott Walter&lt;ref&gt;Walter (1999) page 6&lt;/ref&gt; explains that in November 1907 [[Hermann Minkowski]] alluded to a well-known three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry while speaking to the Göttingen Mathematical Society, but not to a four-dimensional one.&lt;ref&gt;Walter (1999) page 8&lt;/ref&gt;
In tribute to [[Wolfgang Rindler]], the author of a standard introductory university-level textbook on relativity, hyperbolic coordinates of spacetime are called [[Rindler coordinates]].

The '''illusory truth effect''' (also known as the '''validity effect''', '''truth effect''' or the '''reiteration effect''') is the tendency to believe information to be correct after repeated exposure.&lt;ref name="Science Blogs"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth Effect and Other Processing Fluency Miracles|url=http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2007/09/18/the-truth-effect-and-other-pro/|website=Science Blogs|publisher=Science Blogs|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon was first identified in a 1977 study at [[Villanova University]] and [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="Hasher1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PLOS ONE"&gt;{{cite journal|title=People with Easier to Pronounce Names Promote Truthiness of Claims|journal=PLOS ONE|date=September 6, 2014|url=http://www.oalib.com/references/8155256|accessdate=29 December 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0088671}}&lt;/ref&gt; When truth is assessed, people rely on whether the information is in line with their understanding or if it feels familiar. The first condition is logical as people compare new information with what they already know to be true. Repetition makes statements easier to process relative to new, unrepeated, statements, leading people to believe that the repeated conclusion is more truthful. The illusory truth effect has also been linked to "hindsight bias", in which the recollection of confidence is skewed after the truth has been received.

In a 2015 study, researchers discovered that familiarity can overpower rationality and that repetitively hearing that a certain fact is wrong can affect the hearer's beliefs.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; Researchers attributed the illusory truth effect's impact on participants who knew the correct answer to begin with, but were persuaded to believe otherwise through the repetition of a falsehood, to "[[processing fluency]]".

The illusory truth effect plays a significant role in such fields as [[election campaigns]], [[advertising]], [[news media]], and [[propaganda|political propaganda]].

==Initial study==

The effect was first named and defined following the results in a study from 1977 at [[Villanova University]] and [[Temple University]] where participants were asked to rate a series of trivia statements as true or false.&lt;ref name="Hasher1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hasher |first1=Lynn |last2=Goldstein |first2=David |last3=Toppino |first3=Thomas |title=Frequency and the conference of referential validity |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior |date=1977 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=107–112 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(77)80012-1 |url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/hasher/PDF/Frequency%20and%20the%20conference%20Hasher%20et%20al%201977.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515062305/http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/hasher/PDF/Frequency%20and%20the%20conference%20Hasher%20et%20al%201977.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox"/&gt; On three occasions, Lynn Hasher, David Goldstein, and Thomas Toppino presented the same group of college students with lists of sixty plausible statements, some of them true and some of them false. The second list was distributed two weeks after the first, and the third two weeks after that. Twenty statements appeared on all three lists; the other forty items on each list were unique to that list. Participants were asked how confident they were of the truth or falsity of the statements, which concerned matters about which they were unlikely to know anything. (For example, "The first air force base was launched in New Mexico." Or "[[Basketball]] became an Olympic discipline in 1925.") Specifically, the participants were asked to grade their belief in the truth of each statement on a scale of one to seven. While the participants' confidence in the truth of the non-repeated statements remained steady, their confidence in the truth of the repeated statements increased from the first to the second and second to third sessions, with an average score for those items rising from 4.2 to 4.6 to 4.7. The conclusion made by the researchers, who were from Villanova and Temple universities, was that repeating a statement makes it more likely to appear factual.&lt;ref name="Science Blogs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasher1977" /&gt;

In 1989, Hal R. Arkes, Catherine Hackett, and Larry Boehm replicated the original study, with similar results showing that exposure to false information changes the perceived truthfulness and plausibility of that information.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polage|first1=Danielle|title=Making up History: False Memories of Fake News Stories|journal=Europe's Journal of Psychology|date=May 31, 2012|volume=8|pages=245–250|doi=10.5964/ejop.v8i2.456|url=http://ejop.psychopen.eu/article/viewFile/456/pdf|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect works because when people assess truth, they rely on whether the information agrees with their understanding or whether it feels familiar. The first condition is logical as people compare new information with what they already know to be true and consider the credibility of both sources. However, researchers discovered that familiarity can overpower rationality—so much so that repetitively hearing that a certain fact is wrong can have a paradoxical effect.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

==Relation to other phenomena==
===Processing fluency===
At first, the truth effect was  believed to occur only when individuals are highly uncertain about a given statement.&lt;ref name="Science Blogs"/&gt; Psychologists also assumed that "outlandish" headlines wouldn't produce this effect however, recent research shows the illusory truth effect is indeed at play with false news.&lt;ref name="Vox"/&gt; This assumption was challenged by the results of a 2015 study by Lisa K. Fazio, Nadia M. Brasier, B. Keith Payne, and Elizabeth J. Marsh. Published in the ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology]]'', the study suggested that the truth effect can influence participants who actually knew the correct answer to begin with, but who were swayed to believe otherwise through the repetition of a falsehood. For example, when participants encountered on multiple occasions the statement "A sari is the name of the short plaid skirt worn by Scots," some of them were likely to come to believe it was true, even though these same people were able to correctly answer the question "What is the name of the short pleated skirt worn by Scots?"

After replicating these results in another experiment, Fazio and her team attributed this curious phenomenon to "[[processing fluency]]", a term that describes the facility with which people comprehend statements. "Repetition," explained the researcher, "makes statements easier to process (i.e. fluent) relative to new statements, leading people to the (sometimes) false conclusion that they are more truthful."&lt;ref name="Fazio2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fazio |first1=Lisa K. |last2=Brashier |first2=Nadia M. |last3=Payne |first3=B.

===Hindsight bias===
In a 1997 study, Ralph Hertwig, [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], and Ulrich Hoffrage linked the truth effect to the phenomenon known as "[[hindsight bias]]", described as a situation in which the recollection of confidence is skewed after the truth or falsity has been received. They have described the truth effect (which they call "the reiteration effect") as a subset of hindsight bias.&lt;ref name="Hertwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hertwig|first1=Ralph|last2=Gigerenzer|first2=Gerd|last3=Hoffrage|first3=Ulrich|title=The Reiteration Effect in Hindsight Bias|journal=Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition|date=1997|url=https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/volltexte/institut/dok/full/hertwig/hrreipr__/hrreipr__.html|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other studies==
In a 1979 study, participants were told that repeated statements were no more likely to be true than unrepeated ones. Despite this warning, the participants perceived repeated statements as being more true than unrepeated ones.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt;

Studies in 1981 and 1983 showed that information deriving from recent experience tends to be viewed as "more fluent and familiar" than new experience. A 2011 study by Jason D. Ozubko and Jonathan Fugelsang built on this finding by demonstrating that, generally speaking, information retrieved from memory is "more fluent or familiar than when it was first learned" and thus produces an illusion of truth. The effect grew even more pronounced when statements were repeated twice and yet more pronounced when they were repeated four times. The researchers thus concluded that memory retrieval is a powerful method for increasing the so-called validity of statements and that the illusion of truth is an effect that can be observed without directly polling the factual statements in question.&lt;ref name="University of Waterloo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ozubko|first1=JD|last2=Fugelsang|first2=J|title=Remembering makes evidence compelling: retrieval from memory can give rise to the illusion of truth.|journal=University of Waterloo|date=January 2011|doi=10.1037/a0021323|pmid=21058878|volume=37|pages=270–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 study by Ian Maynard Begg, Ann Anas, and Suzanne Farinacci suggested that a statement will seem true if the information seems familiar.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt;

A 2012 experiment by Danielle C. Polage showed that some participants exposed to false news stories would go on to have false memories. The conclusion was that repetitive false claims increase believability and may also result in errors.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox"/&gt;

In a 2014 study, Eryn J. Newman, Mevagh Sanson, Emily K. Miller, Adele Quigley-McBride, Jeffrey L. Foster, Daniel M. Bernstein, and [[Maryanne Garry]] asked participants to judge the truth of statements attributed to various people, some of whose names were easier to pronounce than others. Consistently, statements by persons with easily pronounced names were viewed as being more truthful than those with names that were harder to pronounce. The researchers' conclusion was that subjective, tangential properties can matter when people evaluate sourced information.&lt;ref name="PLOS ONE"/&gt;

==Examples==
Although the truth effect has been demonstrated scientifically only in recent years, it is a phenomenon with which people have been familiar for millennia. One study notes that the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] closed each of his speeches with a call to destroy [[Carthage]] ("''[[Carthago delenda est|Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam]]''"), knowing that the repetition would breed agreement, and that [[Napoleon]] reportedly "said that there is only one figure in rhetoric of serious importance, namely, repetition", whereby a repeated affirmation fixes itself in the mind "in such a way that it is accepted in the end as a demonstrated truth". Others who have taken advantage of the truth effect have included [[Quintilian]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Marcus Antonius]] in [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.&lt;ref name="Hertwig" /&gt;

The truth effect plays a significant role in various fields of activity. During [[election campaigns]], false information about a candidate, if repeated in [[TV commercials]], can cause the public to believe it. Similarly, advertising that repeats unfounded claims about a product may boost sales because some viewers may come to think that they heard the claims from an objective source.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt; The truth effect is also used in news media and is a staple of political propaganda.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dreyfuss|first1=Emily|title=Want to Make a Lie Seem True? Say It Again. And Again. And Again.|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/dont-believe-lies-just-people-repeat/|accessdate=31 October 2017|publisher=Wired|date=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Resnick|first1=Brian|title=Alex Jones and the illusory truth effect, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/6/17/15817056/alex-jones-megyn-kelly-lies-nbc-psychology-illusory-truth|website=Vox|publisher=Vox|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[kayaking]] expert has pointed out that it is an accepted fact that when kayaking on the ocean or the [[Great Lakes]], one should use a kayak at least 16 feet long.

'''Juror misconduct''' is when the law of the [[court]] is violated by a member of the [[jury]] while a [[court case]] is in progression or after it has reached a [[verdict]].&lt;ref name="USLegalDefinitions"&gt;"USLegal Definitions"&lt;/ref&gt;

Misconduct can take several forms:
* Communication by the jury with those outside of the trial/court case. Those on the outside include “[[witnesses]], [[Lawyer|attorneys]], [[bailiff]]s, or [[judge]]s about the case”.&lt;ref name="USLegalDefinitions" /&gt;
* When the jury member brings outside [[evidence]] that they may have found themselves into the trial which has not been allowed by the judges or lawyers and is used to create [[bias]] on the part of the juror. This new [[information]] may be used to [[Social influence|influence]] their final decision.&lt;ref name="USLegalDefinitions" /&gt;
* “Conducting experiments regarding theories of the case outside the court’s presence”.&lt;ref name="USLegalDefinitions" /&gt;

==Bias==
"An [[inclination]] of [[temperament]] or outlook; especially: a personal and sometimes unreasoned [[judgement]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bias Merriam-Webster. An Encyclopædia Britannica Company (2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example mentioned in Eltis's article "Courts, Litigants and the Digital Age. Law, Ethics and Practice" is a juror in Manchester who [[tweeted]] openly throughout a [[rape]] trial. She was found to be tweeting to her friends and asking them to poll whether they thought that the man being tried was guilty or not; whether he committed the rape or not.&lt;ref name="EltisKarenCourts_a"&gt;Eltis, Karen. "Courts, Litigants and the Digital Age. Law, Ethics and Practice". University of Ottawa. Columbia Law School. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the case of Wardlaw v. State where a member of the jury, against the direct instructions by the judge to not use the Internet, looked up the definition of the illness that the individual on trial was stated to be suffering. This jury member also looked up symptoms and whether lying was an effect of suffering with this [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name="Eltis"&gt;Eltis, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The juror did learn that lying was in fact a "symptom"; however, she chose to gather this information during the discussion to find a verdict.&lt;ref name="Eltis" /&gt;

==Social media==
Whether it is on a phone or using a computer, the [[Internet]] has become society’s source for everything. Regarding the place of [[social media]] within trials, the Internet has frequently been used by jury members to gain access to additional information about a certain [[mental illness]], or a broader definition or they are outsourcing trial information.&lt;ref name="EltisKarenCourts_a" /&gt; The legal system and both the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and both the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th amendment]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment&lt;/ref&gt; and 6th amendment &lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States are built around the fact that everyone is required to have a fair trial free from bias.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Information Institute(LII). "Fifth Amendment: An Overview". Cornell University Law School, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legal Information Institute(LII)."Sixth Amendment: Amendment VI. Cornell University Law School, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been multiple instances where certain cases required retrials because of bias on the part of one or more of the jury members. The Internet, while it is the primary source to find additional information and details about another individual, does not necessarily mean that the information it provides is necessarily correct or accurate. According to Bell’s article, ''Juror Misconduct and the Internet'', the use of the Internet within trials is not a new occurrence. It has been found in many cases, jurors who have searched for words unfamiliar to them, done extensive research, “engaged in at-home experiments, visited accident scenes, and otherwise obtained specialized knowledge.&lt;ref name="WilliamBell"&gt;William Bell, Daniel. "Juror Misconduct and the Internet". American Journal of Criminal Law, 2010, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of Internet information==
===Traditional sources===

These sources seem to revolve around cases which include members of the jury searching for additional information about a certain term or illness that is significant in the case at hand. Usually the main outlets are encyclopedic definitions or Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="WilliamBell" /&gt; The use of the Internet has also given jurors the ability to easily and readily access information that they may want to find out about. As stated in Bell's article, many jurors do not have the time during breaks to go out to a library and locate hard copy sources of information needed, thus making the Internet the primary source because all it requires is the simple push of a button.&lt;ref name="WilliamBell"/&gt;

===Novel sources===
This type of information includes access to different sources of information such as (1) “information about parties and witnesses” referring to information about a defendant’s past, background information on a specific employer or business, both publicized information and private information such as driving records, and tickets. All this information is easily accessible over the Internet and all this information was shared among jury members in specific cases. The main outlets usually include [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and online encyclopedias and dictionaries. This would overthrow the entire trial thus causing an automatic [[mistrial]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, pp. 84 &amp; 85&lt;/ref&gt; 2 “Scientific and Technical Information”.&lt;ref name=Bell85&gt;Bell 2010, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; This source of information refers to using the Internet to perform their own form of investigation on the side without actually having to go to the physical scene of the crime. This form of personal investigation may use [[Google Earth]] to acquire specific locations and specific fine points about a crime scene such as neighbourhoods, distances between certain homes and areas, etc.&lt;ref name=Bell85 /&gt;

Since the Internet is frequently used to taint certain verdicts, many judges have put bans and limitations on jury members and their use of the Internet.&lt;ref name=Bell86&gt;Bell 2010, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; When certain individuals are called to be on jury duty, they are told they are not allowed to communicate with other people who are not involved with the case, and they are told they are not allowed to use the Internet to research anything or to send out or receive any information that would compromise the integrity and fairness of the case at hand. This is definitely a challenge as the Internet is ever present in our society today.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Another major problem, aside from the fact that a large majority of people have access to the Internet, is that the information individuals find may not be the entire truth, or may not be 100% accurate. When outside information is brought into a trial, it causes difficulties in ensuring no [[bias]] and a fair trial. Having outside information that is also inaccurate adds more bias and more unfairness to a trial.&lt;ref name=Bell86 /&gt;

==Methods used to prevent bias==
===Separating jury members===

This method is rare as it normally only occurs during cases with a heavy [[media influence]] and because it involves the constant watch of the actions of jury members individually to ensure they do not use the Internet or ruin the verdict and trial in any manner. This method can become problematic because jury members are only watched during the time when they are ready to deliberate amongst each other to reach a decision.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Questionnaire===
This method is slightly more effective because not only will it minimize the amount of jurors to stand during trial, therefore eliminating potential bias and use of outside sources, but it would be useful because it “would also systematically exclude younger jurors and those who otherwise have basic experience using computers and the Internet…”.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, p.87&amp;88.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bell’s article, the main reason behind why outside research is often conducted is because of the desire to satisfy one's curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a jury member is discovered to have brought in outside information, and juror misconduct is clearly present, then the jury member in question may actually be fined by the judge.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be a deterrent to try and prevent future juror misconduct mishaps. It has been found to not be a successful deterrent because it solely shrinks the pool of individuals who wish to participate.&lt;ref name=Bell94&gt;Bell 2010, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A plausible way to prevent this misconduct from taking place is ensuring that the jury members, before the trial, understand completely “what constitutes research, their curiosity, and their perceived “moral duty” to render verdicts based on complete information”.&lt;ref name=Bell94 /&gt; Another successful deterrent is to show how using outside influence is negative, how the life of the individual on trial is in the hands of these chosen jury members (Bell, 94) and to take away their sources of internet, such as phones, before the actual trial commences.&lt;ref name=Bell97&gt;Bell 2010, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mistrials and alternatives==
[[Mistrials]] are the common response in cases where juror misconduct has occurred. Mistrials can be costly and thus will be avoided if possible. When mistrials are seen as a solution, they are compared to wasted assets “when it could have easily been avoided”.&lt;ref name=Bell97 /&gt; If the possibility presents itself, according to Eltis’s article, simply dismissing the misconduct as unacceptable would be less destructive than a mistrial.&lt;ref name="EltisKarenCourts"&gt;Eltis, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Dismissing this misconduct will be destructive since it would not cause the trial to be fair. Overall, it is felt that a mistrial is quite a harsh decision, especially since Internet use by a juror is considered “impossible to control”.&lt;ref name="EltisKarenCourts" /&gt;

== Punishment ==
Under the common law, jurors could be charged with contempt of court if they were found to have carried out independent research into the case they were trying. Proving that a juror was guilty of a contempt required proof that she had acted contrary to a judicial order (e.g. to refrain from carrying out research online). This created uncertainty and possible inconsistency, as judicial directions to jurors could vary. The Law Commission of England &amp; Wales felt it would be better to create a separate criminal offence, as this would make the law clearer for jurors. The Law Commission also felt that the creation of a new offence would give jurors suspected of misconduct greater due process protections, as contempt was tried according to summary court procedure, whereas the proposed offence would be an indictable offence, and therefore subject to the due process protections of a full jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contempt of Court (1): Juror Misconduct and Internet Publications|last=Law Commission|first=The|publisher=LAW COM No 340|year=2013|isbn=9780102987362|location=|pages=62–68|quote=|via=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/274266/0860.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 brought these proposals into law. As Crosby explains:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Act makes it an offence for jurors to ‘research the case during the trial period’, to ‘disclose [improper] information to another member of the jury during the trial period’, and to engage in ‘conduct from which it may reasonably be concluded that the [juror] intends to try the issue otherwise than on the basis of the evidence presented in the proceedings on the issue’. Those found guilty of one of the new offences will be liable to imprisonment for up to two years, and will be disqualified from further service for a decade. What distinguishes these new offences from the existing option of using contempt proceedings is the fact jurors would now be proceeded against on indictment: that they would be tried by their peers for alleged misconduct. This represents a significant change in juror management techniques, as it is probable that criminal trial jurors accused of misconduct have never been tried in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Kevin|year=2015|title=Juror Punishment, Juror Guidance and the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015|url=https://www.academia.edu/30572311/Juror_Punishment_Juror_Guidance_and_the_Criminal_Justice_and_Courts_Act_2015|journal=Criminal Law Review|volume=|pages=578–593|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Former jurors found guilty of one of the new offences will be disqualified from jury service for ten years, even if they have been fined rather than imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=s77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such disqualifications had previously required: a sentence of imprisonment; a community order; a community rehabilitation order; a community punishment order; a community punishment and rehabilitation order; a drug treatment and testing order; or a drug abstinence order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Juries Act 1974|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=Sch2, Pt2, para7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Act introduces for the first time the principle that a fine may also be sufficient for temporary juror disqualification.

In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, a '''lamination''' is a :
* "A [[topological space]] [[partition of a set|partitioned]] into subsets"&lt;ref&gt;{{springer|oldid=l120020|id=Lamination}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* decoration (a structure or property at a point) of a [[manifold]] in which some subset of the manifold is partitioned into sheets of some lower dimension, and the sheets are locally [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]]. 

A lamination of a surface is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of a closed subset of the surface into smooth curves.

It may or may not be possible to fill the gaps in a lamination to make a [[foliation]].&lt;ref name="ornl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ortep/topology/defs.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713073050/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ortep/topology/defs.txt |archivedate=2009-07-13 |df= }} Oak Ridge National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">The '''marginal product of capital (MP&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;)''' is the additional [[Output (economics)|output]] resulting, [[ceteris paribus]] &lt;sup&gt;("all things being equal")&lt;/sup&gt;, from the use of an additional unit of [[Capital (economics)|physical capital]]. It equals the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[incremental capital-output ratio]]. Mathematically, it is the [[partial derivative]] of the [[production function]] with respect to capital. If production output &lt;math&gt;Q = f(K,L)&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt;MP_K = \frac{\text{change in }Q}{\text{change in }K} = \frac{\partial f(K, L)}{\partial K}&lt;/math&gt;

One of the key assumptions in economics is [[diminishing returns]], that is the marginal product of capital is positive but decreasing in the level of capital stock, or mathematically

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial K} MP_K = \frac{\partial^2 f(K, L)}{\partial K^2} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a [[Perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] market, the marginal product of capital is equal to the rental rate of capital.

The '''McIntyre System''', or systems as there have been five of them, is a [[playoff]] system that gives an advantage to teams or competitors qualifying higher. The systems were developed by [[Kenneth McIntyre|Ken McIntyre]], an Australian lawyer, historian and English lecturer, for the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]] in 1931.

== In the VFL/AFL ==
The first McIntyre System, the [[#Page–McIntyre system|Page–McIntyre system]], also known as the McIntyre Final Four System, was adopted by the VFL in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/182547662/20683097 Finals System Successful: Originator Explains the Reasons, ''The Sporting Globe'', Saturday, 10 October 1931, p.2].&lt;/ref&gt; after using three systems since its foundation in 1897, the major system and predecessor to the Page–McIntyre system being the "[[Second amended Argus system|amended ''Argus'' system]]" that had operated from 1907 to 1923 and 1925 to 1930.

McIntyre also devised the McIntyre Final Five System for the VFL for 1972, the McIntyre Final Six System for 1991 (which was revised for 1992) and the [[McIntyre Final Eight System]] for the 1994 season.

The AFL and its fans grew dissatisfied with some of the outcomes the McIntyre Final Eight system might allow, and replaced it with [[AFL final eight system|another final eight system]] in 2000.

== Other competitions ==
McIntyre finals systems are used prominently throughout Australia. Most Australian rules football leagues, from professional down to suburban, use a McIntyre finals system. The [[National Rugby League|New South Wales Rugby League/National Rugby League]] has used the McIntyre Final Four and Final Five at different times throughout its history, and used the McIntyre Final Eight System from 1999 until 2011. The Page–McIntyre system is also used in the [[ANZ Championships]] (netball), the [[Australian Baseball League]] and [[Women's National Basketball League]]. It was also used in the [[A-League]] (soccer) before that competition expanded its finals series to a top-six format. It is also used in the [[Indian Premier League]] (cricket).

Under the name [[Page playoff system]], the McIntyre Final Four is commonly used in [[softball]] and [[curling]] events, especially in Canada. The system was also used in the [[Rugby League National Leagues|Rugby League National League Three]] in Great Britain for the 2004 season.

== The systems ==

|rowspan=2| 1||A||1st Semi Final&lt;ref name="semifinal"&gt;Note that the terms "1st Semi Final" and "2nd Semi Final" specifically relate to the elimination and non-elimination semi-finals respectively, and they retain these names regardless of the chronological order that the games are played in. Many leagues which later adopted the Page–McIntyre system use the terms "Major Semi-Final" and "Minor Semi-Final" to more descriptively differentiate between the two games.&lt;/ref&gt;||Rank 3||v||Rank 4

|-
|3||D||Grand Final||Winner B||v||Winner C
|}
The Page–McIntyre system feature four teams. In the first round of the Page–McIntyre system, the highest two ranked teams play each other, with the winner going straight through to the grand final and the loser going through to the preliminary final. The lowest two ranked teams play each other, and the winner advances to the preliminary final. The winner of preliminary final gets through to the grand final. In this system, the top two teams are able to lose a match and still qualify for the Grand Final, this is referred to as a 'double chance'.

Assuming that each team has an even chance of winning each match, the probability for both the highest ranked teams winning the competition is 37.5%, compared to 12.5% for the third and fourth placed teams.

As its name states, the McIntyre final five system features five teams. From the second round the McIntyre final five system is the same as the Page–McIntyre system, however, in the first round the lowest two ranked teams play to eliminate one team and the second and third ranked teams determine which match they will play in the second round. The highest ranked team has a bye in the first round.

In this case, if all teams have an even chance of winning each match, the highest ranked team has a 37.5% chance, ranks two and three have a 25% chance and the lowest two ranked teams have a 6.25% chance of winning the competition.

=== First McIntyre final six system ===

|}
The first McIntyre final six system was also the same as the Page–McIntyre system from the second round. In this case, two of the four lowest ranked teams are eliminated in the first round, while the top two determine which match they will play in the second round. Under this system the top two teams receive a double chance, as does the winner of match B.

=== Second McIntyre final six system ===
{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center"
|-
!Round!!Match!!Name!!Team 1!!!!Team 2
|-
| rowspan="3" |1||A||1st Elimination Final||Rank 4||v||Rank 5

|-
|3||F||Preliminary Final||Loser E||v||Winner D
|- bgcolor=#d0e6ff
|4||G||Grand Final||Winner E||v||Winner F
|}
This adaptation of the first McIntyre System corrected for the anomaly that, in the first week, the team who finished 4th would have a more difficult opponent than the team who finished 5th, and was hence more likely to be eliminated, despite finishing higher. This was achieved by adding flexibility to the second round draw, so that the two elimination final winners were re-ranked to determine which played the winner of the qualifying final and which played the loser.

However, both McIntyre final six systems had another weakness: the loser of the Qualifying Final (which is the most difficult game of the first round), ended up facing elimination in the First-Semi Final, while the higher-ranked Elimination Final winner (who has had the easiest game of the first round) has a double chance in the Second-Semi Final.

The McIntyre final eight bears little in common with the other McIntyre Systems. At no stage does it follow the Page–McIntyre structure, and at no stage after the first week does any team retain a double chance. The system allows for 26 of the 28 combinations of the eight finalists to feature in the Grand Final (the two combinations not possible are 1st v 7th and 2nd v 8th). It gives 18.75% to 1st and 2nd, 15.625% to 3rd, 12.5% to 4th and 5th, 9.375% to 6th and 6.25% to 7th and 8th.

'''Militarization of police''' refers to the use of [[military equipment]] and [[Military tactics|tactics]] by [[law enforcement officer]]s. This includes the use of [[armored personnel carrier]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, [[submachine gun]]s, [[flashbang grenade]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eliteukforces.info/special-air-service/weapons/stun-grenade.php |title=SAS - Weapons - Flash Bang &amp;#124; Stun Grenade (The British Army's SAS developed flashbang grenades) |publisher=Eliteukforces.info |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The flash from a flashbang grenade detonation momentarily activates all [[photoreceptor cell]]s in the [[human eye|eye]], making vision impossible for approximately five seconds, until the eye restores itself to its normal, unstimulated state. The loud blast is meant to cause temporary loss of hearing, and also disturbs the [[Perilymph|fluid in the ear]], causing loss of balance. The concussive blast of the detonation can still injure, and the heat created can ignite flammable materials.&lt;/ref&gt; [[grenade launcher]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Texas Rangers, Department of Public Safety, [http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/branch_davidian/indexfirst.htm Branch Davidian Evidence], Investigative Report No. 1, September 1999; Investigative Report No. 2, January 2000 (PDFs available at Texas Rangers website). The Rangers found that the FBI used grenade launchers to fire two 40 mm M651 grenades. The Army considers the M651 a pyrotechnic device and that it is known to cause fires. The Army Tech Manual for the M651 warns that it can penetrate 3/4" plywood at 200 meters and "projectile may explode upon target impact." During inventory of the Waco evidence the Texas Rangers also found flashbang grenades.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sniper rifle]]s, and [[Special Weapons and Tactics]] (SWAT) teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/militarization-of-police/| author=James Joyner| title=Militarization of Police| publisher=Outside the Beltway| date=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-and-the-shocking-nature-of-us-police-militarization| author=Paul D.

Observers have noted the militarizing of the policing of [[protest]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo21636470.html|title=Crisis and Control|website=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/10/senate-police-militarization.html|title=Congress scrutinizes police militarization before planned Ferguson protest|website=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, [[riot police]] have fired at protesters using guns with [[rubber bullet]]s or [[plastic bullet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plastic+bullet http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plastic+bullet] "A solid PVC cylinder, 10 cm long and 38 mm in diameter, fired by police or military forces to regain control in riots."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tear gas]], which was developed by the [[United States Army]] for [[riot control]] in 1919, was widely used against protesters in the 2000s. The use of tear gas in [[war]]fare is prohibited by various international treaties&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the [[Geneva Protocol]] of 1925: 'Prohibited the use of "asphyxiating gas, or any other kind of gas, liquids, substances or similar materials"'&lt;/ref&gt; that most states have signed; however, its law enforcement or [[military]] use for [[domestic policy|domestic]] or non-[[combat]] situations is permitted.

Concerns about the militarization of police have been raised by both ends of the political spectrum in the [[United States]], with both the right-of-center/libertarian [[Cato Institute]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] voicing criticisms of the practice. The [[Fraternal Order of Police]] has spoken out in favor of equipping law enforcement officers with military equipment, on the grounds that it increases the officers' safety and enables them to protect members of the public and other [[first responder]]s (e.g., [[firefighter]]s and [[emergency medical services]] personnel). However, a 2017 study showed that police forces which received military equipment were more likely to have violent encounters with the public, regardless of local crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/06/30/does-military-equipment-lead-police-officers-to-be-more-violent-we-did-the-research/| author=Ryan Welch and Jack Mewhirter| title=Does military equipment lead police officers to be more violent?

The [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests|G20 protests]] in Toronto in 2010 showed that the militarization of protest policing is not only occurring in the United States. Police in Toronto used a sound cannon, or [[Long Range Acoustic Device]] (LRAD) -- a [[weapon]] that was developed for use in conflicts in the Middle East, as well as barricades, pre-emptive arrests and riot units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/views-expressed/2014/09/canadian-police-agencies-innovators-militarization|title=Canadian police agencies: Innovators in militarization?|work=rabble.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kevin Walby, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the [[University of Winnipeg]], "the more interesting aspect of the militarization of the police is actually on the strategy side"; police are "increasingly training with military-style tacticians, especially when it comes to situations like [[crowd control]] and, increasingly, [[surveillance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/news/police-militarization-is-already-in-canada-as-surveillance-on-the-rise | author=Ashley Csanady| title=Police militarization is already in Canada as surveillance on the rise| publisher=Canada.com| date=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 "...Brazil saw countrywide demonstrations protesting a lack of basic services while the country was spending billions on the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The unprepared and overreacting police forces responded in a way that shocked the largely middle-class protesters. The police, using "non-lethal" weapons like pepper spray and rubber bullets while dressed from head to toe in ninja-like full battle gear, indiscriminately arrested both violent "[[black bloc]]" demonstrators, known for their confrontational tactics and anarchist views, along with non-violent protestors marching peacefully." As a result, "...calls for de-militarization of the police—from social movements, non-governmental organizations, and even segments of the police itself—became widespread and remain one of the legacies of the World Cup." The Brazilian "...Military Police today, while not officially a wing of the Armed Forces, remains an institution with a strict military hierarchy, training that retains a military ideology, and practices that frequently resemble occupying forces conquering enemy territories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wola.org/commentary/police_militarization_similarities_between_ferguson_and_brazil|title=Police Militarization: Similarities Between Ferguson and Brazil|publisher=wola.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The units that responded to the protests were Shock Police, units specialized in [[riot control]].

===History===

====19th Century====
Following the [[Reconstruction Era]] (1865–1877) in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the 1878 [[Posse Comitatus Act]], in response to the allegation of [[civil liberties]] abuse under [[military occupation]] of the former [[Confederacy (American Civil War)|Confederate States]] by members of the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] during Reconstruction. Still in force, the law prohibits the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]] (as amended in 1956) for being used as [[domestic policy|domestic]] [[law enforcement]] except when authorized by the [[President of the United States|President]] under certain circumstances; similar limitation also applies to the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy]] by [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] policy. The Act does not apply to the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and [[state defense force]]s while under the authority of their respective [[Governor (United States)|state governors]] nor the [[United States Coast Guard]], which is both an [[armed service]] and a [[maritime law enforcement]] agency and is not under authority of the [[United States Department of Defense]] (which was formed in 1947 out of the [[United States Department of War]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/docs/10-16/ch_12.asp|title=Domestic Operational Law: The Posse Comitatus Act and Homeland Security|website=army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=706794 THE POSSE COMITATUS ACT: A HINDRANCE TO NATIONAL SECURITY IN NEED OF A CHANGE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/04autumn/felicett.pdf|title=The Posse Comitatus Act: Liberation from the Lawyers|website=army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the law was passed, it allowed [[U.S. state|state]] and [[Local government in the United States|local authorities]] to regain control of their affairs, with their police departments typically equipped with [[handguns]], [[shotguns]], and [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], which were suitable for law enforcement purposes.

====20th Century====
[[File:Thompsonad1sm.jpg|thumb|upright|The "Anti-Bandit Gun": a 1920s advertisement of the [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson M1921]] for United States [[Police|law enforcement]] forces]]
Throughout the 20th century, the United States has faced large and heavily armed [[criminal organizations]], in which law enforcement officers were clearly outperformed. In the 1920s during the [[Prohibition Era]] and in the early 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], criminal syndicates and individual bank robbers such as [[John Dillinger]] and [[Bonnie and Clyde]] were frequently armed with [[Thompson submachine gun]]s and [[Browning Automatic Rifles]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray Bearse, "The Thompson Submachine Gun: Weapon of War and Peace", in Murtz, ''Gun Digest Treasury'' (DBI Books, 1994), p.210 {{ISBN|0873491564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), as well as police departments in cities such as [[Kansas City, Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article1337845.html|title=Police armored vehicles have long history|work=kansascity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenoshapolice.com/history-department|title=History of Department|work=Kenosha Police Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; began deploying automatic weapons, including the Thompson submachine gun, and armored cars in the 1920s and 1930s.
[[File:Firearms practice, 1936.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An FBI officer firing a [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] in 1936.]]

[[George Fletcher Chandler]], a veteran of the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] and the first Superintendent of the [[New York State Police]], was an early advocate of law enforcement officers wearing their weapons exposed on the outside of their uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Wilbur R.|title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412988766|page=1230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYME6Z35nyAC&amp;pg=PA1230&amp;dq=george+fletcher+chandler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiz_zxr6_TAhVD64MKHUkkChwQ6AEIVjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20fletcher%20chandler&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Social issues of the 1920s in the United States|the late 1920s through the early 1930s]], gunmen from criminal gangs in the United States began wearing [[bulletproof vest]]s made from thick layers of cotton padding and cloth. These early vests could absorb the impact of handgun rounds such as [[.22 Long Rifle]], [[.25 ACP]], [[.32 S&amp;W Long]], [[.32 S&amp;W]], [[.380 ACP]], [[.38 Special]] and [[.45 ACP]] traveling at speeds of up to {{convert|300|m/s|abbr=on}}. To overcome these vests, law enforcement agents such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] began using the newer and more powerful [[.38 Super]], and later the [[.357 Magnum]] cartridge.

Experts believes that police militarization was escalated in the 1950s and 1960s, an era in which [[race riot]]s were common in many U.S. cities. Some believe that the seeming success of officers armed with military-style weapons and deployed to curtail the 1965 [[Watts Riots]], a six-day race riot sparked by conflicts with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) that killed 34 people, gave way to the trend of arming and equipping law enforcement officers with battlefield weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/police-militarization-history-stretches-back-civil-rights-movement-photos-1926956|title=Police Militarization History Stretches Back To Civil Rights Movement [PHOTOS]|author=Aaron Morrison|date=May 18, 2015|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joy Rohde, a professor at the [[University of Michigan]]'s [[Ford School of Public Policy]], has published research indicating that "militarization is a mindset...is a tendency to see the world through the lens of national security, a tendency to exaggerate existing threats." Rohde traces "the origins of modern militarized policing" to the [[Cold War]]-era [[anti-communist]] paranoia, and the idea that domestic civil rights activists were similar to foreign enemies, as manifested in activities such as the CIA's [[Operation CHAOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-is-a-relic-of-cold-war-paranoia-2016-8| author=Joy Rohde| title=Police militarization is a relic of Cold War paranoia| publisher=Business Insider| date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Things have changed over the last 100 years and due to the rise of acts of terrorism and the easy access to high-powered weapons; special weapons and tactics teams have been implemented and are being utilized across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=J|date=2000|title=Training SWAT teams: Implications for improving tactical units.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235200000556|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|doi=10.1016/S0047-2352(00)00055-6|pmid=|access-date=|volume=28|pages=407–413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s to 1990s, encounters with the sophisticated weapons of narcotics trafficking groups such as the [[Medellín Cartel]] and street gangs such as the [[Gangster Disciples]], with organized, violent left-wing protesters at such events as the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]] and the 1999 [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Conference]] in [[Seattle]],&lt;ref name="ew1"&gt;{{Cite news|first = Kera|last = Abraham|title = Flames of Dissent|newspaper = Eugene Weekly|date = November 22, 2006|url = http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|accessdate = June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[urban riots]] such as the 1965 Watts riots in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[1967 Detroit Riot]] in [[Detroit]] led law enforcement to reconsider their standard [[side arm]]s.

The 1981 [[Military Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies Act]] allows the U.S. military to cooperate with domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies. Operations in support of law enforcement include assistance in counter-drug operations, assistance for civil disturbances, special security operations, [[counter-terrorism]], explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), and similar activities. Constitutional and statutory restrictions and corresponding directives and regulations limit the type of support provided in this area.

The 1997 [[North Hollywood shootout]] had a profound effect on law enforcement agencies. Local patrol officers at the time were typically armed with their standard issue [[9×19mm]] or [[.38 Special]] pistols, with some having a [[gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] shotgun available in their cars. The North Hollywood bank robbers carried fully automatic [[AK-47]]-style weapons with high capacity [[drum magazine]]s and ammunition capable of penetrating vehicles and police Kevlar vests. With these weapons, two bank robbers fired approximately 1,100 rounds at officers and civilians before being killed. The robbers wore [[ballistic vest|body armor]] which successfully protected them from bullets and shotgun pellets fired by the responding patrolmen. Police noted that the service pistols carried by the first responding officers had insufficient range and relatively poor accuracy, although a SWAT team eventually arrived with sufficient firepower.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The ineffectiveness of the standard police patrol pistols and shotguns in penetrating the robbers' body armor led to a trend in the United States toward arming selected police officers, not just SWAT teams, with heavier firepower such as semi-automatic [[5.56×45mm NATO]] [[AR-15]] type rifles.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} SWAT teams, whose close quarters battle weaponry usually consisted of [[submachine gun]]s that fired pistol cartridges such as the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]], began supplementing them with AR-15 type rifles and carbines.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====21st Century====
Under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], law enforcement officers must receive written permission from a court of law, or otherwise qualified [[magistrate]], to lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal activity. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the 2001 [[Patriot Act]] gave law enforcement officers permission to search a home or business without the owner's or the occupant's consent or knowledge, amongst other provisions, if terrorist activities were suspected. The Act was criticized for its perceived violation of civil liberties and has generated a great deal of controversy since its enactment. In ''[[United States v.

For a time, the Act allowed for agents to undertake "sneak and peek" searches.

On May 18, 2015, President [[Barack Obama]] announced limits on the types of military equipment which can be transferred to police departments and the implementation of training programs to assure the appropriate use of other items. The military can no longer transfer some weapons, such as grenade launchers, weaponized vehicles, and bayonets to police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-military-equipment-gravy-train-is-ending-for-local-police-departments| author=Colleen Curry| title=The Military Equipment Gravy Train Is Ending for Local Police Departments| publisher=Vice| date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama stated that "We've seen how militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like it's an [[military occupation|occupying force]] as opposed to a force that's part of the community that's protecting them and serving them,...So we're going to prohibit equipment made for the battlefield that is not appropriate for local police departments."&lt;ref name="politico.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/white-house-limiting-military-equipment-for-police-118041.html|title=Police union accuses White House of politicizing cop safety|work=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Obama's announcement, the United States' largest police union, the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], reacted negatively, pledging to push back against the new restrictions, and accusing the administration of politicizing officers' safety.&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt; The executive director of the FOP, James Pasco, stated that his group "...(would) be at (their) most aggressive in asserting the need for officer safety and officer rights in any police changes that are to be effected", and objected to a requirement that would require police departments to obtain permission from city governments to acquire certain equipment, including riot batons, helmets and shields, through federal programs.&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt; Pasco stated "We need to only look back to [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] (the location of the 2015 protests following the [[death of Freddie Gray]]) to see what happens when officers are sent out ill-equipped in a disturbance situation...[;] Because you don't like the optics (of militarization), you can't send police officers out to be hurt or killed."&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt;

In July 2016, the Obama Administration announced that it would revisit the 2015 ban on some types of military equipment for police forces, and begin a process of case-by-case review.&lt;ref name=td20160722&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160722/07570135041/administrations-one-year-experimentation-with-reining-police-militarization-apparently-over.shtml |title=Administration's One-Year Experimentation With Reining In Police Militarization Apparently Over |work=TechDirt |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent Americans have argued that police militarization is required to respond to an alleged "war on police" that exists in the U.S.: Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stated "There's A War On Cops", New York Police Chief Bratton warned of a "war on cops" and similar statements have been made by  [[Donald Trump]], [[Ted Cruz]], and [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/09/10/once-again-there-is-no-war-on-cops-and-those-who-claim-otherwise-are-playing-a-dangerous-game/ | title=Once again: There is no 'war on cops.'

====Ruby Ridge====
In 1992, there was a deadly confrontation and a 12-day [[siege]] at [[Ruby Ridge]] in [[northern Idaho]] between [[Randy Weaver]], his family and his friend Kevin Harris, and agents of the [[United States Marshals Service]] (USMS) and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). USMS and FBI agents were armed with M16s and sniper rifles, and they used an armored personnel carrier. It resulted in the deaths of two Weaver's son Sammy, his wife Vicki, and Deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan. At the subsequent federal criminal trial of Weaver and Harris, Weaver's attorney [[Gerry Spence]] made accusations of "criminal wrongdoing" against every agency involved in the incident: the FBI, USMS, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (BATFE), and the [[United States Attorney's Office]] (USAO) for Idaho. At the completion of the trial, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] formed a Ruby Ridge Task Force to investigate Spence's charges. The 1994 Task Force report was released in redacted form by Lexis Counsel Connect and raised questions about the conduct and policy of all the agencies. Public outcry over Ruby Ridge led to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information holding 14 days of hearings and issuing a report calling for reforms in [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement]] to prevent a repeat of Ruby Ridge and to restore public confidence in federal law enforcement.

====Branch Davidian siege====
In 1993, FBI and BATFE agents used armored vehicles and tanks and attack helicopters during the [[Waco siege|siege of the Branch Davidian community]] in [[Waco]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-really-happened-at-waco/| title=What Really Happened At Waco| publisher=60 Minutes/CBS News| date=January 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI's arms included [[.50 caliber]] (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) rifles and [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]]s, which are based on an [[M60 Patton|M60A1 Patton]] [[main battle tank]] chassis.&lt;ref name="PMania"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patton-mania.com/M60_Patton/m60_patton.html|title=Development and History of the M60 tank: M728 CEV|publisher=Patton Mania|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI also launched {{convert|40|mm|adj=on}} CS grenade fire from [[M79 grenade launcher]]s and fired two military M651 rounds at the Branch Davidian site. 40mm munitions recovered by the Texas Rangers at Waco included dozens of plastic Ferret Model SGA-400 Liquid CS rounds, two metal M651 military pyrotechnic tear gas rounds, two metal NICO Pyrotechnik Sound &amp; Flash grenades, and parachute illumination flares.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Rangers, Department of Public Safety, [http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/branch_davidian/indexfirst.htm Branch Davidian Evidence], Investigative Report No. 1, September 1999; Investigative Report No. 2, January 2000 (PDFs available at Texas Rangers website). The Army considers the M651 a pyrotechnic device and that it is known to cause fires.&lt;/ref&gt; The Army Tech Manual for the M651 warns that it can penetrate 3/4" plywood at 200 meters and the "projectile may explode upon target impact."

===Concerns and responses===
====Community policing====
The drift toward militarization concerns police officers and police policy analysts themselves. U.S. [[community policing]] grew out of the [[Peelian Principles]] of the [[London Metropolitan Police]] which emphasizes the relationship between the police and the community they serve.

In a 2013 piece in the newsletter of the DOJ's [[Office of Community Oriented Policing Services]] (COPS), COPS Senior Policy Analyst Karl Bickel warned that police militarization could seriously impair [[Community policing|community-oriented policing]]. Bickel wrote that accelerating militarization was likely to alienate police relationship with the community, and pointed to a variety of factors that contribute to militarization, including the growth of SWAT; the increase prevalence of dark-colored military-style battle dress uniforms for patrol officers (which research suggests has a psychological effect of increasing aggression in the wearer), and "warrior-like" stress training in policing training, which fosters an "us versus them" approach.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Bickel, [https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/12-2013/will_the_growing_militarization_of_our_police_doom_community_policing.asp Will the Growing Militarization of Our Police Doom Community Policing?], ''Community Policing Dispatch'', [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Community Oriented Policing Services]] (Vol. 6, Issue 12), December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of force====
A report by [[The Marshall Project]] looking at data from the early 2010s investigated the mindset of "guardian" versus "warrior" by calculating the rate of complaints for excessive use of force against police officers who had served in the military versus police officers in general.  It found higher rates for veterans in Boston (28% vs. 17%) and Miami (14% vs. 11%), but found no difference for [[Massachusetts State Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/03/30/when-warriors-put-on-the-badge |title=When Warriors Put On The Badge |date=3 March 2017 |publisher=[[The Marshall Project]] |authors=Simone Weichselbaum, Beth Schwartzapfel, Tom Meagher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A national survey in August 2016 by the [[Pew Research Center]] found police officers who had served in the military were more likely to have fired their weapon while doing police work (32% vs. 26%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=A closer look at police officers who have fired their weapon on duty | url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/08/a-closer-look-at-police-officers-who-have-fired-their-weapon-on-duty/ |authors=Rich Morin, Andrew Mercer |date=8 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Viewpoints====
The ACLU has stated that local police use these "wartime weapons in everyday policing, especially to fight the wasteful and failed drug war, which has unfairly targeted people of color."&lt;ref name="aclu.org"/&gt; Travis Irvine from ''The Huffington Post'' referred to how "local police forces now roll tank-like vehicles through our streets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/travis-irvine/a-new-christmas-truce_b_6370476.html|title=A New Christmas Truce|work=The Huffington Post|date=n.d.|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Pruett from ''The Huffington Post'' raised concerns about "Military [[Humvee]]s, still in camouflage and mounted with [[machine gun]]s, in the hands of municipal police [and] SWAT teams of police in full [[riot gear]], bristling with automatic weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-pruett/what-have-we-become_1_b_6308324.html|title=What Have We Become?|work=The Huffington Post|date=n.d.|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former "...Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper published an essay arguing that the current epidemic of [[police brutality]] is a reflection of the militarization...of our urban police forces, the result of years of the "war on drugs" and the "war on terror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1103039|title=Militarization Of Campus Police|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Rand Paul]] has proposed a demilitarization of U.S. police departments, stating that "The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slumz.boxden.com/f5/aug-20-database-shows-what-military-equipment-your-local-police-department-has-been-stockpiling-2111318/|title=Aug 20 - Database Shows What Military Equipment Your Local Police Department Has Been Stockpiling|publisher=boxden.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chuck Canterbury, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, argued that the equipment received from the federal government had been properly de-militarized, and that it was being used to protect civilians from [[violent crime]]. He further stated that the use of the equipment by law enforcement was necessary to protect civilians, since [[mass shootings]] have taken place across the United States, even in small towns. Responding to claims that law enforcement officers were being given tanks, Canterbury argued that the vehicles being used by law enforcement were not armed, and that they were being used across the United States to protect other officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=Becky|title=Fraternal Order of Police defends 'militarization'|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=370&amp;sid=31391932|website=KSL TV|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2015, a Department of Justice investigation into [[Police use of deadly force in the United States|use of deadly force]] by the [[Philadelphia Police Department]] in the period from 2007-2013 found that the way officers are trained may be a contributing factor to excessive use of deadly force. The report found that a) many officers have the mistaken assumption that being "in fear of their life" is justification for the use of deadly force, but fear should not be a factor - it's a reasonable belief that deadly force is necessary to avoid death or serious injury; b) instruction about policies on the use of force is confusing; c) most training scenarios end in some type of use of force and officers are rarely, if ever, trained how to resolve confrontations peacefully; d) 80% of suspects shot by police were black - black suspects were also more than twice as likely to be shot due to a "threat perception failure"; and e) no consistent procedure was in place for shooting investigations, no audio or video recordings of officer interviews were being made, and officers are often interviewed months after the incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fusion.net/story/108190/the-new-doj-report-on-philadelphia-police-shootings-is-mandatory-reading/| author=Daniel Rivero| title=The new DOJ report on Philadelphia police shootings is mandatory reading| publisher=Fusion| date=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/crime/article/Justice-Department-to-release-use-of-deadly-force-6152555.php|author1=SEAN CARLIN  |author2=MICHAEL R.

====Intelligence-gathering and surveillance====
In a January 2017 report [[Cato Institute]] criminal justice policy analyst Adam Bates argues that in the United States, "an increasingly militarized domestic police force" is characterized by "[[mission creep]] [that] has not been limited to weapons and tactics. What the War on Drugs has done for police militarization, the War on Terror is now doing for police intelligence gathering, and the privacy of millions of Americans is at risk."&lt;ref&gt;Adam Bates, Policy Analysis No. 809, [https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa-809-revised.pdf Stingray: A New Frontier in Police Surveillance], Cato Institute (January 25, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has raised concerns about military involvement in surveillance of peaceful protesters. The ACLU pointed, for example, to [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DOD) issuance of [[TALON (database)|Threat and Local Observation Notices]] (TALON) depicting [[Veterans for Peace]] and other anti-war groups as "terrorist threats." The ACLU also raised concerns about military involvement in "[[fusion center]]s."&lt;ref name="ACLUReport"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Spyfiles_2_0.pdf| title=POLICING FREE SPEECH: Police Surveillance and Obstruction of First Amendment-Protected Activity| publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|date=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil liberties====
The federal [[Posse Comitatus Act]] of 1878 forbids the U.S. military from conducting domestic law enforcement activities, embodying "the traditional American principle of separating civilian and military authority."&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;Matthew Carlton Hammond, [http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1576&amp;context=law_lawreview The Posse Comitatus Act: A Principle in Need of Renewal], ''Washington University Law Review'', Vol. 75, issue 2 (January 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; There have been exceptions made, however: in 1981, Congress enacted legislation allowing military involvement in drug interdiction at U.S. borders, and eight years later "designated the Department of Defense as the 'single lead agency' in drug interdiction efforts."&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt; In the late 1990s, following the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], there were proposals to further limit the act to allow military participation in law enforcement activities in chemical/biological weapon and terrorism cases.&lt;ref name="KopelOlson"&gt;David B. Kopel &amp; Joseph Olson, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=10476 Preventing a Reign of Terror: Civil Liberties Implications of Terrorism Legislation], 21 ''Oklahoma City University Law Review'' 247 (summer/fall 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; These anti-terrorism proposals were criticized by some commentators on the basis that they were a threat to civil liberties.&lt;ref name="KopelOlson"/&gt; Writers such as [[U.S. Air Force]] officer [[Charles J. Dunlap, Jr.]] critiqued proposals to use the military for internal security, on the basis that "No one should suffer the illusion that military forces could ever execute the laws with the same sensitivity to civil liberties as regular police forces." Dunlap argued that "the central imperatives of military service" was "destroying targets and undermining enemy command and control"&amp;mdash;a skill that did not necessary carry over into intelligence-gathering and investigation. Under this view, "a successful policization of the armed forces may well render it incapable of defeating authentic external military threats."&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Dunlap, Jr., [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6040&amp;context=faculty_scholarship The Police-ization of the Military], ''Journal of Political and Military Sociology'' Vol. 27 (Winter 1999), pp. 217-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accelerating militarization of regular law enforcement during the [[War on Drugs]] and post-[[September 11 attacks|September 11]] [[War on Terror]], however, prompted some commentators to express alarm at the blurring of the distinction between civil and military functions, and the potential to erode constraints on governmental power in times of perceived crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Abigail R. Hall &amp; Christoper J. Coyne, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2122384 The Militarization of U.S. Domestic Policing], ''Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy'', vol. 17, no. 4 (spring 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 paper published in the journal ''[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]'' examined "role convergence, that is, evidence that significant segments of police operations in the United States have taken on military characteristics; and evidence indicating that many U.S. military initiatives have taken on policing characteristics."&lt;ref name="CampbellCampbell"&gt;Donald J. Campbell &amp; Kathleen M. Campbell, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249775935_Soldiers_as_Police_Officers_Police_Officers_as_Soldiers_Role_Evolution_and_Revolution_in_the_United_States Soldiers as Police Officers/Police Officers as Soldiers: Role Evolution and Revolution in the United States], ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' 36(2), pp. 347-48 (January 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that "for individual citizens and for society as a whole, at least one aspect of role convergence—the militarization of the police—is potentially troublesome. If this convergence results in the police adopting not only military-type tactics and procedures but also military attitudes and orientations, the convergence may seriously threaten traditional civil rights and liberties."&lt;ref name="CampbellCampbell"/&gt;

A 2014 report by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], ''War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing'', concluded that "American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized...," citing an increase in the use in unnecessarily aggressive SWAT raids, "tactics designed for the battlefield"; and military equipment such as [[armored personnel carrier]]s, [[flashbang grenade]]s, and [[battering ram]]s, as well as a lack of transparency and oversight.&lt;ref name="WarComesHome"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf| title=War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union| date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as [[Ilya Shapiro]] have argued that military leads to "extreme constitutional violations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cato.org/blog/police-militarization-leads-extreme-constitutional-violations| author=Ilya Shapiro and Randal John Meyer| title=Police Militarization Leads to Extreme Constitutional Violations| publisher=Cato Institute| date=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SWAT teams and military-style raid tactics====
Peter Kraska, a criminal justice professor at [[Eastern Kentucky University]], found that the prevalence of SWAT teams, among police agencies serving populations of at least 50,000 people, doubled from the mid-1980s to the late-1990s, rising to 89% of police agencies by the end of this time period. Among smaller police agencies (covering areas  with between 25,000 and 50,000 people), the proportion with SWAT teams rose from 20% in the mid-198-s to 80% in the mid-2000s. Kraska states that: "When people refer to the militarization of police, it's not in a pejorative or judgmental sense.Contemporary police agencies have moved significantly along a continuum culturally, materially, operationally, while using a [[Navy SEALs]] model. All of those are clear indications that they're moving away from a civilian model of policing."&lt;ref name="Sanburn"&gt;Josh Sanburn, [http://time.com/2907307/aclu-swat-local-police/ This Is Why Your Local Police Department Might Have a Tank], ''Time'' (June 24, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 ACLU report, ''War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing'', concluded that "American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized..."&lt;ref name="WarComesHome"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf| title=War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union| date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report examined 818 uses of SWAT teams by more than 20 law enforcement agencies in 11 U.S. states from the period of July 2010 to October 2013.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"&gt;Ed Pilkington, [https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/24/military-us-police-swat-teams-raids-aclu US police departments are increasingly militarised, finds report], ''The Guardian'' (June 24, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Military-style tactics used by such teams include nighttime raids, use of [[battering ram]]s, use of [[flashbang]]s, overwhelming displays of force, and the wearing of helmets and masks.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21599349-americas-police-have-become-too-militarised-cops-or-soldiers Paramilitary police: Cops or soldiers?

The use of SWAT teams became especially common for [[Drug crime|drug]] searches. The ACLU study found that 62% of SWAT deployments were for drug raids, and that 79% involved raids on private homes; the study found that only "7% fell into those categories for which the technique was originally intended, such as hostage situations or barricades."&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt; In some cases, civilians, including infants, were killed or injured due to police use of force in military style raids.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt; In other cases, residents of affected neighborhoods reported experiencing psychological trauma as a result of militaristic law-enforcement tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Davis-Cohen, [https://www.thenation.com/article/footage-of-the-largest-gang-raid-in-nypd-history-reveals-the-agencys-military-style-tactics/ Footage of the Largest Gang Raid in NYPD History Reveals the Agency’s Military-Style Tactics], ''The Nation'' (September 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of force and military-style equipment during such raids prompted criticism,&lt;ref name="Sanburn"/&gt; particularly from [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarians]] such as [[Radley Balko]], who wrote on the topic in his book ''Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces''.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Ferrett, [http://www.wpr.org/police-use-military-style-tactics-can-be-recipe-trouble-journalist-says Police Use of Military-Style Tactics Can Be Recipe For Trouble, Journalist Says], Wisconsin Public Radio (August 1, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chicago Police Department]] (CPD) have been accused of operating a secret "[[black site]]" in Homan Square where suspects were held without being booked and registered and where they could not be found by their attorneys or families.

====Federal efforts to curb militarization====
From 1997 to 2016, the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) has gone to court to challenge policing practices in more than 24 cities in order to protect the civil rights of the public.&lt;ref name="Kaleem"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-baltimore-chicago-police-2016-story.html| author=Jaweed Kaleem| title=Under Obama, the Justice Department aggressively pursued police reforms.

==Types of teams and weapons==

===SWAT teams===
[[File:Falls SWAT team member.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A member of the Wichita Falls SWAT team conducts a rifle drill.]]
{{main|SWAT}}
[[SWAT]] (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams are law enforcement units in the United States that use specialized or military equipment and tactics. First created in the 1960s for [[riot control]] or violent confrontations with [[crime|criminals]], the number and usage of SWAT teams increased in the 1980s and 1990s during the [[War on Drugs]], and in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]]. In the United States today, SWAT teams are deployed 50,000-80,000 times every year, 80% of the time in order to serve search warrants, most often for narcotics. SWAT teams are increasingly equipped with military-type hardware and are trained to deploy against threats of [[terrorism]], for [[crowd control]], and in situations beyond the capabilities of ordinary law enforcement, sometimes deemed "high-risk." Other countries have developed their own [[paramilitary]] police units (PPU)s that are also described as or compared to SWAT police forces. SWAT units are often equipped with specialized firearms including [[submachine gun]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, [[breaching round|breaching shotguns]], [[sniper rifle]]s, [[riot control agent]]s, and stun grenades. They have specialized equipment including heavy body armor, ballistic shields, entry tools, armored vehicles, advanced night vision optics, and motion detectors for covertly determining the positions of hostages or hostage takers, inside enclosed structures.

The increased use of SWAT teams is a hallmark of increased police militarization. The Cato Institute's [[Radley Balko]] wrote that during the 1970s, there were about 300 SWAT raids a year and as of 2005 there were 40,000 a year. SWAT teams being used for gambling crackdowns and serving a search warrant are routine in some places, like Fairfax, VA.&lt;ref name = "Balko"&gt;{{cite web|last=Balko|first=Radley|title=Overkill: The Latest Trend in Policing|work=The Washington Post|date=February 5, 2006|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;"There has been a more than 1400% increase in the amount of SWAT deployments between 1980 and 2000, according to estimates...by [[Eastern Kentucky University]] professor Peter Kraska."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-military-restraints-violence-weaponry-missouri |title=Ferguson police: a stark illustration of newly militarised US law enforcement |last1=Swaine |first1=Jon|last2=Holpuch|first2=Amanda |date=August 14, 2014 |work=The Guardian |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balko states that in 2007, "...a Dallas SWAT team raided a Veterans [organization's]... charity poker games. In 2010, a team of heavily armed Orange County, Florida, sheriff's deputies raided several barbershops, holding barbers and customers at gunpoint while they turned the shops inside out. Of the 37 people arrested, 34 were taken in for "barbering without a license."&lt;ref&gt;[http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/catosletter-v11n4.pdf http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/catosletter-v11n4.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Orlando barbershop raids were subsequently challenged in court, and in 2014, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] ruled that it violated "[[Qualified immunity|clearly established]] Fourth Amendment rights" for the government to conduct "a run-of-the-mill administrative inspection as though it is a criminal raid."&lt;ref&gt;Radley Balko, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/09/19/federal-appeals-court-stop-using-swat-style-raids-for-regulatory-inspections/ Federal appeals court: Stop using SWAT-style raids for regulatory inspections], ''Washington Post'' (September 19, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU has stated that "... heavily armed SWAT teams are raiding people's homes in the middle of the night, often just to search for drugs", causing people to "needlessly di[e] during these raids," in which neighborhoods are turned into "warzones".&lt;ref name="aclu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing|title=War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Snipers===


[[Law enforcement agency|Law enforcement]] [[sniper]]s, commonly called police snipers, and military snipers differ in many ways, including their areas of operation and tactics. A police sharpshooter is part of a police operation and usually takes part in relatively short missions. [[Police]] forces typically deploy such sharpshooters in [[hostage]] scenarios. This differs from a military sniper, who operates as part of a larger army, engaged in warfare. Sometimes as part of a SWAT team, police snipers are deployed alongside negotiators and an assault team trained for [[Close combat|close quarters combat]]. As policemen, they are trained to shoot only as a last resort, when there is a direct threat to life; the police sharpshooter has a well-known rule: "Be prepared to take a life to save a life."&lt;ref name="cbssniper"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/25/60II/main267184.shtml |title=The Sniper, SWAT Teams Grow In Number |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=May 4, 2008| date=January 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police snipers typically operate at much shorter ranges than military snipers, generally under {{convert|100|m|yd|0|sp=us}} and sometimes even less than {{convert|50|m|yd|0|sp=us}}. Both types of snipers do make difficult shots under pressure, and often perform one-shot kills.

Police units that are unequipped for tactical operations may rely on a specialized SWAT team, which may have a dedicated sniper. Police snipers placed in vantage points, such as high buildings, can provide security for events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/photos/2007/09/06/2025679.htm |title=Police sniper watches from roof, Sydney |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=May 4, 2008 |date= September 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one high-profile incident, Mike Plumb, a SWAT sniper in [[Columbus, Ohio Division of Police|Columbus, Ohio]], prevented a suicide by shooting a revolver out of the individual's hand, leaving him unharmed.&lt;ref name="nasta"&gt;{{cite web|ref = harv|year = 2010|url = http://www.nasta.ws/New_Folder/Tactical%20Edge%20Article.doc|title = The Columbus Ohio Police|publisher = The Columbus Ohio Police|accessdate = May 7, 2010|last = Scanlon|first = James J.|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031206083809/http://www.nasta.ws/New_Folder/Tactical%20Edge%20Article.doc|archivedate = December 6, 2003|df = }} - [https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/cold_blooded/badass-sniper-cleanly-shoots-the-gun-out-of-a-crazy-mans-hand-291329.php?autoplay=true News footage of sniper shooting gun out of a persons hand]&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for specialized training for police sharpshooters was made apparent in 1972 during the [[Munich massacre]] when the German police could not deploy specialized personnel or equipment during the standoff at the airport in the closing phase of the crisis, and consequently all of the [[Israel]]i hostages were killed. While the German army did have snipers in 1972, the use of snipers of the German army in the scenario was impossible due to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]'s explicit prohibition of the use of the military in domestic matters. This lack of police trained snipers was later addressed with the founding of the specialized police counter-terrorist unit [[GSG 9]], which subsequently became a widely copied model for a police special forces unit.

In September 2015, a San Bernardino Sheriff's Department sniper shot a suspect in a fast-moving car from a helicopter. The suspect leapt from his car and died on the side of the road, but his vehicle continued forward, striking another vehicle and critically injuring three civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/09/18/suspect-injured-in-deputy-involved-shooting-along-215-freeway/| title=Suspect Dies After Deputy Opens Fire From Helicopter Along 215 Freeway| publisher=CBS Los Angeles| date=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest policing===
[[Image:Mótmæli vörubílstjóra 1.jpg|thumb|Rank of [[Icelandic National Police]] officers in full riot gear during the [[2008 Icelandic lorry driver protests]]]]
Observers have noted the militarizing of the policing of [[protest]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; [[Riot police]] are [[police]] who are organized, deployed, trained or equipped to confront [[crowd]]s, [[protests]] or [[riot]]s. Riot police may be regular police who act in the role of riot police in particular situations or they may be separate units organized within or in parallel to regular police forces. Riot police are used in a variety of different situations and for a variety of different purposes. They may be employed to [[riot control|control riots]] as their name suggests, to disperse or [[crowd control|control crowds]], to maintain [[public order]] or discourage [[criminal]]ity, or to protect people or property. In some cases, riot police may function as a tool of [[political repression]] by violently breaking up protests and suppressing [[dissent]] or [[civil disobedience]].
[[File:WTO protests in Seattle November 30 1999.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A riot policeman sprays [[pepper spray]] at seated protesters during the [[Battle for Seattle|WTO protests in Seattle in 1999.]]]]
Riot police often use special equipment termed [[riot gear]] to help protect themselves and attack protesters or rioters. Riot gear typically includes [[personal armor]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], [[riot shields]] and [[riot helmet]]s. Many riot police teams also deploy specialized [[less-than-lethal]] weapons, such as [[pepper spray]], [[tear gas]], rifles that fire [[rubber bullets]] or [[plastic bullet]]s, [[flashbang grenade]]s, and [[Long Range Acoustic Device]]s (sound cannons).

The police tactics used during the 2001 [[Quebec City protest]] serve as an example of the approaches used by North American riot police. During the protest, riot police fired [[tear gas]] canisters, [[water cannon]], and [[rubber bullets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|authorlink=David Graeber|title=Direct Action: An Ethnography|publisher=[[AK Press]]|year=2009|page=185|ISBN=978-190485979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; dispersing large groupings of protesters both violent and peaceful, including teach-ins and teams of medics providing first aid to other protesters.

Some U.S. SWAT teams have adopted the [[AR-15]] carbine. Some U.S. police departments are using the [[M4 carbine]], which will replace the M16 as the main U.S. Army combat [[assault rifle]]. "After the [[North Hollywood shootout]] in 1997, the Department of Defense gave 600 surplus [[M16 rifle|M16]] [[assault rifle]]s to LAPD, which were issued to each patrol sergeant. Various U.S. SWAT teams are armed with the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]], a [[submachine gun]].

U.S. law enforcement agencies such as the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD), and the [[Pittsburgh Bureau of Police]] (PBP) use the [[Barrett M82]]. Police use the M82 to breach barriers, because the large-calibre [[.50 BMG]] round it fires will penetrate most commercial brick walls and [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete blocks]]. It is an [[anti-materiel rifle]] designated as a Special Application Sniper Rifle and designed for use against military equipment (materiel), rather than against other [[combatant]]s ("[[Anti-personnel weapon|anti-personnel]]"). It is used by many armies around the world both in regular forces and in special forces units. As it uses a .50 BMG round, this has led to some debates in the U.S. armed forces about the legality of using such a large anti-materiel rifle round against a human. There have been persistent reports that some U.S. military personnel believe that the use of .50 BMG in a direct antipersonnel role is prohibited by the [[Laww of war|laws of war]]. However, Maj. Hays Parks states that "No treaty language exists (either generally or specifically) to support a limitation on [the use of .50 BMG] against personnel, and its widespread, longstanding use in this role suggests that such antipersonnel employment is the customary practice of nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/killing-myth |title=Killing A Myth |last1=Parks |first1=Maj W.

In October 2011, a Downey, California police officer shot an unarmed suspect named Michael Nida, who had been mistaken for an armed robber, in the back with a submachine gun, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff writers|title=No charges against Downey officer who shot unarmed man, D.A. says|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/10/michael-nida-shooting-downey-officer-no-charges.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 24, 2012|access-date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2006 and 2014, almost 5,000 [[M16 rifles]] were distributed to local and state law enforcement agencies in Ohio under the surplus military equipment program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2014/08/defense_departments_gives_ohio.html| author=Rich Exner| title=Defense Department issues Ohio police 5,000 M16 rifles, other supplies under surplus program| publisher=Cleveland.com| date=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The 2015 video game ''[[Battlefield Hardline]]'' depicts a militarized police, and it depicts both police and criminals wielding military equipment including rifles, machine guns and grenade launchers. The developer's insistence on "fantasy" while meticulously recreating LA areas and loosely basing crimes in the game on real-life crimes has subsequently been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/03/battlefield-hardline-reviewcop-out.html|title=Battlefield Hardline Review: Cop Out|work=Paste}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/soldier-cops-are-giving-games-like-battlefield-an-image-1620511782|title=Soldier Cops Aren't So Fun Now, Video Games|author=Luke Plunkett|work=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tmi.kotaku.com/why-2014s-battlefield-is-just-avoiding-uncomfortable-to-1593412680|title=Why 2014's Battlefield Is 'Just Avoiding' Uncomfortable Topics|author=Nathan Grayson|work=TMI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''Do Not Resist'' by Craig Atkinson is also critical of the phenomenon of police militarization, as exemplified by law enforcement training courses taught by retired military officer [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]], who tells police officers, "You are men and women of violence." The film won the award for "Best Documentary Feature" at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/30/do-not-resist-film-documentary-us-police-militarization| author=Stuart Miller| title=Do Not Resist: new film shows how US police have become an occupying army| publisher=The Guardian| date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/09/30/do-not-resist-a-chilling-look-at-the-normalization-of-warrior-cops/| author=Radley Balko| title='Do Not Resist': A chilling look at the normalization of warrior cops| publisher=The Washington Post| date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==

Music, When Soft Voices Die

Music, when soft voices die,&lt;br /&gt;
Vibrates in the memory;&lt;br /&gt;
Odours, when sweet violets sicken,&lt;br /&gt;
Live within the sense they quicken.

Rose leaves, when the rose is dead,&lt;br /&gt;
Are heap'd for the belovèd's bed;&lt;br /&gt;
And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,&lt;br /&gt;
Love itself shall slumber on.

==Summary==

The poem was published as "To---" in 1824 under Miscellaneous Poems in two stanzas of four couplets each containing four lines in ''Posthumous Poems''.

The theme of the poem is the endurance of the memories of events and of sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Havens, Raymond D. "Structure and Prosodic Pattern in Shelley's Lyrics". ''PMLA'', Vol. 65, No. 6 (December 1950), pp. 1076–1087.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Shelley edited the poems and wrote the preface to the collection. She described the poems: "Many of the Miscellaneous Poems, written on the spur of the occasion, and never retouched, I found among his manuscript books, and have carefully copied: I have subjoined, whenever I have been able, the date of their composition."&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Percy Bysshe. ''Posthumous Poems.'' London: Hunt, 1824.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Irving. "Shelley's 'Music, When Soft Voices Die': Text and Meaning." ''The Journal of English and Germanic Philology'', Vol. 59, No. 3 (July 1960), pp. 430–438.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unterecker, John. "Shelley's 'To ---(Music, When Soft Voices Die')."

''The Journal of English and Germanic Philology'', Vol. 60, No. 2 (April 1961), pp. 296–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical compositions==

Many composers and musicians have set the poem to music with vocal accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=14938 |title=Vocal settings of "Music, when soft voices die" |publisher=The LiederNet Archive |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the composers are [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]] as a three-part song in 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtgiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1060&amp;lpg=PA1060&amp;dq=music+when+soft+voices+die+charles+wood+1914&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_Nd-dcw1Nr&amp;sig=xJ-pM5elz9cARNGG9oIQaQxrFEM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u-wqT7PtDMiIsQLVzviSDg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=music%20when%20soft%20voices%20die%20charles%20wood%201914&amp;f=false |title=Catalog of Copyright Entires, U.S. Library of Congress |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Bridge]], for mixed chorus a capella, in 1904, [[Eric Nelson (musician)|Eric Nelson]] in 1999, Canadian composer Stephen Chatman, as a part of his set "There Is Sweet Music Here," in 1993, Sir Charles [[Hubert Parry]] in 1897, Three Songs, Opus 12, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rvwsociety.com/workschoral.html |title=Ralph Vaughan Williams Society |publisher=Rvwsociety.com |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415051430/http://www.rvwsociety.com/workschoral.html |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergei Taneyev]], Opus 17, No. 3, ''Pust' otsvuchit'', in 1905, [[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]] for mixed chorus in 1907, [[Peter Warlock]] in 1911 (two versions), [[Liza Lehmann]] for voice and piano, [[Henry Cowell]] in 1922, [[Jack Gibbons]], Opus 17, [[Samuel Barber]], for piano and voice in 1926, [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]], [[Quincy Porter]] in 1947, [[Roger Quilter]], for voice and piano, Opus 25, No. 5, in 1927, [[John Harbison]] for SATB choir and organ or harpsichord in 1966, Julie Knowles for SSA chorus and piano in 1982, Victor C.

'''Partner-optimized inventory management''', also known as '''partnerized inventory management''' or sometimes just the abbreviation '''PIM''' is an [[inventory]] management technique or model often used in [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] inventory systems in which a significant portion of the total inventory regularly becomes [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] in nature, due to slowing and/or low demand such as is typical in heavy machinery and construction equipment where the products themselves are extremely durable and have long lives in the field. Inventory in these cases needs to be maintained for an extended time to allow for repairs and product support perhaps as much as two or more decades after a manufacturer has ceased production.

Traditional inventory management techniques break down in cases where a manufacturer maintains inventory to supply future maintenance of their in-service equipment. As demand for [[finished goods|goods]] approaches zero, liquidation of inventory is indicated in most [[revenue management]] models.&lt;ref name="SAXENA2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. S. SAXENA|title=INVENTORY MANAGEMENT: Controlling in a Fluctuating Demand Environment|date=1 December 2009|publisher=Global India Publications|isbn=978-93-8022-821-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero inventory to service products in the field, however, fails the organization in other business areas. Possible costs to manufacture replacement inventory and the harder-to-calculate costs of [[Customer experience|customer confidence]] erosion can be greater over time than the immediate financial concerns that are remedied by liquidating inventory entirely by [[scrap]]ping or discarding it as [[waste]].&lt;ref&gt;“Are Your Inventory Management Practices Outdated,” AberdeenGroup, 1 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

While scrapping returns inventory to a state of raw materials, Partner-Optimized Inventory Management (PIM) returns inventory to the market as [[intermediate good]]s to be used in production of other goods or non-capital [[spare part]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PIM: A Dynamic Model for Inventory Management|year=2012|publisher=Lippert Enterprises|location=Ashland, Ohio|url=http://lippertent.com/free-whitepaper.html|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organization that uses the PIM model mitigates the immediate [[Pinch point (economics)|pinch point]] caused by inventory reduction by retaining as-needed mutual access to inventory through the marketplace for an indeterminate time rather than losing access immediately and irrevocably through scrapping or discarding the inventory as waste.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">'''Pattern-oriented modeling''' ('''POM''') is an approach to bottom-up [[complex systems]] [[Systems analysis|analysis]] that was developed to [[Systems modeling|model]] complex ecological and [[agent-based model|agent-based]] systems. A goal of POM is to make ecological modeling more rigorous and comprehensive.&lt;ref name="IndividualBasedModelingAndEcology"&gt;Grimm, V.; Railsback  S.F. (2005), ''Individual-based Modeling and Ecology'', [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional ecosystem model attempts to approximate the real system as closely as possible. POM proponents posit that an ecosystem is so information-rich that an ecosystem model will inevitably either leave out relevant information or become over-parameterized and lose predictive power.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingOfAgentBasedComplexSystems"&gt;Grimm, V.; Revilla, E.; Berger, U.; Jeltsch, F.; Mooij, W.M.; Railsback, S.F.; Thulke, H.H.; Weiner, J. Wiegand, T.; DeAngelis D.L. (2005), "Pattern-oriented modeling of agent-based complex systems: lessons from ecology", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 310: 987-991&lt;/ref&gt; Through a focus on only the relevant patterns in the real system, POM offers a meaningful alternative to the traditional approach. 

An attempt to mimic the [[scientific method]], POM requires the researcher to begin with a pattern found in the real system, posit hypotheses to explain the pattern, and then develop predictions that can be tested. A model used to determine the original pattern may not be used to test the researcher’s predictions.  Through this focus on the pattern, the model can be constructed to include only information relevant to the question at hand.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingInpopulationEcology"&gt;Grimm, V.; Frank, K.; Jeltsch, F.; Brandl, R.; Uchmariski, J.; Wissel C. (1996), "Pattern-oriented modeling in population ecology", ''The Science of the Total Environment'', 183: 151-166.&lt;/ref&gt;

POM is also characterized by an effort to identify the appropriate [[Temporal scales|temporal]] and [[Spatial scales|spatial scale]] at which to study a pattern, and to avoid the assumption that a single process might explain a pattern at multiple temporal or spatial scales. It does, however, offer the opportunity to look explicitly at how processes at multiple scales might be driving a particular pattern.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingOfAgentBasedComplexSystems" /&gt;

A look at the trade-offs between model complexity and payoff can be considered in the framework of the [[Medawar zone]]. The model is considered too simple if it addresses a single problem (e.g., the explanation behind a single pattern), whereas it will be considered too complex if it incorporates all the available biological data. The Medawar zone, where the payoff in what is learned is greatest, is at an intermediate level of model complexity.

==Usage==
Pattern-oriented modeling has been used to test [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]] hypotheses on how herdsman decide which farmers to contract with when grazing their cattle. Herdsman behavior followed the pattern predicted by a 'friend' rather than 'cost' priority hypothesis.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingOfAgentBasedComplexSystems" /&gt;

[[File:Phase change - en.svg|thumb|right|340px|This diagram shows the nomenclature for the different phase transitions.]]

The term '''phase transition''' (or '''phase change''') is most commonly used to describe transitions between [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]]eous [[states of matter]], as well as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] in rare cases. A phase of a thermodynamic system and the states of matter have uniform [[physical property|physical properties]]. During a phase transition of a given medium, certain properties of the medium change, often discontinuously, as a result of the change of some external condition, such as [[temperature]], [[pressure]], or others. For example, a liquid may become gas upon heating to the [[boiling point]], resulting in an abrupt change in volume. The measurement of the external conditions at which the transformation occurs is termed the phase transition. Phase transitions commonly occur in nature and are used today in many technologies.

==Types of phase transition==
Examples of phase transitions include:
*The transitions between the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of a single component, due to the effects of temperature and/or [[pressure]]:

* A [[eutectic]] transformation, in which a two component single phase liquid is cooled and transforms into two solid phases. The same process, but beginning with a solid instead of a liquid is called a [[eutectoid]] transformation.
* A [[peritectic]] transformation, in which a two component single phase solid is heated and transforms into a solid phase and a liquid phase.
* A [[spinodal decomposition]], in which a single phase is cooled and separates into two different compositions of that same phase.
* Transition to a [[mesophase]] between solid and liquid, such as one of the "[[liquid crystal]]" phases.
* The transition between the [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] and [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] phases of [[magnet]]ic materials at the [[Curie point]].
* The transition between differently ordered, [[ANNNI model|commensurate]] or [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurate]], magnetic structures, such as in cerium [[antimonide]].
* The [[martensitic transformation]] which occurs as one of the many phase transformations in carbon steel and stands as a model for [[displacive phase transformations]].
* Changes in the [[crystallographic]] structure such as between [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] and [[austenite]] of iron.
* Order-disorder transitions such as in alpha-[[titanium aluminide]]s.
* The dependence of the [[adsorption]] geometry on coverage and temperature, such as for [[hydrogen]] on iron (110).
* The emergence of [[superconductivity]] in certain metals and ceramics when cooled below a critical temperature.
* The transition between different molecular structures ([[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], [[allotropy|allotropes]] or [[polyamorphism|polyamorphs]]), especially of solids, such as between an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] structure and a [[crystal]] structure, between two different crystal structures, or between two amorphous structures.
* Quantum condensation of [[boson]]ic fluids ([[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein condensation]]). The [[superfluidity|superfluid]] transition in liquid [[helium]] is an example of this.
* The [[Symmetry breaking|breaking of symmetries]] in the laws of physics during the early history of the universe as its temperature cooled.
* [[Isotope fractionation]] occurs during a phase transition, the ratio of light to heavy isotopes in the involved molecules changes. When [[water vapor]] condenses (an [[equilibrium fractionation]]), the heavier water isotopes (18O and 2H) become enriched in the liquid phase while the lighter isotopes (16O and 1H) tend toward the vapor phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Phase transitions occur when the [[thermodynamic free energy]] of a system is [[analytic function|non-analytic]] for some choice of thermodynamic variables (cf. [[phase (matter)|phases]]). This condition generally stems from the interactions of a large number of particles in a system, and does not appear in systems that are too small. It is important to note that phase transitions can occur and are defined for non-thermodynamic systems, where temperature is not a parameter. Examples include: quantum phase transitions, dynamic phase transitions, and topological (structural) phase transitions. In these types of systems other parameters take the place of temperature. For instance, connection probability replaces temperature for percolating networks.

At the phase transition point (for instance, [[boiling point]]) the two phases of a substance, liquid and [[vapor]], have identical free energies and therefore are equally likely to exist. Below the boiling point, the liquid is the more stable state of the two, whereas above the gaseous form is preferred.

It is sometimes possible to change the state of a system [[diabatic]]ally (as opposed to [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic]]ally) in such a way that it can be brought past a phase transition point without undergoing a phase transition. The resulting state is [[metastable]], i.e., less stable than the phase to which the transition would have occurred, but not unstable either. This occurs in [[superheating]], [[supercooling]], and [[supersaturation]], for example.

==Classifications==

===Ehrenfest classification===

[[Paul Ehrenfest]] classified phase transitions based on the behavior of the [[thermodynamic free energy]] as a function of other thermodynamic variables.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=The Ehrenfest Classification of Phase Transitions: Introduction and Evolution|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|date=1 May 1998|volume=53|issue=1|pages=51–81|doi=10.1007/s004070050021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this scheme, phase transitions were labeled by the lowest derivative of the free energy that is discontinuous at the transition. ''First-order phase transitions'' exhibit a discontinuity in the first derivative of the free energy with respect to some thermodynamic variable.&lt;ref name = Blundell&gt;{{Cite book | last = Blundell | first = Stephen J. |author2=Katherine M. Blundell | title = Concepts in Thermal Physics | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-19-856770-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various solid/liquid/gas transitions are classified as first-order transitions because they involve a discontinuous change in density, which is the (inverse of the) first derivative of the free energy with respect to pressure. ''Second-order phase transitions'' are continuous in the first derivative (the [[order parameter]], which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the external field, is continuous across the transition) but exhibit discontinuity in a second derivative of the free energy.&lt;ref name = Blundell/&gt; These include the ferromagnetic phase transition in materials such as iron, where the [[magnetization]], which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the applied magnetic field strength, increases continuously from zero as the temperature is lowered below the [[Curie temperature]]. The [[magnetic susceptibility]], the second derivative of the free energy with the field, changes discontinuously. Under the Ehrenfest classification scheme, there could in principle be third, fourth, and higher-order phase transitions.

Though useful, Ehrenfest's classification has been found to be an incomplete method of classifying phase transitions, for it does not take into account the case where a [[derivative]] of [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] diverges (which is only possible in the [[thermodynamic limit]]). For instance, in the [[ferromagnetic]] transition, the [[heat capacity]] diverges to [[infinity]]. The same phenomenon is also seen in superconducting phase transition.

===Modern classifications===
In the modern classification scheme, phase transitions are divided into two broad categories, named similarly to the Ehrenfest classes:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

First-order phase transitions are those that involve a [[latent heat]]. During such a transition, a system either absorbs or releases a fixed (and typically large) amount of energy per volume. During this process, the temperature of the system will stay constant as heat is added: the system is in a "mixed-phase regime" in which some parts of the system have completed the transition and others have not. Familiar examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water (the water does not instantly turn into [[water vapor|vapor]], but forms a [[turbulence|turbulent]] mixture of liquid water and vapor bubbles). Imry and Wortis showed that quenched disorder can broaden a first-order transition. That is, the transformation is completed over a finite range of temperatures, but phenomena like supercooling and superheating survive and hysteresis is observed on thermal cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Imry | first1 = Y. | last2 = Wortis | first2 = M. | year = 1979 | title =  Influence of quenched impurities on first-order phase transitions| url = | journal = Phys.

Second-order phase transitions are also called ''continuous phase transitions''. They are characterized by a divergent susceptibility, an infinite correlation length, and a power-law decay of correlations near criticality. Examples of second-order phase transitions are the ferromagnetic transition, superconducting transition (for a [[Type-I superconductor]] the phase transition is second-order at zero external field and for a [[Type-II superconductor]] the phase transition is second-order for both normal-state—mixed-state and mixed-state—superconducting-state transitions) and the [[superfluid]] transition. In contrast to viscosity, thermal expansion and heat capacity of amorphous materials show a relatively sudden change at the glass transition temperature&lt;ref name="J. Non-Cryst 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ojovan | first1 = M.I. | year = 2013 | title = Ordering and structural changes at the glass-liquid transition | url = | journal = J. Non-Cryst.

[[Lev Landau]] gave a [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] [[Landau theory|theory]] of second-order phase transitions.

Apart from isolated, simple phase transitions, there exist transition lines as well as [[multicritical point]]s, when varying external parameters like the magnetic field or composition.

Several transitions are known as ''infinite-order phase transitions''.
They are continuous but break no [[#Symmetry|symmetries]]. The most famous example is the [[Kosterlitz–Thouless transition]] in the two-dimensional [[XY model]]. Many [[quantum phase transition]]s, e.g., in [[two-dimensional electron gas]]es, belong to this class.

The [[glass transition|liquid–glass transition]] is observed in many [[polymers]] and other liquids that can be [[supercooling|supercooled]] far below the melting point of the crystalline phase. This is atypical in several respects. It is not a transition between thermodynamic ground states: it is widely believed that the true ground state is always crystalline. Glass is a ''[[quenched disorder]]'' state, and its entropy, density, and so on, depend on the thermal history. Therefore, the glass transition is primarily a dynamic phenomenon: on cooling a liquid, internal degrees of freedom successively fall out of equilibrium. Some theoretical methods predict an underlying phase transition in the hypothetical limit of infinitely long relaxation times.&lt;ref&gt;Gotze, Wolfgang. "Complex Dynamics of Glass-Forming Liquids: A Mode-Coupling Theory."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lubchenko | first1 = V. Wolynes | last2 = Wolynes | first2 = Peter G. | year = 2007 | title = Theory of Structural Glasses and Supercooled Liquids | url = | journal = Annual Review of Physical Chemistry | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 235–266 | doi=10.1146/annurev.physchem.58.032806.104653| pmid = 17067282 |arxiv = cond-mat/0607349 |bibcode = 2007ARPC...58..235L }}&lt;/ref&gt; No direct experimental evidence supports the existence of these transitions.

==Characteristic properties==

===Phase coexistence===
A disorder-broadened  first-order transition occurs over a finite range of temperatures where the fraction of the low-temperature equilibrium phase grows from zero to one (100%) as the temperature is lowered. This continuous variation of the coexisting fractions with temperature raised interesting possibilities. On cooling, some liquids vitrify into a glass rather than transform to the equilibrium crystal phase. This happens if the cooling rate is faster than a critical cooling rate, and is attributed to the molecular motions becoming so slow that the molecules cannot rearrange into the crystal positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1995 | title =  Metallic Glasses| url = | journal = Science | volume = 267 | issue = 5206| pages = 1947–1953 |bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1947G |doi = 10.1126/science.267.5206.1947 | pmid =  17770105| last1 =  Greer| first1 =  A. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This slowing down happens below a glass-formation temperature Tg, which may depend on the applied pressure.&lt;ref name="J. Non-Cryst 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tarjus | first1 = G. | year = 2007 | title =  Materials science: Metal turned to glass| url = | journal = Nature | volume = 448 | issue = 7155| pages = 758–759 | doi=10.1038/448758a| pmid = 17700684 |bibcode = 2007Natur.448..758T }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the first-order freezing transition occurs over a range of temperatures, and Tg falls within this range, then there is an interesting possibility that the transition is arrested when it is partial and incomplete. Extending these ideas to first-order magnetic transitions being arrested at low temperatures, resulted in the observation of incomplete magnetic transitions, with two magnetic phases coexisting, down to the lowest temperature.

The interesting feature of these observations of Tg falling within the temperature range over which the transition occurs is that the first-order magnetic transition is influenced by magnetic field, just like the structural transition is influenced by pressure. The relative ease with which magnetic fields can be controlled, in contrast to pressure, raises the possibility that one can study the interplay between Tg and Tc in an exhaustive way. Phase coexistence across first-order magnetic transitions will then enable the resolution of outstanding issues in understanding glasses.

===Critical points===
In any system containing liquid and gaseous phases, there exists a special combination of pressure and temperature, known as the [[critical point (physics)|critical point]], at which the transition between liquid and gas becomes a second-order transition. Near the critical point, the fluid is sufficiently hot and compressed that the distinction between the liquid and gaseous phases is almost non-existent. This is associated with the phenomenon of [[critical opalescence]], a milky appearance of the liquid due to density fluctuations at all possible wavelengths (including those of visible light).

===Symmetry===
Phase transitions often involve a [[symmetry breaking]] process. For instance, the cooling of a fluid into a [[crystalline solid]] breaks continuous [[translation symmetry]]: each point in the fluid has the same properties, but each point in a crystal does not have the same properties (unless the points are chosen from the lattice points of the crystal lattice). Typically, the high-temperature phase contains more symmetries than the low-temperature phase due to [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], with the exception of certain [[accidental symmetry|accidental symmetries]] (e.g. the formation of heavy [[virtual particles]], which only occurs at low temperatures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivancevic|first1=Vladimir G.|last2=Ivancevic|first2=Tijiana, T.|title=Complex Nonlinearity|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-79357-1|pages=176–177|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wpsPgHgtxEYC&amp;pg=PA177 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order parameters&lt;!--'Order parameter' and 'Order parameters' redirect here--&gt;===
An '''order parameter'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a measure of the degree of order across the boundaries in a phase transition system; it normally ranges between zero in one phase (usually above the critical point) and nonzero in the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Compendium of Chemical Terminology  | editor = A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson | isbn = 978-0-86542-684-9 | doi = | publisher = [[IUPAC]] | url = http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/O04323.html | accessdate = 2007-10-23| year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the critical point, the order parameter [[susceptibility (disambiguation)|susceptibility]] will usually diverge.

An example of an order parameter is the net [[magnetization]] in a [[ferromagnetic]] system undergoing a phase transition. For liquid/gas transitions, the order parameter is the difference of the densities.

From a theoretical perspective, order parameters arise from symmetry breaking. When this happens, one needs to introduce one or more extra variables to describe the state of the system. For example, in the [[ferromagnetic]] phase, one must provide the net [[magnetization]], whose direction was spontaneously chosen when the system cooled below the [[Curie point]]. However, note that order parameters can also be defined for non-symmetry-breaking transitions. Some phase transitions, such as superconducting and ferromagnetic, can have order parameters for more than one degree of freedom. In such phases, the order parameter may take the form of a complex number, a vector, or even a tensor, the magnitude of which goes to zero at the phase transition.

There also exist dual descriptions of phase transitions in terms of disorder parameters. These indicate the presence of line-like excitations such as [[Quantum vortex|vortex]]- or [[Topological defect|defect]] lines.

===Relevance in cosmology===
Symmetry-breaking phase transitions play an important role in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. It has been speculated by Lee Smolin and [[Jeremy Bernstein]] that, in the [[Big Bang|hot early universe]], the vacuum (i.e. the various [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]] that fill space) possessed a large number of symmetries. As the universe expanded and cooled, the vacuum underwent a series of symmetry-breaking phase transitions. For example, the electroweak transition broke the SU(2)×U(1) symmetry of the [[electroweak force|electroweak field]] into the U(1) symmetry of the present-day [[electromagnetic field]]. This transition is important to understanding the asymmetry between the amount of matter and antimatter in the present-day universe (see [[Baryogenesis#Baryogenesis within the Standard Model|electroweak baryogenesis]].)

Progressive phase transitions in an expanding universe are implicated in the development of order in the universe, as is illustrated by the work of [[Eric Chaisson]]&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, ''Cosmic Evolution'', Harvard, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and David Layzer.&lt;ref&gt;David Layzer, ''Cosmogenesis, The Development of Order in the Universe'', Oxford Univ. Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Relational order theories]].

===Critical exponents and universality classes===
{{main|critical exponent}}
Continuous phase transitions are easier to study than first-order transitions due to the absence of [[latent heat]], and they have been discovered to have many interesting properties. The phenomena associated with continuous phase transitions are called critical phenomena, due to their association with critical points.

It turns out that continuous phase transitions can be characterized by parameters known as [[critical exponent]]s. The most important one is perhaps the exponent describing the divergence of the thermal [[correlation length]] by approaching the transition. For instance, let us examine the behavior of the [[heat capacity]] near such a transition. We vary the temperature {{mvar|T}} of the system while keeping all the other thermodynamic variables fixed, and find that the transition occurs at some critical temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' . When {{mvar|T}}  is near ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' , the heat capacity {{mvar|C}} typically has a [[power law]] behavior,
:&lt;math&gt; C \propto |T_c - T|^{-\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

The heat capacity of amorphous materials has such a behaviour near the glass transition temperature where the universal critical exponent α = 0.59&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/1958/1/ojovanmi1_Topologically2.pdf |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/18/50/007|bibcode = 2006JPCM...1811507O |title=Topologically disordered systems at the glass transition|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|volume=18|issue=50|pages=11507–11520|year=2006|last1=Ojovan|first1=Michael I|last2=Lee|first2=William E}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar behavior, but with the exponent {{mvar|ν}} instead of {{mvar|α}}, applies for the correlation length.

The exponent {{mvar|ν}} is positive. This is different with {{mvar|α}}. Its actual value depends on the type of phase transition we are considering.

It is widely believed  that the critical exponents are the same above and below the critical temperature. It has now been shown that this is not necessarily true: When a continuous symmetry is explicitly broken down to a discrete symmetry by irrelevant (in the renormalization group sense) anisotropies, then some exponents (such as &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt;, the exponent of the susceptibility) are not identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leonard|first1=F.|last2=Delamotte|first2=B.|year = 2015|title=Critical exponents can be different on the two sides of a transition| url = | journal = Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume = 115 | issue = 20| page = 200601 | arxiv = 1508.07852|bibcode = 2015PhRvL.115t0601L| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.200601 |pmid=26613426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For −1 &amp;lt; α &amp;lt; 0, the heat capacity has a "kink" at the transition temperature. This is the behavior of liquid helium at the [[lambda transition]] from a normal state to the [[superfluid]] state, for which experiments have found {{mvar|α}} = -0.013±0.003.
At least one experiment was performed in the zero-gravity conditions of an orbiting satellite to minimize pressure differences in the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.68.174518 | title=Specific heat of liquid helium in zero gravity very near the lambda point | year=2003 | last1=Lipa | first1=J. | last2=Nissen | first2=J. | last3=Stricker | first3=D. | last4=Swanson | first4=D. | last5=Chui | first5=T. | journal=Physical Review B | volume=68 | issue=17| pages=174518 |arxiv = cond-mat/0310163 |bibcode = 2003PhRvB..68q4518L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This experimental value of α agrees with theoretical predictions based on [[variational perturbation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.60.085001 | title=Critical exponents from seven-loop strong-coupling φ4 theory in three dimensions | year=1999 | last1=Kleinert | first1=Hagen | journal=Physical Review D | volume=60 | issue=8| pages=085001 |arxiv = hep-th/9812197 |bibcode = 1999PhRvD..60h5001K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 0 &amp;lt; {{mvar|α}} &amp;lt; 1, the heat capacity diverges at the transition temperature (though, since {{mvar|α}} &amp;lt; 1, the enthalpy stays finite). An example of such behavior is the 3D ferromagnetic phase transition. In the three-dimensional [[Ising model]] for uniaxial magnets, detailed theoretical studies have yielded the exponent {{mvar|α}} ∼ +0.110.

Some model systems do not obey a power-law behavior. For example, mean field theory predicts a finite discontinuity of the heat capacity at the transition temperature, and the two-dimensional Ising model has a [[logarithm]]ic divergence. However, these systems are limiting cases and an exception to the rule. Real phase transitions exhibit power-law behavior.

Several other critical exponents, {{math| ''β, γ, δ, ν''}}, and {{mvar|η}}, are defined, examining the power law behavior of a measurable physical quantity near the phase transition. Exponents are related by scaling relations, such as
:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\gamma/(\delta-1) , \qquad \nu=\gamma/(2-\eta)&lt;/math&gt;.
It can be shown that there are only two independent exponents, e.g. {{mvar|ν}} and {{mvar|η}}.

It is a remarkable fact that phase transitions arising in different systems often possess the same set of critical exponents. This phenomenon is known as ''universality''. For example, the critical exponents at the liquid–gas critical point have been found to be independent of the chemical composition of the fluid.

More impressively, but understandably from above, they are an exact match for the critical exponents of the ferromagnetic phase transition in uniaxial magnets. Such systems are said to be in the same universality class. Universality is a prediction of the [[renormalization group]] theory of phase transitions, which states that the thermodynamic properties of a system near a phase transition depend only on a small number of features, such as dimensionality and symmetry, and are insensitive to the underlying microscopic properties of the system. Again, the divergence of the correlation length is the essential point.

===Critical slowing down and other phenomena===
There are also other critical phenomena; e.g., besides ''static functions'' there is also ''critical dynamics''. As a consequence, at a phase transition one may observe critical slowing down or ''speeding up''. The large ''static universality classes'' of a continuous phase transition split into smaller ''dynamic universality'' classes. In addition to the critical exponents, there are also universal relations for certain static or dynamic functions of the magnetic fields and temperature differences from the critical value.

===Percolation theory===
Another phenomenon which shows phase transitions and critical exponents is [[percolation theory|percolation]]. The simplest example is perhaps percolation in a two dimensional square lattice. Sites are randomly occupied with probability p. For small values of p the occupied sites form only small clusters. At a certain threshold p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; a giant cluster is formed and we have a second-order phase transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fractals and Disordered Systems|author= Armin Bunde and [[Shlomo Havlin]] |year= 1996|publisher= Springer|url= http://havlin.biu.ac.il/Shlomo%20Havlin%20books_fds.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior of P&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; near p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is, P&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;~(p-p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;, where β is a critical exponent.

===Phase transitions in biological systems===
Phase transitions play many important roles in biological systems. Examples include the [[lipid bilayer]] formation, the [[Coil–globule transition|coil-globule transition]] in the process of [[protein folding]] and [[DNA melting]], liquid crystal-like transitions in the process of [[DNA condensation]], and cooperative ligand binding to DNA and proteins with the character of phase transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/07391102.2000.10506578 | pmid=10798534 | title=Long-range interactions between ligands bound to a DNA molecule give rise to adsorption with the character of phase transition of the first kind | year=2000| author = D.Y. Lando and V.B. Teif| journal=J. Biomol. Struct. Dynam. | volume=17 | issue=5 | pages=903–911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''biological membranes'', gel to liquid crystalline phase transitions play a critical role in physiological functioning of biomembranes. In gel phase, due to low fluidity of membrane lipid fatty-acyl chains, membrane proteins have restricted movement and thus are restrained in exercise of their physiological role. Plants depend critically on photosynthesis by chloroplast thylakoid membranes which are exposed cold environmental temperatures. Thylakoid membranes retain innate fluidity even at relatively low temperatures because of high degree of fatty-acyl disorder allowed by their high content of linolenic acid, 18-carbon chain with 3-double bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = YashRoy | first1 = R.C. | year = 1987 | title = 13-C NMR studies of lipid fatty acyl chains of chloroplast membranes | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230822408 | journal = Indian Journal of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 177–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature of biological membranes can be determined by many techniques including calorimetry, flouorescence, [[spin label]] [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] and [[NMR]] by recording measurements of the concerned parameter by at series of sample temperatures. A simple method for its determination from 13-C NMR line intensities has also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = YashRoy | first1 = R C | year = 1990 | title = Determination of membrane lipid phase transition temperature from 13-C NMR intensities | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20790042 | journal = Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 353–356 | pmid = 2365951 |doi=10.1016/0165-022X(90)90097-V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that some biological systems might lie near critical points. Examples include [[neural network]]s in the salamander retina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1407.5946|last1=Tkacik|first1=Gasper|title=Thermodynamics for a network of neurons: Signatures of criticality|last2=Mora|first2=Thierry|last3=Marre|first3=Olivier|last4=Amodei|first4=Dario|last5= Berry II|first5=Michael J.|last6=Bialek|first6=William|class=q-bio.NC|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; bird flocks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bialek|first1=W|last2=Cavagna|first2=A|last3=Giardina|first3=I|title = Social interactions dominate speed control in poising natural flocks near criticality|journal=PNAS|volume=111|issue=20|pages=7212–7217|year = 2014|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.7212B|doi=10.1073/pnas.1324045111|pmid=24785504|pmc=4034227|arxiv=1307.5563}}&lt;/ref&gt;
gene expression networks in Drosophila,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Krotov |first1=D|last2=Dubuis|first2=J O|last3=Gregor|first3=T|last4=Bialek|first4=W|title = Morphogenesis at criticality|journal = PNAS|year = 2014|doi=10.1073/pnas.1324186111|pmid=24516161|pmc=3956198|volume=111|issue=10|pages=3683–3688|arxiv=1309.2614|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.3683K}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protein folding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mora|first1=Thierry|last2=Bialek|first2=William|title = Are biological systems poised at criticality?|journal = Journal of Statistical Physics|volume=144|issue=2|pages=268–302|year = 2011 |arxiv=1012.2242 |doi= 10.1007/s10955-011-0229-4|bibcode=2011JSP...144..268M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not clear whether or not alternative reasons could explain some of the phenomena supporting arguments for criticality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwab|first1=David J|last2=Nemenman|first2=Ilya|last3=Mehta|first3=Pankaj|title = Zipf's law and criticality in multivariate data without fine-tuning|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume=113|issue=6|pages=068102|year = 2014 |arxiv=1310.0448 |bibcode= 2014PhRvL.113f8102S|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.068102|pmid=25148352|pmc=5142845}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that biological organisms share two key properties of phase transitions: the change of macroscopic behavior and the coherence of a system at a critical point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=G.|last2=Montévil|first2=M.|date=2011-08-01|title=From physics to biology by extending criticality and symmetry breakings|url=https://www.academia.edu/23155991|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|series=Systems Biology and Cancer|volume=106|issue=2|pages=340–347|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.03.005|pmid=21419157|via=|arxiv=1103.1833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In groups of organisms in stress (when approaching critical transitions), correlations tend to increase, while at the same time, fluctuations also increase. This effect is supported by many experiments and observations of groups of people, mice, trees, and grassy plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T.A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main options are '''interleaved posting''' (also called '''inline replying''', in which the different parts of the reply follow the relevant parts of the original post), '''bottom-posting''' (in which the reply follows the quote) or '''top-posting''' (in which the reply precedes the quoted original message). For each of those options, there is also the issue of whether '''trimming''' of the original text is allowed, required, or preferred.

For a long time the traditional style was to post the answer below as much of the quoted original as was necessary to understand the reply (bottom or inline). Many years later, when email became widespread in business communication, it became a widespread practice to reply above the entire original and leave it (supposedly untouched) below the reply.

While each [[virtual community|online community]] differs on which styles are appropriate or acceptable, within some communities the use of the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; method risks being seen as a breach of [[netiquette]], and can provoke vehement response from community regulars.

==Quoting previous messages==
In an e-mail reply, it is sometimes appropriate to include a full or partial copy of the original message that is being replied to.  As opposed to in-person conversations and Internet [[online chat|chat]]s, email responses may be received long after the original message was sent, so the original sender may have forgotten, misplaced or deleted the original. Many email reading programs ([[mail user agent]]s) encourage this behaviour by automatically including a copy of the original message in the reply editing window.

Quoted text from previous messages is usually distinguished in some way from the new (reply) text. At a minimum, the two parts are given different [[Indentation (typesetting)|indentation]]. In the example below, the first line is the original message, the second line is the reply:

     All these words are terrible. They're hurtful and they make no sense. --Mary
 &lt;br&gt;
 Much like your posting.--Joe.

Alternatively, special delimiter lines may be used:

 Hey Joe, Paris is in France, not England. --Mary
 &lt;br&gt;
 --- original message ---
 You just had a call from England, from Paris I think. --Joe
 --- end of original message ---

For extra clarity, blank lines may also be inserted between the two parts. When using an email medium that supports text markup (such as HTML or RTF), the previous text may be indicated by a distinctive font and/or color:

     &lt;span style="color:darkgreen"&gt;The meeting has been postponed to next Friday. --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Has the deadline for the report been moved too? --Joe

===Quoted line prefix===
[[Image:MsOutlook-EmailOptions.png|thumb|right|Alternative e-mail quoting styles supported by Microsoft Outlook]]
{{see also|Usenet quoting}}
A common convention in plain-text email is to prefix each line of the quoted text with a distinctive character or string.  Today (and for many years previously), the [[greater-than sign]] (&amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo;, the [[wikt:canon|canonical]] prefix)&lt;ref name="rfc3676#section-4.5"&gt;R. Gellens (February 2004), '''RFC 3676''' [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3676#section-4.5 ''The Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters'']&lt;/ref&gt; is almost universally used; but other characters such as the [[ASCII]] [[vertical bar]] character (&amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo;) have been used as well, sometimes with one or more spaces inserted before or after the quoted text marker.

There is no standard declaring one quote-prefix to be &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; and others to be &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;, but some standards depend on conventional quoting. The (unpublished) [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1849.html &amp;ldquo;son-of-1036&amp;rdquo;] draft recommends &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; as the quote-prefix; [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3676.txt RFC 3676] depends on it and considers &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; to be semantically different. That is, &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; has a quote-depth of two, while &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; has a quote-depth of one, quoting a line starting with &amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;. Most e-mail clients treat both alternatives equivalently, however.

The convention of quoting was common in [[Usenet]] newsgroups by 1990, and is supported by many popular  [[User agent|email interfaces]], either by default or as a user-settable option. In [[Microsoft Outlook]], for instance, this option is labeled &amp;ldquo;prefix each line of the original.&amp;rdquo;  Besides inserting markers automatically in quoted lines, some interfaces assume that a line starting with a &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; character or similar is quoted text, and will automatically display it in a distinctive font or color:

 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; How is the report coming? --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe

Sometimes the insertion of a quoted line marker will cause one original line to be folded as two lines in the reply, and the continuation line may not have the proper marker. To avoid ambiguity in such cases, one may consider inserting blank lines after each block of quoted text:

 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt;The board is asking again for the sales data. We really must provide&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; them with some figures. How is the report coming? --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe

Quoted line markers are most commonly used in plain-text messages. In HTML messages, other devices may be used to indicate quoted text, such as [[HTML element|HTML indentation element]]s like &lt;code&gt;[[Blockquote element|blockquote]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dl&lt;/code&gt;.

===Reply level indication===
A message often includes text from two or more messages exchanged in previous rounds of a long discussion. If an additional quotation marker is inserted at every round, without removing any existing markers, the number of markers at the beginning of each line will show the &amp;ldquo;level&amp;rdquo; of the reply, that is, how many rounds have occurred since that line was written. These accumulated markers are usually sufficient to distinguish the parts that came from each message.  Some email interfaces recognize this convention and automatically render each level in a different color. For example:

 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How is the report coming? --Mary
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:magenta"&gt;&gt;
 &gt; Sorry Joe, I need it by 11:00 at the latest. --Mary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 OK, but it will be missing this month's figures. --Joe

If the discussion is between two parties only, then an even number of markers (including zero) identifies text written by the sender, while an odd number of markers identifies text by the recipient. (In the above example even numbers are Joe's text and odd number are Mary's.)

 No problem. 6pm it is then. --Jim
 &lt;br&gt;
 At 10.01am Wednesday, Danny wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Whoa! I need to email a report at 5:30.
 &gt; Could you push it back an hour? --Danny
 &gt;
 &gt; At 9.40am Wednesday, Jim wrote:
 &gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm going to suspend the mail service for approx. thirty
 &gt;&gt; minutes tonight, starting at 5pm. --Jim&lt;/span&gt;

In HTML messages, &lt;code&gt;[[Blockquote element|blockquote]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dl&lt;/code&gt; elements may be nested to achieve the same effect.

===Attribution lines===
Quoted material is often preceded by an ''attribution line'' that identifies its author.  These lines are particularly helpful in discussions between multiple parties. For example:

 Nancy wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Peter wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; When will we have the performance figures?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; The tests will be completed next week. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Mary wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter.  We need the sales data and also Nancy's
 performance figures.  Let's meet next Friday after lunch.

This reply quotes two messages, one by Nancy (itself a reply to Peter) and one by Peter (itself a reply to Mary).

Many mail agents will add these attribution lines automatically to the top of the quoted material.  Note that a newly added attribution line should not get the quotation marker, since it is not part of the quoted text; so that the level indicator of the attribution line is always one less than the corresponding text. Doing otherwise may confuse the reader and also e-mail interfaces that choose the text color according to the number of leading markers.

Instead of an attribution line, one may indicate the author by a comment in brackets, at the beginning of the quotation:

 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; [Peter:] When will we have the performance figures?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; [Nancy:] The tests will be completed next week. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&gt;&gt; [Mary:] We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;&gt; [Peter:] Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter.  We need the sales data and Nancy's
 performance figures.  Let's meet next Friday after lunch.

Another alternative, used in [[Fidonet]] and some [[mail user agent]]s, is to place the initials of the author before the quoting marker. This may be used with or without attribution lines:

 Nancy wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;N&gt; Peter wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;P&gt;&gt; When will we have the performance figures?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;N&gt; The tests will be completed next week. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;P&gt; Mary wrote:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;M&gt;&gt; We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;P&gt; Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter.  We need the sales data and also Nancy's
 performance figures.  Let's meet next Friday after lunch.

==Trimming and reformatting==
When replying to long discussions, particularly in [[newsgroup]] discussions, quoted text from the original message is often trimmed so as to leave only the parts that are relevant to the reply — or only a reminder thereof.  This practice is sometimes called &amp;ldquo;trim-posting&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;edited posting&amp;rdquo;, and is recommended by some manuals of posting etiquette.&lt;ref name="rfc1855"&gt;S. Hambridge (October 1995), [[Network Working Group]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 1855 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855 ''Netiquette Guidelines'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes an indicator of deleted text is given, usually in the form of a square bracketed tag as: &amp;ldquo;[snipped],&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;[trimmed],&amp;rdquo; or simply &amp;ldquo;[...]&amp;rdquo;. The text that is retained may be edited to some extent, e.g. by re-folding the lines.  For example, if the original message was

  This is a reminder that the project meeting which was canceled
  last week will be held today in the 3rd floor conference room at
  14:30 sharp.  Everybody must attend. --Mary

the reply may be

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
  &gt; the project meeting [...] will be held today in the 3rd floor
  &gt; conference room
  &lt;/span&gt;
  Mary, be sure to check the mics in that room. --Joe

or even just

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
  &gt; 3rd floor conference room
  &lt;/span&gt;
  Mary, be sure to check the mics in that room. --Joe

Deleted text may also be replaced by a summary in brackets:

  On Thursday, Jim wrote:&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
  &gt; The movie clearly adds a sense of menace to the story
  &gt; which is not present in the original book.
  &gt; [...claim that the darker tone weakens the movie...]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  I disagree.  The darker tone works well, once one understands
  the two are aimed at different audiences.

Automatically included text (such as [[signature block]]s, free e-mail service ads, and corporate disclaimers) are more likely to be deleted, usually without ellipses, than manually written text.  Some posters may delete any parts of the original message that they are not replying to.  Some posters delete only parts dealing with issues that they see as  &amp;ldquo;closed,&amp;rdquo; and leave any parts that, in their opinion, deserve further discussion or will be replied to in a later message.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===How much to trim===
Some style guides recommend that, as a general rule, quoted material in replies should be trimmed or summarized as much as possible, keeping only the parts that are necessary to make the readers understand the replies.&lt;ref name="rfc1855"/&gt;  That of course depends on how much the readers can be assumed to know about the discussion.  For personal e-mail, in particular, the subject line is often sufficient, and no quoting is necessary; unless one is replying to only some points of a long message.&lt;ref name="rfc1855"/&gt;

In particular, when replying to a message that already included quoted text, one should consider whether that quoted material is still relevant.  For example:

&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; [Mary:] Shall we meet this afternoon to discuss the
 &gt;&gt; marketing strategy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; [Peter:] Perhaps, if we can get all the information we need.
 &gt; Do we have the West Coast sales data yet?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 The LA office just sent them in.
 Joe

The quote from Mary's message is relevant to Peter's reply, but not to Joe's reply.  The latter could have been trimmed to

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; [Peter:] Do we have the West Coast sales data yet?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 The LA office just sent them in.
 Joe

On the other hand, in some situations, any trimming or editing of the original message may be inappropriate. For example, if the reply is being copied to a third person who did not see the original message, it may be advisable to quote it in full; otherwise the trimmed message may be misinterpreted by the new recipient, for lack of context.

Also, when replying to a customer or supplier, it may be advisable to quote the original message in its entirety, in case the other party somehow failed to keep a copy of it.

==Placement of replies==

=== Interleaved style ===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Netiquette]] --&gt;

In the interleaved reply style (also called &amp;ldquo;inline reply,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;interlined reply,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;point-by-point rebuttal,&amp;rdquo; or, sometimes, &amp;ldquo;bottom posting&amp;rdquo;), the original message is broken into two or more sections, each followed by a specific reply or comment.  A reply in inline style may also include some [[#Top-posting|top-posted]] or [[#Bottom-posting|bottom-posted]] comments that apply to the whole reply message, rather than to a specific point.  For example:

 I have been following the discussion about the new product line. Here are my thoughts.
 &lt;br&gt;
 Joe wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Will our prices be competitive?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 That may not be a problem for now, we still have a quality edge.
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; We do not have enough trained people on the West Coast. We have many
 &gt; new employees but they do not know our products yet.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 We can bring them here for a crash training course.
 &lt;br&gt;
 Mary wrote:
 &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; We still do not have a clear marketing plan. &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter, would you take charge of that? Let me know if you need help.
 &lt;br&gt;
 On the whole, I am quite optimistic.  It looks like we will be shipping
 the basic system before the end of this quarter.
 Nancy

The interleaved reply style can also be combined with top-posting: selected points are quoted and replied to, as above, and then a full copy of the original message is appended.

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Can you present your report an hour later?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Yes I can. The summary will be sent no later than 5pm.
 Jim
 &lt;br&gt;
 At 10.01am Wednesday, Danny wrote:&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; 2.00pm: Present report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Jim, I have a meeting at that time. Can you present your report an hour later?
 &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; 4.30pm: Send out summary of feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;
 &gt; Also if you do the above, this may need to happen later too.
 &gt; Danny
 &gt;
 &gt; At 9.40am Wednesday, Jim wrote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;
 &gt;&gt; My schedule for today will be:
 &gt;&gt; 10.00am: Gather data for report
 &gt;&gt; 2.00pm: Present report to team
 &gt;&gt; 4.30pm: Send out summary of feedback
 &gt;&gt; Jim&lt;/span&gt;

Interleaving was the predominant reply style in the [[Usenet]] discussion lists, years before the existence of the [[WWW]] and the spread of [[e-mail]] and the [[Internet]] outside the academic community.&lt;ref name="interleave standard"&gt;Archives of Usenet posts at [[Google Groups]] prior to the [[WWW|beginning of the WWW]] (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Interleaving was also common originally in e-mail, because many internet users had been exposed to Usenet newsgroups and other [[Internet forum]]s, where it is still used.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The style became less common for email after the opening of the internet to commercial and non-academic personal use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} One possible reason is the large number of casual e-mail users that entered the scene at that time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Another possible reason is the inadequate support provided by the reply function of some [[webmail]] readers, which either do not automatically insert a copy of the original message into the reply, or do so without any quoting prefix [[#Quoted line prefix|level indicators]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Finally, most forums, wiki discussion pages, and [[blog]]s (such as [[Slashdot]]) essentially impose the bottom-post format, by displaying all recent messages in chronological order.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Interleaving continues to be used on technical mailing lists where clarity within complex threads is important.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

===Top-posting===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Netiquette]] --&gt;
In top-posting style, the original message is included verbatim, with the reply above it.  It is sometimes referred to by the term '''TOFU''', an acronym for &amp;ldquo;text over, fullquote under.&amp;rdquo;  It has also been colloquially referred to as ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' reply style.  The original message asks a question and the reply answers it, so the order in which these texts appear follows the format of that game show, where the answer (the clue) comes first and the response is a question.

Example:
 No problem.  6pm it is then.
 Jim &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;

Top-posting preserves an apparently unmodified transcript of a branch in the conversation.  Often all replies line up in a single branch of a conversation.  The top of the text shows the latest replies.  This appears to be advantageous for business correspondence, where an e-mail thread can dupe others into believing it is an &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; record.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

By contrast, excessive indentation of interleaved and bottom posting may turn difficult to interpret.  If the participants have different stature such as manager vs. employee or consultant vs. client, one person's cutting apart another person's words without the full context may look impolite or cause misunderstanding.

In the earlier days of [[Usenet]] informal discussions where everyone was an equal encouraged bottom-posting.  Until the mid-1990s, posts in a net.newcomers newsgroup insisted on interleaving replies.  Usenet [[Comp.* hierarchy|''comp.lang'' hierarchy]], especially comp.lang.c and comp.lang.c++ insisted on the same as of the 2010s.  The [[Alt.* hierarchy|''alt'' hierarchy]] tolerated top-posting.  Newer online participants, especially those with limited experience of Usenet, tend to be less sensitive to arguments about posting style.

Top-posting can be problematic on mailing lists with ongoing discussions which eventually require someone to act on the top-posted material. For example, top-posting &amp;ldquo;Those changes look ok to me, go ahead and make them&amp;rdquo; can be very inconvenient for the person who needs to make the changes if he or she has to read through a long email trail to know which changes the top-poster is referring to. Inter-leaving the text directly below the text describing the changes is much more convenient in these cases.

Users of [[handheld device|mobile devices]], like [[smartphone]]s, are encouraged to use top-posting because the devices may only download the beginning of a message for viewing.  The rest of the message is only retrieved when needed, which takes additional download time.  Putting the relevant content at the beginning of the message requires less bandwidth, less time, and less scrolling for the user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danwarne.com/my-rapidly-growing-email-habit/ My rapidly growing email habit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119091029/http://danwarne.com/my-rapidly-growing-email-habit/ |date=January 19, 2007 }} blog post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2001-07/1670.html  Stopping SirCam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035410/http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2001-07/1670.html |date=September 28, 2007 }} — postfix.org mailing list&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2006-June/083465.html Top Posting and Mobiles] — [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|Jabber]] mailing list&lt;/ref&gt;

Top-posting is a natural consequence of the behavior of the &amp;ldquo;reply&amp;rdquo; function in many current e-mail readers, such as [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Gmail]], and others.  By default, these programs insert into the reply message a copy of the original message (without headers and often without any extra indentation or quotation markers), and position the editing [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] above it.  Moreover, a bug present on most flavours of Microsoft Outlook caused the quotation markers to be lost when replying in plain text to a message that was originally sent in HTML/RTF.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  
For these and possibly other reasons, many users seem to accept top-posting as the &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; reply style.

Partially because of Microsoft's influence, top-posting is very common on [[Electronic mailing list|mailing list]]s and in personal e-mail.&lt;ref name="Intelligently"&gt;{{Cite web

Top-posting has always been the standard format for forwarding a message to a third party, in which case the comments at the top (if any) are a "cover note" for the recipient.

===Bottom-posting===
In the "bottom-posting" style, the reply is appended to a full or partial copy of the original message. The name bottom-posting is sometimes used for inline-style replies, and indeed the two formats are the same when only one point is being replied to.

 &gt; By the way, which systems will be updated? I had some network

 &lt;/span&gt;
 No problems. 6pm it is then.
 &lt;br&gt;
 Basically, I will update our WWW server and firewall.
 No, you won't have to reboot.

Bottom-posting, like inline replies, encourages posters to trim the original message as much as possible, so that readers are not forced to scroll past irrelevant text, or text that they have already seen in the original message:

===Choosing the proper posting style===
The choice between interleaved, top or bottom posting generally depends on the forum and on the nature of the message. Some forums (such as personal e-mail) are quite tolerant, in which case the proper style is dictated by taste and effectiveness.  In any case one should consider whether the reply will be easily read by the intended recipient(s).  Their e-mail interfaces may have different rules for handling quoted line markers and long lines, so a reply that looks readable in one's screen may be jumbled and incorrectly colored on theirs.  Blank lines and judicious trimming of the original text may help avoid ambiguity.

The interleaved reply style can require more work in terms of labeling lines, but possibly less work in establishing the context of each reply line. It also keeps the quotes and their replies close to each other and in logical reading order, and encourages trimming of the quoted material to the bare minimum. This style makes it easier for readers to identify the points of the original message that are being replied to; in particular, whether the reply misunderstood or ignored some point of the original text.   It also gives the sender freedom to arrange the quoted parts in any order, and to provide a single comment to quotations from two or more separate messages, even if these did not include each other.

Top- and bottom-posting are sometimes compared to traditional [[letter (message)|written correspondence]] in that the response is a single continuous text, and the whole original is appended only to clarify which letter is being replied to. [[Customer service]] e-mail practices, in particular, often require that all points be addressed in a clear manner without quoting, while the original e-mail message may be included as an attachment.  Including the whole original message may be necessary also when a new correspondent is included in an ongoing discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mailformat.dan.info/quoting/top-posting.html Quoting: Top Posting] — Dan's Mail Format Site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/ Sensible email] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017180623/http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/sensible_email/ |date=October 17, 2006 }} — Blog post and discussion&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially in business correspondence, an entire message thread may need to be forwarded to a third party for handling or discussion. On the other hand, in environments where the entire discussion is accessible to new readers (such as [[newsgroup]]s or [[online forum]]s), full inclusion of previous messages is inappropriate; if quoting is necessary, the interleaved style is probably best.

If the original message is to be quoted in full, for any reason, bottom-posting is usually the most appropriate format — because it preserves the logical order of the replies and is consistent with the Western reading direction from top to bottom.

It is not uncommon during discussions concerning top-posting vs. bottom-posting to hear quotes from "Netiquette Guidelines (RFC 1855)". While many RFCs are vetted and approved though a committee process, some RFCs, such as RFC 1844, are just "Informational" and in reality, sometimes just personal opinions. (Additional information on "Informational" RFCs can be found in RFC 2026, under "4.2.2  Informational" and "4.2.3  Procedures for Experimental and Informational RFCs".) The nature of RFC 1855 should be considered while reading the following discussion.

According to RFC 1855, a message can begin with an abbreviated summary; i.e. a post can begin with a paraphrasing instead of quoting selectively.  Specifically, it says:

  If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you
  summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just
  enough text of the original to give a context.  This will make
  sure readers understand when they start to read your response.
  Since NetNews, especially, is proliferated by distributing the
  postings from one host to another, it is possible to see a
  response to a message before seeing the original.  Giving context
  helps everyone.  But do not include the entire original!

Interleaved reply combined with top-posting combines the advantages of both styles. However this also results in some portions of the original message being quoted twice, which takes up extra space and may confuse the reader.

In forwarding it is sometimes preferred to include the entire original message (including all headers) as a [[MIME]] attachment, while in top-posted replies these are often trimmed or replaced by an [[#Attribution lines|attribution line]]. An untrimmed quoted message is a weaker form of transcript, as key pieces of [[metadata|meta information]] are destroyed.  (This is why an [[Internet service provider|ISP]]'s [[Postmaster (computing)|Postmaster]] will typically insist on a ''forwarded'' copy of any problematic e-mail, rather than a quote.)  These forwarded messages are displayed in the same way as top-posting in some mail clients.
Top-posting is viewed as seriously destructive to [[Electronic mailing list|mailing-list]] digests, where multiple levels of top-posting are difficult to skip.  The worst case would be top-posting while including an entire digest as the original message.

Some believe that "top-posting" is appropriate for interpersonal e-mail, but inline posting should always be applied to threaded discussions such as newsgroups.

This example is occasionally used in mailing lists to mock and discourage top-posting:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/mailinglists/etiquette.php|title=ARM Linux - Mailing Lists - Etiquette|work=linux.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idallen.com/topposting.html|title=Top Posting and Bottom Posting|work=idallen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://what-is-what.com/what_is/top_posting.html|title=What is Top Posting?|work=what-is-what.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
 Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
 A: Top-posting.
 Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

Bottom-posting preserves the logical order of the replies and is consistent with the Western reading direction from top to bottom.

The major argument against bottom-posting is that scrolling down through a post to find a reply is inconvenient, especially for short replies to long messages, and many inexperienced computer users may not know that they need to scroll down to find a reply to their query. When sending an untrimmed bottom-posted message, one might indicate inline replies with a notice at the top such as "I have replied below." However, as many modern mail programs are capable of displaying different levels of quotation with different colors (as seen in the [[#Bottom-posting-example|bottom-posting example]] on this page), this is not so much of an issue any more. Another method to indicate that there is more reply text still to come is to always end your text with a signature line. Then a reader who is familiar with your reply style will know to continue to read until your signature line appears. This method is particularly polite and useful when using the inline reply method, since it tells the reader that your response is complete at the point where your signature line appears.

===Quoting support in popular mail clients===

This widespread policy in business communication made bottom and inline posting so unknown among most users that some of the most popular email programs no longer support the traditional posting style. For example, Microsoft Outlook, AOL, and Yahoo! make it difficult or impossible to indicate which part of a message is the quoted original or do not let users insert comments between parts of the original.

Yahoo! does not have the option "Quote the text of the original message" in Mail Classic, but this setting is retained after turning it on in All-New Mail and then switching back to Mail Classic. Inline replying is broken in Microsoft Outlook, which despite choosing the setting to prefix each line of the original with the "greater-than" character (&gt;) produces a blue line that makes answers inserted between quotes of an HTML email look like part of the original. The workarounds are to use the setting "read all standard mail in plain text", or to use the "Edit Message" option on the original email and convert it to plain text before replying (then discard the edited version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.loftninjas.org/2008/08/14/making-outlook-2007-quote-responsibly/|title=Making Outlook 2007 quote responsibly|work=loftninjas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PowerDEVS''' [[PowerDEVS#References|[BK011]]] is a general purpose software tool for [[DEVS]]  modeling and simulation oriented to the simulation of hybrid systems.  The environment allows   defining atomic DEVS models in C++ language that can be then graphically coupled in hierarchical block diagrams to create more complex systems.

It is developed at [[Universidad Nacional de Rosario]] ([[Argentina]]) by Ernesto Kofman, Federico Bergero, Gustavo Migoni, Enrique Hansen, Joaquín Fernandez,  Marcelo Lapadula and Esteban Pagliero.

The distribution is totally free.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4370">In [[mathematics]], the '''quotient''' (also called '''Serre quotient''' or '''Gabriel quotient''') of an [[abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; by a [[Serre subcategory]] ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' is the abelian category ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' which, intuitively, is obtained from ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;'' by ignoring (i.e. treating as [[Zero-object|zero]]) all objects from ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;.''  There is a canonical [[Exact functor|exact]] [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;Q \colon \mathcal A \to \mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; whose kernel is ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;''.

== Definition ==
Formally, ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' is the category whose objects are those of ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;'' and whose morphisms from ''X'' to ''Y'' are given by the [[direct limit]] (of [[Abelian group|abelian groups]]) &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim \mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal A(X', Y/Y')&lt;/math&gt; over [[Subobject|subobjects]] &lt;math&gt;X' \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y' \subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X/X'\in \cal{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y' \in \cal{B}&lt;/math&gt;.  (Here, &lt;math&gt;X/X'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y/Y'&lt;/math&gt; denote [[Quotient object|quotient objects]] computed in ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;''.) Composition of morphisms in ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' is induced by the universal property of the direct limit. 

The canonical functor &lt;math&gt;Q \colon \mathcal A \to \mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; sends an object ''X'' to itself and a morphism &lt;math&gt;f \colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; to the corresponding element of the direct limit with X'=X and Y'=0.

== Examples ==
Let &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] and consider the abelian category &lt;math&gt;{\rm Mod}(k)&lt;/math&gt; of all [[Vector space|vector spaces]] over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Then the full subcategory &lt;math&gt;{\rm mod}(k)&lt;/math&gt;of finite-[[Dimension|dimensional]] vector spaces is a Serre-subcategory of &lt;math&gt;{\rm Mod}(k)&lt;/math&gt;. The quotient &lt;math&gt;\cal{C}={\rm Mod}(k)/{\rm mod}(k)&lt;/math&gt; has as objects the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-vector spaces, and the set of morphisms from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\cal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math display="block"&gt;\{k\text{-linear maps from } X\text{ to } Y\}/\{k\text{-linear maps from } X \text{ to } Y \text{ with finite-dimensional image}\}&lt;/math&gt;(which is a [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient of vector spaces]]).  This has the effect of identifying all finite-dimensional vector spaces with 0, and of identifying two linear maps whenever their difference has finite-dimensional image.

== Properties ==
The quotient ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' is an abelian category, and the canonical functor &lt;math&gt;Q \colon \mathcal A \to \mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; is [[Exact functor|exact]].   The kernel of  &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'', i.e., &lt;math&gt;Q(X)&lt;/math&gt;is a [[Zero-object|zero object]] of  ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A/\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; belongs to ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;''. 

The quotient and canonical functor are characterized by the following [[universal property]]: if  ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;'' is any abelian category and &lt;math&gt;F \colon \mathcal A \to \mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; is an exact functor such that &lt;math&gt;F(X)&lt;/math&gt; is a zero object of ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;'' for each object &lt;math&gt;X \in \mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a unique exact functor &lt;math&gt;\overline{F} \colon \mathcal A/\mathcal B \to \mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;F = \overline{F} \circ Q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Pierre, ''[http://www.numdam.org/article/BSMF_1962__90__323_0.pdf Des categories abeliennes]'', Bull. Soc. Math. France '''90''' (1962), 323-448.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gabriel–Popescu ==
The [[Gabriel–Popescu theorem]] states that any [[Grothendieck category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a quotient category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)/\cal{B}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt;denotes the abelian category of right modules over some unital ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\cal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is some [[localizing subcategory]] of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=N.

'''Reverse engineering''', also called '''back engineering''', is the [[process (engineering)|process]] by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object; similar to [[scientific research]], the only difference being that scientific research is about a [[natural phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Eilam"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Eilam, Eldad |title=Reversing: secrets of reverseengineering|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7645-7481-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

There are many reasons for performing reverse engineering in various fields.

Software reverse engineering can help to improve the understanding of the underlying source code for the maintenance and improvement of the software, relevant information can be extracted in order to make a decision for software development and graphical representations of the code can provide alternate views regarding the source code, which can help to detect and fix a software bug or vulnerability. Frequently, as some software develops, its design information and improvements are often lost over time, but this lost information can usually be recovered with reverse engineering. This process can also help to cut down the time required to understand the source code, reducing the overall cost of the software development.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"/&gt; Reverse engineering can also help to detect and eliminate a malicious code written to the software with better code detectors. Reversing a source code can be used to find alternate uses of the source code, such as to detect unauthorized replication of the source code where it wasn't intended to be used, or to reveal how a competitors product was built.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt; This process is commonly used for [[Software cracking|"cracking" software and media]] to remove their [[copy protection]],&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|7}} or to create a (possibly improved) [[Copying|copy]] or even a [[knockoff]], which is usually the goal of a competitor or a hacker.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|8}} [[Malware]] developers often use reverse engineering techniques to find vulnerabilities in an [[operating system]] (OS), in order build a [[computer virus]] that can exploit the system vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Reverse engineering is also being used in [[cryptanalysis]] in order to find vulnerabilities in [[substitution cipher]], [[symmetric-key algorithm]] or [[public-key cryptography]].&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

* '''Interfacing'''. Reverse engineering can be used when a system is required to interface to another system and how both systems would negotiate is to be established. Such requirements typically exist for [[interoperability]].
* '''Military or commercial [[espionage]]'''. Learning about an enemy’s or competitor’s latest research by stealing or capturing a prototype and dismantling it, which may result in development of similar product, or a better countermeasure against it.
* '''Obsolescence'''. [[Integrated circuit]]s are often designed on proprietary systems, and built on production lines which become obsolete in only a few years.  When systems using these parts can no longer be maintained (since the parts are no longer made), the only way to incorporate the functionality into new technology is to reverse engineer the existing chip and then [[Remake (computing)|redesign]] it using newer tools, using the understanding gained as a guide. Another obsolescence originated problem which can be solved by reverse engineering is the need to support (maintenance and supply for continuous operation) existing, legacy devices which are no longer supported by their [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM). This problem is particularly critical in military operations.
* '''Product security analysis'''. To examine how a product works, what are specifications of its components, estimate costs and identify potential [[patent infringement]]. Acquiring sensitive data by disassembling and analysing the design of a system component.&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; Another intent may be to remove [[copy protection]], or circumvention of access restrictions.
* '''Competitive technical intelligence'''. Understand what one's competitor is actually doing, versus what they say they are doing.
* '''Saving money''', when one finds out what a piece of electronics is capable of, it can spare a user from purchase of a separate product.
* '''[[Repurposing]]''', when obsolete objects are reused in a different but useful manner.

== Common situations ==
===Reverse engineering of machines===
As [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) has become more popular, reverse engineering has become a viable method to create a 3D virtual model of an existing physical part for use in 3D CAD, [[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]], [[computer-aided engineering|CAE]] or other software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0010-4485(96)00054-1|url=http://ralph.cs.cf.ac.uk/papers/Geometry/RE.pdf|title=Reverse engineering of geometric models–an introduction|year=1997|last1=Varady|first1=T|last2=Martin|first2=R|last3=Cox|first3=J|journal=Computer-Aided Design|volume=29|issue=4|pages=255–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse-engineering process involves measuring an object and then reconstructing it as a 3D model. The physical object can be measured using [[3D scanner|3D scanning]] technologies like [[coordinate-measuring machine|CMMs]], [[3D scanner#Triangulation|laser scanners]], [[3D scanner#Structured light|structured light digitizer]]s, or [[Industrial CT Scanning]] (computed tomography). The measured data alone, usually represented as a [[point cloud]], lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of [[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS]] surfaces, or a [[computer assisted design|CAD]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://haman-co.com|title = Haman Engineering Solutions|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid Modelling is commonly used term when NURBS and [[Solid modeling|Parametric modelling]] are implemented together. Using a combination of geometric and freeform surfaces can provide a powerful method of 3D modelling. Areas of freeform data can be combined with exact geometric surfaces to create a hybrid model. A typical example of this would be the reverse engineering of a cylinder head, which includes freeform cast features, such as water jackets and high tolerance machined areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicaldigital.com/services/reverse-engineering/|title=Reverse Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse engineering is also used by businesses to bring existing physical geometry into digital product development environments, to make a digital 3D record of their own products, or to assess competitors' products. It is used to analyse, for instance, how a product works, what it does, and what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential [[patent]] infringement, etc.

[[Value engineering]] is a related activity also used by businesses. It involves de-constructing and analysing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.

===Reverse engineering of software===
In 1990, [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) defined ''reverse engineering'' as "the process of analyzing a
subject system to identify the system's components and their interrelationships and to create representations of the system in another form or at a higher
level of abstraction", where the "subject system" is the end product of software development. Reverse engineering is a process of examination only: the software system under consideration is not modified (which would make it [[reengineering (software)|re-engineering]] or restructuring). Reverse engineering can be performed from any stage of the product cycle, not necessarily from the functional end product.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"/&gt;

There are two components in reverse engineering: redocumentation and design recovery. Redocumentation is the creation of new representation of the computer code so that it is easier to understand. Meanwhile, design recovery is the using of deduction or reasoning from general knowledge or personal experience of the product in order to fully understand the product functionality.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chikofsky | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Cross | first2 = J. H. | doi = 10.1109/52.43044 
| title = Reverse engineering and design recovery: A taxonomy | journal = IEEE Software | volume = 7 | pages = 13–17 |date=January 1990 | url = http://win.ua.ac.be/~lore/Research/Chikofsky1990-Taxonomy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as "going backwards through the development cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Warden | first=R. | title=Software Reuse and Reverse Engineering in Practice | year=1992 | publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall | location=London, England | pages=283–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the output of the implementation phase (in source code form) is reverse-engineered back to the analysis phase, in an inversion of the traditional [[waterfall model]]. Another term for this technique is [[program comprehension]].&lt;ref name="Nelson96"/&gt; Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE) has been held yearly to explore and expand the techniques of reverse engineering.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE)|url=http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wcre/index.html|website=http://dblp.uni-trier.de|publisher=Computer Science bibliography|accessdate=22 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314150255/http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wcre/index.html|archivedate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE) and automated code generation have contributed greatly in the field of reverse engineering.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;

[[Software anti-tamper]] technology like [[Obfuscation (software)|obfuscation]] is used to deter both reverse engineering and re-engineering of proprietary software and software-powered systems. In practice, two main types of reverse engineering emerge. In the first case, source code is already available for the software, but higher-level aspects of the program, perhaps poorly documented or documented but no longer valid, are discovered. In the second case, there is no source code available for the software, and any efforts towards discovering one possible source code for the software are regarded as reverse engineering. This second usage of the term is the one most people are familiar with. Reverse engineering of software can make use of the [[clean room design]] technique to avoid copyright infringement.

On a related note, [[black box testing]] in [[software engineering]] has a lot in common with reverse engineering. The tester usually has the [[application programming interface|API]], but their goals are to find bugs and undocumented features by bashing the product from outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/3659140732 | title=Reverse Engineering and Testing of Black-Box Software Components: by Grammatical Inference techniques | publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing | author=Shahbaz, Muzammil | year=2012 | isbn=978-3659140730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other purposes of reverse engineering include security auditing, removal of copy protection ("[[software cracking|cracking]]"), circumvention of access restrictions often present in [[consumer electronics]], customization of [[embedded systems]] (such as engine management systems), in-house repairs or retrofits, enabling of additional features on low-cost "crippled" hardware (such as some graphics card chip-sets), or even mere satisfaction of curiosity.

====Binary software====
Binary reverse engineering is performed if source code for a software is unavailable.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt; This process is sometimes termed ''Reverse Code Engineering'', or RCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chuvakin | first=Anton |author2=Cyrus Peikari  | edition=1st | title=Security Warrior | publisher=O'Reilly |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, decompilation of binaries for the [[Java platform]] can be accomplished using Jad. One famous case of reverse engineering was the first non-[[International Business Machines|IBM]] implementation of the [[IBM PC|PC]] [[BIOS]] which launched the historic [[IBM PC compatible]] industry that has been the overwhelmingly dominant computer hardware platform for many years. Reverse engineering of software is protected in the U.S. by the [[fair use]] exception in [[copyright|copyright law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/797533 |authorlink=Pamela Samuelson |first=Pamela |last=Samuelson |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Suzanne |last2=Scotchmer |title=The Law and Economics of Reverse Engineering |volume=111 |journal=[[Yale Law Journal]] |issue= 7|pages=1575–1663 |year=2002 |url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal/content-pages/the-law-and-economics-of-reverse-engineering/|jstor=797533 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samba software]], which allows systems that are not running [[Microsoft Windows]] systems to share files with systems that are, is a classic example of software reverse engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Samba: An Introduction | url=http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/SambaIntro.html | date=2001-11-27 | accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Samba project had to reverse-engineer unpublished information about how Windows file sharing worked, so that non-Windows computers could emulate it. The [[Wine (software)|Wine]] project does the same thing for the [[Windows API]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] is one party doing this for the [[Microsoft Office]] file formats. The [[ReactOS]] project is even more ambitious in its goals, as it strives to provide binary (ABI and API) compatibility with the current Windows OSes of the NT branch, allowing software and drivers written for Windows to run on a clean-room reverse-engineered  [[Free Software]] ([[GPL]]) counterpart.  [[WindowsSCOPE]] allows for reverse-engineering the full contents of a Windows system's live memory including a binary-level, graphical reverse engineering of all running processes.

Another classic, if not well-known example is that in 1987 [[Bell Laboratories]] reverse-engineered the [[Mac OS]] System 4.1, originally running on the Apple [[Macintosh SE]], so they could run it on RISC machines of their own.&lt;ref name="Lee2013"&gt;{{cite book|first=Newton|last=Lee|title=Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness (2nd Edition)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Counterterrorism-Cybersecurity-Total-Information-Awareness/dp/1461472040/|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|date=2013|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Binary software techniques=====
Reverse engineering of software can be accomplished by various methods.
The three main groups of software reverse engineering are
#Analysis through observation of information exchange, most prevalent in protocol reverse engineering, which involves using [[bus analyzer]]s and [[packet sniffer]]s, for example, for accessing a [[computer bus]] or [[computer network]] connection and revealing the traffic data thereon. Bus or network behavior can then be analyzed to produce a stand-alone implementation that mimics that behavior. This is especially useful for reverse engineering [[device driver]]s. Sometimes, reverse engineering on [[embedded system]]s is greatly assisted by tools deliberately introduced by the manufacturer, such as [[JTAG]] ports or other debugging means. In [[Microsoft Windows]], low-level debuggers such as [[SoftICE]] are popular.
#[[Disassembly]] using a [[disassembler]], meaning the raw [[machine language]] of the program is read and understood in its own terms, only with the aid of machine-language [[mnemonic]]s. This works on any computer program but can take quite some time, especially for someone not used to machine code. The [[Interactive Disassembler]] is a particularly popular tool.
#Decompilation using a [[decompiler]], a process that tries, with varying results, to recreate the source code in some high-level language for a program only available in machine code or [[bytecode]].

====Software classification====
Software classification is the process of identifying similarities between different software binaries (for example, two different versions of the same binary) used to detect code relations between software samples. This task was traditionally done manually for several reasons (such as patch analysis for vulnerability detection and [[copyright infringement]]) but nowadays can be done somewhat automatically for large numbers of samples.

This method is being used mostly for long and thorough reverse engineering tasks (complete analysis of a complex algorithm or big piece of software). In general, [[statistical classification]] is considered to be a hard problem and this is also true for software classification, therefore there aren't many solutions/tools that handle this task well.

===Source code===
A number of [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] tools refer to the process of importing and analysing source code to generate UML diagrams as "reverse engineering". See [[List of UML tools]].

Although UML is one approach to providing "reverse engineering" more recent advances in international standards activities have resulted in the development of the [[Knowledge Discovery Metamodel]] (KDM). This standard delivers an ontology for the intermediate (or abstracted) representation of programming language constructs and their interrelationships.  An [[Object Management Group]] standard (on its way to becoming an ISO standard as well), KDM has started to take hold in industry with the development of tools and analysis environments which can deliver the  extraction and analysis of source, binary, and byte code. For source code analysis, KDM's granular standards' architecture enables the extraction of software system flows (data, control, &amp; call maps), architectures, and business layer knowledge (rules, terms, process). The standard enables the use of a common data format (XMI) enabling the correlation of the various layers of system knowledge for either detailed analysis (e.g. root cause, impact) or derived analysis (e.g. business process extraction).  Although efforts to represent language constructs can be never-ending given the number of languages, the continuous evolution of software languages and the development of new languages, the standard does allow for the use of extensions to support the broad language set as well as evolution. KDM is compatible with UML, BPMN, RDF and other standards enabling migration into other environments and thus leverage system knowledge for efforts such as software system transformation and enterprise business layer analysis.

===Reverse engineering of protocols===

[[Communications protocol|Protocols]] are sets of rules that describe message formats and how messages are exchanged (i.e., the protocol [[Finite-state machine|state-machine]]). Accordingly, the problem of protocol reverse-engineering can be partitioned into two subproblems; message format and state-machine reverse-engineering.

The message formats have traditionally been reverse-engineered through a tedious manual process, which involved analysis of how protocol implementations process messages, but recent research proposed a number of automatic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, J. Kannan, and H. J. Wang. Discoverer: Automatic protocol reverse engineering from network traces. In Proceedings of 16th USENIX Security Symposium on USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, M. Peinado, K. Chen, H. J. Wang, and L. Irún-Briz. Tupni: Automatic reverse engineering of input formats. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 391–402. ACM, Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek pages 110-125"&gt;P. M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek, C. Kruegel, and E. Kirda. Prospex: Protocol specification extraction. In Proceedings of the 2009 30th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 110–125, Washington, 2009. IEEE Computer Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these automatic approaches either group observed messages into clusters using various [[Cluster analysis|clustering analyses]], or emulate the protocol implementation tracing the message processing.

There has been less work on reverse-engineering of state-machines of protocols. In general, the protocol state-machines can be learned either through a process of [[offline learning]], which passively observes communication and attempts to build the most general state-machine accepting all observed sequences of messages, and [[online machine learning|online learning]], which allows interactive generation of probing sequences of messages and listening to responses to those probing sequences. In general, offline learning of small state-machines is known to be [[NP-complete]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(78)90562-4|title=Complexity of automaton identification from given data|year=1978|last1=Gold|first1=E|journal=Information and Control|volume=37|issue=3|pages=302–320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while online learning can be done in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Angluin|title= Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples|doi=10.1016/0890-5401(87)90052-6|journal= Information and Computation|volume= 75|issue=2|pages=87–106|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; An automatic offline approach has been demonstrated by Comparetti et al.&lt;ref name="M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek pages 110-125"/&gt; and an online approach by Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;C.Y. Cho, D. Babic, R. Shin, and D. Song. [http://www.domagoj-babic.com/index.php/Pubs/CCS10botnets Inference and Analysis of Formal Models of Botnet Command and Control Protocols], 2010 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other components of typical protocols, like encryption and hash functions, can be reverse-engineered automatically as well. Typically, the automatic approaches trace the execution of protocol implementations and try to detect buffers in memory holding unencrypted packets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/polyglot_ccs07_av.pdf Polyglot: automatic extraction of protocol message format using dynamic binary analysis]. J. Caballero, H. Yin, Z. Liang, and D. Song. Proceedings of the 14th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, p. 317-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse engineering of integrated circuits/smart cards===
Reverse engineering is an invasive and destructive form of analyzing a smart card. The attacker grinds away layer after layer of the smart card and takes pictures with an [[electron microscope]]. With this technique, it is possible to reveal the complete hardware and software part of the smart card. The major problem for the attacker is to bring everything into the right order to find out how everything works. The makers of the card try to hide keys and operations by mixing up memory positions, for example, [[bus scrambling]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rankl, Wolfgang Effing, Smart Card Handbook (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Welz: [https://archive.is/20120724013648/http://www.crypto.rub.de/its_seminar_ws0708.html Smart cards as methods for payment] (2008), Seminar ITS-Security Ruhr-Universität Bochum&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, it is even possible to attach a probe to measure voltages while the smart card is still operational. The makers of the card employ sensors to detect and prevent this attack.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Musker: [http://www.jenkins.eu/articles-general/reverse-engineering.asp Protecting &amp; Exploiting Intellectual Property in Electronics], IBC Conferences, 10 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This attack is not very common because it requires a large investment in effort and special equipment that is generally only available to large chip manufacturers. Furthermore, the payoff from this attack is low since other security techniques are often employed such as shadow accounts.  It is uncertain at this time whether attacks against CHIP/PIN cards to replicate encryption data and consequentially crack PINS would provide a cost effective attack on multifactor authentication.

===Reverse engineering for military applications===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
Reverse engineering is often used by people in order to copy other nations' technologies, devices, or information that have been obtained by regular troops in the fields or by [[military intelligence|intelligence]] operations. It was often used during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]. Well-known examples from WWII and later include:
* [[Jerry can]]: British and American forces noticed that the Germans had gasoline cans with an excellent design. They reverse-engineered copies of those cans. The cans were popularly known as "Jerry cans".
*[[Panzerschreck]]: The Germans captured an American [[Bazooka]] during World War II, and reverse engineered it to create the larger Panzerschreck.
* [[Tupolev Tu-4]]: In 1944, three American [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bombers on missions over [[Japan]] were forced to land in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The Soviets, who did not have a similar strategic bomber, decided to copy the B-29. Within three years, they had developed the Tu-4, a near-perfect copy.
* [[SCR-584 radar]]: copied by [[Soviet Union|USSR]] after the Second World War. Known in the form a few modifications - СЦР-584, Бинокль-Д.
* [[V-2]] rocket: Technical documents for the V2 and related technologies were captured by the Western Allies at the end of the war. The American side focused their reverse engineering efforts via [[operation Paperclip]], which led to the development of the [[PGM-11 Redstone]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |title=Redstone rocket |publisher=centennialofflight.net |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet side used captured German engineers to reproduce technical documents and plans, and work from captured hardware in order to make their clone of the rocket, the [[R-1 (missile)|R-1]]. Thus began the postwar Soviet rocket program that led to the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] and the beginning of the [[space race]].
* [[Vympel K-13|K-13/R-3S]] missile ([[NATO reporting name]] '''AA-2 Atoll'''), a Soviet reverse-engineered copy of the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], was made possible after a Taiwanese AIM-9B hit a Chinese [[MiG-17]] without exploding in September 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chinese Air Force: Evolving Concepts, Roles, and Capabilities", Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs (U.S), by National Defense University Press, pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt; The missile became lodged within the airframe, and the pilot returned to base with what Russian scientists would describe as a university course in missile development.
* [[BGM-71 TOW]] Missile: In May 1975, negotiations between Iran and Hughes Missile Systems on co-production of the TOW and Maverick missiles stalled over disagreements in the pricing structure, the subsequent [[1979 revolution]] ending all plans for such co-production. Iran was later successful in reverse-engineering the missile and are currently producing their own copy: the [[Toophan]].
* China has [[Intellectual property in the People's Republic of China|reversed engineered many examples]] of Western and Russian hardware, from fighter aircraft to missiles and [[HMMWV]] cars.
* During the Second World War, Polish and British cryptographers studied captured German [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|"Enigma"]] message encryption machines for weaknesses. Their operation was then simulated on electro-mechanical devices called "[[Bombe]]s" that tried all the possible scrambler settings of the "Enigma" machines to help break the coded messages sent by the Germans.
* Also during the Second World War, British scientists analyzed and defeated a [[Battle of the Beams|series of increasingly sophisticated radio navigation systems]] being used by the German Luftwaffe to perform guided bombing missions at night. The British countermeasures to this system were so effective that in some cases German aircraft were led by signals to land at RAF bases, believing they were back in German territory.

=== Overlap with patent law===
Reverse engineering applies primarily to gaining understanding of a process or artifact, where the manner of its construction, use, or internal processes is not made clear by its creator.

[[Patent|Patented items]] do not of themselves have to be reverse-engineered to be studied, since the essence of a patent is that the inventor provides detailed public disclosure themselves, and in return [[intellectual property rights|receives legal protection]] of the [[invention]] involved. However, an item produced under one or more patents could also include other technology that is not patented and not disclosed. Indeed, one common motivation of reverse engineering is to determine whether a competitor's product contains [[patent infringement]]s or [[copyright infringement]]s.

==Legality==
===United States===
In the United States even if an artifact or process is protected by [[trade secret]]s, reverse-engineering the artifact or process is often lawful as long as it has been legitimately obtained.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/management-professional-practice/trade-secrets-101 "Trade Secrets 101," Feature Article, March 2011]. ASME. Retrieved on 2013-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse engineering of [[computer software]] in the US often falls under both [[contract law]] as a [[breach of contract]] as well as any other relevant laws. This is because  most [[EULA]]s (end user license agreement) specifically prohibit it, and U.S. courts have ruled that if such terms are present, they override the copyright law which expressly permits it (see ''[[Bowers v. Baystate Technologies]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsystem.edu/ogc/intellectualproperty/baystatevbowersdiscussion.htm Baystate v. Bowers Discussion]. Utsystem.edu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Grant. (2003-06-26) [http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/contract-case-could-hurt-reverse-engineering-337 Contract case could hurt reverse engineering | Developer World]. InfoWorld.

Sec. 103(f) of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201- 17 U.S.C. § 1201 (f)]) says that a person who is in legal possession of a program, is permitted to reverse-engineer and circumvent its protection if this is necessary in order to achieve "interoperability" — a term broadly covering other devices and programs being able to interact with it, make use of it, and to use and transfer data to and from it, in useful ways. A limited exemption exists that allows the knowledge thus gained to be shared and used for interoperability purposes.&lt;ref&gt;The section states:&lt;br&gt;(f) Reverse Engineering.—&lt;br&gt;(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under this title.&lt;br&gt;(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title.&lt;br&gt;(3) The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or violate applicable law other than this section.&lt;br&gt;(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term 「interoperability」 means the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.&lt;/ref&gt;

An objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together. Such an exception to the author's exclusive rights may not be used in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the program.}}

'''Self-abasement''' is voluntary [[self-punishment]] or [[humiliation]] in order to atone for some real or imagined wrongdoing.

Self-abasement might have a [[religious]] aspect for those seeking [[humility]] before [[God]], perhaps in the context of [[monastic]] or [[cenobitic]] lifestyle.

It also has a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] and [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] aspect for those people who enjoy [[erotic humiliation]] and other related [[BDSM]] practices. 

Examples of self-abasement practices include [[self-flagellation]], [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[torture]], [[public humiliation]] (including [[online humiliation]]).

In [[psychology]], self-abasement is associated with [[shame]] (rather than [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]) and involves the reduction of the subject's [[self-esteem]]. The notion of self-abasement can be said to be based in [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Fear may also result in self-abasement.

'''Setsuban Kanri''' (節番管理) is the name of a [[production management]] methodology for make-to-order business companies. More specifically, it indicates a "management system by synchronized process blocks" which had been originally set and implemented as a management model for the control of the manufacturing progress with makers whose products were very much tailored upon the requests of their customers. It is specific to organizations where the production model is one of the following: DTO ("Design-to-order"), ETO ("Engineer-to-order"), ATO ("Assembly-to-order") or MTO ("Make-to-order").

==Origins==

The first applications of this model concerned the [[Japan]]ese [[railway]]s and the aviation industry, which in the operational management of activities had been referring to a block by block workflow progress management system (what is meant literally by the expression "suishin kusei kōtei kanri" 推進区制工程管理).

This one was the root of the so-called [[Oiban kanri]] for series production management, of the [[Seiban kanri]] for discontinuous productions and of the Setsuban Kanri for make-to-order productions. The study and formalization of this threefold approach were run later on by JMA - the [[Japan Management Association]], who could base their work on the most significant industrial experiences to date (such as the application of the oiban kanri at [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]). Besides, they could enrich and tune the methodological contents with specific implementation tools and gave meaningful contributions to the definition of the methodology itself, which was named Setsuban Kanri from the reading of the ideographic characters 節 (setsu = period/temporal unit) and 番 (ban = ordinal number) + 管理 (kanri = management, control).

Employed until the 1970s in many companies operating as make-to-order in [[Japan]], for some decades it has fallen out of practice and knowledge. Since 2006, thanks to the direct initiative of [[Akira Kōdate]], a Japanese engineer who launched it and promoted its application in Italy. Its name had a revival and it is now being adopted by several companies (among machine tools makers especially).

==Basic principles==

The basic principles of the Setsuban Kanri are:

1. ''Awareness of both the "axes" (nijiku kanri 二軸管理) to be managed''.

Make-order productions need a continuous monitoring to grant for integration and fair balance in-between the following:

[[File:Figura setsuban nijiku.jpg|thumb|The double perspective of the ''setsuban kanri'' management approach]]

a. the X axis represents the  made-to-order flow, where attention must be paid to [[quality (business)|quality]], [[cost]], [[time]], and [[customer satisfaction]] issues per each order, throughout all work phases - from the order receipt to the delivery to customer.

b. the Y axis represents the department/function where attention should be paid in managing the load/capacity, know-how and priorities to complete all the orders which go through a single dept./function.

The targets for every order can be achieved only by managing at the same time both axes according to a production plan which allows the various production flows get synchronized one another. Actually, the current [[Project Management]] practices generally result too unbalanced on the X axis; the normal practices of [[production management]], on the contrary, tend to focus almost exclusively to the governance of the Y axis.

[[File:ScreenHunter 02 May. 14 16.59.jpg|thumb|Production Control Board at a machine tool assembly plant]]

2.  ''Synchronization''.

It is like what happens with the Japanese railway system: the on time arrival of trains is not granted by forcing a check on each single train on the run. Instead, it is the result of careful synchronization of the entry and departure of all the trains from/to each railway station. Each train is considered with reference to the train running before and the one to follow. That is to say that the sequence can be effectively managed only by synchronizing the entire system and verifying the consistency among the drawings release plan, the supply plan and the production plan.

3. ''Backward planning starting from point zero''.

Every single order must be planned backwards starting prom a point zero (the point after which it is no longer necessary to have processes monitored because there is a minimum risk of jamming). Choosing a reference time unit called [[Setsuban]] (can be days, weeks, decades or months), a number of time units are accounted for in the calendar and the duration of each stage in the working flow is fixed accordingly, and referred to by using delivery indicators called ''teban'' (see below).

4.  ''The fourfold multilevel planning''.
 
The planning system consists of 4 levels:

a. Level 0 or ''portfolio planning'': all orders to all departments/functions

b. Level 1 or ''make-to-order planning'': each order through all departments

c. Level 2 or ''department planning'': all the orders with each department/function

d. Level 3 or ''block planning'':  plan by block, that is a set of activities related to every single order being realized inside a single department/function.

==Terminology==

'''Workflow progress block''' (Suishin-ku 推進区):

A set of activities realized for a production order within the department or office where a person is clearly identified to be in charge of the correct (qualitative) completion and of meeting the production plan as well.

'''Reference time unit''' (Setsuban 節番):

The unit in which the time available is divided and the basis on which the plan is organized. For simplicity the week  is generally preferred (the work shift or a period of time – e.g. 10 days - can be chosen instead).

'''Delivery turn'''  (Teban手番):

The number showing the moment of time when the object planned should reach or leave a specific division or office (e.g. piece to be worked at dept. Y supposed to get in the dept. at teban 23 and to leave the same department at teban 25).

'''Workflow progress assistant''' (Shinkōin 進行員):

The person in charge of the due progress of the job /activity block in the department where the part/product is being manufactured. It is not necessarily an assigned job role, as it can be performed by the shift leader, by the head of department, by single operators or even by the in-house logistic workforce (e.g. the forklift operator).

'''The management system''' (Suishin kusei kōtei kanri 推進区制工程管理):

The true name of the organizational and managerial system  and the concept the "setsuban kanri" has been referring to from its origins. The term refers to the set of processes, roles, coordination mechanisms and supporting visual tools which allow the management of processes/organizational functions by "blocks of stepping progress (advancement)".

==Tools==

One of the founding principles of Setsuban Kanri is that the work progress control can take place only by combining to electronic tools some visual tools the use of which is the closest possible to the physical place where things happen (e.g. Assembly Dept., R&amp;D office). Four types of tools are used:

• Tools for controlling the quality, cost, time,and customer satisfaction progress over each order for all the y axes

• Tools for managing the workload and capacity, priorities and competences through all the y axes

• Tools for synchronization and portfolio control (e.g. Portfolio plans, aggregated [[Key performance indicator|KPIs]], etc.)

• Tools for the [[know-how]] retrieval and for the execution speed-up of each activity.

==Relationship with other methods of operations management==

The method shares many aspects with the [[Lean Thinking]] techniques. Inspired by the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS), it facilitates the application of the same approach to [[make-to-order]] business companies, while overcoming some of its limits. As a matter of fact, the Setsuban Kanri is adopting approaches which meet the needs of discontinuous production, high product customization and strict cross-relation among the sale, design and production phases.

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of terrorism''' is an emerging field in [[sociology]] seeking to understand [[terrorism]] as a [[social phenomenon]] and how individuals as well as [[State (polity)|states]] respond to such events. It is not to be confused with [[critical terrorism studies]] which sometimes overlaps with the [[psychology of terrorism]].

==History==

===Pre-September 11 attacks===
After the [[September 11 attacks]], there has been a spike of interest in various sociological traditions related to terrorism, such as [[moral panic]], organizational response and media coverage, and [[counter-terrorism]].

The most comprehensive study into the definition of terrorism comes from a study by Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler (2004) who examined 73 definitions of terrorism from 55 articles and concluded that terrorism is: "a politically motivated tactic involving the threat or use of force or violence in which the pursuit of publicity plays a significant role."&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, Weinberg ''et al.'' point out that definitions of terrorism often ignore [[Symbolism of terrorism|symbolic aspects of terrorism]].  Due to its focus on symbolism, sociology has a unique vantage point from which to assess [[Fear|terror]].

===Post-September 11 attacks===
Since the September 11 attacks, Mathieu Deflem ([[University of South Carolina]]), S.E. Costanza ([[Central Connecticut State University]]) and John C. Kilburn Jr. ([[Texas A&amp;M International University]]) are among the sociologists to call for the development of a sub-field in sociology related to terrorism. Common topics that are part of the discourse in the sociology of terrorism include: [[military spending]], counter-terrorism, [[immigration]], privacy issues, and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], where within these contexts questions of power, the definition of terrorism, propaganda, nationality, the media, etc. are being deliberated upon.

Early peer-reviewed literature after the September 11 attacks examined policing and citizen responses to terror during the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It also examined interactions between [[first responder]]s (police, rescue teams, etc.) and communities. Ramirez, Hoopes and Quinlan (2003) rightly predicted that police organizations would change fundamental styles of [[Racial profiling|profiling]] people&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Hoopes and Quinlan 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and police agencies would alter their [[mission statement]]s after the September 11 attacks. There is strong reason to believe that even the smallest of local police agencies are apt to feel some kind of pressure to deal with the issue of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;DeLone 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent work in the sociology of terrorism field is philosophical and reflective and has focused on issues such as moral panic and over-spending after the September 11 attacks. Costanza and Kilburn (2005), in an article entitled ''Symbolic Security, Moral Panic and Public Sentiment: Toward a sociology of Counterterrorism'' argued that the issue of symbolism is of much importance to understanding the war on terror.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza and Kilburn 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Using a classic [[symbolic interactionist]] perspective, they argue that strong public sentiment about the [[homeland security]] issue has driven policy more to superficial threats than real and concrete threats. Others argue that symbolism has led to agency a policy of “[[hypervigilance]]” in agency decision-making that is costly and [[Falsifiability|untestable]].

Some sociologists and legal scholars have contemplated the potential consequences of aggressive (or [[militaristic]]) policing of terror threats that may have negative implications for human rights which are of great interest to sociologists as a matter of [[social justice]].  For instance, in a peer-reviewed article ''Crouching tiger or phantom dragon? Examining the discourse on global cyber-terror'', Helms, Costanza and Johnson (2011) ask if it is possible that media hype at the national level could prompt an unnecessary and systemic over-pursuit of [[cyberterrorism]]. They warn that such overreaction might lead to a "[[killswitch]]" policy which could give the federal government ultimate power over the internet.

Despite the [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] lean of modern sociology; Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik (2011) point out that there are several methodological barbs to effectively and scientifically assessing the effect of homeland security measures.&lt;ref&gt;Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In traditional [[criminology]], the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e., [[Neighborhood Watch|neighborhood watch]], [[gun control]], foot patrols, etc.) is to assess total financial costs against [[clearance rates]] or [[arrest rates]]. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena, measuring arrests would be a naive way to test policy effectiveness.

Another methodological problem in the development of sociology of terrorism as a sub-field is one of finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg et al 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for social scientists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly conceptualize these ideas.

==Three sociological perspectives==

===Structural functionalism===
{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
Functionalism is “the theory that various social institutions and processes in society exists to serve some important (or necessary) function to keep society running.” This sociological perspective draws on the work of sociologists like [[Émile Durkheim]], and gets its name from the idea that the best way to study society is to identify the [[Role|roles]] that different aspects of society play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=29|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deviance (sociology)|Social deviance]], loosely understood, can be taken to mean any "transgression of socially established [[Social norm|norms]]." This can range from the minor–slamming a door in someone's face–to the major–a terrorist act. Thus terrorism is a deviant behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=189|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Functionalism sees terrorism–which is a form of [[crime]]–as a temporary deviation from the normal goings on of society, and is in a way functional to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and  Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sociologist that utilizes structural functionalism would explain the existence of any social phenomena by the function they perform. Therefore, terrorism is functional because it joins individuals together in opposition, and brings a sense of belonging to the group opposing it. This feeling of [[group solidarity]] would help prevent [[Anomie|''anomie'']], which is the stage where people do not need to follow any norms of society in order to survive in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorists, like other criminals, become what is known as a reference point; individuals use a reference point as a standard for evaluation. The norms and rules of society become clearer, and are seen as necessary, in comparison to terrorism. In order to protect the [[Status quo|''status quo'']], society uses terrorism as a way to reassert the importance of social norms in the lives of individuals. Thus individuals see terrorism as a threat to the [[social equilibrium]] and their life in a functioning society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalists believe that social change is required to keep a healthy society. Slow, well-planned, and evolutionary method-types change a healthy society socially. These social changes often come about from a drastic need for change and are preceded by a social shock.  Terrorism brings about a social shock that moves society towards a change in direction that enables it to find new ways in which to protect itself. Functionalists view these new changes as providing society with a healthy and slow-paced [[social change]] that was needed. Terrorism thus becomes an expected and needed shock, and therefore can be seen in a sense to encourage society to change for the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
{{Main|Conflict theories}}
Conflict theory is “the idea that conflict between competing interests is the basic, animating force of social change and society in general." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=30|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conflict theorist generally sees that the control of conflict equals the ability of one group to suppress the group that they are opposing, and that [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] is a technique of defining and maintaining a social order that benefits some at the expense of others.

Conflict theorists view terrorism as a reaction to [[injustice]], which is probably created in the minds of terrorists due to misguidance, illiteracy, or unrealistic goals, and that violent behaviors expressed by terrorist organizations are the result of individual frustration, aggression or showing a readiness to fight. [[Political conflict]] makes people look for ways to explain and solve the problems they are facing. If the conflict is deeply rooted, and the current ideology proves unable to deal with the problems, people begin to turn to other ideologies that can often carry a religious theme to them. This is not to say that all forms of terrorist acts are committed by people that are religious. In 83% of the [[Suicide attack|suicide attackers]] worldwide, between 1980 and 2003, only 43% were identifiably religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorists use violence because they believe that if they did not use violence they would lose a power struggle, which lead many conflict theorists to view it as a weapon of the weak. In [[Iraq]], between March 2003 and February 2006, 443 suicide missions took place with 71% belonging to [[al-Qaeda]]. They justified their actions in religious terms; viewing the [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Shi'a control of Iraq]] as abandoning religious principles. Suicide attacks against the Iraqi regime and its American and British supporters were seen as the means in which to accomplish this. Yet it was only under certain political conditions that suicide bombings spiked. The first condition being that it was in relation with the [[Counter-insurgency|counterinsurgency]] of the American and British militaries. The second being a strategic response to the [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] control becoming more stabilized in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorists do not have the money or the political power that is needed to wage war, so they use terrorism as a means, not a goal, to agitate the government in order to achieve their political objectives.  Before committing an act of terror, a terrorist does not always weigh the cost and benefits of their actions, but rather is reacting from the humiliation and frustration they feel they are being subjected too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism}}
Symbolic interactionism is “a [[Microsociology|micro-level theory]] in which shared meanings, originations, and assumptions form the basic motivations behind peoples’ actions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=31|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symbolic interactionism, [[face-to-face interaction]] creates the social world. Individuals act on perceived meanings that appear to be self-constituting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=32|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group membership is one of the major determinations if individual interpretations of reality, which enables symbolic interactionism to explain crime, and thus terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deviance, which terrorism falls under, can be explained by [[labeling theory]]. Labeling theory is “the belief that individuals subconsciously notice how others see or label them, and their reactions to those labels, over time, form the basis of their [[Self-concept|self-identity]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=206|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social groups]] create rules about what is acceptable behavior for people in society. When a rule is broken, society determines if the act was deviant. A person can only become deviant after a social reaction to an act committed is labeled deviant, and that original act is referred to as the [[primary deviance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=209|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being labeled deviant causes a person to see themselves as deviants, which leads to said person performing more deviant acts, with each act being referred to as [[secondary deviance]]. Secondary deviance can quickly turn into a [[Social stigma|stigma]], which is a label that changes the way people see someone, and how individuals view themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=2011|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to symbolic interactionism, terrorism is treated as learned behaviors. Each person learns how to commit terrorism through interactions with terrorists. Involvement in the group is important in the learning process, and members, upon joining, are resocialized to the group’s version of [[Social reality|reality]]. The best way to accomplish this is to involve new members in terrorist acts, which leads the terrorist organization to become the only reference point for its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and  Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social learning theory plays a part in the [[socialization]] of terroristic behaviors. Learning theory states that a person becomes deviant because of an abundance of definitions that favor deviant behavior versus definitions that are unfavorable to such behaviors. This theory is broken down into four learning mechanisms: differential association, definitions, differential reinforcement, and imitation.

The first learning mechanism is [[differential association]], which refers to "direct association and interaction with others who engage in certain kinds of behaviors or express norms, values, and attitudes supportive of such behavior, as well as indirect association and identification with more distant reference groups." The groups that an individual are differentially associated with provides the context in which the social learning is operated. The greater the priority, intensity, duration, and frequency of the differential association the greater the effect on behavior. Hence, the theory in relation to terrorism is that the stronger someone's connection is towards a terrorist organization the better chance that person has of also exhibiting terroristic behaviors.

The second learning mechanism is definitions. Definitions refer to an "individual's own value and belief system about what is and is not acceptable behavior." These values are learned and reinforced through differential association. There are two types of definitions, general definition and specific definition. General definitions include broad beliefs about conformity that are influenced through conventional means and are often influenced by religious or moral values. Specific definitions are seen as those that align an individual with particular acts of crime. The greater the number of definitions the more likely a person will engage in criminal behavior. So the more definitions an individual has that favor terroristic behavior the greater chance that person has of committing a terroristic acts.

The third learning mechanism is [[differential reinforcement]]. Differential reinforcement "refers to the balance of anticipated or actual rewards and punishments that follow behavior." An individual refraining from committing a crime depends on a balance of past, present, and anticipated future rewards or punishments for their actions. In regards to terrorism, the more direct or indirect social interaction a person has towards terrorism the more likely they are to commit a terroristic act.

The fourth and final learning mechanism is [[imitation]]. "Imitation is the notion that individuals engage in behaviors that they have previously witnessed others doing." The characters being observed, the behaviors that are being witnessed, and the consequences for those behaviors determine how much an individual imitates a behavior. All of these things need to fall into place in order for an individual to imitate a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pauwels|first1=Lieven|last2=Schils|first2=Nele|title=Differential Online Exposure to Extremist Content and Political Violence: Testing the Relative Strength of Social Learning and Competing Perspectives|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=28|pages=1|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09546553.2013.876414|doi=10.1080/09546553.2013.876414|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''strangelet''' is a [[hypothetical particle]] consisting of a [[bound state]] of roughly equal numbers of [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]] [[quark]]s. An equivalent description is that a strangelet is a small fragment of [[strange matter]], small enough to be considered a particle. The size of an object composed of strange matter could, theoretically, range from a few [[Fermi (unit)|femtometers]] across (with the mass of a light nucleus) to arbitrarily large. Once the size becomes macroscopic (on the order of metres across), such an object is usually called a [[strange star]]. The term "strangelet" originates with Edward Farhi and [[Robert Jaffe|R. L. Jaffe]].&lt;ref name = 'Farhi and Jaffe'&gt;E. Farhi and R. Jaffe, "Strange Matter", [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v30/i11/p2379_1 Phys. Rev. D30, 2379 (1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; Strangelets have been suggested as a [[dark matter]] candidate.&lt;ref name='Witten'/&gt;

==Theoretical possibility==

===Strange matter hypothesis===
The known particles with strange quarks are unstable because the strange quark is heavier than the up and down quarks, so strange particles, such as the [[Lambda baryon|Lambda particle]], which contains an up, down, and strange quark, always lose their strangeness, by decaying via the [[weak interaction]] to lighter particles containing only up and down quarks. But states with a larger number of quarks might not suffer from this instability. This is the "strange matter hypothesis" of Bodmer &lt;ref name='Bodmer'&gt;A. Bodmer "Collapsed Nuclei" [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v4/i6/p1601_1 Phys. Rev. D4, 1601 (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edward Witten|Witten]].&lt;ref name='Witten'&gt;E. Witten, "Cosmic Separation Of Phases" [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v30/i2/p272_1 Phys. Rev. D30, 272 (1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, when a large enough number of quarks are collected together, the lowest energy state is one which has roughly equal numbers of up, down, and strange quarks, namely a strangelet. This stability would occur because of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; having three types of quarks, rather than two as in normal nuclear matter, allows more quarks to be placed in lower energy levels.

===Relationship with nuclei===
A nucleus is a collection of a large number of up and down quarks, confined into triplets ([[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s). According to the strange matter hypothesis, strangelets are more stable than nuclei, so nuclei are expected to decay into strangelets. But this process may be extremely slow because there is a large energy barrier to overcome: as the weak interaction starts making a nucleus into a strangelet, the first few strange quarks form strange baryons, such as the Lambda, which are heavy. Only if many conversions occur almost simultaneously will the number of strange quarks reach the critical proportion required to achieve a lower energy state. This is very unlikely to happen, so even if the strange matter hypothesis were correct, nuclei would never be seen to decay to strangelets because their lifetime would be longer than the age of the universe. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Size===
The stability of strangelets depends on their size. This is because of (a) surface tension at the interface between quark matter and vacuum (which affects small strangelets more than big ones), and (b) screening of charges, which allows small strangelets to be charged, with a neutralizing cloud of electrons/positrons around them, but requires large strangelets, like any large piece of matter, to be electrically neutral in their interior. The charge screening distance tends to be of the order of a few femtometers, so only the outer few femtometers of a strangelet can carry charge.&lt;ref&gt;H. Heiselberg, "Screening in quark droplets", [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v48/i3/p1418_1 Phys. Rev. D48, 1418 (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface tension of strange matter is unknown. If it is smaller than a critical value (a few MeV per square femtometer&lt;ref name='screen'&gt;M. Alford, K. Rajagopal, S. Reddy, A. Steiner, "The Stability of Strange Star Crusts and Strangelets", Phys. Rev. D73 114016 (2006) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604134 arXiv:hep-ph/0604134]&lt;/ref&gt;) then large strangelets are unstable and will tend to fission into smaller strangelets (strange stars would still be stabilized by gravity). If it is larger than the critical value, then strangelets become more stable as they get bigger.

==Natural or artificial occurrence==
Although nuclei do not decay to strangelets, there are other ways to create strangelets, so if the strange matter hypothesis is correct there should be strangelets in the universe. There are at least three ways they might be created in nature:

* Cosmogonically, i.e. in the early universe when the [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] confinement phase transition occurred. It is possible that strangelets were created along with the neutrons and protons that form ordinary matter.
* High-energy processes. The universe is full of very high-energy particles ([[cosmic ray]]s). It is possible that when these collide with each other or with neutron stars they may provide enough energy to overcome the energy barrier and create strangelets from nuclear matter. Some identified exotic cosmic ray events, like the [[Price's event]] with very low charge-to-mass ratio could have already registered strangelets.&lt;ref&gt;Shibaji Banerjee, Sanjay K. Ghosh, Sibaji Raha, and Debapriyo Syam, "Can Cosmic Strangelets Reach the Earth?", [http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.1384 Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1384 – Published 14 August 2000, https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0006286]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Cosmic ray impacts. In addition to head-on collisions of cosmic rays, [[ultra high energy cosmic ray]]s impacting on [[Earth's atmosphere]] may create strangelets.

These scenarios offer possibilities for observing strangelets. If there are strangelets flying around the universe, then occasionally a strangelet should hit Earth, where it would appear as an exotic type of cosmic ray. If strangelets can be produced in high-energy collisions, then we might make them at heavy-ion colliders.

===Accelerator production===
At heavy ion accelerators like the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC), nuclei are collided at relativistic speeds, creating strange and antistrange quarks that could conceivably lead to strangelet production. The experimental signature of a strangelet would be its very high ratio of mass to charge, which would cause its trajectory in a magnetic field to be very nearly, but not quite, straight. The [[STAR detector|STAR collaboration]] has searched for strangelets produced at the RHIC,&lt;ref&gt;STAR Collaboration, "Strangelet search at RHIC", [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0511047 arXiv:nucl-ex/0511047]&lt;/ref&gt; but none were found. The [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) is even less likely to produce strangelets,&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"&gt;Ellis J, Giudice G, Mangano ML, Tkachev I, Wiedemann U (LHC Safety Assessment Group) (5 September 2008). "[http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0954-3899/35/11/115004/g8_11_115004.pdf?request-id=1973667e-34da-47a4-b75a-08624558a81b Review of the Safety of LHC Collisions]" (PDF, 586 [[KiB]]).

[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1111112?ln=fr CERN record].&lt;/ref&gt; but searches are planned&lt;ref&gt;A. Angelis ''et al.'', "Model of Centauro and strangelet production in heavy ion collisions", Phys. Atom. Nucl. 67:396-405 (2004) {{arXiv|nucl-th/0301003}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the LHC [[ALICE: A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]] detector.

===Space-based detection===
The [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (AMS), an instrument that is mounted on the [[International Space Station]], could detect strangelets.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sandweiss, "Overview of strangelet searches and Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer: When will we stop searching?" [http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0954-3899/30/1/004 J. Phys. G30:S51-S59 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible seismic detection===
In May 2002, a group of researchers at [[Southern Methodist University]] reported the possibility that strangelets may have been responsible for seismic events recorded on October 22 and November 24 in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;D. Anderson ''et al.'', "Two seismic events with the properties for the passage of strange quark matter through the earth" [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0205089 arXiv:astro-ph/0205089]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors later retracted their claim, after finding that the clock of one of the seismic stations had a large error during the relevant period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0505584 E.T. Herrin ''et al.'', "Seismic Search for Strange Quark Nuggets"]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization#International Monitoring System|International Monitoring System]] being set up to verify the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] (CTBT) after entry into force may be useful as a sort of "strangelet observatory" using the entire Earth as its detector. The IMS will be designed to detect anomalous seismic disturbances down to {{convert|1|ktonTNT|lk=on}} energy release or less, and could be able to track strangelets passing through Earth in real time if properly exploited.

===Impacts on Solar System bodies===
It has been suggested that strangelets of subplanetary i.e. heavy meteorite mass, would puncture planets and other solar system objects, leading to impact (exit) craters which show characteristic features.&lt;ref&gt;Lance Labun, Jeremey Birrell, Johann Rafelski, "Solar System Signatures of Impacts by Compact Ultra Dense Objects",{{arxiv|1104.4572}}[http://inspirehep.net/record/897105]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
If the strange matter hypothesis is correct ''and'' a stable negatively-charged strangelet with a surface tension larger than the aforementioned critical value exists, then a larger strangelet would be more stable than a smaller one. One speculation that has resulted from the idea is that a strangelet coming into contact with a lump of ordinary matter could convert the ordinary matter to strange matter.&lt;ref name='DDH'/&gt;&lt;ref name='BJSW'/&gt;&lt;!-- original suggestion may have been Glashow and De Rujula in Nature--&gt; This "[[ice-nine]]"-like disaster scenario is as follows: one strangelet hits a nucleus, catalyzing its immediate conversion to strange matter. This liberates energy, producing a larger, more stable strangelet, which in turn hits another nucleus, catalyzing its conversion to strange matter. In the end, all the nuclei of all the atoms of Earth are converted, and Earth is reduced to a hot, large lump of strange matter. 

This is not a concern for strangelets in cosmic rays because they are produced far from Earth and have had time to decay to their ground state, which is predicted by most models to be positively charged, so they are electrostatically repelled by nuclei, and would rarely merge with them.&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen, "Intermediate mass strangelets are positively charged", Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 (2000) 4687-4690 (2000) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0008217 arXiv:hep-ph/0008217]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen "Strangelets in Cosmic Rays", for Proceedings of 11th Marcel Grossmann Meeting, Germany, Jul 2006, [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612784 arXiv:astro-ph/0612784]&lt;/ref&gt; But high-energy collisions could produce negatively charged strangelet states which live long enough to interact with the nuclei of ordinary matter.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schaffner-Bielich, C. Greiner, A. Diener, H. Stoecker, "Detectability of strange matter in heavy ion experiments", Phys. Rev. C55:3038-3046 (1997), [https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/9611052 arXiv:nucl-th/9611052]&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger of catalyzed conversion by strangelets produced in heavy-ion colliders has received some media attention,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/Others/Others-Doc-Science&amp;Forteana/+Doc-Science-Astronomy&amp;Cosmology&amp;EarthScience/CouldScientistsCreateABlackHole.htm New Scientist, 28 August 1999: "A Black Hole Ate My Planet"] &lt;!-- ORIGINALLY: http://www.kressworks.com/Science/A_black_hole_ate_my_planet.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[End Day|''Horizon: End Days'']], an episode of the [[BBC]] [[television series]] [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|''Horizon'']]&lt;/ref&gt; and concerns of this type were raised&lt;ref name='DDH'&gt;A. Dar, A. De Rujula, U. Heinz, "Will relativistic heavy ion colliders destroy our planet?", Phys. Lett. B470:142-148 (1999) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9910471 arXiv:hep-ph/9910471]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Wagner, "Black holes at Brookhaven?" and reply by F. Wilzcek, Letters to the Editor, Scientific American July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; at the commencement of the RHIC experiment at Brookhaven, which could potentially have created strangelets. A detailed analysis&lt;ref name='BJSW'&gt;W. Busza, R. Jaffe, J. Sandweiss, F. Wilczek, "Review of speculative 'disaster scenarios' at RHIC", Rev. Mod. Phys.72:1125-1140 (2000) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9910333 arXiv:hep-ph/9910333]&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the RHIC collisions were comparable to ones which naturally occur as cosmic rays traverse the solar system, so we would already have seen such a disaster if it were possible. RHIC has been operating since 2000 without incident. Similar concerns have been raised about the operation of the LHC at [[CERN]]&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Dennis Overbye, Asking a Judge to Save the World, and Maybe a Whole Lot More, NY Times, 29 March 2008 [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/science/29collider.html?ref=us]&lt;/ref&gt; but such fears are dismissed as far-fetched by scientists.&lt;ref name='NYT'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/en/LHC/Safety-en.html|title=Safety at the LHC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Blaizot ''et al.'', "Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC", [http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search?sysno=002372601cer CERN library record] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907004852/http://doc.cern.ch/yellowrep/2003/2003-001/p1.pdf CERN Yellow Reports Server (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a [[neutron star]], the conversion scenario seems much more plausible. A neutron star is in a sense a giant nucleus (20&amp;nbsp;km across), held together by gravity, but it is electrically neutral and so does not electrostatically repel strangelets. If a strangelet hit a neutron star, it could convert a small region of it, and that region would grow to consume the entire star, creating a [[quark star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Astrophys. J.|volume=310|page=261|date=1986|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1986ApJ...310..261A|doi=10.1086/164679|title=Strange stars|last1=Alcock|first1=Charles|last2=Farhi|first2=Edward|last3=Olinto|first3=Angela|bibcode = 1986ApJ...310..261A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate about the strange matter hypothesis==
The strange matter hypothesis remains unproven. No direct search for strangelets in cosmic rays or particle accelerators has seen a strangelet (see references in earlier sections). If any of the objects such as neutron stars could be shown to have a surface made of strange matter, this would indicate that strange matter is stable at zero pressure, which would vindicate the strange matter hypothesis. However there is no strong evidence for strange matter surfaces on neutron stars (see below).

Another argument against the hypothesis is that if it were true, all neutron stars should be made of strange matter, and otherwise none should be.&lt;ref&gt;J. Friedman and R. Caldwell, "Evidence against a strange ground state for baryons", Phys. Lett. B264, 143-148 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Even if there were only a few strange stars initially, violent events such as collisions would soon create many strangelets flying around the universe. Because a single strangelet will convert a neutron star to strange matter, by now all neutron stars would have been converted. This argument is still debated,&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen, "Strangelets as cosmic rays beyond the GZK-cutoff", Phys. Rev. Lett. 90:121102 (2003) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211597 arXiv:stro-ph/0211597]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Balberg, "Comment on 'strangelets as cosmic rays beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff'", Phys. Rev. Lett. 92:119001 (2004), [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403503 arXiv:astro-ph/0403503]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

D71, 014026 (2005) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411538 arXiv:astro-ph/0411538]&lt;/ref&gt; but if it is correct then showing that one neutron star has a conventional nuclear matter crust would disprove the strange matter hypothesis.

Because of its importance for the strange matter hypothesis, there is an ongoing effort to determine whether the surfaces of neutron stars are made of strange matter or nuclear matter. The evidence currently favors nuclear matter. This comes from the phenomenology of [[X-ray burst]]s, which is well explained in terms of a nuclear matter crust,&lt;ref&gt;A. Heger, A. Cumming, D.

[[File:Bore Stroke Ratio Animation.gif|thumb|Bore/Stroke Animation]]
In a [[reciprocating engine|reciprocating piston engine]], the '''stroke ratio''', defined by either '''bore/stroke ratio''' or '''stroke/bore ratio''', is a term to describe the ratio between [[bore (engine)|cylinder bore]] diameter and [[piston]] [[stroke (engine)|stroke]].  This can be used for either an [[internal combustion engine]], where the fuel is burned within the cylinders of the engine, or [[external combustion engine]], such as a [[steam engine]], where the combustion of the fuel takes place ''outside'' the working cylinders of the engine.

A fairly comprehensive yet understandable study of stroke/bore effects was published in ''Horseless Age'', 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ingram|first1=Edward|title=As to the Matter of Stroke|journal=Horseless Age|date=April 1916|volume=37|issue=6 &amp; 7|pages=275, 325|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA275&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 November 2015|ref=WA-37-Stroke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conventions==
In a [[piston engine]], there are two different ways of describing the ''stroke ratio'' of its [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]], namely: ''bore/stroke'' ratio, and ''stroke/bore'' ratio.

===Bore/stroke ratio===
'''Bore/stroke''' is the more commonly used term, with usage in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]].

The diameter of the [[bore (engine)|cylinder bore]] is divided by the length of the [[piston]] [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] to give the ratio.

==Square, oversquare and undersquare engines==
The following terms describe the naming conventions for the configurations of the various bore/stroke ratio:

===Square engine===
A '''square engine''' has equal bore ''and'' stroke dimensions, giving a bore/stroke value of exactly 1:1.

====Square engine examples====

1989 – [[Nissan Motors|Nissan's]] [[Nissan SR engine#SR20DE and SR20De|SR20DE]] is a square engine, with an {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

1990–2010 [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] [[Saab Automobile|B234/B235]] is a square engine, with a {{convert|90.0 x 90.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

1991 – [[Ford Modular engine#4.6 L|Ford's 4.6]] V8 OHC engine has a {{convert|3.552 x 3.543|in|mm|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} bore and stroke. It has been the backbone of Ford V8-powered cars and trucks in different power levels and head designs for two decades.

1995 – The [[BMW]] [[BMW M52|M52]] engine with a displacement of 2793 cubic centimeters is an example of a perfect square engine with an {{convert|84.0 x 84.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

1996 – Jaguar's [[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#4.0 L|AJ-V8]] engine in 4.0-litre form has an 86.0&amp;nbsp;mm bore and stroke.

2000 – [[Mercedes-Benz]] 4.0-litre ({{convert|3.996|L|cc cid|disp=out|comma=5}}) [[Mercedes-Benz OM628/OM629|OM628]] V8 diesel engine is an example of a square engine – with an {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

The [[Volkswagen Group]]'s 2005 [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#W16|W16 engine]] as used in the [[Bugatti Veyron]] also using a {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

The [[Peugeot]] [[Peugeot|XU10]] engine line – with a displacement of 1998 cubic centimeters – is an example of a perfect square engine with an {{convert|86.0x86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

[[Toyota Motors|Toyota's]] [[Toyota JZ engine#2JZ|2JZ]] and [[Toyota U engine#4U|4U]] are square engines, with {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

Honda's J30A engine has an {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

===Oversquare or short-stroke engine===
An engine is described as '''oversquare''' or '''short-stroke''' if its cylinders have a greater bore diameter than its stroke length, giving a bore/stroke ratio greater than 1:1.

An oversquare engine allows for more and larger valves in the head of the cylinder, higher possible rpm by lowering maximum piston ring speed and lower crank stress due to the lower peak piston acceleration for the same engine speed. Due to the increased piston and head surface area, the heat loss increases as the bore/stroke ratio is increased. Thus an excessively high ratio can lead to a decreased thermal efficiency compared to other engine geometries. Because these characteristics favor higher engine speeds, oversquare engines are often tuned to develop peak torque at a relatively high speed. The large size/width of the combustion chamber at ignition can cause increased inhomogeneity in the air/fuel mixture during combustion, resulting in higher emissions.

The reduced stroke length allows for a shorter cylinder and sometimes a shorter connecting rod, generally making oversquare engines less tall  but wider than undersquare engines of similar [[engine displacement]].

====Oversquare engine examples====
Oversquare engines (a.k.a. "short stroke engines") are very common, as they allow higher [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] (and thus more power), without excessive piston speed.

Examples include both Chevrolet and Ford small-block V8s. The [[BMW N45]] gasoline engine has a bore/stroke ratio of 1.167.

[[Flat engine|Horizontally opposed, also known as "Boxer" or "flat", engines]] typically feature oversquare designs since any increase in stroke length would result in twice the increase in overall engine width.  This is particularly so in [[Subaru]]’s front-engine layout, where the steering angle of the front wheels is constrained by the width of the engine. Although oversquare engines have a reputation for being high-strung, {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} low-torque machines, the [[Subaru EJ engine|Subaru EJ181 engine]] develops peak torque at speeds as low as 3200 rpm.

Nissan's [[Nissan SR engine#SR16VE|SR16VE]] engine found in [[Nissan Pulsar]] VZ-R and VZ-R N1 is an oversquare engine with {{convert|86|mm|in|2}} bore and {{convert|68.7|mm|in|2}} stroke, giving it an impressive {{convert|175|-|200|hp|kW|-1}} but relatively small torque of {{convert|119|-|134|lbft|Nm kgm}}

Extreme oversquare engines are found in [[Formula One]] racing cars, where strict rules limit displacement, thereby necessitating that power be achieved through high engine speeds. Stroke ratios approaching 2.5:1 are allowed,{{efn|There is no actual restriction on bore:stroke ratio, but cylinder bores are limited to {{convert|98|mm|in|2|disp=or}} and capacity to {{convert|2400|cm3|cuin}}.}} enabling engine speeds of 18,000 rpm while remaining reliable for multiple races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011F1 Technical Regulations|url=http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/2B2B158DE64879C7C12578C0004B1DF6/$FILE/2011_F1__TECHNICAL_REGULATIONS_30-06-2011.pdf|publisher=FIA|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ducati 1199|Ducati Panigale]] [[motorcycle engine]] is massively oversquare with a bore/stroke ratio of 1.84:1. It was given the name "SuperQuadro" by [[Ducati]], roughly translated as "super-square" from Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1199panigale.ducati.com/en/#|title=Ducati 1199 Panigale - Ducati|author=|date=|website=www.1199panigale.ducati.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[side-valve]] Belgian [[D-Motor LF26]] [[aircraft engine|aero-engine]] has a bore/stroke ratio of 1.4:1.&lt;ref&gt;http://d-motor1.vpweb.be/Price---product-specifications.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Mercedes-Benz M116 engines had a {{convert|92|mm|in|2}} bore and a {{convert|65.6|mm|in|2}} stroke for a 3.5 litre V8.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/mercedes_350SL_technical_specifications.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|undersquare}}Undersquare or long-stroke engine===
An engine is described as '''undersquare''' or '''long-stroke''' if its cylinders have a smaller bore (width, diameter) than its stroke (length of piston travel)  - giving a ratio value of less than 1:1.

At a given engine speed, a longer stroke increases engine friction and increases stress on the crankshaft due to the higher peak piston acceleration. The smaller bore also reduces the area available for valves in the cylinder head, requiring them to be smaller or fewer in number.

Undersquare engines exhibit peak torque at lower rpm than an oversquare engine due to their longer crank throw and high piston speed.

Undersquare engines have become more common lately, as manufacturers push for more and more efficient engines and higher fuel economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://newsroom.toyota.co.jp/en/powertrain2018/engine/|title=2.0-liter Dynamic Force Engine, a New 2.0-liter Direct-injection, Inline 4-cylinder Gasoline Engine |publisher=Toyota |location=Japan |date=26 February 2018 |access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Undersquare engines have a higher volume/surface area ratio, leading to reduced heat loss and higher BSFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/why-0-5-liter-cylinders-will-soon-dominate-automotive-engine-design |title=Why 0.5-Liter Cylinders Will Soon Dominate Automotive-Engine Design |first=Don |last=Sherman |work=Car and Driver |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Undersquare engine examples====
Many inline engines, particularly those mounted transversely in front-wheel-drive cars, utilize an undersquare design. The smaller bore allows for a shorter engine that increases room available for the front wheels to steer. Examples of this include many [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines|Volkswagen]], [[list of Nissan engines|Nissan]], [[list of Honda engines|Honda]], and [[list of Mazda engines|Mazda]] engines. The [[Toyota KR engine#1KR-FE|1KR-FE]]-engine used in the [[Toyota Aygo]], [[Citroën C1]] and [[Peugeot 107]] amongst others is an example of a modern long-stroke engine widely used in [[FF layout]] cars. This engine has a 71&amp;nbsp;mm bore and 84&amp;nbsp;mm stroke giving it a bore/stroke ratio of 0.845:1. Some rear-wheel-drive cars that borrow engines from front-wheel-drive cars (such as the [[Mazda MX-5]]) use an undersquare design.
.

BMW's acclaimed [[BMW M54#S54B32|S54B32]] engine was undersquare ({{convert|91|mm|2}} vs {{convert|87|mm|2}} bore), offering a world record torque-per-litre figure ({{cvt|114|Nm/L|lbft/USgal|disp=comma}}) for normally-aspirated production engines at the time; this record stood until Ferrari unveiled the [[458 Italia]].

Many [[United Kingdom|British]] automobile companies used undersquare designs until the 1950s, largely because of a motor tax system that [[RAC horsepower|taxed cars by their cylinder bore]].  This includes the [[BMC A-Series engine]], and many [[Nissan]] derivatives. The [[Trojan (automobile)|Trojan Car]] used an undersquare, [[split-single|split piston]], [[two stroke]], two cylinder in line engine; this was partly for this tax advantage and partly because its proportions allowed flexing V-shaped connecting rods for the two pistons of each U-shaped cylinder, which was cheaper and simpler than two connecting rods joined with an additional bearing.

The  225&amp;nbsp;cu in (3.7&amp;nbsp;[[litre]]) [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine]] is undersquare, with a {{convert|86|mm|2}} bore and a {{convert|105|mm|2}} stroke (bore/stroke ratio = 0.819:1).

The Ford [[Ford Modular engine#5.4.C2.A0L|5.4L Modular Engine]] features a cylinder bore of 90.1&amp;nbsp;mm (3.552&amp;nbsp;in) and a stroke of 105.8&amp;nbsp;mm (4.165&amp;nbsp;in), which makes a bore/stroke ratio of 0.852:1. Since the stroke is significantly longer than the bore, the SOHC 16V (2-valve per cylinder) version of this engine is able to generate a peak torque of 350&amp;nbsp;lb·ft as low as 2501&amp;nbsp;rpm.

The Willys Jeep  [[Willys Go Devil engine|L134]] and [[Willys Hurricane engine|F134]] engines were undersquare, with a 79.4&amp;nbsp;mm (3.125&amp;nbsp;in) bore and 111.1&amp;nbsp;mm (4.375&amp;nbsp;in) stroke (bore/stroke ratio = 0.714:1).

The [[Dodge Power Wagon]] used a [[straight-six engine|straight-six]] [[Chrysler Flathead engine]] of 230&amp;nbsp;cu in (3.8&amp;nbsp;l) with a bore of {{convert|83|mm|2}} and a stroke of {{convert|117|mm|2}}, yielding a substantially undersquare bore/stroke ratio of 0.709:1.

The 4-litre [[Ford Barra engine#Straight-six engine|Barra Inline 6]] engine from the Australian [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]], uses a 92.21&amp;nbsp;mm bore and 99.31&amp;nbsp;mm stroke, which equates to a 0.929:1 bore-stroke ratio.

The 292 Chevrolet I6 is also undersquare, with a bore of 3.875 in and a stroke of 4.125 in (bore/stroke ratio = 0.939:1).

Mitsubishi's 4G63T engine found primarily in many generations of [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]] is an undersquare engine at 85&amp;nbsp;mm bore x 88&amp;nbsp;mm stroke.

Virtually all piston engines used in military aircraft were long-stroke engines. The PW R-2800, Wright R-3350, [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major]], Rolls-Royce Merlin (1650), Allison V-1710, and Hispano-Suiza 12Y-Z are only a few of more than a hundred examples.

All diesel-powered ships have massively undersquare marine engines.  A [[Wärtsilä]]  [[Wärtsilä-Sulzer RT-flex96-C|two-stroke marine diesel engine]] has a cylinder bore of 960&amp;nbsp;mm (37.8&amp;nbsp;in) and stroke of 2500&amp;nbsp;mm (98.4&amp;nbsp;in), (bore/stroke ratio = 0.384:1).

While most modern [[motorcycle engine]]s are square or oversquare, some are undersquare.  The [[Kawasaki Z1300]]'s [[straight-six engine]] was made undersquare to minimise engine width, more recently, a new [[straight-twin engine]] for the [[Honda NC700 series]] used an undersquare design to achieve better combustion efficiency in order to reduce fuel consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global 700cc Engine for Next-Generation : Technical details|url=http://world.honda.com/Global-700cc-engine/Tech-details/page05.html|work=Honda Worldwide|publisher=Honda Motor Co|accessdate=25 March 2014|page=5|date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garrett|first=Jerry|title=Reality Check From Honda, in Touch With Economics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/automobiles/autoreviews/reality-check-from-honda-in-touch-with-economics.html|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Subtext''' or '''undertone''' is any content of a creative work which is not announced explicitly by the characters or author, but is implicit or becomes something understood by the observer of the work as the production unfolds. Subtext can also refer to the thoughts and motives of the characters which are only covered in an aside. Subtext can also be used to imply controversial subjects without specifically alienating people from the fiction, often through use of [[metaphor]]. Especially in light of their inherently ambiguous and self-referential character, many authors have explicitly used subtexts (or subtexts about subtexts) in humor. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Subtext is content underneath the [[spoken dialogue|dialogue]]. Under dialogue, there can be conflict, [[anger]], [[competition]], [[pride]], showing off, or other implicit ideas and emotions. Subtext is the unspoken thoughts and [[Base motive|motives]] of characters — what they really think and believe. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Subtext is also a frequently used method of subtly inserting social or political commentary into fiction. Subtext is often also inserted in narratives where explicit themes are unable to be shown or expressed due to [[censorship]] or simply interest in appealing to a general audience. Frequently, these subtexts may include a sexual nature or possible references to sexual orientation. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Their inclusion is such so that they are easily overlooked by younger viewers but may be caught by more mature viewers. Subtext also serves to add complexity to a premise that may superficially appeal to younger viewers but may also attract older fans, as is often the case with cartoons, science fiction and fantasy. It also may serve to aid in [[suspension of disbelief]].

Subtext includes information about the period and culture in which the author of a book is writing that may not be deliberately articulated but is conveyed through the text in speech, social customs or historical details. 

A more recently coined term, '''metamessage''' is considered by some authors to be synonymous with subtext.&lt;ref name="Ballon2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Ballon|title=Breathing Life Into Your Characters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2sSIF2PMmEC&amp;pg=PT240|year=2009|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=1-59963-342-6|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevenson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Stevenson|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1112|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|page=1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Metamessage'' is a term more commonly used in the analysis of [[business communication]] rather than of literary works.&lt;ref name="LohmannLohmann2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger A. Lohmann|author2=Nancy Lohmann|title=Social Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JpY07RJXqkC&amp;pg=PT225|year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50261-0|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=June 2015}}

==Definition==
The author [[David Baboulene]], in his practical academic work on story theory, ''The Story Book'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Baboulene| first = David| title = ''The Story Book - Guidance for writers on story creation, optimisation and problem resolution''| edition = 1st| year = 2010| publisher = DreamEngine Media Ltd| isbn = 978-0-9557089-2-3| pages = 256 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines subtext as "the result of any form of gap in knowledge between any of the participants in a story; for example, between the author and a character, between two characters or between the audience and at least one character."

An example occurs in the 1978 movie [[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]. Lois Lane has just met Clark Kent. The subtext is that she has taken an instant dislike to him. At the surface, however, their conversation seems only to solicit and supply information about the existence of others of Clark Kent's type.  "Any more at home like you?" she inquires. "Uh, not really, no", Clark replies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = ''[http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/superman_I_shoot.txt] http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/superman_I_shoot.txt, View source lines 1718-1722''}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Examples ==
In the play ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' by [[Henrik Ibsen]], subtext is important in gaining a greater understanding of the characters, as they cannot always speak freely due to the constrictions of social conventions at the time.

A scene in [[Woody Allen]]'s movie ''[[Annie Hall]]'', in which [[subtitles]] explain the characters' inner thoughts during an apparently innocent conversation, is an example of the subtext of a scene being made explicit.

Victorian novels may feature confining social norms such as strict marriage conventions, taboos against births out of wedlock, inheritance to first born sons, etc., that form the subtext of plot and character. These issues can be deployed unconsciously, as in [[Wilkie Collins]]' "The Woman in White" or as part of a concealed critique of gender politics, as in [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s "Jane Eyre".

In the episode "My Best Friend's Bottom" of the British comedy TV series ''[[Coupling (UK TV series)|Coupling]]'', "Captain Subtext" is a tool used in the narrative to explicitly make the viewers aware of the subtextual message in the dialogue. In it, the dialogue and the subtext have been deliberately made humorous.

Television sci-fi such as the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (both of which implicitly avoided onscreen sexual situations) have often been discussed with respect to certain scenes or lines of dialogue.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Cues for the subtext are sometimes given in the main text in the form of ''intertexts'', which are [[allusion]]s to the themes of other texts. An example is ''[[Blade Runner]]'', which can be interpreted as containing numerous biblical (intertextual) allusions, framing the subtext as a religiously inspired theme—the search for the [[Creator deity|Creator]] and the meaning of life beyond physical existence.&lt;ref name="Danesi2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Danesi|title=Messages, Signs, and Meanings: A Basic Textbook in Semiotics and Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDI4mBnS8OoC&amp;pg=PA142|year=2004|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|isbn=978-1-55130-250-8|page=142|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political use==
Historians have often identified an anticipated future revolution, often without the ruling party's understanding.

Such an example of the power and controversy of subtexts might include the deliverance theme pervasive in the songs, stories, and symbols of the slaves in the United States up through the [[Civil Rights]] era and, perhaps, still today. The slave prayers, with their theme of deliverance, may have seemed subversive, as striking at planter ideology and control &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DhlT0z9DX3cC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=slavery+deliverance+subtext&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sR3Zu9t2Pq&amp;sig=DPczMb3EAQxtXp21ktJfQ0X1lC0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ogy4Us7CEoqihgf86oD4AQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=slavery%20deliverance%20subtext&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtext messages have seen fairly widespread use as a way to combat [[censorship]] in literary works, for example in the former [[Communist bloc]].&lt;ref name="Vianu1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lidia Vianu|title=Censorship in Romania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eDddelzL0oC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1998|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9116-09-2|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is of course much older; e.g. one find works from the [[middle ages]] criticizing the church establishment. Some of these works use a formal technique called ''double structure'' in which the same text can have different (usually antithetical) meanings by reading sentences or verses in two different orders.&lt;ref name="Shuger2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Debora Shuger|title=Censorship and Cultural Sensibility: The Regulation of Language in Tudor-Stuart England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66zotoM7eMsC&amp;pg=PA205|year=2006|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0334-8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metamessage ==
{{see also|meta-communication}}
According to a 2008 [[organizational communication]] textbook, ''meta message'' is a term coined by lawyer [[Gerard Nierenberg]] in his 1995 book ''The Art of Negotiating'' to denote (in the words of the textbook) "those messages that are conveyed between the lines of what we explicitly say or write, possibly due to the purpose, context, or timing of the message and/or the relationship between the people communicating".&lt;ref name="BlundelIppolito2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Blundel|author2=Kate Ippolito|title=Effective Organisational Communication: Perspectives, Principles and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jxrepUBc5wC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2008|publisher=FT Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-273-71375-3|page=10|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also appears in a 1972 book of [[Gregory Bateson]], who suggested a somewhat similar distinction, although in the form of a potentially infinite hierarchy of messages, metamessages, meta-metamessages and so on.&lt;ref name="Bateson1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Bateson|title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HewJbnQmn1gC&amp;pg=PA247|year=1972|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-03905-3|pages=247–248 and 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateson argued that any message needs to be interpreted in the [[Linguistic frame of reference|frame of reference]] established by a superordinate message cueing how the textual message is intended.&lt;ref name="Tannen2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Deborah Tannen]]|title=Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk among Friends|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988515-2|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Wolfe]] points out that Bateson's concepts and terminlogy are rather technical, and are thus commonly misinterpreted. In particular, in Bateson's work the metamessage is the framing message, not the actual (subtext) meaning assigned to the subordinate message in the context of the framing message.&lt;ref name="Wolfe1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Wolfe|title=Marginalized in the Middle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vdSwzN74qgC&amp;pg=PT204|date=January 1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-90517-4|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two decades before introducing the metamessage terminology into his works, Bateson studied by what "mood sign[al]" (his earlier term for metamessage) subordinated messages are interpreted "seriously, jokingly, sarcastically, as gestures of friendliness, as acts of aggression" etc. Invoking [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Theory of Logical Types]], Bateson proposed that for every signal, there is always signal level above it which precisely determines its interpretation. Bateson's theory was however criticized as too rigid and lacking explanatory power for real-world communication phenomena in which signals of any kind (at any level) can be deceitful.&lt;ref name="Jones1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J. Jones|title=Communication and Meaning: An Essay in Applied Modal Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGYoAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-277-1543-2|pages=132–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metamessages can be delivered by a wide variety of means, including [[verbal modifier]]s (like "certainly", "only", "just", etc.),&lt;ref name="McKayDavis2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthew McKay|author2=Martha Davis|author3=Patrick Fanning|title=Messages: The Communication Skills Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XsPAEpOiUgC&amp;pg=PA75|year=2009|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|isbn=978-1-57224-853-3|pages=75–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and—in spoken communication—by [[paralanguage]],&lt;ref name="Lefevre2010"/&gt; e.g. by [[Rhythm#Linguistics|rhythm]] and [[Pitch accent|pitch]].&lt;ref name="McKayDavis2009"/&gt; Metamessages can also be conveyed by [[body language]].&lt;ref name="Lefevre2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michelle Lefevre|title=Communicating with Children and Young People: Making a Difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNv6zH437C0C&amp;pg=PA46|year=2010|publisher=The Policy Press|isbn=978-1-84742-282-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous pipe image from ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'' with the subtitle "ceci n'est pas une pipe" (meaning "this is not a pipe") is sometimes given as an example of metamessage conveyed by paralanguage.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Language, Volume 28, Issues 1-2, J. Benjamins 2004, p. 247, {{doi| 10.1075/sl.28.1.14hai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''swale''' is a shallow channel with gently sloping sides.  A swale may be either natural or human created. Artificial swales are often [[infiltration basin]]s, designed to manage water [[surface runoff|runoff]], filter [[water pollution|pollutants]], and increase rainwater [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC (1999). [http://www.epa.gov/owm/mtb/vegswale.pdf "Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Vegetated Swales."] EPA Document No. 832-F-99-006. September 1999. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722234524/http://www.epa.gov/owm/mtb/vegswale.pdf |date=July 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The swale concept has also been popularized as a [[rainwater harvesting]] and [[soil conservation]] strategy by [[Bill Mollison]], [[Geoff Lawton]] and other advocates of [[permaculture]]. In this context it is usually a water-harvesting ditch on contour, also called a ''contour [[Bunding|bund]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Image:Swale NSG-Eldena Sept-2008 SL271623.JPG|thumb|left|A natural swale]]

Swales as used in permaculture are designed to slow and capture runoff by spreading it horizontally across the landscape (along an [[elevation]] [[contour line]]), facilitating runoff infiltration into the soil.  This type of swale is created by digging a ditch on contour and piling the dirt on the downhill side of the ditch to create a [[berm]]. 

In arid climates, vegetation (existing or planted) along the swale can benefit from the concentration of runoff. Trees and shrubs along the swale can provide shade and mulch which decrease evaporation.

The term swale or "beach swale" is also used to describe long, narrow, usually shallow troughs between ridges or [[sandbar]]s on a beach, that run parallel to the shoreline.&lt;ref&gt;Michigan State University Extension.[http://web1.msue.msu.edu/iosco/openshoreline.htm "Wetlands of the Great Lakes Open Shoreline and Embayed Wetlands."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731181130/http://web1.msue.msu.edu/iosco/openshoreline.htm |date=2010-07-31 }} Retrieved 2009-09-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
System dynamics is a methodology and mathematical modeling technique to frame, understand, and discuss complex issues and problems. Originally developed in the 1950s to help corporate managers improve their understanding of industrial processes, SD is currently being used throughout the public and private sector for policy analysis and design.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

Convenient [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) system dynamics software developed into user friendly versions by the 1990s and have been applied to diverse systems. SD models solve the problem of simultaneity (mutual causation) by updating all variables in small time increments with positive and negative feedbacks and time delays structuring the interactions and control. The best known SD model is probably the 1972 ''[[The Limits to Growth]]''. This model forecast that exponential growth of population and capital, with finite resource sources and sinks and perception delays, would lead to economic collapse during the 21st century under a wide variety of growth scenarios.

System dynamics is an aspect of [[systems theory]] as a method to understand the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the recognition that the structure of any system, the many circular, interlocking, sometimes time-delayed relationships among its components, is often just as important in determining its behavior as the individual components themselves. Examples are [[chaos theory]] and [[social dynamics]]. It is also claimed that because there are often properties-of-the-whole which cannot be found among the properties-of-the-elements, in some cases the behavior of the whole cannot be explained in terms of the behavior of the parts.

==History==
System dynamics was created during the mid-1950s&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, Jay (1971). Counterintuitive behavior of social systems. Technology Review 73(3): 52–68&lt;/ref&gt; by Professor [[Jay Forrester]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1956, Forrester accepted a professorship in the newly formed [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. His initial goal was to determine how his background in science and engineering could be brought to bear, in some useful way, on the core issues that determine the success or failure of corporations. Forrester's insights into the common foundations that underlie engineering, which led to the creation of system dynamics, were triggered, to a large degree, by his involvement with managers at [[General Electric]] (GE) during the mid-1950s. At that time, the managers at GE were perplexed because employment at their appliance plants in Kentucky exhibited a significant three-year cycle. The [[business cycle]] was judged to be an insufficient explanation for the employment instability. From hand simulations (or calculations) of the stock-flow-feedback structure of the GE plants, which included the existing corporate decision-making structure for hiring and layoffs, Forrester was able to show how the instability in GE employment was due to the internal structure of the firm and not to an external force such as the business cycle. These hand simulations were the start of the field of system dynamics.&lt;ref name="UDE"&gt;Michael J. Radzicki and Robert A. Taylor (2008). [http://www.systemdynamics.org/DL-IntroSysDyn/start.htm "Origin of System Dynamics: Jay W. Forrester and the History of System Dynamics"]. In: ''U.S. Department of Energy's Introduction to System Dynamics''. Retrieved 23 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Forrester and a team of graduate students moved the emerging field of system dynamics from the hand-simulation stage to the formal [[computer modeling]] stage. [[Richard Bennett (computer scientist)|Richard Bennett]] created the first system dynamics computer modeling language called SIMPLE (Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations) in the spring of 1958. In 1959, [[Phyllis Fox]] and [[Alexander Pugh]] wrote the first version of
[[DYNAMO (programming language)|DYNAMO]] (DYNAmic MOdels), an improved version of SIMPLE, and the system dynamics language became the industry standard for over thirty years. Forrester published the first, and still classic, book in the field titled ''Industrial Dynamics'' in 1961.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

From the late 1950s to the late 1960s, system dynamics was applied almost exclusively to corporate/managerial problems. In 1968, however, an unexpected occurrence caused the field to broaden beyond corporate modeling. [[John F. Collins]], the former mayor of Boston, was appointed a visiting professor of Urban Affairs at MIT. The result of the Collins-Forrester collaboration was a book titled ''Urban Dynamics''. The [[Urban Dynamics]] model presented in the book was the first major non-corporate application of system dynamics.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

The second major noncorporate application of system dynamics came shortly after the first. In 1970, Jay Forrester was invited by the [[Club of Rome]] to a meeting in Bern, Switzerland. The Club of Rome is an organization devoted to solving what its members describe as the "predicament of mankind"—that is, the global crisis that may appear sometime in the future, due to the demands being placed on the Earth's [[carrying capacity]] (its sources of renewable and nonrenewable resources and its sinks for the disposal of pollutants) by the world's exponentially growing population. At the Bern meeting, Forrester was asked if system dynamics could be used to address the predicament of mankind. His answer, of course, was that it could. On the plane back from the Bern meeting, Forrester created the first draft of a system dynamics model of the world's socioeconomic system. He called this model WORLD1. Upon his return to the United States, Forrester refined WORLD1 in preparation for a visit to MIT by members of the Club of Rome. Forrester called the refined version of the model WORLD2. Forrester published WORLD2 in a book titled [[World Dynamics]].&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

==Topics in systems dynamics==
The elements of system dynamics diagrams are feedback, accumulation of flows into stocks and time delays.

As an illustration of the use of system dynamics, imagine an organisation that plans to introduce an innovative new durable consumer product.  The organisation needs to understand the possible [[market dynamics]] in order to design marketing and production plans.

===Causal loop diagrams===
{{Main article|Causal loop diagram}}
In the system dynamics methodology, a problem or a system (e.g., ecosystem, political system or mechanical system) may be represented as a [[causal loop diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, John D. (2000). Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World. New York: McGraw&lt;/ref&gt; A causal loop diagram is a simple map of a system with all its constituent components and their interactions. By capturing interactions and consequently the feedback loops (see figure below), a causal loop diagram reveals the structure of a system. By understanding the structure of a system, it becomes possible to ascertain a system’s behavior over a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, Donella. (2008). Thinking in Systems: A Primer. Earthscan&lt;/ref&gt;

The causal loop diagram of the new product introduction may look as follows:

[[Image:Adoption CLD.svg|centre|Causal loop diagram of ''New product adoption'' model|frame]]

There are two feedback loops in this diagram.  The positive reinforcement (labeled R) loop on the right indicates that the more people have already adopted the new product, the stronger the word-of-mouth impact.  There will be more references to the product, more demonstrations, and more reviews.  This positive feedback should generate sales that continue to grow.

The second feedback loop on the left is negative reinforcement (or "balancing" and hence labeled B).  Clearly, growth cannot continue forever, because as more and more people adopt, there remain fewer and fewer potential adopters.

Both feedback loops act simultaneously, but at different times they may have different strengths.  Thus one might expect growing sales in the initial years, and then declining sales in the later years. However, in general a causal loop diagram does not specify the structure of a system sufficiently to permit determination of its behavior from the visual representation alone.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G. P. (1986), Problems with causal-loop diagrams. Syst. Dyn. Rev., 2: 158–170. doi:10.1002/sdr.4260020207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock and flow diagrams===
{{Main article|Stock and flow}}
Causal loop diagrams aid in visualizing a system’s structure and behavior, and analyzing the system qualitatively. To perform a more detailed quantitative analysis, a causal loop diagram is transformed to a [[stock and flow]] diagram. A stock and flow model helps in studying and analyzing the system in a quantitative way; such models are usually built and simulated using computer software.

A stock is the term for any entity that accumulates or depletes over time.  A flow is the rate of change in a stock.

[[Image:Simple stock and flow diagram.gif|centre|frame|A flow is the rate of accumulation of the stock]]

In our example, there are two stocks: Potential adopters and Adopters.  There is one flow: New adopters.  For every new adopter, the stock of potential adopters declines by one, and the stock of adopters increases by one.

[[Image:Adoption SFD.png|centre|Stock and flow diagram of ''New product adoption'' model|frame]]

===Equations===
The real power of system dynamics is utilised through simulation.  Although it is possible to perform the modeling in a [[spreadsheet]], there are a [[Comparison of system dynamics software|variety of software]] packages that have been optimised for this.

The steps involved in a simulation are:

*Define the problem boundary
*Identify the most important stocks and flows that change these stock levels
*Identify sources of information that impact the flows
*Identify the main feedback loops
*Draw a causal loop diagram that links the stocks, flows and sources of information
*Write the equations that determine the flows
*Estimate the parameters and initial conditions.  These can be estimated using statistical methods, expert opinion, market research data or other relevant sources of information.&lt;ref name="Sterman2001CMR"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sterman |first=John D. |year=2001 |month= |title=System dynamics modeling: Tools for learning in a complex world |journal=California management review |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=8–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Simulate the model and analyse results.

In this example, the equations that change the two stocks via the flow are:

 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Potential adopters} = \int_{0} ^{t} \mbox{-New adopters }\,dt &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- I don't want to mark up this great contribution, but shouldn't this be something like potential adopters at t(0) - sum(new adopters at t(i))? Yes --&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Adopters} = \int_{0} ^{t} \mbox{New adopters }\,dt &lt;/math&gt;

===Equations in discrete time===
List of all the equations in [[discrete time]], in their order of execution in each year, for years 1 to 15 :

 &lt;math&gt;1) \ \mbox{Probability that contact has not yet adopted}=\mbox{Potential adopters} / (\mbox{Potential adopters } + \mbox{ Adopters}) &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;2) \ \mbox{Imitators}=q \cdot \mbox{Adopters} \cdot \mbox{Probability that contact has not yet adopted}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;3) \ \mbox{Innovators}=p \cdot \mbox{Potential adopters} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4) \ \mbox{New adopters}=\mbox{Innovators}+\mbox{Imitators} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4.1) \ \mbox{Potential adopters}\ -= \mbox{New adopters }&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4.2) \ \mbox{Adopters}\ += \mbox{New adopters }&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\ p=0.03 &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ q=0.4 &lt;/math&gt;

====Dynamic simulation results====
The dynamic simulation results show that the behaviour of the system would be to have growth in ''adopters'' that follows a classic s-curve shape.&lt;br /&gt;
The increase in ''adopters'' is very slow initially, then exponential growth for a period, followed ultimately by saturation.

===Equations in continuous time===
To get intermediate values and better accuracy, the model can run in continuous time: we multiply the number of units of time and we proportionally divide values that change stock levels. In this example we multiply the 15 years by 4 to obtain 60 trimesters, and we divide the value of the flow by 4.&lt;br&gt;
Dividing the value is the simplest with the [[Euler method]], but other methods could be employed instead, such as [[Runge–Kutta methods]].

List of the equations in continuous time for trimesters = 1 to 60 :
*They are the same equations as in the section ''Equation in discrete time'' above, except equations ''4.1'' and ''4.2'' replaced by following :
 &lt;math&gt;10) \ \mbox{Valve New adopters}\ = \mbox{New adopters} \cdot TimeStep &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;10.1) \ \mbox{Potential adopters}\ -= \mbox{Valve New adopters} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;10.2) \ \mbox{Adopters}\ += \mbox{Valve New adopters } &lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt; \ TimeStep = 1/4 &lt;/math&gt;

*In the below stock and flow diagram, the intermediate flow 'Valve New adopters' calculates the equation :
 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Valve New adopters}\ = \mbox{New adopters } \cdot TimeStep &lt;/math&gt;

==Application==
System dynamics has found application in a wide range of areas, for example [[Population dynamics|population]], agriculture&lt;ref&gt;F. H. A. Rahim, N. N. Hawari and N. Z. Abidin, “Supply and demand of rice in Malaysia: A system dynamics approach”, International Journal of Supply Chain and Management, Vol.6, No.4, pp. 234-240, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Ecosystem model|ecological]] and [[Economics|economic]] systems, which usually interact strongly with each other.

System dynamics have various "back of the envelope" management applications. They are a potent tool to:
*Teach [[system thinking]] reflexes to persons being coached
*Analyze and compare assumptions and [[mental model]]s about the way things work
*Gain qualitative insight into the workings of a system or the consequences of a decision
*Recognize archetypes of dysfunctional systems in everyday practice

Computer software is used to [[computer simulation|simulate]] a system dynamics [[model (abstract)|model]] of the situation being studied. Running "what if" simulations to test certain policies on such a model can greatly aid in understanding how the system changes over time.  System dynamics is very similar to [[systems thinking]] and constructs the same [[causal loop diagram]]s of systems with feedback.  However, system dynamics typically goes further and utilises simulation to study the behaviour of systems and the impact of alternative policies.&lt;ref name="SysDynSociety"&gt;[http://www.systemdynamics.org/ System Dynamics Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

System dynamics has been used to investigate resource dependencies, and resulting problems, in product development.&lt;ref name="Repenning:2001kx"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Repenning |first=Nelson P. |year=2001 |month= |title= Understanding fire fighting in new product development |journal= The Journal of Product Innovation Management |volume= 18 |issue=5|pages= 285–300|doi= 10.1016/S0737-6782(01)00099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Repenning:1999ng"&gt;Nelson P. Repenning (1999). ''Resource dependence in product development improvement efforts'', [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] Department of Operations Management/System Dynamics Group, Dec 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A system dynamics approach to  [[macroeconomics]], known as ''[[Minsky (economic simulator)|Minsky]]'',  has been developed by the economist [[Steve Keen]].&lt;ref name="SForge"&gt;&amp;nbsp;[http://sourceforge.net/blog/january-2014-potm/&amp;nbsp;SourceForge]&amp;nbsp;Minsky&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Project of the month January 2014. Interview with Minsky development team. Accessed January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used to successfully model world economic behaviour from the apparent stability of the [[Great Moderation]] to the sudden unexpected [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]].

===Example===
[[Image:Causal Loop Diagram of a Model.png|thumb|600px|center|Causal loop diagram of a model examining the growth or decline of a life insurance company.&lt;ref name ="Tay Feedback"/&gt;]]

The figure above is a causal loop diagram of a system dynamics model created to examine forces that may be responsible for the growth or decline of [[life insurance]] companies in the [[United Kingdom]]. A number of this figure's features are worth mentioning. The first is that the model's negative feedback loops are identified by ''C's'', which stand for ''Counteracting'' loops. The second is that double slashes are used to indicate places where there is a significant delay between causes (i.e., variables at the tails of arrows) and effects (i.e., variables at the heads of arrows). This is a common causal loop diagramming convention in system dynamics. Third, is that thicker lines are used to identify the feedback loops and links that author wishes the audience to focus on. This is also a common system dynamics diagramming convention. Last, it is clear that a decision maker would find it impossible to think through the dynamic behavior inherent in the model, from inspection of the figure alone.&lt;ref name ="Tay Feedback"&gt;Michael J. Radzicki and Robert A. Taylor (2008). [http://www.systemdynamics.org/DL-IntroSysDyn/start.htm "Feedback"]. In: ''U.S. Department of Energy's Introduction to System Dynamics''. Retrieved 23 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example of piston motion ===
# Objective: study of a crank-connecting rod system.&lt;br /&gt; We want to model a crank-connecting rod system through a system dynamic model. Two different full descriptions of the physical system with related systems of equations can be found  [[Piston motion equations#Position|here]] {{en icon}} and [[:fr:Système bielle-manivelle#Équations horaires|here]] {{fr icon}}; they give the same results. In this example, the crank, with variable radius and angular frequency, will drive a piston with a variable connecting rod length.
# System dynamic modeling: the system is now modeled, according to a stock and flow system dynamic logic.&lt;br /&gt; The figure below shows the stock and flow diagram [[Image:TRUE Piston SFD.png|centre|Stock and flow diagram for crank-connecting rod system|frame]]
# Simulation: the behavior of the crank-connecting rod dynamic system can then be simulated.&lt;br /&gt; The next figure is a 3D simulation created using [[procedural animation]]. Variables of the model animate all parts of this animation: crank, radius, angular frequency, rod length, and piston position.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4482">'''UK Kindness Movement''' is a non-monetary, independent organisation that promotes kindness campaigns, initiatives, and resources. It also serves as a [[think tank]] on kindness research.

==History==

It was founded in 2005 by [[Louise Burfitt-Dons]] as an associate campaign of children’s charity [[Act Against Bullying]] to promote their [[Cool to be Kind]] campaign and initiate other pro-social projects and initiatives. Since then it has designed and produced media campaigns across a range of sectors emphasising the importance of [[ethical]] behaviour in modern life.

==Kindness Day UK==
The UK Kindness Movement co-founded [[Kindness Day UK]] [http://www.national-awareness-days.com/national-kindness-day.html]. It was originally celebrated on November 13, the date decreed for World Kindness Day.[http://www.incredibull.com/content/kindness-king] but the date for the UK National Day of Kindness has been moved to March 31. Kindness Day has received a great amount of support from celebrities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Makes Britons Happy? Just a Simple Act of Kindness|publisher=The Daily Express|author=Tim Morgan |accessdate=2010-11-12 |url=http://www.express.co.uk/printer/view/211049/}}&lt;/ref&gt; enterprise, politicians and religious leaders. Supporters include Dame [[Barbara Stocking]] DBE, Chief Executive of Oxfam, The Rt HON Sir [[John Major]] KG CH, [[Russell Brand]], [[Holly Willoughby]] and  Sir [[Stuart Rose]], Chairman of Marks and Spencer, The Rt Hon [[David Blunkett]],  [[Gary Lineker]], Sir [[Alex Ferguson]], [[Vanessa Feltz]], [[Camilla Dallerup]], [[Peter Snow]], [[Jo Brand]], [[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]], [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Alan Titchmarsh]], [[Brian Blessed]], [[Jilly Cooper]], [[Noel Edmonds]], [[Charles Kennedy MP]],  [[Arlene Phillips]], and [[Ruby Wax]]

==Research==
The UK Kindness Movement has been researching the link between kindness and civility. The benefits of kindness are being welcomed since the global economic crisis and findings that more altruistic methods of doing business can be rewarding [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kindness-emotions-psychology]. Acts of kindness are linked to increased serotonin in the recipient of the kindness and the one being kind [http://www.1888articles.com/scientific-research-on-kindness-03ie16p1x7.html] In April 2012 the UKKM published the Good Returns Report, which was the first comprehensive study of the fiscal cost of decreasing kindness on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Returns Report|url=http://www.ukkindnessmovement.org/reports/good_returns_report.htm|work=Louise Burfitt-Dons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
There are many nationwide campaigns to promote kindness. [[Transport for London]] have been collecting stories from people on London Tubes and they are exhibited on trains and in stations [http://art.tfl.gov.uk/actsofkindness]

==Conferences and events==

In April 25, 2009 the UKKM inspired [http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/whats-on.php?event=36118 Kindival], created for the award-winning documentary series Battlefront and [[Channel 4]] led by Tom Robbins. The event took place at the [[Chelsea College of Art]] boosting [[The Kindness Offensive]] as its headline act.

On November 10, 2011, the UK Kindness Movement organised a public conference with the [[Big Society]] Network at [[Somerset House]] to debate the level of kindness in the City. This followed from concern that the London Riots indicated a decline of kindness and civility in modern Britain. A Young Foundation report suggested changes in national and local policy to counteract the drop in moral standards, including a better balance between punitive responses and actions that actively encourage civility.[http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/charm-offensive-oct-2011]

==UK Kindness organisations==

Other UK organisations, which promote acts of kindness include [[The Kindness Offensive]] and [[Kindness UK]].
