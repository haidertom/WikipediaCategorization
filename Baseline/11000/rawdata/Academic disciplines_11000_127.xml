[[Image:Storybus 53.jpg|thumb|220px|The StoryBus in Chicago]]
'''America's Children's Museum on Wheels: StoryBus''' is a children's literacy museum on wheels that visits schools and community events in the [[Chicago area]]. Housed inside a 37-foot Winnebago, the bus promotes reading to students at the [[kindergarten]] and [[pre-k]] levels. Filled with a rotating collection of hands-on interactive exhibits, the StoryBus transports children inside the worlds of favorite children's stories, such as ''[[The Little Red Hen]]'', ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]'', and ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]''.

StoryBus has a special mission to serve low-income children who too often fall behind in the development of reading skills. StoryBus also provides teachers with an arts-based curriculum to reinforce the StoryBus experience and special training institutes for using the curriculum.

Launched in 2000, the StoryBus is a project of the [[Dolores Kohl Education Foundation]]. Members of the [[Kohl McCormick Academy of Outstanding Educators]] present at the institutes, mentor teachers at participating schools, and develop the curriculum materials. [[Merri Dee]] serves on the board.{{clear}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The concept of the oceanic anoxic event (OAE) was first proposed in 1976 by Seymour Schlanger (1927–1990) and geologist Hugh Jenkyns&lt;ref name="HistOfOil-2"&gt;History Channel, "The History of Oil" (2007), Australian Broadcasting System, Inc.&lt;!--may be out of context --&gt;, aired: 2:00-4:00 pm EDST, 2008-07-08; Note: [[Geologist]] Hugh Jenkyns was interviewed in the History Channel's (re: footnote:3 History Channel, "The History of Oil" (2007)) documentary "The History of Oil" and attributed the matching occurrence high in the [[Apennine Mountains]]' meter thick black shale band put together with the findings from the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] as triggering the theory and work that followed from a beginning ca 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and arose from discoveries made by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] (DSDP) in the Pacific Ocean. It was the finding of black carbon-rich shales in Cretaceous sediments that had accumulated on submarine [[volcanic plateau]]s ([[Shatsky Rise]], [[Manihiki Plateau]]), coupled with the fact that they were identical in age with similar deposits cored from the Atlantic Ocean and known from outcrops in Europe - particularly in the geological record of the otherwise limestone-dominated [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]&lt;ref name="HistOfOil-2"/&gt; chain in Italy - that led to the realization that these widespread similar [[stratigraphy|strata]] recorded highly unusual oxygen-depleted conditions in the world ocean during several discrete periods of [[geological time scale|geological time]].

Sedimentological investigations of these organic-rich sediments, which have continued to this day, typically reveal the presence of fine laminations undisturbed by bottom-dwelling fauna, indicating anoxic conditions on the sea floor, believed to be coincident with a low lying poisonous layer of hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; Furthermore, detailed organic [[geochemical]] studies have recently revealed the presence of molecules (so-called biomarkers) that derive from both [[purple sulfur bacteria]]&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; and [[green sulfur bacteria]]: organisms that required both light and free [[hydrogen sulfide|hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)]], illustrating that anoxic conditions extended high into the illuminated upper water column.

There are currently several places on earth that are exhibiting the features of anoxic events on a localized scale such as algal/bacterial blooms and localized "dead zones". [[Dead zone (ecology)|Dead zones]] exist off the East Coast of the United States in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], in the Scandinavian strait [[Kattegat]], the [[Black Sea]] (which may have been anoxic in its deepest levels for millennia, however), in the northern Adriatic as well as a dead zone off the coast of Louisiana. The current{{When|date=May 2016}} surge of [[jellyfish]] worldwide is sometimes regarded as the first stirrings of an anoxic event{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Other marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and [[New Zealand]]. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080814154325.htm]

This is a recent understanding. This picture was only pieced together during the last three decades{{When|date=May 2016}}. The handful of known and suspected anoxic events have been tied geologically to large-scale production of the world's oil reserves in worldwide bands of black [[shale]] in the [[geologic record]]. Likewise the high relative temperatures believed linked to so called "[[super-greenhouse event]]s".&lt;ref

===Euxinia===
{{See also|Phosphorus cycle}}
Oceanic '''anoxic events''' with [[Euxinia|euxinic]] (i.e. sulfidic) conditions have been linked to extreme episodes of volcanic outgassing. Thus, volcanism contributed to the buildup of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, increased global temperatures, causing an accelerated hydrological cycle that introduced nutrients to the oceans to stimulate planktonic productivity. These processes potentially acted as a trigger for euxinia in restricted basins where water-column stratification could develop. Under anoxic to euxinic conditions, oceanic phosphate is not retained in sediment and could hence be released and recycled, aiding continued high productivity.&lt;ref name="Kump 2008" /&gt;

Temperatures throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous are generally thought to have been relatively warm, and consequently dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean were lower than today - making anoxia easier to achieve. However, more specific conditions are required to explain the short-period (less than a million years) oceanic anoxic events. Two hypotheses, and variations upon them, have proved most durable.

One hypothesis suggests that the anomalous accumulation of organic matter relates to its enhanced preservation under restricted and poorly oxygenated conditions, which themselves were a function of the particular geometry of the ocean basin: such a hypothesis, although readily applicable to the young and relatively narrow Cretaceous Atlantic (which could be likened to a large-scale Black Sea, only poorly connected to the World Ocean), fails to explain the occurrence of coeval black shales on open-ocean Pacific plateaus and shelf seas around the world.  There are suggestions, again from the Atlantic, that a shift in oceanic circulation was responsible, where warm, salty waters at low latitudes became hypersaline and sank to form an intermediate layer, at {{convert|500|to|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} depth, with a temperature of {{convert|20|C|F|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|25|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ngeo217"&gt;{{cite journal

|last5=Kuhnert|issue=7|bibcode=2008NatGe...1..453F
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second hypothesis suggests that oceanic anoxic events record a major change in the fertility of the oceans that resulted in an increase in organic-walled plankton (including bacteria) at the expense of calcareous plankton such as [[coccoliths]] and [[foraminifera]].
Such an accelerated flux of organic matter would have expanded and intensified the [[oxygen minimum zone]], further enhancing the amount of organic carbon entering the sedimentary record. Essentially this mechanism assumes a major increase in the availability of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and possibly iron to the phytoplankton population living in the illuminated layers of the oceans.

For such an increase to occur would have required an accelerated influx of land-derived nutrients coupled with vigorous [[upwelling]], requiring major climate change on a global scale. Geochemical data from oxygen-[[isotope]] ratios in carbonate sediments and fossils, and magnesium/calcium ratios in fossils, indicate that all major oceanic anoxic events were associated with thermal maxima, making it likely that global weathering rates, and nutrient flux to the oceans, were increased during these intervals.  Indeed, the reduced solubility of oxygen would lead to phosphate release, further nourishing the ocean and fuelling high productivity, hence a high oxygen demand - sustaining the event through a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="10.1146.2Fannurev.earth.36.031207.124256"/&gt;

Here is another way of looking at oceanic anoxic events.  Assume that the earth releases a huge volume of carbon dioxide during an interval of intense volcanism; global temperatures rise due to the [[greenhouse effect]]; global weathering rates and fluvial nutrient flux increase; organic productivity in the oceans increases; organic-[[Carbon sequestration|carbon burial]] in the oceans increases (OAE begins); carbon dioxide is drawn down due to both burial of organic matter and weathering of silicate rocks (inverse greenhouse effect); global temperatures fall, and the ocean–atmosphere system returns to equilibrium (OAE ends).

In this way, an oceanic anoxic event can be viewed as the Earth’s response to the injection of excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and [[hydrosphere]].  One test of this notion is to look at the age of [[large igneous province]]s (LIPs), the extrusion of which would presumably have been accompanied by rapid effusion of vast quantities of volcanogenic gases such as carbon dioxide.  Intriguingly, the age of three LIPs ([[Karoo-Ferrar]] flood basalt, [[Caribbean large igneous province]], [[Ontong Java Plateau]]) correlates uncannily well with that of the major [[Jurassic]] (early [[Toarcian]]) and Cretaceous (early [[Aptian extinction|Aptian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event|Cenomanian–Turonian]]) oceanic anoxic events, indicating that a causal link is feasible.

==Occurrence==
Oceanic anoxic events most commonly occurred during periods of very warm [[climate]] characterized by high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and mean surface temperatures probably in excess of {{Convert|25|°C}}. The [[Quaternary]] levels, the current [[period (geology)|period]], are just {{Convert|13|°C}} in comparison. Such rises in carbon dioxide may have been in response to a great outgassing of the highly flammable [[natural gas]] (methane) that some call an "oceanic burp".&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt;&lt;ref

|quote=With extreme weather continuing to bite -- hurricanes may increase in power by half a category above today’s top-level Category Five -- world food supplies will be critically endangered. :And: The Eocene greenhouse event fascinates scientists not just because of its effects, which also saw a major mass-extinction in the seas, but also because of its likely cause: [[methane hydrate]]s. This unlikely substance, a sort of ice-like combination of methane and water that is only stable at low temperatures and high pressure, may have burst into the atmosphere from the seabed in an immense '''“ocean burp”''', sparking a surge in global temperatures (methane is even more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide). Today vast amounts of these same methane hydrates still sit on sub-sea continental shelves. As the oceans warm, they could be released once more in a terrifying echo of that methane belch of 55 million years ago.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vast quantities of [[methane]] are normally locked into the Earth's crust on the continental plateaus in one of the many deposits consisting of compounds of [[methane hydrate]], a solid precipitated combination of methane and water much like ice. Because the methane hydrates are unstable, except at cool temperatures and high (deep) pressures, scientists have observed smaller "burps" due to [[tectonic]] events.  Studies suggest the huge release of natural gas&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; could be a major climatological trigger, methane itself being a [[greenhouse gas]] many times more powerful than carbon dioxide.  However, anoxia was also rife during the [[Hirnantian]] (late Ordovician) ice age.

Oceanic anoxic events have been recognized primarily from the already warm [[Cretaceous]] and [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Periods]], when numerous examples have been documented,&lt;ref name="Gronstal 2008"&gt;{{cite web

The [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (PETM), which was characterized by a global rise in temperature and deposition of organic-rich shales in some shelf seas, shows many similarities to oceanic anoxic events.

Typically, oceanic anoxic events lasted for less than a million years, before a full recovery.

==Consequences==
Oceanic anoxic events have had many important consequences. It is believed that they have been responsible for mass [[extinction events|extinctions]] of marine organisms both in the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]].&lt;ref name="10.1146.2Fannurev.earth.36.031207.124256"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = K. M.| first2 = L. R. | title = Oceanic Euxinia in Earth History: Causes and Consequences | url =  | journal = Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 251–288 | year = 2008| last1 = Meyer | doi = 10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256| last2 =    Kump
  |bibcode = 2008AREPS..36..251M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Toarcian and [[Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event]]s correlate with the [[Toarcian turnover|Toarcian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian extinction event]]s of mostly marine life forms. Apart from possible atmospheric effects, many deeper-dwelling marine organisms could not adapt to an ocean where oxygen penetrated only the surface layers.

An economically significant consequence of oceanic anoxic events is the fact that the prevailing conditions in so many Mesozoic oceans has helped produce most of the world's [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves. During an oceanic anoxic event, the accumulation and preservation of organic matter was much greater than normal, allowing the generation of potential petroleum [[source rock]]s in many environments across the globe. Consequently, some 70 percent of oil source rocks are Mesozoic in age, and another 15 percent date from the warm Paleogene: only rarely in colder periods were conditions favorable for the production of source rocks on anything other than a local scale.

===Atmospheric effects===
A model put forward by Lee Kump, Alexander Pavlov and Michael Arthur in 2005 suggests that oceanic anoxic events may have been characterized by upwelling of water rich in highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which was then released into the atmosphere. This phenomenon would probably have poisoned plants and animals and caused mass extinctions. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the hydrogen sulfide rose to the upper atmosphere and attacked the [[ozone layer]], which normally blocks the deadly [[ultraviolet radiation]] of the [[Sun]]. The increased UV radiation caused by this [[ozone depletion]] would have amplified the destruction of plant and animal life. Fossil spores from strata recording the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] show deformities consistent with UV radiation. This evidence, combined with fossil [[Bioindicator|biomarker]]s of [[green sulfur bacteria]], indicates that this process could have played a role in that [[mass extinction]] event, and possibly other extinction events. The trigger for these mass extinctions appears to be a warming of the ocean caused by a rise of carbon dioxide levels to about 1000 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Ocean chemistry effects===
Reduced oxygen levels are expected to lead to increased seawater concentrations of redox-sensitive metals. The reductive dissolution of [[iron]]–[[manganese]] oxyhydroxides in seafloor sediments under low-oxygen conditions would release those metals and associated trace metals. Sulfate reduction in such sediments could release other metals such as [[barium]]. When heavy-metal-rich anoxic deep water entered continental shelves and encountered increased O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, precipitation of some of the metals, as well as poisoning of the local biota, would have occurred. In the late Silurian mid-[[Silurian#Pridoli|Pridoli]] event, increases are seen in the Fe, Cu, As, Al, Pb, Ba, Mo and Mn levels in shallow-water sediment and microplankton; this is associated with a marked increase in the malformation rate in [[chitinozoan]]s and other microplankton types, likely due to metal toxicity.&lt;ref name="Vandenbroucke2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vandenbroucke|first1=T.

==Anoxic events in Earth's history==

===Cretaceous===
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
{{See also|Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event}}
Sulfidic (or euxinic) conditions, which exist today in many [[water bodies]] from [[pond]]s to various land-surrounded [[mediterranean sea]]s&lt;ref
 name="dicdef-1"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mediterranean definition of mediterranean sea]; "6. surrounded or nearly surrounded by land."&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Black Sea]], were particularly prevalent in the [[Cretaceous]] Atlantic but also characterized other parts of the world ocean. In an ice-free sea of these supposed super-greenhouse worlds, oceanic waters were as much as 200 meters higher, in some eras. During the time spans in question, the [[continental plate]]s are believed to have been well separated, and the [[mountain]]s we know today were (mostly) future [[tectonic]] events—meaning the overall landscapes were generally much lower— and even the half super-greenhouse climates would have been eras of highly expedited water erosion&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt;  carrying massive amounts of nutrients into the world oceans fueling an overall explosive population of microorganisms and their predator species in the oxygenated upper layers.

Detailed stratigraphic studies of Cretaceous black shales from many parts of the world have indicated that two oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were particularly significant in terms of their impact on the chemistry of the oceans, one in the early [[Aptian]] (~120 Ma), sometimes called the [[Selli Event]] (or OAE 1a) &lt;ref name="oaedef"&gt;{{cite journal

* Insofar as the Cretaceous OAEs can be represented by type localities, it is the striking outcrops of laminated black shales within the vari-colored claystones and pink and white limestones near the town of Gubbio in the Italian [[Apennines]] that are the best candidates.
* The 1-meter thick black shale at the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary that crops out near Gubbio is termed the ‘Livello Bonarelli’ after the man who first described it in 1891.

More minor oceanic anoxic events have been proposed for other intervals in the Cretaceous (in the [[Valanginian]], [[Hauterivian]], [[Albian]] and [[Coniacian]]–[[Santonian]] stages), but their sedimentary record, as represented by organic-rich black shales, appears more parochial, being dominantly represented in the Atlantic and neighboring areas, and some researchers relate them to particular local conditions rather than being forced by global change.

===Jurassic===
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The only oceanic anoxic event documented from the Jurassic took place during the early [[Toarcian]] (~183 Ma).&lt;ref name="Gronstal 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2008"/&gt; Because no DSDP ([[Deep Sea Drilling Project]]) or ODP ([[Ocean Drilling Program]]) cores have recovered black shales of this age – there being little or no Toarcian ocean crust remaining in the world ocean – the samples of black shale primarily come from outcrops on land.  These outcrops, together with material from some commercial oil wells, are found on all major continents and this event seems similar in kind to the two major Cretaceous examples.

===Paleozoic===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
The boundary between the Ordovician and Silurian periods is marked by repetitive periods of anoxia, interspersed with normal, oxic conditions. In addition, anoxic periods are found during the Silurian.  These anoxic periods occurred at a time of low global temperatures (although {{co2}} levels were high), in the midst of a glaciation.&lt;ref name=Page2007&gt;{{palAss2007|author=Page, A. |author2=Zalasiewicz, J. |author3=Williams, M |last-author-amp=yes |title=Deglacial anoxia in a long-lived Early Palaeozoic Icehouse. |pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeppsson (1990) proposes a mechanism whereby the temperature of polar waters determines the site of formation of downwelling water.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the high latitude waters are below {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, they will be dense enough to sink; as they are cool, oxygen is highly soluble in their waters, and the deep ocean will be oxygenated.  If high latitude waters are warmer than {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, their density is too low for them to sink below the cooler deep waters.  Therefore, thermohaline circulation can only be driven by salt-increased density, which tends to form in warm waters where evaporation is high.  This warm water can dissolve less oxygen, and is produced in smaller quantities, producing a sluggish circulation with little deep water oxygen.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990/&gt;  The effect of this warm water propagates through the ocean, and reduces the amount of {{co2}} that the oceans can hold in solution, which makes the oceans release large quantities of {{co2}} into the atmosphere in a geologically short time (tens or thousands of years).&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;  The warm waters also initiate the [[Clathrate gun hypothesis|release of clathrates]], which further increases atmospheric temperature and basin anoxia.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;  Similar positive feedbacks operate during cold-pole episodes, amplifying their cooling effects.

The periods with cold poles are termed "P-episodes" (short for ''primo''&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and are characterised by [[Bioturbation|bioturbated]] deep oceans, a humid equator and higher weathering rates, and terminated by extinction events - for example, the [[Ireviken event|Ireviken]] and [[Lau event]]s.  The inverse is true for the warmer, oxic "S-episodes" (''secundo''), where deep ocean sediments are typically [[graptolit]]ic black shales.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990/&gt;
A typical cycle of ''secundo-primo'' episodes and ensuing ''event'' typically lasts around 3&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

The duration of events is so long compared to their onset because the positive feedbacks must be overwhelmed.  Carbon content in the ocean-atmosphere system is affected by changes in weathering rates, which in turn is dominantly controlled by rainfall. Because this is inversely related to temperature in Silurian times, carbon is gradually drawn down during warm (high {{co2}}) S-episodes, while the reverse is true during P-episodes.  On top of this gradual trend is overprinted the signal of [[Milankovic cycles]], which ultimately trigger the switch between P- and S- episodes.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

These events become longer during the Devonian; the enlarging land plant biota probably acted as a large buffer to carbon dioxide concentrations.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

The end-Ordovician Hirnantian event may alternatively be a result of algal blooms, caused by sudden supply of nutrients through wind-driven upwelling or an influx of nutrient-rich meltwater from melting glaciers, which by virtue of its fresh nature would also slow down oceanic circulation.&lt;ref name="Lüning2006"&gt;{{cite journal

===Archean and Proterozoic===
It has been thought that through most of Earth's history, oceans were largely oxygen-deficient. During the [[Archean]], euxinia was largely absent because of low availability of [[sulfate]] in the oceans,&lt;ref name="Kump 2008"/&gt; but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.

The attacks were said to be "the biggest single disaster ever to affect the [art] industry".&lt;ref name= "BBC"&gt;{{cite news |date= 5 October 2001|title='Up to' $100m art lost in attacks |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1581737.stm|work= BBC |location= |access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Port Authority]] held an estimated 100 pieces of art work at the World Trade Center Complex, in addition to the seven public works of art that had been created for the World Trade Center, all of which were destroyed or severely damaged.

==Public art==
An estimated $10 million worth of public art was lost due to the collapse of the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

There were seven one-of-a-kind public works of art in the World Trade Center Complex at the time of the attacks:
* ''[[Cloud Fortress]]'' by [[Masayuki Nagare]]
* ''[[The Sphere]]'' by [[Fritz Koenig]]
* ''[[Ideogram (sculpture)|Ideogram]]'' by [[James Rosati]]
* ''[[Bent Propeller]]'' by [[Alexander Calder]]
* ''[[The World Trade Center Tapestry]]'' by [[Joan Miró]] and [[Josep Royo]]
* ''[[Sky Gate, New York]]'' by [[Louise Nevelson]]
* ''[[1993 bombing memorial fountain]]'' by [[Elyn Zimmerman]]

''Ideogram'', ''The World Trade Center Tapestry'', and ''Sky Gate, New York'' were never recovered from the rubble and are presumed destroyed.

''Cloud Fortress'' survived the attack and collapse of the buildings, but was severely damaged and subsequently cleared by rescue workers in the days after the attacks.

''Bent Propeller'' was partially recovered from the rubble. Only a small piece of the 1993 bombing memorial fountain was recovered.

''The Sphere'' was damaged in the attacks, but was refurbished and put on display as a memorial.

In addition to the seven public art works, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] also had approximately 100 pieces of art on the complex, including:
* ''Recollection Pond'', a tapestry by [[Romare Bearden]] [https://www.artsy.net/artwork/romare-bearden-recollection-pond]
* ''Path Mural'' by [[Germaine Keller]]

==Private art collections==
The World Trade Center alone held more than 430 tenants at the time of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/trade.center/tenants1.html |title=List of World Trade Center tenants|website=cnn.com |publisher=CNN |access-date= 1 December 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the decorative art that each office contained, some firms held large corporate art collections.

Three companies held major corporate art collections in the World Trade Center: Fred Alger, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Bank of America. Aside from these three, all other companies in the World trade center kept their artwork in other locations.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===Cantor Fitzgerald===
In addition to losing the most lives in the attack, [[Cantor Fitzgerald]] lost the most artwork. Their offices on the 105th floor of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|North Tower]] housed a gallery called the “Museum in the Sky” which held an estimated 300 casts of [[Rodin]] sculptures.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

Some of the Rodin works were recovered a quarter mile away from Ground Zero, including a bust from ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'', two of the three figures from ''The Three Shades'', and a cast of ''[[The Thinker]]''. After being recovered, ''The Thinker'' cast went missing, possibly due to theft.&lt;ref name="Born" /&gt;

===Citigroup===
The collection of Citigroup, whose office was in [[List of tenants in 7 World Trade Center|
World Trade Center Building 7]], contained 1113 works of art which were all lost on September 11, 2001, according to Suzanne F. W. Lemakis who was the Citigroup Art Curator at the time of the attacks.&lt;ref name="Citigroup1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ifar.org/nineeleven/911_citi1.htm |title=

The Citigroup collection at the World Trade Center consisted of about 75% prints, many of which were mass-produced and were replaceable. Also lost were English and American antique furniture, and Asian porcelains.&lt;ref name="Citigroup2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ifar.org/nineeleven/911_citi2.htm |title=

According to Lemakis, the most expensive painting in Citigroup’s collection was a large mural depicting Wall Street, painted by an unknown designer.&lt;ref name="Citigroup2" /&gt;

===Fred Alger===
Also located in the North Tower, this firm lost a collection of photographs by photographers including [[Cindy Sherman]] and [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]].&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===Bank of America===
Bank of America’s office in the World Trade Center lost over 100 works of art by contemporary artists.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

At the time of the attack, the firm had only five lithographs in its Trade Center office, keeping most of its corporate art collection of over 17,000 works of art at its offices two blocks from the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Born"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Barry|first1=Dan |last2= Rashbaum|first2=William K.|date= 20 May 2002|title=Born of Hell, Lost After Inferno; Rodin Work From Trade Center Survived, and Vanished |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/20/nyregion/born-hell-lost-after-inferno-rodin-work-trade-center-survived-vanished.html|work= New York Times|location= New York City|access-date=1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art studios in the World Trade Center==
The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council had its offices in Building 5 of the World Trade Center, and two studios on the 91st and 92nd floors of [[The North Tower]].  
The Council hosted an artist-in-residency program, called World Views, which hosted 15 artists from around the globe and was supposed to run from May–November 2001. The 15 artists worked in the studios in the North Tower. Nearly all of their artwork was lost in the attack on and subsequent collapse of the towers. At least one of the artists, Jamaican-born sculptor Michael Richards, also died in the attacks. Richards had worked through the night in the towers on an unfinished sculpture, a memorial piece dedicated to the [[Tuskegee Airmen]], which portrayed a pilot riding a burning meteor.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cotter"&gt;{{cite news |last= Cotter|first=Holland |date= 3 December 2001|title=ART REVIEW; The Studios Were Lost, But the Artists Get Their Day |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/03/arts/art-review-the-studios-were-lost-but-the-artists-get-their-day.html|work= New York Times|location= New York City|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "BBC" /&gt;

The council also lost all of its archives that had been in their offices in Building 5.&lt;ref name="Cotter" /&gt;

==Government art collections==
Twenty-four works from the art collections of the [[Army]], [[Navy]], [[Air Force]], and [[Marine Corps]] were destroyed at [[The Pentagon]] by the attack.

Some works from The Pentagon's library were also damaged, but the majority were ultimately restored.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Bridge|first1=Sarah |last2=Kazi |first2=Stastna|date=21 August 2011 |title= 9/11 anniversary: What was lost in the damage|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/9-11-anniversary-what-was-lost-in-the-damage-1.1123528 |work=CBC |access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bam''H I''' (from ''[[Bacillus amyloliquefaciens]]'') is a type II [[restriction endonuclease]], having the capacity for recognizing short sequences (6 b.p.) of DNA and specifically [[Bond cleavage|cleaving]] them at a [[Restriction site|target site]]. This exhibit focuses on the structure-function relations of ''Bam''H I as described by Newman, et al. (1995). ''Bam''H I binds at the [[recognition sequence]] 5'-GGATCC-3', and cleaves these sequences just after the 5'-guanine on each strand. This cleavage results in [[sticky end]]s which are 4 b.p. long. In its unbound form, ''Bam''H I displays a central [[beta sheet|b sheet]], which resides in between [[alpha helix|α-helices]]. ''Bam''H I is an extraordinarily unique molecule in that it undergoes a series of unconventional [[conformational change]]s upon [[DNA recognition]]. This allows the DNA to maintain its normal B-DNA conformation without distorting to facilitate enzyme binding. ''Bam''H I is a symmetric [[Protein dimer|dimer]]. DNA is bound in a large cleft that is formed between dimers; the enzyme binds in a "crossover" manner. Each ''Bam''H I subunit makes the majority of its backbone contacts with the phosphates of a DNA half site but base pair contacts are made between each ''Bam''H I subunit and nitrogenous bases in the major groove of the opposite DNA half site. The protein binds the bases through either direct [[hydrogen bond]]s or water-mediated H-bonds between the protein and every H-bond donor/acceptor group in the major groove. Major groove contacts are formed by atoms residing on the amino-terminus of a parallel 4 helix bundle. This bundle marks the ''Bam''H I dimer interface, and it is thought that the [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]]s of the NH2-terminal atoms on this bundle may contribute to [[electrostatic stabilization]].

==Sites of Recognition Between ''Bam''H I and DNA==
The ''Bam''H I enzyme is capable of making a large number of contacts with DNA. Water-mediated hydrogen bonding, as well as both main-chain and side-chain interactions aid in binding of the ''Bam''H I recognition sequence. In the major groove, the majority of enzyme/DNA contacts take place at the amino terminus of the parallel-4-helix bundle, made up of a4 and a6 from each subunit. Although a6 from each subunit does not enter the DNA major groove, its preceding loops interact with the outer ends of the recognition site. Conversely, a4 from each subunit does enter the major groove in the center of the recognition sequence. A total of 18 bonds are formed between the enzyme and DNA across the 6 base pair recognition sequence (12 direct and 6 water mediated bonds). Arg155 and Asp154 located in a spiral ring before a6 are connected with G:C base pairs outside while the middle G:C pairs are connected with Asp154, Arg122, and Asn116 (direct binding). Hydrogen bonding between water and Asn116 results in binding at A:T base pairs inside (water-mediated binding).&lt;ref name="Tong 621–630"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tong Z, Zhao B, Zhao G, Shang H, Guan Y | title = 2'-O-methyl nucleotide modified DNA substrates influence the cleavage efficiencies of BamHI and BglII | journal = Journal of Biosciences | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 621–30 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25116617 | doi = 10.1007/s12038-014-9466-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As discussed above, the L and R subunits bind in a cross over manner, whereby the R-subunit of ''Bam''H I contacts the left DNA half-site of the recognition sequence. The binding of each ''Bam''H I subunit is precisely the same as its symmetrical partner. The recognition site for ''Bam''H I has a [[palindromic sequence]] which can be cut in half for ease in showing bonds.

&lt;/div&gt;

As of the end of 2010, there were 5 crystal structures of ''Bam''H I in the [[Protein Data Bank]]

== Two-metal Mechanism ==
BamHI, type II restriction endonucleases, often requires divalent metals as cofactors to catalyze DNA cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Alexander J. | last1 = Ninfa | first2 = David P. | last2 = Ballou | first3 = Marilee | last3 = Benore | name-list-format = vanc | title = Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology | date = 2008 | publisher = Wiley | location = Hoboken, N.J. | isbn = 978-0-470-08766-4 | page = 345 | edition = 2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two-metal ion mechanism is one of the possible catalytic mechanisms of BamHI since the BamHI crystal structure has the ability to bind two metal ions at the active site, which is suitable for the classical two-metal ion mechanism to proceed.  Two-metal ion mechanism is the use of two metal ions to catalyze the cleavage reaction of restriction enzyme. BamHI has three critical active site residues that are important for metal catalyst. They are known as Asp94, Glu111 and Glu113. These residues are usually acidic. In the presence of a metal ion, the residues are pointed toward the metal ion. In the absence of metal ions, the residues are pointed outward.  The two metal ions (A and B) are 4.1 apart from each other in the active site and are in-line with these residues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Viadiu H, Aggarwal AK | title = The role of metals in catalysis by the restriction endonuclease BamHI | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 910–6 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9783752 | doi = 10.1038/2352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, when the two metal ions (A and B) are bonded to the active site, they help stabilize a cluster distribution of negative charges localized at the active site created by the leaving of an oxygen atom during the transition state. First, a water molecule will be activated by metal ion A at the active site. This water molecule will act as the attacking molecule attacking the BamHI-DNA complex and thus making the complex negative. Later, another water will bound to metal ion B and donate a proton to the leaving group of complex, stabilizing the build-up of negative charge on the leaving oxygen atom.&lt;ref name="pmid12496295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mordasini T, Curioni A, Andreoni W | title = Why do divalent metal ions either promote or inhibit enzymatic reactions? The case of BamHI restriction endonuclease from combined quantum-classical simulations | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 7 | pages = 4381–4 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12496295 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.C200664200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The function of Ca2+ in the active site of BamHI is known. It is an inhibitor of DNA cleavage, converting BamHI into the pre-reactive state.  This revealed the water molecular is the attacking molecule.  It donates a proton to the leaving group that is bounded to Ca2+ forming a 90o O-P-O bond angles.  If Glu 113 is replaced by lysine, the cleavage is lost since Glu 113 accepts the proton from the attacking water molecule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Biological significance ==
Because of its ability to recognize specific DNA sequence and cleave by a nuclease, ''Bam''H I carries various importances in understanding Type II restriction endonuclease, cloning DNA, and possibly treating certain DNA mutation-derived diseases through genetic therapy.&lt;ref name="Tong 621–630"/&gt; NARP and MILS syndromes, for example, are mitochondrial diseases that can be caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria can recover its functions after the excision of the mutant sequence through restriction endonuclease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexeyev MF, Venediktova N, Pastukh V, Shokolenko I, Bonilla G, Wilson GL | title = Selective elimination of mutant mitochondrial genomes as therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NARP and MILS syndromes | journal = Gene Therapy | volume = 15 | issue = 7 | pages = 516–23 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18256697 | doi = 10.1038/sj.gt.2008.11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262640201_Brain_Emotional_Learning-Inspired_Models Brain Emotional Learning-inspired Models]''' or '''BELiMs''' can be considered as a primary step to take inspiration from emotional systems to form new computational Intelligence (CI)  models. BELIMs have been inspired by [[fear conditioning]] that is one of the emotional systems in [[mammalians]] and is a mechanism by which a [[biological system]] learns how to predict aversive events.&lt;ref&gt;M. Parsapoor, “Brain Emotional Learning-Inspired Models. Licentiate dissertation”, Halmstad University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis behind the development of BELiMs is that "the neural structure of fear conditioning can be considered as a natural system that consists of some components (e.g., the amygdala, thalamus, and the sensory cortex) and whose functionality is fulfilled through interaction among its components. Fear conditioning as a system shows an intelligent behavior by learning how to respond to fear-induced stimuli and thus can be utilized to design new CI models for prediction and decision-making applications" &lt;ref&gt;[2]M.

'''Capillary electrochromatography''' ('''CEC''') is a [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] technique in which the mobile phase is driven through the chromatographic bed by [[electroosmosis]].&lt;ref name="DittmannRozing1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dittmann|first1=Monika M.|last2=Rozing|first2=Gerard P.|title=Capillary electrochromatography — a high-efficiency micro-separation technique|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=744|issue=1–2|year=1996|pages=63–74|issn=00219673|doi=10.1016/0021-9673(96)00382-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CikaloBartle1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cikalo|first1=Maria G.|last2=Bartle|first2=Keith D.|last3=Robson|first3=Mark M.|last4=Myers|first4=Peter|last5=Euerby|first5=Melvin R.|title=Capillary electrochromatography|journal=The Analyst|volume=123|issue=7|year=1998|pages=87–102|issn=00032654|doi=10.1039/a801148f|bibcode=1998Ana...123...87C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capillary electrochromatography is a combination of two analytical techniques, [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] and [[capillary electrophoresis]]. Capillary electrophoresis aims to separate analytes on the basis of their [[mass-to-charge ratio]] by passing a high voltage across ends of a [[capillary tube]], which is filled with the analyte. High-performance liquid chromatography separates analytes by passing them, under high pressure, through a column filled with [[stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]]. The interactions between the analytes and the stationary phase and [[mobile phase]] lead to the separation of the analytes. In capillary electrochromatography capillaries, packed with HPLC stationary phase, are subjected to a high voltage. Separation is achieved by electrophoretic migration of solutes and differential partitioning.

==Principle==
Capillary electrochromatography (CEC) combines the principles used in HPLC and CE. The mobile phase is driven across the chromatographic bed using electroosmosis instead of pressure (as in HPLC). Electroosmosis is the motion of liquid induced by an applied potential across a porous material, capillary tube, membrane or any other fluid conduit. Electroosmotic flow is caused by the [[Coulomb force]] induced by an electric field on net mobile electric charge in a solution. Under [[alkaline]] conditions, the surface [[silanol]] groups of the fused silica will become ionised leading to a negatively charged surface. This surface will have a layer of positively charged ions in close proximity which are relatively immobilised. This layer of ions is called the [[Stern layer]]. The thickness of the double layer is given by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_r\epsilon_0RT}{2cF^2 }} &lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[relative permittivity]] of the medium, ε&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the permittivity of vacuum, R is the [[universal gas constant]], T is the [[absolute temperature]], c is the [[molar concentration]], and F is the [[Faraday constant]]

When an electric field is applied to the fluid (usually via electrodes placed at inlets and outlets), the net charge in the electrical double layer is induced to move by the resulting Coulomb force. The resulting flow is termed electroosmotic flow. In CEC positive ions of the electrolyte added along with the analyte accumulate in the electrical double layer of the particles of the column packing on application of an electric field they move towards the cathode and drag the liquid mobile phase with them.

The relationship between the linear velocity u of the liquid in the capillary and the applied electric field is given by the [[Smoluchowski equation]] as 

:&lt;math&gt; u = \epsilon_r\epsilon_0 \zeta E \eta&lt;/math&gt; 

where ζ is the potential across the Stern layer ([[zeta potential]]), E is the [[electric field strength]], and η is the [[viscosity]] of the solvent.

Separation of components in CEC is based on interactions between the stationary phase and differential electrophoretic migration of solutes.

==Instrumentation==
The components of a capillary electrochromatograph are a sample [[vial]], source and destination vials, a packed capillary, electrodes, a [[high voltage power supply]], a detector, and a data output and handling device. The source vial, destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an aqueous buffer solution. The capillary is packed with stationary phase. To introduce the sample, the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample and then returned to the source vial (sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, or siphoning). The migration of the analytes is then initiated by an electric field that is applied between the source and destination vials and is supplied to the electrodes by the high-voltage power supply. The analytes separate as they migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility, and are detected near the outlet end of the capillary. The output of the detector is sent to a data output and handling device such as an [[integrator]] or computer. The data is then displayed as an [[electropherogram]], which reports detector response as a function of time. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks with different migration times in an [[electropherogram]].

==Advantages==
Avoiding the use of pressure to introduce the mobile phase into the column, results in a number of important advantages. Firstly, the pressure driven flow rate across a column depends directly on the square of the particle diameter and inversely on the length of the column. This restricts the length of the column and size of the particle, particle size is seldom less than 3 micrometer and the length of the column is restricted to 25&amp;nbsp;cm. Electrically driven flow rate is independent of length of column and size. A second advantage of using electroosmosis to pass the mobile phase into the column is the plug-like flow velocity profile of EOF, which reduces the solute dispersion in the column, increasing column efficiency.

[[File:The logo of the Centre for Integrative Bee Research as used since 2010.jpg|thumb|The Ciber Logo]]
The '''Centre for Integrative Bee Research''' ('''CIBER''') is located on the Crawley campus at the [[University of Western Australia]] in [[Perth]]. CIBER conducts basic scientific research into [[honeybee]] reproduction, immunity and ecology and aligns its work with the needs of industrial and governmental partners. CIBER is specifically dedicated to facilitate interdisciplinary research and offers opportunities for scientists to perform collaborative research on honeybees using methods and approaches from [[systems biology]] and [[evolutionary ecology]]. The ultimate goal is to better understand how individual molecules and their interplay are responsible for complex biological process such as sexual reproduction or immunity. Research conducted at CIBER is done in close collaboration with the local [[beekeeping]] industry, notably the Better Bees of Western Australia bee breeding program. The research group consists of 20–30 researchers from all different academic levels as well as representatives from the governmental and honeybee industry sector.  The research group also runs an outreach program and was involved in the making of the theatrical movie ''[[More than Honey]]''.

== History ==

Reports about dramatic declines in a number of global honeybee populations, especially in commercially managed stock, resulted in an inquiry of the Australian Parliament into the future of the Australian honey bee industry. A house standing committee on Primary Industries and Resources finally published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=House of Representatives, Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources|title=More Than Honey: The future of the Australian honey bee and pollination industries |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=/pir/honeybee/report.htm|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 16 June 2008 that summarised the situation of the honeybee industry in Australia.  Among a large number of recommendations, the report identified an urgent need for more research to address existing and future problems of Australian honeybees, the bee industry and recommended a substantial increase in funding for honeybee research. The need for additional and coordinated research into honeybees stimulated in a number of initiatives from Australian researchers and research institutions. However, it became clear that the geographical isolation of Western Australia and the ban to import bees or some bee products into the state requires the buildup of a specific research hub. CIBER was formally set up as the Collaborative Initiative for Bee Research at the [[University of Western Australia]] in 2008 and was renamed in 2011 to Centre for Integrative Bee Research. The name change coincided with the introduction of a new logo, that is currently still in use. In 2017 CIBER shifted its operations from the University of Western Australia to the University of California, Riverside campus.  See http://ciber.ucr.acsitefactory.com/

== Research ==
The interdisciplinary approach is one of the core characteristics of CIBER’s activities, which run along two different gradients: First, CIBER connects several disciplines of research including the molecular and nano sciences, evolutionary biology, and sociobiology, as well as economics. Second, CIBER bridges fundamental and applied sciences by generating new knowledge in areas of practical interest for honeybee industry partners. CIBER uses a number of modern molecular technologies such as [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] to identify molecules involved in physiological processes such as reproduction or immunity. Research conducted at CIBER pioneered a novel scientific field in research known as evolutionary proteomics. The central idea is to understand how evolutionary processes operate on the molecular level. Researchers at CIBER conducted the first large scale analyses of the proteins present in glandular secretions supporting honeybee sperm, such as seminal fluid and spermathecal fluid.

For experimental work, CIBER maintains and breeds its own bee stock of around 60 colonies, kept at an apiary on the campus of the University of Western Australia. During the winter month, most of the bee stock is moved north to overwintering grounds.

CIBER personnel is represented in a number of National boards and councils to provide expertise and advice on issues about honeybees, for example the [http://www.rirdc.gov.au/research-programs/animal-industries/honeybee RIRDC Honeybee Advisory Board], the Primary Producers Committee or the  [http://asianhoneybee.net.au/ Asian Honeybee Transition to Management Scientific Advisory group].

== Collaboration with the honeybee industry ==
A number of research projects are done in collaboration with local beekeepers. To do this, CIBER received funding in 2009 from the [[Australian Research Council]] to conduct research on male honeybee fertility together with '''Better Bees of Western Australia''' as an industry partner. 
Better Bees of Western Australia is a group of 8 commercial beekeepers. Each individual beekeeper owns and maintains some of the 24 bee lineages that are recognized as part of "The Western Australian Bee Breeding Program". The aim of the honey bee breeding program is to maintain a genetic pool of honey bee breeding stock for the WA apiary industry to use in maintaining a healthy population of managed honeybees.
In 2013 CIBER and Better Bees received a second grant from the [[Australian Research Council]] to study the fungal disease Nosema and its interactions with the honeybee immune system.

== CIBER outreach ==
The research and activities of CIBER are communicated to the broader public through an outreach program, which includes the organisation of public lectures and seminars, the showing of bees to the public and in schools and exhibitions, as well as activities during the yearly honeybee week. In 2011, CIBER and the [[Perth]] based museum SciTech organised an exhibition "The Science of Honeybees", which initially ran for 6 months at SciTech, then toured through schools and libraries in Western Australia. The success of the exhibition insipired plans for a permanent CIBER - Honeybee exhibition at [[Scitech|SciTech]], which was scheduled to open in 2013.
CIBER also maintains its own [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Centre-for-Integrative-Bee-Research-CIBER/107607792730734 facebook page], which allows interested users to follow ongoing activities at CIBER as well as get updated information on honeybees in general.
CIBER is also involved in organisation of the yearly Honey Week, which is held annually in May. Honey week is an Australia-wide initiative to showcase bees and beekeeping to the public.
The outreach activities of CIBER were awarded with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140923093546/http://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/science/ScienceAwards/Pages/2014Winners.aspx Premier's Science Award] of Western Australia in 2014, acknowledging its success in raising community awareness about the importance of honeybees in the environment.

== ''More than Honey'' movie==
CIBER was involved in the making of the theatrical documentary ''[[More than Honey]]'' by Swiss film maker [[Markus Imhoof]], which was released into several European movie theatres in 2012. The group provided scientific advisory for the film, and some of the research conducted at CIBER is featured in the film. The movie had its world premiere on 11 August 2012, concluding the [[Locarno film festival]] in Switzerland and was later on shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF) in September 2012. The documentary was the most successful Swiss film of 2012 and is the most successful Swiss documentary movie of all time. The movie was awarded more than 25 international prizes such as the German and Swiss Film Awards for best documentary, and became the Swiss candidate for a nomination in the category of Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards (Oscar) . CIBER actively promoted screenings of the movie in Australia as part of the [http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/fia/ffg/fil/fuef/enindex.htm German Film Festival] and maintains the official [http://www.ciber.science.uwa.edu.au/blog/ English] and [http://www.ciber.science.uwa.edu.au/blog/?lang=de German] blog of the movie.

== Future Bees Fund ==

For fund raising purposes and in order to finance activities such as bee research, beekeeping and outreach activities, CIBER set up the [http://www.futurebeesfund.org Future Bees Fund] in 2013, which is a non-profit fund located at the University of Western Australia. A board consisting of representatives from research and the bee keeping industry decides on the usage of funds available and to help publicise the fund activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3124">[[Image:Coleoptile.png|thumb|Schematic image of wheat coleoptile (above) and flag leaf (below).]]
'''Coleoptile''' is the pointed protective sheath covering the emerging shoot in [[monocotyledons]] such as grasses.  Coleoptiles have two vascular bundles, one on either side.  Unlike the flag leaves rolled up within, the pre-emergent coleoptile does not accumulate significant protochlorophyll or carotenoids, and so it is generally very pale.  Some preemergent coleoptiles do, however, accumulate purple anthocyanin pigments.

[[Coleoptiles]] consist of very similar cells that are all specialised to fast stretch growth. They do not divide, but increase in size as they accumulate more water. Coleoptiles also have water vessels (frequently two) along the axis to provide a water supply.

When a coleoptile reaches the surface, it stops growing and the flag leaves penetrate its top, continuing to grow along. The wheat coleoptile is most developed in the third day of the germination (if in the darkness).

==Tropisms==
Early experiments on [[phototropism]] using coleoptiles suggested that plants grow towards light because [[plant cell]]s on the darker side elongate more than those on the lighter side. In 1880 [[Charles Darwin]] and his son [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] found that coleoptiles only bend towards the light when their tips are exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. R. (1880). ''The Power of Movement in Plants''. London: Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the tips must contain the [[photoreceptor cell]]s although the bending takes place lower down on the shoot.  A chemical messenger or [[hormone]] called [[auxin]] moves down the dark side of the shoot and stimulates growth on that side. The natural [[plant hormone]] responsible for phototropism is now known to be [[indoleacetic acid]] (IAA).

The [[Cholodny–Went model]] is named after [[Frits Warmolt Went]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] and the Russian scientist [[N. Cholodny]], who reached the same conclusion independently in 1937. It describes the [[phototropism|phototropic]] and [[gravitropism|gravitropic]] properties of emerging shoots of [[monocotyledon]]s. The model proposes that auxin, a plant growth hormone, is synthesized in the coleoptile tip, which senses light or gravity and will send the auxin down the appropriate side of the shoot. This causes [[symmetry|asymmetric]] growth of one side of the plant. As a result, the plant shoot will begin to bend toward a light source or toward the surface.&lt;ref name="basipetal"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Plant Physiology| title=Basipetal Auxin Transport Is Required for Gravitropism in Roots of Arabidopsis| author=Rashotte|date=February 2000| volume=122| number=2| pages=481–490| doi=10.1104/pp.122.2.481|display-authors=etal| pmc=58885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleoptiles also exhibit strong [[geotropism|geotropic]] reaction, always growing upward and correcting direction after reorientation. Geotropic reaction is regulated by light (more exactly by [[phytochrome]] action).

'''Configurable modularity''' is a term coined by Raoul de Campo of [[IBM Research]] and later expanded on by [[Nate Edwards]] of the same organization, denoting the ability to reuse independent components by changing their interconnections, but not their internals.&lt;ref&gt;N.P. Edwards, ''On the Architectural Requirements of an Engineered System'', IBM Research Report, RC 6688 (#28797), T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 8/18/1977&lt;/ref&gt;  In Edwards' view this characterizes all successful reuse systems, and indeed all systems which can be described as "engineered".

'''Dark matter''' is a [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] form of [[matter]] that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the [[universe]], and about a quarter of [[Universe#Composition|its total energy density]]. The majority of dark matter is thought to be non-[[baryon]]ic in nature, possibly being composed of some as-yet undiscovered [[subatomic particle]]s.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A small portion of dark matter could be baryonic. See [[Baryonic dark matter]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its presence is implied in a variety of [[astrophysical]] observations, including [[gravitation]]al effects that cannot be explained unless more matter is present than can be seen. For this reason, most experts think dark matter to be ubiquitous in the universe and to have had a strong influence on its structure and evolution. The name dark matter refers to the fact that it does not appear to interact with observable [[electromagnetic radiation]], such as [[light]], and is thus invisible (or 'dark') to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]], making it extremely difficult to detect using usual astronomical equipment.&lt;ref name="CERN Dark Matter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.cern/about/physics/dark-matter |title=Dark Matter |website=CERN Physics |date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because dark matter has not yet been observed directly, it must barely interact with ordinary [[baryonic]] matter and radiation. The primary candidate for dark matter is some new kind of [[elementary particle]] that has [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|not yet been discovered]], in particular, [[weakly-interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs), or [[gravitationally-interacting massive particles]] (GIMPs).&lt;ref name="Copi 1995" /&gt; Many experiments to directly detect and study dark matter particles are being actively undertaken, but none has yet succeeded.&lt;ref name="bertone hooper silk" /&gt; Dark matter is classified as cold, warm, or hot according to its [[velocity]] (more precisely, its [[Free streaming|free streaming length]]). Current models favor a [[cold dark matter]] scenario, in which [[structure formation|structures emerge]] by gradual accumulation of particles.

By using these measurements, he estimated the mass of the galaxy, which he determined is different from the mass of visible stars. Lord Kelvin thus concluded that "many of our stars, perhaps a great majority of them, may be dark bodies".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/a-history-of-dark-matter/|title=A history of dark matter|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 [[Henri Poincaré]] in "The Milky Way and Theory of Gases" used "dark matter", or "matière obscure" in French, in discussing Kelvin's work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1933, Swiss astrophysicist [[Fritz Zwicky]], who studied [[groups and clusters of galaxies|galaxy clusters]] while working at the [[California Institute of Technology]], made a similar inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |authorlink=Fritz Zwicky |date=1933 |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |journal=[[Helvetica Physica Acta]] |volume=6 |pages=110–127 |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |authorlink=Fritz Zwicky |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=86 |page=217 |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |doi=10.1086/143864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zwicky |first=F. |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |date=1933 |journal=Helvetica Physica Acta |volume=6 |pages=110–127}} See also {{Citation |last=Zwicky |first=F. |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=86 |page=217 |doi=10.1086/143864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwicky applied the [[virial theorem]] to the [[Coma Cluster]] and obtained evidence of unseen mass that he called ''dunkle Materie'' ('dark matter'). Zwicky estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and compared that to an estimate based on its brightness and number of galaxies. He estimated that the cluster had about 400 times more mass than was visually observable. The gravity effect of the visible galaxies was far too small for such fast orbits, thus mass must be hidden from view. Based on these conclusions, Zwicky inferred that some unseen matter provided the mass and associated gravitation attraction to hold the cluster together. This was the first formal inference about the existence of dark matter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Some details of Zwicky's calculation and of more modern values are given in {{Citation |first=M. |last=Richmond |title=Using the virial theorem: the mass of a cluster of galaxies |url=http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys440/lectures/gal_clus/gal_clus.html |accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwicky's estimates were off by more than an order of magnitude, mainly due to an obsolete value of the [[Hubble constant]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Katherine |last=Freese|title=The Cosmic Cocktail: Three Parts Dark Matter|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=c2B8AgAAQBAJ}}|date=4 May 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5007-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same calculation today shows a smaller fraction, using greater values for luminous mass.

The first robust indications that the [[mass-to-light ratio]] was anything other than unity came from measurements of galaxy rotation curves. In 1939, [[Horace W. Babcock]] reported the rotation curve for the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda nebula]] (known now as the Andromeda Galaxy), which suggested that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases radially.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode=1939LicOB..19...41B |doi=10.5479/ADS/bib/1939LicOB.19.41B |title=The rotation of the Andromeda Nebula |journal=Lick Observatory Bulletins |volume=19 |pages=41–51|year=1939|last1=Babcock|first1=Horace W}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed it to either light absorption within the galaxy or modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to missing matter.

At the same time that Rubin and Ford were exploring optical rotation curves, radio astronomers were making use of new radio telescopes to map the 21&amp;nbsp;cm line of atomic hydrogen in nearby galaxies. The radial distribution of interstellar atomic hydrogen ([[H I region|HI]]) often extends to much larger galactic radii than those accessible by optical studies, allowing the sampling of rotation curves—and thus of the total mass distribution—to a new dynamical regime.

== Technical definition ==
{{see also|Friedmann equations}}
In standard cosmology, matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], i.e., ''ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''. This is in contrast to radiation, which scales as the inverse fourth power of the scale factor '' ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; '', and a [[cosmological constant]], which is independent of ''a''. These scalings can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a cubical box, doubling the length of the sides of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (''2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''). For radiation, the decrease in energy density is larger because an increase in scale factor causes a proportional [[redshift]]. A cosmological constant, as an intrinsic property of space, has a constant energy density regardless of the volume under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf|title=Cosmology: Part III Mathematical Tripos, Cambridge University|author=Daniel Baumann|page=21−22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dark energy]] is a term often used nowadays as a substitute for cosmological constant. It is basically the same except that dark energy might depend on scale factor in some unknown way rather than necessarily being constant.&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, "dark matter" means all components of the universe that are not visible but still obey ''ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''. In practice, the term "dark matter" is often used to mean only the non-baryonic component of dark matter, i.e., excluding "[[missing baryon problem|missing baryons]]." Context will usually indicate which meaning is intended.

=== Galaxy rotation curves ===
{{Main|Galaxy rotation curve}}
[[File:GalacticRotation2.svg|thumb|[[Galaxy rotation curve|Rotation curve]] of a typical spiral galaxy: predicted ('''A''') and observed ('''B'''). Dark matter can explain the 'flat' appearance of the velocity curve out to a large radius.]]
[[File:Comparison of rotating disc galaxies in the distant Universe and the present day.webm|thumb|Models of rotating disc galaxies in the present day (left) and ten billion years ago (right). In the present-day galaxy, dark matter—shown in red—is more concentrated near the center and it rotates more rapidly (effect exaggerated).]]

The arms of [[spiral galaxies]] rotate around the galactic center. The luminous mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the center to the outskirts. If luminous mass were all the matter, then we can model the galaxy as a point mass in the centre and test masses orbiting around it, similar to the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is a consequence of the [[shell theorem]] and the observation that spiral galaxies are spherically symmetric to a large extent (in 2D).&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Kepler's Second Law]], it is expected that the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the center, similar to the Solar System. This is not observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Corbelli E. |author2=Salucci, P. | title=The extended rotation curve and the dark matter halo of M33|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=2000|volume=311|issue=2|pages=441–447 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03075.x|arxiv = astro-ph/9909252 |bibcode = 2000MNRAS.311..441C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the galaxy rotation curve remains flat as distance from the center increases.

If Kepler's laws are correct, then the obvious way to resolve this discrepancy is to conclude that the mass distribution in spiral galaxies is not similar to that of the Solar System. In particular, there is a lot of non-luminous matter (dark matter) in the outskirts of the galaxy.

=== Velocity dispersions ===
{{main|Velocity dispersion}}
Stars in bound systems must obey the [[virial theorem]]. The theorem, together with the measured velocity distribution, can be used to measure the mass distribution in a bound system, such as elliptical galaxies or globular clusters. With some exceptions, velocity dispersion estimates of elliptical galaxies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Faber |first1=S. M. |last2=Jackson |first2=R. E. |date=1976 |title=Velocity dispersions and mass-to-light ratios for elliptical galaxies |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=204 |pages=668–683 |bibcode=1976ApJ...204..668F |doi=10.1086/154215}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not match the predicted velocity dispersion from the observed mass distribution, even assuming complicated distributions of stellar orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last1=Binny|first1=James|last2=Merrifield|first2=Michael|date=1998|title=Galactic Astronomy|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=712-713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with galaxy rotation curves, the obvious way to resolve the discrepancy is to postulate the existence of non-luminous matter.

=== Galaxy clusters ===
[[Galaxy clusters]] are particularly important for dark matter studies since their masses can be estimated in three independent ways:

* From the scatter in radial velocities of the galaxies within clusters
* From [[X-ray]]s emitted by hot gas in the clusters. From the X-ray energy spectrum and flux, the gas temperature and density can be estimated, hence giving the pressure; assuming pressure and gravity balance determines the cluster's mass profile. 
* [[Gravitational lens]]ing (usually of more distant galaxies) can measure cluster masses without relying on observations of dynamics (e.g., velocity).

Generally, these three methods are in reasonable agreement that dark matter outweighs visible matter by approximately 5 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cosmological Parameters from Clusters of Galaxies|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=49|issue=1|pages=409–470|doi=10.1146/annurev-astro-081710-102514|arxiv=1103.4829|bibcode=2011ARA&amp;A..49..409A|year=2011|last1=Allen|first1=Steven W|last2=Evrard|first2=August E|last3=Mantz|first3=Adam B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gravitational lensing ===

One of the consequences of [[general relativity]] is that massive objects (such as a [[galaxy cluster|cluster of galaxies]]) lying between a more distant source (such as a [[quasar]]) and an observer should act as a lens to bend the light from this source. The more massive an object, the more lensing is observed.

Strong lensing is the observed distortion of background galaxies into arcs when their light passes through such a gravitational lens. It has been observed around many distant clusters including [[Abell 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=A.

Although both dark matter and ordinary matter are matter, they do not behave in the same way. In particular, in the early universe, ordinary matter was ionized and interacted strongly with radiation via [[Thomson scattering]]. Dark matter does not interact directly with radiation, but it does affect the CMB by its gravitational potential (mainly on large scales), and by its effects on the density and velocity of ordinary matter. Ordinary and dark matter perturbations, therefore, evolve differently with time and leave different imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

The cosmic microwave background is very close to a perfect blackbody but contains very small temperature anisotropies of a few parts in 100,000. A sky map of anisotropies can be decomposed into an angular power spectrum, which is observed to contain a series of acoustic peaks at near-equal spacing but different heights. 
The series of peaks can be predicted for any assumed set of cosmological parameters by modern computer codes such as CMBFast and CAMB, and matching theory to data, therefore, constrains cosmological parameters.&lt;ref name="Wayne Hu"&gt;The details are technical. See {{citeweb|author=Wayne Hu|title=Intermediate Guide to the Acoustic Peaks and Polarization|url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/intermediate.html|date=2001}} for an intermediate-level introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The first peak mostly shows the density of baryonic matter, while the third peak relates mostly to the density of dark matter, measuring the density of matter and the density of atoms.&lt;ref name="Wayne Hu" /&gt;

The CMB anisotropy was first discovered by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, though this had too coarse resolution to detect the acoustic peaks. 
After the discovery of the first acoustic peak by the balloon-borne [[BOOMERanG]] experiment in 2000, 
the power spectrum was precisely observed by [[WMAP]] in 2003-12, and even more precisely 
by the [[Planck spacecraft]] in 2013-15. The results support the Lambda-CDM model.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |display-authors=etal |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement]] |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Planck15" /&gt;

The observed CMB angular power spectrum provides powerful evidence in support of dark matter, as its precise structure is well fitted by the [[Lambda-CDM model]],&lt;ref name="Planck15"/&gt; but difficult to reproduce with any competing model such as [[modified Newtonian dynamics]] (MOND).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skordis |first1=C. |display-authors=etal |title=Large Scale Structure in Bekenstein's theory of relativistic Modified Newtonian Dynamics |journal=Phys.

=== Structure formation ===
{{Main|Structure formation}}
[[File:COSMOS 3D dark matter map.png|thumb|Mass map|3D map of the large-scale distribution of dark matter, reconstructed from measurements of [[weak gravitational lensing]] with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press |date=7 January 2007 |title=Hubble Maps the Cosmic Web of "Clumpy" Dark Matter in 3-D |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/01/image/a/grav |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Structure formation refers to the period after the Big Bang when density perturbations collapsed to form stars, galaxies, and clusters. Prior to structure formation, the [[FRW metric|Friedmann solutions]] to general relativity describe a homogeneous universe. Later, small anisotropies gradually grew and condensed the homogeneous universe into stars, galaxies and larger structures. Ordinary matter is affected by radiation, which is the dominant element of the universe at very early times. As a result, its density perturbations are washed out and unable to condense into structure.&lt;ref name="Jaffe"&gt;{{citeweb|author=A. H. Jaffe|title=Cosmology 2012: Lecture Notes|url=http://astro.imperial.ac.uk/sites/default/files/cosmology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there were only ordinary matter in the universe, there would not have been enough time for density perturbations to grow into the galaxies and clusters currently seen.

Dark matter provides a solution to this problem because it is unaffected by radiation. Therefore, its density perturbations can grow first. The resulting gravitational potential acts as an attractive [[potential well]] for ordinary matter collapsing later, speeding up the structure formation process.&lt;ref name="Jaffe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|title="Constraints on the composite photon theory|author=L.

=== Bullet Cluster ===
{{Main|Bullet Cluster}}
If dark matter does not exist, then the next most likely explanation is that general relativity—the prevailing theory of gravity—is incorrect. The Bullet Cluster, the result of a recent collision of two galaxy clusters, provides a challenge for modified gravity theories because its apparent center of mass is far displaced from the baryonic center of mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Type Ia [[supernovae]] can be used as [[standard candles]] to measure extragalactic distances, which can in turn be used to measure how fast the universe has expanded in the past.

=== Sky surveys and baryon acoustic oscillations ===
{{Main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}

Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are fluctuations in the density of the visible [[baryonic]] matter (normal matter) of the universe on large scales. These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid of the early universe, and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. BAOs set up a preferred length scale for baryons. As the dark matter and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (~ 1 percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147 Mpc, compared to those separated by 130 or 160 Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Redshift-space distortions ===
Large galaxy [[redshift survey]]s may be used to make a three-dimensional map of the galaxy distribution. These maps are slightly distorted because distances are estimated from observed [[redshift]]s; the redshift contains a contribution from the galaxy's so-called peculiar velocity in addition to the dominant Hubble expansion term. On average, superclusters are expanding but more slowly than the cosmic mean due to their gravity, while voids are expanding faster than average. In a redshift map, galaxies in front of a supercluster have excess radial velocities towards it and have redshifts slightly higher than their distance would imply, while galaxies behind the supercluster have redshifts slightly low for their distance. This effect causes superclusters to appear squashed in the radial direction, and likewise voids are stretched. Their angular positions are unaffected.
The effect is not detectable for any one structure since the true shape is not known, but can be measured by averaging over many structures assuming Earth is not at a special location in the Universe.

The effect was predicted quantitatively by Nick Kaiser in 1987, and first decisively measured in 2001 by the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peacock |first1=J. |title=A measurement of the cosmological mass density from clustering in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey |journal=Nature |year=2001 |volume=410 |issue=6825 |pages=169–73 |arxiv=astro-ph/0103143 |bibcode=2001Natur.410..169P |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1038/35065528 |pmid=11242069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results are in agreement with the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

Dark matter can refer to any substance that interacts predominantly via gravity with visible matter (e.g., stars and planets). Hence in principle it need not be composed of a new type of fundamental particle but could, at least in part, be made up of standard baryonic matter, such as protons or neutrons.{{refn|name=BaryonicFootnote01|group=note|Astronomers define the term [[baryonic matter]] to refer to ordinary matter made of [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[electron]]s, including [[neutron stars]] and [[black holes]] from the collapse of ordinary matter.  Strictly speaking, electrons are [[lepton]]s not [[baryon]]s; but since their number is equal to the protons while their mass is far smaller, electrons give a negligible contribution to the average density of baryonic matter. Baryonic matter excludes other known particles such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrinos]]. Hypothetical primordial black holes are also generally defined as non-baryonic, since they would have formed from radiation, not matter.&lt;ref name=BaryonicSource01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/B/Baryonic+Matter |title=Baryonic Matter |website=COSMOS - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy |publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]]|access-date=9 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, for the reasons outlined below, most scientists think the dark matter is dominated by a non-baryonic component, which is likely composed of a currently unknown fundamental particle (or similar exotic state).

[[File:Fermi Observations of Dwarf Galaxies Provide New Insights on Dark Matter.ogv|thumb|[[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi-LAT]] observations of dwarf galaxies provide new insights on dark matter.]]

=== Baryonic matter ===
{{Distinguish|Missing baryon problem}}
[[Baryon]]s ([[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) make up ordinary stars and planets. However, baryonic matter also encompasses less common [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s, faint old [[white dwarf]]s and [[brown dwarf]]s, collectively known as [[massive compact halo object]]s (MACHOs), which can be hard to detect.{{sfn|Randall|2015|p=286}}

However, multiple lines of evidence suggest the majority of dark matter is not made of baryons:

* Sufficient diffuse, baryonic gas or dust would be visible when backlit by stars. 
* The theory of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predicts the observed [[abundance of the chemical elements]]. If there are more baryons, then there should also be more helium, lithium and heavier elements synthesized during the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;Achim Weiss, "[http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/BBN Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Cooking up the first light elements]" in: Einstein Online Vol. 2 (2006), 1017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raine |first=D. |last2=Thomas |first2=T. |date=2001 |title=An Introduction to the Science of Cosmology |page=30 |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7503-0405-4 |oclc=864166846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement with observed abundances requires that baryonic matter makes up between 4–5% of the universe's [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]]. In contrast, [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] and other observations indicate that the total matter density is about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="planckesa2015" /&gt;
* Astronomical searches for [[gravitational microlensing]] in the [[Milky Way]] found that at most a small fraction of the dark matter may be in dark, compact, conventional objects (MACHOs, etc.); the excluded range of object masses is from half the Earth's mass up to 30 solar masses, which covers nearly all the plausible candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tisserand |first1=P. |last2=Le Guillou |first2=L. |last3=Afonso |first3=C. |last4=Albert |first4=J.

=== Non-baryonic matter ===

Candidates for non-baryonic dark matter are hypothetical particles such as [[axion]]s, [[sterile neutrino]]s, [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs), [[gravitationally-interacting massive particles]] (GIMPs), or [[supersymmetric]] particles. The three neutrino types already observed are indeed abundant, and dark, and matter, but because their individual masses—however uncertain they may be—are almost certainly tiny, they can only supply a small fraction of dark matter, due to limits derived from [[Observable universe|large-scale structure]] and high-[[redshift]] galaxies.&lt;ref name="bertone merritt" /&gt;

Unlike baryonic matter, nonbaryonic matter did not contribute to the formation of the [[Chemical element|elements]] in the early universe ([[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]])&lt;ref name="Copi 1995" /&gt; and so its presence is revealed only via its gravitational effects, or [[weak lensing]]. In addition, if the particles of which it is composed are supersymmetric, they can undergo [[annihilation]] interactions with themselves, possibly resulting in observable by-products such as [[gamma rays]] and neutrinos (indirect detection).&lt;ref name="bertone merritt"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bertone |first1=G. |last2=Merritt |first2=D. |title=Dark Matter Dynamics and Indirect Detection |year=2005 |journal=[[Modern Physics Letters A]] |volume=20 |issue=14 |pages=1021–1036 |arxiv=astro-ph/0504422 |bibcode=2005MPLA...20.1021B |doi=10.1142/S0217732305017391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter aggregation and dense dark matter objects===
If dark matter is as common as observations suggest, an obvious question is whether it can form objects equivalent to [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, or [[black hole]]s. The answer has historically been that it cannot,&lt;ref name="curio"&gt;http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/95-the-universe/galaxies/general-questions/508-are-there-any-dark-stars-or-dark-galaxies-made-of-dark-matter-advanced&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |date=February 1, 2018 |website=Physics |url=https://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.051102 |title=Synopsis: A Way to Cool Dark Matter |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |quote=One widely held belief about dark matter is that it cannot cool off by radiating energy. If it could, then it might bunch together and create compact objects in the same way that baryonic matter forms planets, stars, and galaxies.

As a result, it is extremely unlikely there are very dense objects like stars made out of entirely (or even mostly) dark matter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="siegel"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/10/28/why-doesnt-dark-matter-form-black-holes/#4e5014943de1 Why Doesn't Dark Matter Form Black Holes?] - Forbes column, authored by [https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethansiegel/#2f9e270c683e Ethan Siegel], whose Forbes biography identifies the author as a "Ph.D. astrophysicist, author, and science communicator, who professes physics and astronomy... numerous awards for science writing ... including the award for best science blog by the Institute of Physics.&lt;/ref&gt; because of two factors:

* ''It lacks an efficient means to lose energy:''&lt;ref name="curio" /&gt; Ordinary matter forms dense objects because it has numerous ways to lose energy. Losing energy would be essential for object formation, because a particle that gains energy during compaction or falling "inward" under gravity, and cannot lose it any other way, will heat up and increase [[velocity]] and [[momentum]]. Dark matter appears to lack means to lose energy, simply because it is not capable of interacting strongly in other ways except through gravity. The [[Virial theorem]] suggests that such a particle would not stay bound to the gradually forming object—as the object began to form and compact, the dark matter particles within it would speed up and tend to escape.
* ''It lacks a range of interactions needed to form structures:''&lt;ref name="siegel" /&gt; Ordinary matter interacts in many different ways. This allow it to form more complex structures. For example, stars form through gravity, but the particles within them interact and can emit energy in the form of [[neutrino]]s and [[electromagnetic radiation]] through [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] when they become energetic enough. [[Proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can bind via the [[strong interaction]] and then form [[atom]]s with [[electron]]s largely through [[electromagnetic interaction]]. But there is no evidence that dark matter is capable of such a wide variety of interactions, since it only seems to interact through gravity and through some means no stronger than the [[weak interaction]] (although this is speculative until dark matter is better understood).

This question has been debated heavily during recent years. In 2016–2017 the idea of dense dark matter or dark matter being black holes, including [[primordial black hole]]s, made a comeback&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Adrian |title=Is dark matter made of black holes? |journal=Science |date=9 February 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.aal0721}}&lt;/ref&gt; following results of [[Gravitational wave|gravitation wave]] detection. These were again ruled out in December 2017,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2156252-ancient-black-holes-ruled-out-as-source-of-all-dark-matter/&lt;/ref&gt; but research and theories based on these still continue as at 2018, including approaches to dark matter cooling,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2160305-there-could-be-entire-stars-and-planets-made-out-of-dark-matter/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.051102|pmid=29481169|title=Collapsed Dark Matter Structures|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=120|issue=5|pages=051102|year=2018|last1=Buckley|first1=Matthew R|last2=Difranzo|first2=Anthony|arxiv=1707.03829|bibcode=2018PhRvL.120e1102B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the question is by no means settled.

== Classification of dark matter: cold, warm or hot ==
Dark matter can be divided into ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Joseph |last=Silk|title=The Big Bang: Third Edition| url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XLwe1lUmz5kC| page=82}}| date=6 December 2000| publisher=Henry Holt and Company| isbn=978-0-8050-7256-3| chapter=IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories refer to velocity rather than an actual temperature, indicating how far corresponding objects moved due to random motions in the early universe, before they slowed due to cosmic expansion—this is an important distance called the [[free streaming]] length (FSL). Primordial density fluctuations smaller than this length get washed out as particles spread from overdense to underdense regions, while larger fluctuations are unaffected; therefore this length sets a minimum scale for later structure formation. The categories are set with respect to the size of a [[protogalaxy]] (an object that later evolves into a dwarf galaxy): dark matter particles are classified as cold, warm, or hot according as their FSL; much smaller (cold), similar (warm), or much larger (hot) than a protogalaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=N. |last1=Vittorio |author2=J. Silk |date=1984 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=285 |pages=L39–L43 |title=Fine-scale anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in a universe dominated by cold dark matter |doi=10.1086/184361 |bibcode=1984ApJ...285L..39V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Masayuki |last1=Umemura |author2=Satoru Ikeuchi |title=Formation of Subgalactic Objects within Two-Component Dark Matter |date=1985 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=299 |pages=583–592 |doi=10.1086/163726 |bibcode=1985ApJ...299..583U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixtures of the above are also possible: a theory of [[mixed dark matter]] was popular in the mid-1990s, but was rejected following the discovery of [[dark energy]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Cold dark matter leads to a bottom-up formation of structure while hot dark matter would result in a top-down formation scenario;{{Clarification needed|date=September 2018}} the latter is excluded by high-redshift galaxy observations.&lt;ref name="bertone hooper silk" /&gt;

=== Alternative definitions ===
These categories also correspond to [[fluctuation spectrum]] effects and the interval following the Big Bang at which each type became non-relativistic. Davis ''et al.'' wrote in 1985:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=M. |author2=Efstathiou, G. |author3=Frenk, C. S. |author4=White, S. D. M. |title=The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=292 |date=May 15, 1985 |pages=371–394 |doi=10.1086/163168 |bibcode=1985ApJ...292..371D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Candidate particles can be grouped into three categories on the basis of their effect on the [[Mixed dark matter|fluctuation spectrum]] (Bond ''et al.'' 1983). If the dark matter is composed of abundant light particles which remain relativistic until shortly before recombination, then it may be termed "hot". The best candidate for hot dark matter is a neutrino ... A second possibility is for the dark matter particles to interact more weakly than neutrinos, to be less abundant, and to have a mass of order 1&amp;nbsp;keV. Such particles are termed "warm dark matter", because they have lower thermal velocities than massive neutrinos ... there are at present few candidate particles which fit this description. [[Gravitino]]s and [[photino]]s have been suggested (Pagels and Primack 1982; Bond, Szalay and Turner 1982) ... Any particles which became nonrelativistic very early, and so were able to diffuse a negligible distance, are termed "cold" dark matter (CDM). There are many candidates for CDM including supersymmetric particles. | M. Davis, G. Efstathiou, C. S. Frenk, and S. D. M. White | The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter}}

Another approximate dividing line is that warm dark matter became non-relativistic when the universe was approximately 1 year old and 1 millionth of its present size and in the [[radiation-dominated era]] (photons and neutrinos), with a photon temperature 2.7 million K. Standard physical cosmology gives the [[particle horizon]] size as 2''ct'' (speed of light multiplied by time) in the radiation-dominated era, thus 2 light-years. A region of this size would expand to 2 million light-years today (absent structure formation). The actual FSL is approximately 5 times the above length, since it continues to grow slowly as particle velocities decrease inversely with the scale factor after they become non-relativistic. In this example the FSL would correspond to 10 million light-years, or 3 mega[[parsec]]s, today, around the size containing an average large galaxy.

The 2.7 million K photon temperature gives a typical photon energy of 250 electron-volts, thereby setting a typical mass scale for warm dark matter: particles much more massive than this, such as GeV–TeV mass [[weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]], would become non-relativistic much earlier than one year after the Big Bang and thus have FSLs much smaller than a protogalaxy, making them cold. Conversely, much lighter particles, such as neutrinos with masses of only a few eV, have FSLs much larger than a protogalaxy, thus qualifying them as hot.

=== Cold dark matter ===
{{Main|Cold dark matter}}
[[Cold dark matter]] offers the simplest explanation for most cosmological observations. It is dark matter composed of constituents with an FSL much smaller than a protogalaxy. This is the focus for dark matter research, as hot dark matter does not seem capable of supporting galaxy or galaxy cluster formation, and most particle candidates slowed early.

The constituents of cold dark matter are unknown. Possibilities range from large objects like MACHOs (such as black holes&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hawkins |first1=M. R.

The 1997 [[DAMA/NaI]] experiment and its successor [[DAMA/LIBRA]] in 2013, claimed to directly detect dark matter particles passing through the Earth, but many researchers remain skeptical, as negative results from similar experiments seem incompatible with the DAMA results.

Many [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] models offer dark matter candidates in the form of the WIMPy [[Lightest Supersymmetric Particle]] (LSP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Supersymmetric dark matter |journal=Physics Reports |date=1 March 1996 |pages=195–373 |volume=267 |issue=5–6 |doi=10.1016/0370-1573(95)00058-5 |first=Gerard |last=Jungman |first2=Marc |last2=Kamionkowski |first3=Kim |last3=Griest |arxiv=hep-ph/9506380 |bibcode=1996PhR...267..195J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, heavy sterile neutrinos exist in non-supersymmetric extensions to the [[Standard Model|standard model]] that explain the small [[neutrino]] mass through the [[seesaw mechanism]].

=== Warm dark matter ===
{{Main|Warm dark matter}}
[[Warm dark matter]] comprises particles with an FSL comparable to the size of a protogalaxy. Predictions based on warm dark matter are similar to those for cold dark matter on large scales, but with less small-scale density perturbations. This reduces the predicted abundance of dwarf galaxies and may lead to lower density of dark matter in the central parts of large galaxies. Some researchers consider this a better fit to observations. A challenge for this model is the lack of particle candidates with the required mass ~ 300 eV to 3000 eV.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

No known particles can be categorized as warm dark matter. A postulated candidate is the [[sterile neutrino]]: a heavier, slower form of neutrino that does not interact through the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], unlike other neutrinos. Some modified gravity theories, such as [[scalar–tensor–vector gravity]], require "warm" dark matter to make their equations work.

=== Hot dark matter ===
{{Main|Hot dark matter}}
[[Hot dark matter]] consists of particles whose FSL is much larger than the size of a protogalaxy. The [[neutrino]] qualifies as such particle. They were discovered independently, long before the hunt for dark matter: they were postulated in 1930, and [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment|detected in 1956]]. Neutrinos' [[Neutrino mass|mass]] is less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; that of an [[electron]]. Neutrinos interact with normal matter only via gravity and the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], making them difficult to detect (the weak force only works over a small distance, thus a neutrino triggers a weak force event only if it hits a nucleus head-on). This makes them 'weakly interacting light particles' (WILPs), as opposed to WIMPs.

The three known [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavours]] of neutrinos are the ''electron'', ''muon'', and ''tau''. Their masses are slightly different. Neutrinos oscillate among the flavours as they move. It is hard to determine an exact [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]] on the collective average mass of the three neutrinos (or for any of the three individually). For example, if the average neutrino mass were over 50 ''eV/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; of the mass of an electron), the universe would collapse. CMB data and other methods indicate that their average mass probably does not exceed 0.3 ''eV/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, observed neutrinos cannot explain dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/neutrinos.html |title=Neutrinos as Dark Matter |publisher=Astro.ucla.edu |date=21 September 1998 |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because galaxy-size density fluctuations get washed out by free-streaming, hot dark matter implies that the first objects that can form are huge [[supercluster]]-size pancakes, which then fragment into galaxies. [[List of deep fields|Deep-field observations]] show instead that galaxies formed first, followed by clusters and superclusters as galaxies clump together.

== Detection of dark matter particles ==
If dark matter is made up of sub-atomic particles, then millions, possibly billions, of such particles must pass through every square centimeter of the Earth each second.&lt;ref name="Gaitskell 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gaitskell |first=Richard J. |title=Direct Detection of Dark Matter |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |volume=54 |pages=315–359 |bibcode=2004ARNPS..54..315G |date=2004 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.54.070103.181244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Number per second"&gt;{{cite web |title=NEUTRALINO DARK MATTER |url=http://www.picassoexperiment.ca/dm_neutralino.php |accessdate=26 December 2011}}

Although [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]] are popular search candidates,&lt;ref name="bertone hooper silk" /&gt; the [[Axion Dark Matter Experiment]] (ADMX) searches for [[axion]]s. Another candidate is heavy [[hidden sector]] particles that only interact with ordinary matter via gravity.

These experiments can be divided into two classes: direct detection experiments, which search for the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei within a detector; and indirect detection, which look for the products of dark matter particle annihilations or decays.&lt;ref name="bertone merritt" /&gt;

=== Direct detection ===
{{details|Weakly interacting massive particles#Direct detection}}
Direct detection experiments aim to observe low-energy recoils (typically a few [[keV]]s) of nuclei induced by interactions with particles of dark matter, which (in theory) are passing through the Earth. After such a recoil the nucleus will emit energy as, e.g., [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light or [[phonon]]s, which is then detected by sensitive apparatus. To do this effectively, it is crucial to maintain a low background, and so such experiments operate deep underground to reduce the interference from [[cosmic ray]]s. Examples of underground laboratories with direct detection experiments include the [[Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory|Stawell mine]], the [[Soudan mine]], the [[SNOLAB]] underground laboratory at [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], the [[Gran Sasso National Laboratory]], the [[Canfranc Underground Laboratory]], the [[Boulby Underground Laboratory]], the [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]] and the [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory]].

These experiments mostly use either cryogenic or noble liquid detector technologies. Cryogenic detectors operating at temperatures below 100&amp;nbsp;mK, detect the heat produced when a particle hits an atom in a crystal absorber such as [[germanium]]. [[Noble gas|Noble liquid]] detectors detect [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] produced by a particle collision in liquid [[xenon]] or [[argon]]. Cryogenic detector experiments include: [[Cryogenic Dark Matter Search|CDMS]], [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]], [[EDELWEISS]], [[European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array|EURECA]]. Noble liquid experiments include ZEPLIN, [[XENON]], [[DEAP]], [[ArDM]], [[WIMP Argon Programme|WARP]], [[DarkSide]], [[PandaX]], and LUX, the [[Large Underground Xenon experiment]]. Both of these techniques focus strongly on their ability to distinguish background particles (which predominantly scatter off electrons) from dark matter particles (that scatter off nuclei). Other experiments include [[SIMPLE (dark matter)|SIMPLE]] and [[PICASSO (dark matter)|PICASSO]].

Currently there has been no well-established claim of dark matter detection from a direct detection experiment, leading instead to strong upper limits on the mass and interaction cross section with nucleons of such dark matter particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drees|first1=M.|last2=Gerbier|first2=G.|title=Dark Matter|journal=Chin.

A few of the dark matter particles passing through the Sun or Earth may scatter off atoms and lose energy.

=== Collider searches for dark matter ===
An alternative approach to the detection of dark matter particles in nature is to produce them in a laboratory. Experiments with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) may be able to detect dark matter particles produced in collisions of the LHC [[proton]] beams. Because a dark matter particle should have negligible interactions with normal visible matter, it may be detected indirectly as (large amounts of) missing energy and momentum that escape the detectors, provided other (non-negligible) collision products are detected.&lt;ref name="kane watson"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Kane, G. |author2=Watson, S. |title=Dark Matter and LHC:. what is the Connection? |journal=Modern Physics Letters A |year=2008 |volume=23 |pages=2103–2123 |doi=10.1142/S0217732308028314 |bibcode=2008MPLA...23.2103K |arxiv=0807.2244 |issue=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Constraints on dark matter also exist from the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider|LEP]] experiment using a similar principle, but probing the interaction of dark matter particles with electrons rather than quarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=P.J.|last2=Harnik|first2=R.|last3=Kopp|first3=J.|last4=Tsai|first4=Y.|title=LEP Shines Light on Dark Matter|journal=Phys.

== Alternative hypotheses ==
{{More|Alternatives to general relativity}}
Because dark matter remains to be conclusively identified, many other hypotheses have emerged aiming to explain the observational phenomena that dark matter was conceived to explain. The most common method is to modify general relativity. General relativity is well-tested on solar system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales has not been well proven. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably eliminate the need for dark matter. The best-known theories of this class are [[MOND]] and its relativistic generalization [[tensor-vector-scalar gravity]] (TeVeS),&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see: {{cite journal |title=The failures of the Standard Model of Cosmology require a new paradigm |author=Pavel Kroupa |display-authors=etal |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |date=December 2012 |volume=21 |issue=4 |doi=10.1142/S0218271812300030 |arxiv = 1301.3907 |bibcode = 2012IJMPD..2130003K }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[f(R) gravity]]&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see: {{cite journal |title=The dark matter problem from f(R) gravity viewpoint |author=Salvatore Capozziello |author2=Mariafelicia De Laurentis |journal=Annalen der Physik |date=October 2012|volume=524|issue=9–10|doi=10.1002/andp.201200109|bibcode = 2012AnP...524..545C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[entropic gravity]].&lt;ref name="physorgnewtheory"&gt;{{cite news |authorlink= Delta Institute for Theoretical Physics | title=New theory of gravity might explain dark matter | url=https://phys.org/news/2016-11-theory-gravity-dark.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alternatives to general relativity|Alternative theories]] abound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alternatives to Dark Matter and Dark Energy|author=Phillip D.

A problem with alternative hypotheses is that the observational evidence for dark matter comes from so many independent approaches (see the "observational evidence" section above). Explaining any individual observation is possible but explaining all of them is very difficult. Nonetheless, there have been some scattered successes for alternative hypotheses, such as a 2016 test of gravitational lensing in entropic gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-12-verlinde-theory-gravity.html |title=Verlinde's new theory of gravity passes first test |date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=First test of Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity using Weak Gravitational Lensing measurements |first1=Margot M. |last1=Brouwer |display-authors=etal |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume= 466|issue=to appear |date=11 December 2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw3192 |arxiv=1612.03034 |pages=2547–2559|bibcode = 2017MNRAS.466.2547B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2116446-first-test-of-rival-to-einsteins-gravity-kills-off-dark-matter/|title=First test of rival to Einstein's gravity kills off dark matter|date=15 December 2016|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing opinion among most astrophysicists is that while modifications to general relativity can conceivably explain part of the observational evidence, there is probably enough data to conclude there must be some form of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2012/05/09/dark-matter-vs-modified-gravity-a-trialogue/ |title=Dark Matter vs. Modified Gravity: a Trialogue |author-link=Sean M.

==In philosophy of science==

In [[philosophy of science]], dark matter is an example of an auxiliary hypothesis, an [[Ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc]] postulate that is added to a theory in response to observations that [[falsifiability|falsify]] it. It has been argued that the dark matter hypothesis is a [[conventionalism#Epistemology|conventionalist]] hypothesis, that is, a hypothesis that adds no empirical content and hence is unfalsifiable in the sense defined by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merritt |first1=David |title=Cosmology and convention |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |date=February 2017 |volume=57 |issue=2017 |pages=41–52 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2016.12.002|arxiv=1703.02389 |bibcode=2017SHPMP..57...41M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Differential psychology''' studies the ways in which individuals differ in their behavior and the processes that underlie it. This is distinguished from other aspects of psychology in that although psychology is ostensibly a study of individuals, modern psychologists often study groups, or attempt to discover general psychological processes that apply to all individuals.&lt;ref name="Ergodicity"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fisher, A.J.| displayauthors=etal| year = 2018 | title = Lack of group-to-individual generalizability is a threat to human subjects research| journal = PNAS | volume = 115 | issue = 27 | pages = 6106–6115| doi=10.1073/pnas.1711978115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy, the mean performance of the therapy in one [[Treatment and control groups|treatment group]] might be compared to the mean effectiveness of a [[placebo]] (or a well-known therapy) in a second, control group. In this context, differences between individuals in their reaction to the experimental and control manipulations are actually treated as errors rather than as interesting phenomena to study.

This approach is applied because [[psychological research]] depends upon statistical controls that are only defined upon groups of people. Individual difference psychologists usually express their interest in individuals while studying groups by seeking dimensions shared by all individuals but upon which individuals differ. The ergodicity problem impedes correct group-to-individual generalization for most psychological phenomena.&lt;ref name="Ergodicity"/&gt;

== Importance of individual differences ==
Individual differences are essential whenever we wish to explain how
individuals differ in their behavior. In any study, significant
variation exists between individuals.  [[Reaction time]], preferences,
values, and health-linked behaviors are just a few examples. Individual
differences in factors such as [[personality]], [[intelligence]],
[[memory]], or physical factors such as body size, sex, age, and other
factors can be studied and used in understanding this large source of
variance. Importantly, individuals can also differ not only in their
current state, but in the magnitude or even direction of response to a
given [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]]. Such phenomena, often
explained in terms of [[Yerkes-Dodson law|inverted-U]] response curves,
place differential psychology at an important location in such
endeavours as [[personalized medicine]], in which diagnoses are
customised for an individual's response profile.

== Areas of study ==
Individual differences research typically includes [[personality psychology|personality]], [[motivation]], [[intelligence]], ability, [[IQ]], [[Interest (emotion)|interests]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[self-concept]], [[self-efficacy]], and [[self-esteem]] (to name just a few). There are few remaining "differential psychology" programs in the United States, although research in this area is very active. Current researchers are found in a variety of applied and experimental programs, including [[clinical psychology]], [[educational psychology]], [[Industrial and organizational psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[behavioral genetics]], and [[developmental psychology]] programs, in the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] in particular.

'''Dmitry Sergeyevich Likhachov''' ({{lang-ru|Дми́трий Серге́евич Лихачёв}}, also ''Dmitri Likhachev'' or ''Likhachyov''; {{OldStyleDate|28 November|1906|15 November}} – 30 September 1999) was [[Russian people|Russian]] [[medievalist]], [[linguist]], and [[concentration camp]] survivor. During his lifetime, Likhachov was considered the world's foremost scholar of the [[Old Russian language]] and its literature.

He was revered as "the last of old St Petersburgers", and as "a guardian of national culture". Due to his high profile as a [[Soviet dissident]] during his later life, Likhachov was often referred to as "Russia's conscience".

==Life and career==
Dmitry Likhachov was born in [[Saint Petersburg]]. From his early childhood he had a passion for literature, even though his parents did not approve of this interest.

In a 1987 interview with [[David Remnick]], Likhachov recalled how he had, "watched the February and [[October Revolution]]s from his window."&lt;ref name="Remnick 104"&gt;David Remnick (1994), ''Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire'', page 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, at only 16 years old, Likhachov entered the Department of Linguistics and Literature of [[Leningrad State University]]. He attended the Roman-Germanic and Slavic-Russian sections at the same time, undertaking two diplomas. At the university the young Likhachov met many outstanding scientists and developed his own way of thinking. Likhachov graduated in 1928 from the [[Leningrad University]]. In 1928, at the end of his studies, Likhachyov was arrested and accused of being a member of what Remnick called, "a students' literary group called the Cosmic Academy of Sciences", which "posed about as great a threat to the [[Kremlin]] as the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' does to the [[White House]]."&lt;ref name="Remnick 104"/&gt;

For his election as an [[Academician]], Likhachyov had presented a short report, in which he poked fun at the [[Reforms of Russian orthography|new spelling rules of 1918]] and urged that they be "reformed" by restoring the banned letter "Yat". After his arrest, Likhachyov was confronted with the paper by a [[Soviet secret police]] interrogator, who screamed, "What do you mean by language reform? Perhaps we won't even have any language at all under Socialism!"&lt;ref name="Remnick 104"/&gt;

After nine months in jail, the young scientist was unlawfully exiled without trial and spent five years in the USSR's [[Solovki prison camp|first concentration camp]], located on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the White Sea.

Deported to the [[Solovki Special Purpose Camp]], he spent 5 years studying  "criminal folklore" (as he termed it). Dmitry Likhachov wrote his first scientific article, "Card Games of Criminals", in the camp. He didn't play cards himself, but was a keen observer. He also gathered much material about the language of thieves and later published articles and a book about thieves' slang and customs.

At the camp, hard work, poor living conditions and illness dramatically damaged Likhachov's health, but he survived. On the Solovetsky Islands he met both exiled Russian intellectuals and real criminals, who happened to save his life. As Dmitry Likhachov said many years later, "At the Solovki, I understood that every person is a person."

Whilst on the islands, for some period of time Dmitry Likhachov worked as a member of the Criminological Cabinet, organizing a labor colony for teenagers and saving them from death caused by hunger, drugs, and cold.

On the night of 28 October 1929, he was summoned from a visit with his parents and ordered to join a party of 300 prisoners destined for execution. Wishing to spare his parents the trauma, Likhachyov told them that he had been summoned for night work and that they should not wait for him. He then hid behind a wood pile and listened as the three hundred prisoners were shot and thrown into a [[mass grave]]. The next morning, Likhachyov returned from his hiding place as a completely different man. In a 1987 interview with David Remnick, Likhachyov recalled the events of that night and concluded, "The executioner is older than me, and he is still alive."&lt;ref&gt;Remnick (1994), pages 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931, Likhachov was a worker on the construction of the [[White Sea–Baltic Canal|Stalin White Sea–Baltic Canal]] until his release.

Likhachyov returned to Leningrad and started his spectacular scholarly career in the [[Pushkin House]] (as the Russian Literature Institute is known), which spanned more than 60 years and saw the publication of more than 500 scholarly works. Likhachov didn't stop his work even during the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. He believed that Russia was an integral and indivisible part of European civilization, contrary to "Euroasiatic" views of Russia popular with [[Lev Gumilev]], [[Boris Rybakov]], and many other contemporaries.

Likhachov worked for five years as a proofreader in the publishing house of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]]. In 1936, thanks to petitions by the president of the Academy of Sciences, [[Alexander Karpinsky|Aleksandr Karpinsky]], Dmitry Likhachyov's criminal record was cleared. In 1938 the talented scientist was noticed{{by whom|date=September 2015}} and invited to the Department of Old Russian Literature of the [[Institute of Russian Literature]] (known as the Pushkin House). Dmitry Likhachyov worked here until the end of his life.

[[Old Russian literature]], which at that time did not receive much academic attention, became the main scientific interest of Dmitry Likhachyov who, by the beginning of the 1940s, was one of the most renowned specialists in this sphere. In 1941 Likhachyov presented his thesis "The Novgorod Annalistic Corpus of the 12th Century".

World War II brought new trials. Likhachov, together with his wife and twin daughters, survived the horrors of the [[siege of Leningrad]] (1941-1944). He described his experience in a story, full of harsh details, exposing different types of people and their heroic or appalling behavior when faced with starvation and death. In 1942, completely exhausted by hunger and cold, Dmitry Likhachyov started to gather materials on medieval poetry and soon published the book ''Defense of the Old Russian Cities''. In 1943 Likhachyov and his entire family were exiled to Kazan, supposedly because of the "connection with the Solovetsky Camp". But by the end of the war they had returned to Leningrad.

In 1947 Dmitry Likhachov received his Doctorate in Philology, having presented his thesis "Essays on the History of Annalistic Literary Forms of the 11th–16th Centuries". Three years later he became a professor at the Leningrad State University. From 1953 he was a corresponding member - and from 1970 a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Dmitry Likhachyov's conquest of the scientific world was definitely a triumphant one.

1950 marked the publication of Likhachov’s two-volume edition containing unique, important literary works translated into the modern Russian language: ''The [[Primary Chronicle]]'', a history of Kievan Rus' from the 9th to the 12th centuries, and ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|The Lay of the Host of Igor]]'', an account based on a failed raid by Prince [[Igor Svyatoslavich]] of [[Principality of Novgorod-Seversk|Novgorod-Seversk]] against the [[Cumans]] in 1185.

Dmitry Likhachov was not a scientist detached from everyday life. From the 1950s he began a campaign to save the wooden temples of the Russian North and to preserve the historical appearance of Russian cities. He helped found the [[Dostoevsky Museum|museums of Dostoevsky]], Pushkin and Pasternak.

In 1953 Likhachov was admitted into the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] as a [[corresponding member]]. He defended [[Andrei Sakharov]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and other dissidents during their persecution by Soviet authorities.

In the 1960s Likhachyov was one of the initiators of the movement for the protection of historical monuments, libraries and archives. Thanks to Likhachyov many monuments were saved, including [[Marina Tsvetaeva]]'s flat in Moscow, the [[Nevsky Prospect]] in Leningrad (which was supposed to be turned into a shopping street) and [[Alexander Garden (disambiguation)|Aleksandr's Garden]]. In the 1980s he headed the Soviet (later renamed Russian) Cultural Fund, supporting the process of the Orthodox Church's reclaiming of its temples, formerly appropriated by the Soviet government. The scientist also participated in the preservation of [[national minority|national minorities]] in danger of dying out while aiding the return to Russia of émigré public and cultural figures.

In 1980 Likhachov was one of the members of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] who refused to sign a letter requesting the expulsion the famous scientist [[Andrei Sakharov]] from the Academy because of Sakharov's public disapproval of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|dispatch of Soviet troops to Afghanistan]] in 1979.

Despite his busy social life, Likhachov still spent a lot of time on scientific work. Focusing on Old Russian literature, he developed the concept of [[artistic time]] and space. In 1969 the researcher was awarded with the [[USSR State Prize]] for his work "Poetics of Old Russian Literature".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Dmitry Likhachov gained worldwide recognition as a theorist of culture and as a publicist. In the 1980s he developed a concept that considered the problems of humanization and the reorientation of educational goals and ideas. The scientist viewed culture as a historical memory, as a process of accumulation, rather than consecutive changes. This was also the theoretical basis for Likhachov’s attention to ancient monuments, especially in architecture. Inspired by the works of [[Vladimir Vernadsky]], Dmitry Likhachov suggested the idea of a “homosphere”- a human sphere of the Earth. His original contribution to general science was also the development of a new discipline called the [[ecology of culture]], which was defined as an essential sphere of human life.

One of the ideas of Likhachov's concept was the correlation between culture and nature. In his book ''Poetics of the Gardens'' (1982), park and garden art was for the first time considered as a [[semiotic]] reflection of major cultural and artistic styles and their corresponding ideologies.

In Moscow and St. Petersburg, in 1986 he created the International Association of intellectuals and creative "Myr Culture", with the writer Nicolaj Sanvelian,  the Italian economist and writer Giancarlo Pallavicini
and other leading writers, artists and scientists, he was inspiring and President for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Various editions of the World of Culture Association have been published, and "Forum of the artistic intelligentsia of Russia, Moscow, Boltscioj Theatre, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 he was elected the first President of the [[Russian Cultural Fund]]. In his 1980s and 1990s, he became more of a public figure, serving as an informal advisor to St. Petersburg Mayor [[Anatoly Sobchak]] and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]]. In October 1993 he signed the [[Letter of Forty-Two]].&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Писатели требуют от правительства решительных действий |url=http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/PAPERS/HONOUR/LETT42.HTM |accessdate=21 August 2011 |newspaper=[[Izvestia]] |date=5 October 1993 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716043414/http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/PAPERS/HONOUR/LETT42.HTM |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he became the first person to be named an Honorary Citizen of St Petersburg. He also presided over the commission set up to prepare for [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s bicentenary.

Likhachov thought about his [[life journey]] as a vertical movement, towards the heavenly home. The reflections of his experience as a person are written in the book “Reminiscences” (1995).

During the first visit to Rome Gorbachev, Myr Culture has officially handed over, on behalf of the intellectual-creative in the world, a cultural program, called "Manifesto of the three" by the signatories founders of the association, the Russian spokesman Zagladin presented the world's press at the Foro Italico, in 1998, as an instance of cultural freedom for Russia and for the world, signed by Dmitry Likhachov, Nicolaj Sanvelian e Giancarlo Pallavicini.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giancarlopallavicini.it/cultura/myr-cultura-in-italia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last works by Dmitry Likhachov gathered together his general ideas about his native country. The book ''Thoughts About Russia'', completed in 1999, a few days before the author's death, is devoted to Russia'’s place in world history, its myths and its most characteristic features. The edition ''Russian Culture'' was published posthumously in 2000.

As a great scientist, Likhachov was a foreign member of the Academies of Sciences of Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia and a corresponding member of the Austrian, American, British, Italian and Göttingen Academies. In 1984 the minor planet 2877 was named after Likhachyov.

A year before his death, Likhachov became the very first recipient of the reinstated [[Order of St. Andrew]].

Dmitry Likhachov died on 30 September 1999.

In 2001 Likhachyov's daughter and [[George Soros]] established the [http://lfond.spb.ru/ Likhachov Philanthropic Fund].

== Family ==
Likhachov married Zinaida Makarova, who devoted her entire life to her husband. They had twin daughters, Vera and Lyudmila.

==Legacy==
A [[minor planet]] [[2877 Likhachev]] discovered in 1969 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Chernykh]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | edition = 5th  | year = 2003 | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=2877+Likhachev+TR2 | isbn = 3-540-00238-3

'''DragonLord Enterprises, Inc.''' is an American corporation that develops games, mobile apps, and
3D simulations.  Under the name Sequoia Consulting,
it also specializes in robotics, machine learning,
and applied artificial intelligence.  DragonLord created the first adventure game running on a cell phone in the world.

== Mobile Games ==
DragonLord created the first adventure game for cell phones in the world, ''Cavern Crawl'', in 2001.  DragonLord was the first developer in America to create games for cell phones, and one of the first in the world, after Nokia's ''Snake''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=User's Guide for the Kyocera 2235 phone (English version)|url=http://www.kyocerawireless.com/2200-phone/pdf/2235_user_guide_english.pdf|publisher=Kyocera Wireless|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DragonLord's ''Cavern Crawl'' and ''Mystic I Ching'' were
factory-built into the firmware of such cell phones as the Kyocera Model 2235 handset, distributed by Verizon;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kyocera 2235 Cell Phone|url=http://www.epinions.com/review/Kyocera_2235_Cellular_Phone/content_76337811076|publisher=Epinions|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the S14 Opal, distributed by Cricket and MetroPCS;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kyocera Opal S14 User Guide|url=http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/opal-phone/pdf/opal_user_guide_english.pdf|publisher=Kyocera|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2255&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=User's Guide for the Kyocera 2255 Phone|url=http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/2200-phone/pdf/2255_user_guide_english.pdf|publisher=Kyocera Wireless|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2325,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=User's Guide for the Kyocera 2325 Phone|url=http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/2300-phone/pdf/2325_user_guide_english.pdf|publisher=Kyocera Wireless|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DragonLord also made multiple versions of ''Tetris'',
that were built into the factory firmware of various Kyocera handsets through at least 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slider User Guide|url=http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/slider-phone/pdf/se44_user_guide_largeprint_english.pdf|publisher=Kyocera Wireless|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kyocera 3245 User Guide|url=http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/3200-phone/pdf/3245_user_guide_english.pdf|publisher=Kyocera Wireless|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robotics and A.I.==
DragonLord's Sequoia Consulting created the software for a humanoid robot for NASA JPL
in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=System Integration of a Humanoid Robot Testbed, Final Report|year=2006|publisher=DragonLord Enterprises, Inc|location=Sherman Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The robot was one of the first humanoid robots to integrate speech recognition of commands and speech generation of responses.  It used a real-time expert system shell to plan and sequence actions.
It used primitive model-based stereo vision to locate and track objects in its environment.
It was able to turn, walk over to a spar, squat down, bend over,
and pick the spar up, using an arm with no wrist joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPL (NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratories): System Integration of a Humanoid Robot|url=http://www.seqcon.com/caseJPL.html|publisher=Sequoia Consulting|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
DragonLord is featured in the book ''The Fat Man on Game Audio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanger|first=George Alistair|title=The Fat Man on Game Audio: Tasty Morsels of Sonic Goodness|year=2003|publisher=New Riders Publishing|location=America|isbn=1-59273-009-4|pages=86–91,118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries do not have laws that ban the practice of oral sex, though some cultures may consider it [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; People may also have negative feelings or [[sexual inhibition]]s about giving or receiving oral sex; they may refuse to engage in it of their own volition.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Commonly, people do not regard forms of oral sex as affecting the [[virginity]] of either partner, though opinions on the matter vary.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qNCeI2AcY4C&amp;pg=PT11 here] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=pXXZn_qSoDoC&amp;pg=PA48 47-49] for male virginity, how gay and lesbian individuals define virginity loss, and for how the majority of researchers and heterosexuals define virginity loss/"technical virginity" by whether or not a person has engaged in vaginal sex. {{Cite book|author=Laura M.

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] noun ''fellatio'' comes from ''{{lang|la|fellātus}}'', which in [[Latin]] is the past [[participle]] of the verb ''{{lang|la|fellāre}}'', meaning to suck. In ''fellatio'' the ''-us'' is replaced by the ''-io''; the declension stem ends in ''-ion-'', which gives the suffix the form ''-ion'' (cf. French ''fellation''). The ''-io''(''n'') ending is used in English to create nouns from Latin [[adjective]]s and it can indicate a state or action wherein the Latin verb is being, or has been, performed.

Further English words have been created based on the same Latin root. A person who performs fellatio upon another may be termed a ''fellator''; because of Latin's [[grammatical gender|gender based declension]], this word may be restricted by some English speakers to describing a male. The equivalent term for a female is ''fellatrix''.

==Practice==

===General===
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (20).jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]] of fellatio scene]]
[[File:We, two boys together clinging - 05 - Picture by Giovanni Dall'Orto, July 30 2014.jpg|thumb|Two men engaging in fellatio|150px]]

A person who performs fellatio on someone may be referred to as the giving partner, and the other person as the receiving partner. Fellatio can be [[Sexual arousal|sexually arousing]] for participants, and males commonly experience [[orgasm]] and [[ejaculation]] of [[semen]] during the act.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; People may use fellatio as [[foreplay]] to sexually arouse their [[sex partner]] before [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]] or [[Anal sex|anal]] intercourse, or other [[sexual activity]],&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHS"/&gt; or they may use it as an [[Eroticism|erotic]] and [[physical intimacy|physically intimate act]] in its own right.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; Though a person who receives fellatio is male, his sex partner may be of either sex. When the penis is [[Pelvic thrust|thrust]] into someone's mouth, it may be called ''[[irrumatio]]'', though the term is rarely used.&lt;ref name="SL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/irrumatio|title=irrumatio in Sex-Lexis|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential aspect of fellatio is for a man's sex partner to take his penis into their mouth, and then move their mouth up and down the penis to a rhythm set by them mimicking the thrusting motion of vaginal or anal intercourse, with saliva acting as a lubricant, and being careful not to bite or scratch with the teeth.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; The man receiving fellatio can slow the rhythm of the stimulation by holding his partner's head. The man's partner may also orally play with his penis by licking, sucking, kissing or otherwise playing with the tongue and lips.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Fellatio may also include the oral stimulation of the scrotum, whether licking, sucking or taking the entire scrotum into the mouth.&lt;ref name="Kar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crooks"/&gt;

It is difficult for some people to perform fellatio, due to their sensitivities to the natural [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]]. Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, but some people learn to suppress the reflex. [[Deep-throating]] is an act in which a man's partner takes the entire erect penis deep into their mouth, in such a way as to enter their throat.

[[Nancy Friday]]'s book, ''Men in Love – Men's Sexual Fantasies: The Triumph of Love over Rage,'' suggests that swallowing semen is high on a man's intimacy scale.&lt;ref&gt;''Men in Love - Men's Sexual Fantasies: The Triumph of Love over Rage'' (1982) by [[Nancy Friday]]. {{ISBN|978-0-440-15903-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man receiving fellatio receives direct sexual stimulation, while his partner may derive satisfaction from giving him pleasure. Giving and receiving fellatio may happen simultaneously in sex positions like [[69 (sex position)|69]] and [[Sex position#Group sex|daisy chain]].

Fellatio is sometimes practiced when penile penetration would create a physical difficulty for a sex partner. For example, it may be practiced during pregnancy instead of vaginal intercourse by couples wishing to engage in intimate sexual activity while avoiding the difficulty of vaginal intercourse during later stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com/400_is-it-safe-to-swallow-semen-during-pregnancy_510175_1000.bc |title=Is it safe to swallow semen during pregnancy? |publisher=BabyCenter |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be other reasons why a woman may not wish to have vaginal intercourse, such as apprehension of losing her virginity, of becoming pregnant,&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt; or she may be [[menstruation|menstruating]].

It is physically possible for men who have sufficient flexibility, penis size or a combination of the two to perform fellatio by oneself as a form of [[masturbation]]; this is called [[autofellatio]]. Few men possess sufficient flexibility and penis length to safely perform the necessary [[frontbend]].&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iWmsV0n0mNYC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=autofellation+and+really Savage Love]'', page 242 (Plume 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taste and odor===

It may be that "few women praise the taste" of semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bechtel|first1=Stefan|last2=Stains|first2=Laurence Roy|last3=Stains|first3= Larry|title=What Women Want: What Every Man Needs to Know About Sex, Romance, Passion and Pleasure|date=1 April 2000|publisher=Rodale Press|isbn=1579540937|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with [[breast milk]], the taste of semen may be altered by diet.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2018}} There are anecdotal reports that higher red meat and dairy intake may increase its generally salty taste.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2018}} Asparagus has been noted to cause bitterness, while parsley, celery, cinnamon, and many kinds of fruit (especially tropical) are noted to sweeten it.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Health aspects==

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[gonorrhea]], [[herpes simplex virus|herpes]], [[hepatitis]] (multiple strains), and other [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs), can be transmitted through oral sex.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web| title = Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance| publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)| year = 2008| accessdate = December 6, 2011|url =https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/surv2008-Complete.pdf}} Also see [https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/2008survFactSheet.PDF Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert J.

There is an increased risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth, or [[Bleeding on probing|bleeding gums]].&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Oral Sex and HIV Risk |date=June 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/Factsheets/pdf/oralsex.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510210937/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/Factsheets/pdf/oralsex.pdf |archivedate=May 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; These wounds, even when they are [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of the aforementioned factors, medical sources advise the use of [[condom]]s or [[Safe sex#Barrier protection|other effective barrier methods]] when performing or receiving fellatio with a partner whose STI status is unknown.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

===HPV and oral cancer link===
Links have been reported between oral sex and [[oral cancer]] with human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oralcancerfoundation.org/hpv/index.htm |title=The HPV Connection |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227175640/http://www.oralcancerfoundation.org/hpv/index.htm |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 research study suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with HPV might increase the risk of oral cancer. The study found that 36 percent of the cancer patients had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medindia.net/news/view_news_main.asp?x=5822 |title=Oral Sex Linked To Mouth Cancer Risk |publisher=MedIndia |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study suggested a [[correlation]] between oral sex and [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV, a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'Souza G |title=Case-control study of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer |journal=N.

===Pregnancy and semen exposure===
{{See also|Paternal tolerance}}

Fellatio cannot result in [[pregnancy]], as there is no way for ingested [[sperm]] to reach the [[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s to fertilize an [[ovum|egg]]. At any rate, acids in the stomach and [[digestive enzyme]]s in the [[digestive tract]] break down and kill spermatozoa.

Clinical research has tentatively linked fellatio with immune modulation,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1803978.stm |title=Sex 'primes woman for sperm'. |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-02-06 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating it may reduce the chance of complications during pregnancy. The potentially fatal complication [[pre-eclampsia]] was observed to occur less in women who regularly engaged in fellatio, with those who also ingested their partner's [[semen]] being at the least risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koelman |year=2000 |title=Correlation between oral sex and a low incidence of preeclampsia: A role for soluble HLA in seminal fluid? |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=46 |pages=155–166 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(99)00062-5 |pmid=10706945 |first1=CA |issue=2 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were consistent with the fact that semen contains [[TGF beta 1|TGF-β1]], the exchange of which between partners having a causal reduction in risk of pre-eclampsia caused by an [[immunological]] reaction. It is worth noting that fellatio is not the only viable mechanism for the transmission of [[TGF beta 1|TGF-β1]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor RN (1997) "Review: Immunobiology of preeclampsia" American Journal of Reproductive Immunology Volume 37 pp. 79-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaouat et al., (2005) "Fourth International Workshop on Immunology of Pre-eclampsia, December 2004, Reunion, France" Journal of Reproductive Immunology Volume 67 pp. 103-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==

===Semen ingestion===
{{See also|Semen#Ingestion}}
As late as 1976, some doctors were advising women in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy not to swallow semen lest it induce premature labor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pregnant Couple's Guide to Sex, Romance, and Intimacy|author1=Sandra Margot |author2=Tonianne Robino |isbn=978-0-8065-2323-1|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is now known to be safe.

Semen ingestion has had central importance in some cultures around the world. In [[Baruya people|Baruya]] culture, there is a secret ritual in which boys give fellatio to young males and drink their semen, to "re-engender themselves before marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=New Left Review - Jack Goody: The Labyrinth of Kinship |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Sambia people]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], beginning at age seven all males regularly submit to oral penetration by adolescents in a six-stage initiation process, as the Sambia believe that regular ingestion of an older boy's semen is necessary for a prepubescent youth to achieve sexual maturity and masculinity. By the time he enters mid-puberty he in turn participates in passing his semen on to younger males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Virginity===

Oral sex is commonly used as a means of preserving [[virginity]], especially among heterosexual pairings; this is sometimes termed ''[[technical virginity]]'' (which additionally includes anal sex, [[mutual masturbation]] and other [[non-penetrative sex]] acts, but excludes penile-vaginal sex).&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ken Plummer | title = Modern Homosexualities: Fragments of Lesbian and Gay Experiences | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2002 | pages = 187–191 | accessdate = August 24, 2013|isbn =1134922426 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSO3q4XEfz4C&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage|quote=The social construction of 'sex' as vaginal intercourse affects how other forms of sexual activity are evaluated as sexually satisfying or arousing; in some cases whether an activity is seen as a sexual act at all.

===Legality===
{{See also|Islamic views on oral sex}}

Fellatio is legal in most countries. Laws of some jurisdictions regard fellatio as [[Sexual penetration|penetrative sex]] for the purposes of [[Sex and the law|sexual offenses]] with regard to the act, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice, in contrast to anal sex or [[extramarital sex]]. In [[Islam]]ic literature, the only forms of sexual activity that are consistently explicitly prohibited within marriage are anal sex and sexual activity during [[menstrual cycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.understanding-islam.com/q-and-a/social-issues/regarding-oral-sex-5555 |title=Regarding 'Oral Sex' |publisher=Understanding-islam.com |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact attitude towards oral sex is a subject of disagreements between modern scholars of Islam. Authorities considering it "objectionable" do so because of the penis's supposedly impure fluids coming in contact with the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/fatwa_oral_desai.html |title=Articles and Essays |publisher=Zawaj.Com |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others emphasize that there is no decisive evidence to forbid oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543892 |title=Islam's Stance on Oral Sex - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |publisher=IslamonLine.net |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324080602/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Islamonline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543892 |archivedate=2010-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Malaysia]], fellatio is illegal, but the law is seldom enforced. Under Malaysia's Section 377A of the Penal Code, the introduction of the penis into the anus or mouth of another person is considered a "carnal intercourse against the order of nature" and is punishable with imprisonment of 20 years maximum and whipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]''|date=March 1, 2009|accessdate=December 9, 2010|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/3/1/focus/3375398&amp;sec=focus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622074655/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F3%2F1%2Ffocus%2F3375398&amp;sec=focus|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 22, 2011|title=Illegal but not abnormal|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tradition===
[[File:Depiction of fellatio on Attic red-figure kylix, c. 510 BC.jpg|thumb|180px|Depiction of fellatio on Attic red-figure kylix, c. 510 BC]]
Galienus called fellatio ''lesbiari'' since women of the island of [[Lesbos]] were supposed to have introduced the practice of using one's lips to give sexual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/priap/prp105.htm |title=Priapeia, translated by Leonard Smithers and Richard Francis Burton: Irrumation |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KamaSutra08.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Oral sex depicted in the [[Kama Sutra]]]]
The [[India|Ancient Indian]] [[Kama Sutra]], dating from the first century AD, describes oral sex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamashastra.com/kama209.htm |title=The actual kama sutra or kamasutra: Part II: On Sexual Union: Chapter IX. On Holding the Lingam in the Mouth by Kamashastra |publisher=Kamashastra.com |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313043325/http://www.kamashastra.com/kama209.htm |archivedate=2010-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; discussing fellatio in great detail (the Kama Sutra has a chapter on ''auparishtaka'' (or ''oparishtaka''), "mouth congress")&lt;ref name=Badger&gt;{{cite web|url=http://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2003/04/09/the_ageold_question_.php |title=The age-old question: Spit or swallow? |publisher=The Badger Herald |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only briefly mentioning [[cunnilingus]]. However, according to the Kama Sutra, fellatio is above all a characteristic of [[eunuch]]s (or, according to other translations, of [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] or [[Trans woman|transwomen]] similar to the modern [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] of India), who use their mouths as a substitute for female [[Sex organ|genitalia]].

The author of the Kama Sutra states that it is also practiced by "unchaste women", but mentions that there are widespread traditional concerns about this being a degrading or unclean practice, with known practitioners being evaded as love partners in large parts of the country. The author appears to somewhat agree with these attitudes, claiming that "a wise man" should not engage in that form of intercourse while acknowledging that it can be appropriate in some unspecified cases.

The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture of ancient [[Peru]] worshipped daily life including sexual acts. They depicted fellatio in their ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Berrin, Katherine &amp; Larco Museum.

In 1917-1918, around 7,555,190 speeches were given in 5,200 communities&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0767917189&lt;/ref&gt;. The topics dealt with the American war effort in the First World War and were presented during the four minutes between reels changing in movie theaters across the country. Also, the speeches were made to be four minutes so that they could be given at town meetings, restaurants, and other places that had an audience. This is an instance of "viral marketing" before its time.

== History==
{{Main|Presidency of Woodrow Wilson#Propaganda}}
On April, 6th 1917 the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] declared war on Germany. President Wilson was determined to rouse the public.

Wilson established the first modern propaganda office, the [[Committee on Public Information]] (CPI), headed by [[George Creel]].&lt;ref&gt;George Creel,  [https://archive.org/details/howweadvertameri00creerich ''How We Advertised America: The First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information That Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe.'' (1920)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vaughn, ''Holding Fast the Inner Lines: Democracy, Nationalism, and the Committee on Public Information'' (1980). [https://www.questia.com/library/1664084/holding-fast-the-inner-lines-democracy-nationalism online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Creel set out to systematically reach every person in the United States multiple times with patriotic information about how the individual could contribute to the war effort. It also worked with the post office to censor seditious counter-propaganda.   Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the Four Minute Men.  CPI created colorful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Adams, ''Progressive Politics and the Training of America’s Persuaders'' (1999) &lt;/ref&gt; Movie theaters were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four-minute breaks needed to change reels.  They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and even logging camps. Speeches were mostly in English, but ethnic groups were reached in their own languages.
[[File:111-SC-16569 - NARA - 55193236.jpg|thumb|left|Douglas Fairbanks delivering a speech in support of the 3rd Liberty Loan]]

CPI Director [[George Creel]] boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people.  The speakers attended training sessions through local universities, and were given pamphlets and speaking tips on a wide variety of topics, such as buying Liberty Bonds, registering for the draft, rationing food, recruiting unskilled workers for munitions jobs, and supporting Red Cross programs.  Ethnic groups were reached in their own languages.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mastrangelo,  "World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation." ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;Committee on public information, ''Complete Report of the Committee on Public Information: 1917, 1918, 1919'' (1920) [https://archive.org/details/CompleteReportCommitteeOnPublicInformation191719181919 online free]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose==
With many millions of [[German Americans]] in the United States, as well as [[Irish Americans]] and [[Scandinavian Americans]] and poor rural Southerners, with strong isolationist feelings, there was a strong need for a [[propaganda]] campaign to stir support for the war. This effort had many unique challenges to meet to address the existing [[political climate]]. Wilson needed to speak directly to the fragmented and spread out audience in the United States.  He had to address the country's self-perception to generate support for the war. The Four-Minute Men provided an answer to these challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mastrangelo,  "World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation." ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Four Minute Men urged citizens to purchase [[Liberty Bonds]] and Thrift Stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qhRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA796|title=The American Year Book: A Record of Events and Progress, Volume 1918|date=1919|publisher=T.

==Addressing challenges==
The Four Minute Men idea became a useful tool in the propaganda campaign because it addressed a specific [[rhetorical situation]]. One of the challenges of the effort was the fragmented audience of the United States. Many different heritages were represented in the United States, and the president needed their support for the war. To address each groups specific needs, the director of the Four Minute Men, William McCormick Blair, delegated the duty of speaking to local men. Well known and respected community figures often volunteered for the Four Minute Men program. This gave the speeches a local voice. Also, the four minute men were given general topics and talking points to follow and rotated between theaters to help the speeches seem fresh, instead of generic propaganda speeches.

These speeches usually celebrated Woodrow Wilson as a larger than life character and the Germans as less-than-human huns. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0767917189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The four minute men was a division of the Committee on Public Information, headed by [[George Creel]]. The Committee on Public Information appointed William McCormick Blair as director of the Four Minute Men. Blair appointed state chairmen of the Four Minute Men, who then would appoint a city or community chairman. Each of these appointments needed to be approved in Washington. The local chairman would then appoint a number of speakers to cover the theaters in the city or community for which he is responsible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2834">'''Galactic Bridges and Tails''' is a computer animation film created in 1972 by astrophysicists [[Alar Toomre]] and [http://lcd-www.colorado.edu/jtoomre/ Juri Toomre]. The brothers created the film as a teaching aid to accompany their 1972 landmark research paper of the same name, published in ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]'', which described [[interacting galaxy|galaxy collisions]] and [[galaxy merger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Galactic Bridges and Tails |last1=Toomre |first1=Alar |last2=Toomre |first2=Juri |publisher=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |date=December 1972 |doi=10.1086/151823 |access-date=13 July 2016 |bibcode=1972ApJ...178..623T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology of the original animated film ==
The Toomre film contains both [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics]] simulations of colliding galaxies. The animations are [[time-lapse]]s that compress billions of years into just a few minutes. Written in the [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] programming language, the simulations sent character and vector information to a CRT-based [[ASCII]] character film recorder. The film recorder exposed multiple frames of [[16mm]] film to create the final animated film.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kinotonik.net/mindcine/toomre/ |title=Galactic Bridges and Tails (Film Restoration) |last=Lauter |first=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geoprofessions''' is a term coined by the Geoprofessional Business Association to connote various technical disciplines that involve engineering, earth and environmental services applied to below-ground (“subsurface”), ground-surface, and ground-surface-connected conditions, structures, or formations. The principal disciplines include, as major categories:
* [[geomatics engineering]]
* [[#Geotechnical-engineering specialties|geotechnical engineering]];
* [[#Engineering geology and other geology specialties|geology and engineering geology]];
* [[#Geological engineering|geological engineering]];
* [[#Geophysics|geophysics]];
* [[#Geophysical engineering|geophysical engineering]];
* [[#Environmental-science and environmental-engineering specialties|environmental science and environmental engineering]];
* [[#Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET)|construction-materials engineering and testing]]; and
* [[#Other geoprofessional services|other geoprofessional services]].

Each discipline involves specialties, many of which are recognized through professional designations that governments and societies or associations confer based upon a person’s education, training, experience, and educational accomplishments. In the United States, engineers must be licensed in the state or territory where they practice engineering. Most states license geologists and several license environmental “site professionals.” Several states license engineering geologists and recognize geotechnical engineering through a geotechnical-engineering titling act.

==Geotechnical-engineering specialties==
{{main|Geotechnical engineering}}
Although geotechnical engineering is applied for a variety of purposes, it is essential to foundation design. As such, geotechnical engineering is applicable to every existing or new structure on the planet; every building and every highway, bridge, tunnel, harbor, airport, water line, reservoir, or other public work. Commonly, the geotechnical-engineering service comprises a study of subsurface conditions using various sampling, in-situ testing, and/or other site-characterization techniques. The instrument of professional service in those cases typically is a report through which geotechnical engineers relate the information they have been retained to provide, typically: their findings; their opinions about subsurface materials and conditions; their judgment about how the subsurface materials and conditions assumed to exist probably will behave when subjected to loads or used as building material; and their preliminary recommendations for materials usage or appropriate foundation systems, the latter based on their knowledge of a structure’s size, shape, weight, etc., and the subsurface/structure interactions likely to occur. [[Civil engineers]], [[structural engineers]], and [[architects]], feasibly among other members of the project team, apply the geotechnical findings and preliminary recommendations to take the structure’s design forward. They realize these preliminary recommendations are subject to change, however, because – as a matter of practical necessity related to the [[Observational method (geotechnics)|observational method]] inherent to geotechnical engineering – geotechnical engineers base their recommendations on the composition of samples taken from a tiny portion of a site whose actual subsurface conditions are unknowable before excavation, because they are hidden by earth and/or rock and/or water. For this reason, as a key component of a complete geotechnical engineering service, geotechnical engineers employ construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) to observe subsurface materials as they are exposed through excavation. To help achieve economies on their clients’ behalf, geotechnical engineers assign their field representatives – specially educated and trained paraprofessionals – to observe the excavated materials and the excavations themselves in light of conditions the geotechnical engineers opined to exist. When differences are discovered, the geotechnical engineers evaluate the new findings and, when necessary, modify their design and construction recommendations. Because such changes could require other members of the design and construction team to modify their designs, specifications, and proposed methods, many owners have their geotechnical engineers serve as active members of the project team from project inception to conclusion, working with others to help ensure appropriate application of geotechnical information and judgments.

In other cases, geotechnical engineering goes beyond a study and construction recommendations to include design of soil and rock structures. The most common of these are the [[Road surface|pavements]] that make up our streets and highways, airport runways, and bridge and tunnel decks, among other paved improvements. Geotechnical engineers design the pavements in terms of the subgrade, subbase, and base layers of materials to be used, and the thickness and composition of each. Geotechnical engineers also design the earth-retention walls associated with structures such as levees, earthen dams, reservoirs, and landfills. In other cases, the design is applied to contain earth, via structures such as excavation-support systems and retaining walls. Sometimes referred to as geostructural engineering or geostructural design, these services are also intrinsic to [[hydraulic engineering]], [[Hydrogeological|hydrogeologic engineering]], [[coastal engineering]], geologic engineering and [[Civil engineering#Water resources engineering|water-resources engineering]]. Geotechnical-engineering design is also applied for structures such as tunnels, bridges, dams, and other structures beneath, on, or connected to the surface of the earth. Geotechnical engineering, like geology, engineering geology, and geologic engineering, also involves the specialties of [[rock mechanics]] and [[soil mechanics]], and often requires knowledge of [[geotextiles]] and [[geosynthetics]], as well as an array of instrumentation and monitoring equipment, to help ensure specified conditions are achieved and maintained.

[[Earthquake engineering]] and landslide detection, remediation, and prevention are geoprofessional services associated with specialized types of geotechnical engineering (as well as [[#Geophysics|geophysics]]; see below), as is forensic geotechnical engineering, a geoprofessional service applied to determine why a certain applicable type of event – usually a failure of some sort – occurred. (Virtually all geoprofessional services can be performed for forensic purposes, commonly as litigation-support/[[expert witness]] services.) [[Railway systems engineering|Railway-systems engineering]] is another type of specialized geotechnical engineering, as are the design of [[piers]] and [[Bulkhead (barrier)|bulkheads]], [[drydocks]], on-shore and off-shore [[Wind turbine|wind-turbine]] systems, and systems that stabilize [[oil platforms]] and other marine structures to the sea floor.

Geotechnical engineers have long been involved in [[sustainability]] initiatives, including  (among many others) the use of excavated materials; the safe application of contaminated subsurface materials; the recycling of asphalt, concrete, and building rubble and debris; and the design of [[permeable paving|permeable pavements]].

All [[Civil engineering|civil-engineering]] specialties and projects – roads and highways, bridges, rail systems, ports and other waterfront structures, airport terminals, etc. – require the involvement of geotechnical engineers and engineering, meaning that many civil-engineering pursuits are geoprofessional pursuits to a greater or lesser degree. However, geotechnical engineering has for centuries also been associated with [[military engineering]]; [[sappers]] (in general) and [[miners]] (whose tunneling design services (known as [[Mining (military)|landmining]] and [[Mining (military)|undermining]]) were used in military-siege operations).

==Engineering geology and other geology specialties==
{{main|Geology|Engineering geology}}
Engineering geologist.
(a) Elements of the engineering geologist specialty. 
The practice of engineering geology involves the interpretation, evaluation, analysis, and application of geological information and data to civil works. Geotechnical soil and rock units are designated, characterized, and classified, using standard engineering soil and rock classification systems. Relationships are interpreted between landform development, current and past geologic processes, ground and surface water, and the strength characteristics of soil and rock. Processes evaluated include both surficial processes (for example, slope, fluvial, and coastal processes), and deep-seated processes (for example, volcanic activity and seismicity). Geotechnical zones or domains are designated based on soil and rocked geological strength characteristics, common landforms, related geologic processes, or other pertinent factors. Proposed developmental modifications are evaluated and, where appropriate, analyzed to predict potential or likely changes in types and rates of surficial geologic processes. Proposed modifications may include such things as vegetation removal, using various types of earth materials in construction, applying loads to shallow or deep foundations, constructing cut or fill slopes and other grading, and modifying ground and surface water flow. The effects of surficial and deep-seated geologic processes are evaluated and analyzed to predict their potential effect on public health, public safety, land use, or proposed development.
(b) Typical engineering geologic applications and types of projects. Engineering geology is applied during all project phases, from conception through planning, design, construction, maintenance, and, in some cases, reclamation and closure. Planning-level engineering geologic work is commonly conducted in response to forest practice regulations, critical areas ordinances, and the State Environmental Policy Act. Typical planning-level engineering geologic applications include timber harvest planning, proposed location of residential and commercial developments and other buildings and facilities, and alternative route selection for roads, rail lines, trails, and utilities. Site-specific engineering geologic applications include cuts, fills, and tunnels for roads, trails, railroads, and utility lines; foundations for bridges and other drainage structures, retaining walls and shoring, dams, buildings, water towers, slope, channel and shoreline stabilization facilities, fish ladders and hatcheries, ski lifts and other structures; landings for logging and other work platforms; airport landing strips; rock bolt systems; blasting; and other major earthwork projects such as for aggregate sources and landfills.

While engineering geology is applicable principally to planning, design and construction activities, other specialties of geology are applied in a variety of geoprofessional specialty fields, such as [[mining geology]], [[petroleum geology]], and [[environmental geology]]. Note that mining geology and [[mining engineering]] are different geoprofessional fields.

==Geological engineering==
{{distinguish|Climate engineering}}
'''Geological engineering''' is a hybrid discipline that comprises elements of [[civil engineering]], [[mining engineering]], [[petroleum engineering]], and [[earth sciences]]. Geological engineers often become licensed as both engineers and geologists. There are thirteen geological-engineering (or '''geoengineering''') programs in the United States that are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET: (1) Colorado School of Mines, (2) Michigan Technological University, (3) Missouri University of Science and Technology, (4) Montana Tech of the University of Montana, (5) South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, (6) University of Alaska-Fairbanks, (7) [[University of Minnesota]] Twin Cities, (8) [[University of Mississippi]], (9) [[University of Nevada, Reno]] (10) University of North Dakota, (11) University of Texas at Austin, (12) University of Utah, and (13) University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Other schools offer programs or classes in geological engineering, including the [[University of Arizona]].

'''Geoengineering''' or '''geological engineering''', [[engineering geology]], and [[geotechnical engineering]] deal with the discovery, development, and production and use of subsurface earth resources, as well as the design and construction of [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. Geoengineering is the application of [[geosciences]], where mechanics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and geology are used to understand and shape our interaction with the earth.

Geoengineers work in areas of
# [[mining]], including surface and subsurface [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]]s, and [[rock burst]] mitigation
# energy, including [[hydraulic fracturing]] and [[Boring (earth)|drilling]] for exploration and production of water, oil, or gas
# infrastructure, including [[Rapid transit|underground transportation]] systems and isolation of [[nuclear waste|nuclear]] and [[hazardous waste]]s; and
# environment, including [[groundwater flow]], contaminant transport and remediation, and hydraulic structures.

Professional [[List of geoscience organizations|geoscience organizations]] such as the [[American Rock Mechanics Association]] or the [[Geo-Institute]] and academic degrees such as the bachelor of geoengineering accredited by [[ABET]] acknowledge the broad scope of work practiced by geoengineers and stress fundamentals of science and engineering methods for the solution of complex problems. Geoengineers study the mechanics of rock, [[soil mechanics|soil]], and fluids to improve the sustainable use of earth’s finite resources, where problems appear with competing interests, for example, groundwater and waste isolation, [[Offshore drilling|offshore]] [[oil drilling]] and risk of spills, natural gas production and [[induced seismicity]].

==Geophysics==
{{main|Geophysics|Exploration geophysics}}
Geophysics is the study of the physical properties of the earth using quantitative physical methods to determine what lies beneath the earth's surface.  The physical properties of concern include the propagation of elastic waves (seismic), magnetism, gravity, electrical resistivity/conductivity, and electromagnetism.  Geophysics has historically been most commonly used in oil exploration and mining, but its popularity in non-destructive investigative work has flourished since the early 1990s.  It is also used in groundwater exploration and protection, geo-hazard studies (e.g., faults and landslides), alignment studies (e.g., proposed roadway, underground utilities, and pipelines), foundation studies, contamination characterization and remediation, landfill investigations, unexploded-ordnance investigations, vibration monitoring, dam-safety evaluation, location of underground storage tanks, identification of subsurface voids, and assisting in archeological investigations. (definition from Association of Environmental &amp; Engineering Geologists)

==Geophysical engineering==
'''Geophysical engineering''' is the application of geophysics to the engineering design of facilities including roads, tunnels, and mines.

==Environmental-science and environmental-engineering specialties==
{{main|Environmental science|Environmental engineering}}
Environmental science and environmental engineering are the geoprofessions commonly associated with the identification, remediation, and prevention of environmental contamination. These services range from phase-one and phase-two [[Environmental Site Assessment|environmental site-assessments]] – research designed to assess the likelihood that a property is contaminated and subsurface exploration conducted to identify the nature and extent of contamination, respectively – up through the design of processes and systems to remediate contaminated sites for the protection of human health and the environment.

[[Environmental geology]] is one of the principal geoprofessions engaged in assessing and remediating contaminated sites. Environmental geologists help identify the subsurface [[stratigraphy]] in which contaminants are located and through which they migrate. [[Environmental chemistry]] is the geoprofession that encompasses the study of chemical compounds in the soil.  These compounds are categorized as pollutants or contaminants when introduced into the environment by human factors (e.g., waste, mining processes, radioactive release) and are not of natural origin. Environmental chemistry assesses interactions or these compounds with soil, rock, and water to determine their fate and transport, the techniques to measure the levels of contaminants in the environment, and technologies to destroy or reduce the toxicity of contaminants in wastes or compounds that have been released to the environment. [[Environmental engineering]] is often applied to assess contaminated sites, but more often is used in the design of systems to remediate contaminated soil and groundwater.

[[Hydrogeology]] is the geoprofession involved when environmental studies involve subsurface water. Hydrogeology applications range from securing safe, plentiful underground drinking-water sources to identifying the nature of groundwater contamination in order to facilitate remediation. [[Environmental toxicology]] is a geoprofession when used to identify the source, fate, transformation, effects, and risks of pollutants on the environment, including soil, water, and air. [[Society of Wetland Scientists|Wetlands science]] is a geoprofessional pursuit that incorporates several scientific disciplines, such as [[botany]], [[biology]], and [[limnology]]. It involves, among other activities, the delineation, conservation, restoration, and preservation of wetlands. These services are sometimes conducted by geoprofessional specialists called [[Society of Wetland Scientists|wetlands scientists]]. [[Ecology]] is a closely related environmental geoprofession involving studies into the distribution of organisms and biodiversity within an environmental context.
 
Numerous geoprofessional disciplines contribute to the redevelopment of [[brownfields]], sites (typically urban) that are underused or abandoned because they are or are assumed to be contaminated by hazardous materials. Geoprofessionals are engaged to evaluate the degree to which such sites are contaminated and the steps that can be taken to achieve the sites’ safe reuse. Environmental engineers and scientists work with developers to identify and design remediation strategies and exposure-barrier designs that protect future site users from unacceptable exposure to environmental contamination resulting from previous uses of the site. Because these previous uses often resulted in degraded soil conditions and the presence of abandoned, underground structures, geotechnical engineers often are needed to design special foundations for the new structures.

==Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET)==
Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) comprises an array of licensed-engineer-directed professional services applied principally for purposes of construction quality assurance and quality control. CoMET services commonly are provided as a separate discipline by firms that also practice geotechnical engineering, possibly among other geoprofessional disciplines. The geoprofessional-service industry has evolved in this manner because geotechnical engineering employs the observational method. [[Karl von Terzaghi]] and [[Ralph B. Peck]] – the creators of modern geotechnical engineering – used the [[Observational method (geotechnics)|observational method]] and multiple working hypotheses to expedite and economize the subsurface-exploration process, by using sampling and testing to form a judgment about subsurface conditions, and then observing excavated conditions and materials to confirm or modify those judgments and related recommendations, and then finalize them. To economize still further, geoprofessionals educated and trained paraprofessionals to represent them on site (hence the term “field representative”), especially to apply their judgment (much as a geotechnical engineer would) in comparing observed conditions with those the geotechnical engineer believed would exist. Over time, geotechnical engineers expanded their CoMET services by providing the additional education and training their field representatives needed to evaluate constructors’ attainment of conditions commonly specified by geoprofessionals; e.g., subsurface preparation for foundations of buildings, roadways, and other structures; materials used for subgrade, subbase, and base purposes; site grading; construction of earthen structures (earth dams, levees, reservoirs, landfills, et al.) and earth-retaining structures (e.g., retaining walls); and so on. Because many of the materials involved, such as concrete, are used in other elements of construction projects and structures, geoprofessional firms expanded their field representatives’ skill sets still more, to encompass observation and testing of numerous additional materials (e.g., reinforced concrete, structural steel, masonry, wood, and fireproofing), processes (e.g., cutting and filling and rebar placement), and outcomes (e.g., the effectiveness of welds). Laboratory services are a common element of many CoMET operations. Also operating under the direction of a licensed engineer, they are applied in geotechnical engineering to evaluate subsurface-material samples. In overall CoMET operations, laboratories operate with the equipment and personnel required to evaluate a variety of construction materials.

CoMET services applied to evaluate the actual composition of a site’s subsurface are part of a complete geotechnical engineering service. For purposes of short-term economy, however, some owners select a firm not associated with the geotechnical engineer of record to provide these and all other CoMET services. This approach precludes the geotechnical engineer of record from providing a complete service. It also aggravates risk, because the individuals engaged to evaluate actual subsurface conditions are not “briefed” by the geotechnical engineer of record before they go to the project site and seldom communicate with the geotechnical engineer of record when they discern differences, in large part because the firm associated with the geotechnical engineer of record is regarded as a competitor of the firm employing the field representatives. In some cases, the field representatives in question lack the specific project background information and/or the education and training required to discern those differences.

CoMET services applied to evaluate constructor’s attainment of specified conditions take the form of quality-assurance (QA) or quality-control (QC) services. QA services are performed directly or indirectly for the owner. The owner specifies the nature and extent of QA services that the owner believes is appropriate. Some owners specify none at all or only those that may be required by law. Those required by law are imposed via a jurisdiction’s [[building code]]. Almost all U.S. jurisdictions base their building codes on “model codes” developed by associations of building officials. The [[International Code Council|International Code Council (ICC)]] is the most prominent of these groups and its [[International Building Code (IBC)]] is the most commonly used model. As a result, many jurisdictions now require IBC “Special Inspection,” a term defined by the IBC as “the required examination of the materials, installation, fabrication, erection, or placement of components and connections requiring special expertise to ensure compliance with approved construction documents and referenced standards.” Special Inspection requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on the provisions adopted by the local building official. While some of the services involved may be similar to or the same as conventional CoMET services, Special Inspection is handled differently. Most commonly, the owner or the owner’s agent is required to retain a building-official-approved Special Inspection-services provider. Special Inspection is often required to obtain a certificate of occupancy.

QC services are those applied by or on behalf of a constructor to ensure the constructor has attained conditions the constructor has contractually agreed to attain. Most CoMET consultants are engaged far more to provide QA services than QC services.

Many CoMET procedures are specified in standards developed by [[Standards organization#Standard-developing organizations .28SDOs.29|standards-developing organizations (SDOs)]] such as the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)]], [[ASTM International]], and [[American Concrete Institute|American Concrete Institute (ACI)]], using standards-development protocols approved by the [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standards Institute (ANSI)]] and/or the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]]. All such standards identify what is minimally required to conform. Likewise, several organizations have developed programs to accredit CoMET field and laboratory services to perform certain types of testing and inspection. Some of these programs are more comprehensive than others; e.g., requiring regular calibration of equipment, participation in proficiency testing programs, and implementation and documentation of a (quality) management system to demonstrate technical competence. As with all such programs, of course, accreditation identifies what is least acceptable. Many CoMET laboratories go far beyond minimum requirements in an effort to attain higher levels of quality.

A variety of organizations – including local building departments – have developed personnel-certification protocols and requirements. In many jurisdictions, only appropriately certified individuals are permitted to perform certain evaluations. Individuals typically are required to meet certain prerequisites for certification and must pass examinations, in some cases involving performance observation in the field. The prerequisite for higher degrees of certification often include a requirement that the individual has met requirements for a lower degree of certification (e.g., Soils Technician I is in some cases a prerequisite for Soils Technician II). It should be noted that field representatives are sometimes referred to as “soil testers,” “technicians,” “technicians/technologists,” or “engineering technicians.” The Geoprofessional Business Association developed the term “field representative” to encompass all the many types of paraprofessionals involved (e.g., those involved with specific types of materials, such as reinforced concrete, soil, or steel; those who observe or inspect processes or conditions, such as welding inspectors, caisson inspectors, and foundation inspectors), and especially to underscore their significant, mutual responsibility, that purpose titles such as “technician” fail to signify. In fact, the engineers who direct CoMET operations are personally and professionally responsible and liable for their field representatives’ acts and statements while representing the engineer on site.

Especially because CoMET consultants have more hands-on experience with construction activities than many other design-team members, many owners involve them (among other geoprofessionals) from the outset of a project, during the design phase, to help the owner and/or design team members develop technical specifications and establish testing and inspection requirements, instrumentation requirements and procedures, and observation programs. Geotechnical engineers employ CoMET services during the earliest stages of a project, to oversee subsurface sampling procedures, such as drilling.

Many of the CoMET services performed for construction projects are performed for environmental projects as well, but requirements tend to be less rigid because they involve fewer licensing and related requirements. For example, individuals may perform federally mandated all-appropriate inquiries – typically a phase-one environmental site assessment – without a license of any kind.

==Other geoprofessional services==
To the extent that [[archeology]] and [[paleontology]] require systematic subsurface excavation to recover artifacts, they, too, are considered geoprofessions. Many geoprofessional-services firms offer these services to those of their clients that need to satisfy federal and/or state regulations that require paleontological and/or archeological inquiry before site development or redevelopment activities can proceed.

[[Image:Great Australian Bight Marine Park.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Great Australian Bight]]

The '''Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System''' is a seasonal [[upwelling]] system in the eastern [[Great Australian Bight]], extending from [[Ceduna, South Australia]], to [[Portland, Victoria]], over a distance of about {{convert|800|km|mi}}. Upwelling events occur in the austral summer (from November to May) when seasonal winds blow from the southeast. These winds blow parallel to the shoreline at certain areas of the coast, which forces coastal waters offshore via [[Ekman transport]] and draws up cold, nutrient-rich waters from the ocean floor.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

Because the deep water carries abundant nutrients up from the [[ocean floor]], the upwelling area differs from the rest of the Great Australian Bight, especially the areas offshore of [[Western Australia]] and the [[Nullabor]] in [[South Australia]], which are generally nutrient-poor. Every summer, the upwelling sustains a bountiful ecosystem that attracts [[blue whale]]s and supports rich [[fishery|fisheries]].&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

The Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System (GSACUS) is [[Australia]]'s only deep-reaching coastal upwelling system, with nutrient-enriched water stemming from depths exceeding {{convert|300|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Preconditioning"&gt;Kämpf, J., 2010. On the preconditioning of coastal upwelling in the eastern Great Australian Bight. Journal of Geophysical Research – Oceans, VOL. 115, C12071, 11 pp., {{doi|10.1029/2010JC006294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a new upwelling centre has been discovered on the western shelf of Tasmania.&lt;ref name="Tasmania"&gt;Kämpf, J., 2015. Phytoplankton blooms on the western shelf of Tasmania: evidence of a highly productive ecosystem, Ocean Sci., 11, 1-11. {{doi|10.5194/os-11-1-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this new upwelling centre is located outside South Australian waters, the entire upwelling system should be rather called the '''Great Southern Australian Coastal Upwelling System'''.

==Oceanographic processes==

During the austral summer, [[high-pressure system]]s over the Great Australian Bight cause southeasterly winds to blow over the coasts of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and South Australia. When winds blow parallel to the shoreline, [[Ekman transport]] pushes water to the left of the wind direction (in the southern hemisphere), which in this case is westward and offshore. To replace the water moving offshore, cold waters from the ocean floor rise to the surface.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|9–10}} During upwelling events, local sea surface temperature drops by  2-3 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Key upwelling centres form in three different locations, described in the sub-sections below; the Kangaroo Island and Eyre Peninsula centres are linked by the same upwelling process.&lt;ref name="Conservation"&gt;Butler, A. J., F. Althaus, D. M. Furlani, and K. R. Ridgway.

===Bonney Upwelling===

The Bonney Upwelling is the largest and most predictable upwelling in the GSACUS. It stretches from [[Portland, Victoria]] to [[Robe, South Australia]]. The [[continental shelf]] is narrow offshore of the "Bonney Coast" - only about {{convert|20|km|mi}} from the shore to the [[continental slope]] - and deep water is funneled to the surface through a series of [[submarine canyon]]s.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|4;24–26}}&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Kangaroo Island and Eyre Peninsula===

Upwelling at [[Kangaroo Island]] and the [[Eyre Peninsula]] is different than at the Bonney Upwelling. Here, the [[continental shelf]] is generally much wider than at the Bonney Coast - up to {{convert|100|km|mi}} wide off the Eyre Peninsula - and water is not drawn directly from the seafloor to the surface. Instead, field data and hydrodynamic modelling suggest that the upwelling follows from a chain of processes.&lt;ref name="Preconditioning"/&gt; This chain of processes starts in the deep submarine canyons of the Murray Canyon Group, located south of Kangaroo Island, where localized sub-surface upwelling brings a pool of cold water from the [[abyssal plains]] up to the continental shelf. This dense-water pool, named the ''Kangaroo Island Pool'', drifts along the shelf bottom just offshore of Kangaroo Island and the Eyre Peninsula. When a classical wind-driven upwelling event occurs, normally two to three times a summer, cold water is upwelled from the pool, not directly from the [[ocean floor]].&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|1–3}}&lt;ref name="Alongshore"&gt;McClatchie, S., J. F. Middleton, and T. M. Ward (2006), Water mass and alongshore variation in upwelling intensity in the eastern Great Australian Bight, J. Geophys. Res., 111, C08007, {{doi|10.1029/2004JC002699}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Der Borch, C.C., J.R. Conolly, R.S.

==Ecology==
[[File:Nyctiphanes australis.jpg|thumb|alt=Australian Krill|Large swarms of [[krill]], ''[[Nyctiphanes australis]]'', form during upwelling events.]]
[[File:Blue Whale 001 body bw.jpg|thumb|alt=Blue Whale|An abundance of krill makes the Bonney Upwelling an important feeding site for the [[Blue Whale]] (''Balaenoptera musculus'')]]

Extensive upwelling of nutrient-rich water makes the GSACUS an important marine hot spot on Australia's southern shelves. During upwelling events, the abundance of the GSACUS ecosystem can approach that of some of the world’s most productive upwelling centers, such as those offshore of [[Humboldt Current|Peru]], [[California Current|California]], and [[Benguela Current#Upwelling and primary production|Namibia]].&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, T. M., McLeay, L. J., Dimmlich, W. F., Rogers, P. J., McClatchie, S., Matthews, R., Kämpf, J. and Van Ruth, P. D. (2006), Pelagic ecology of a northern boundary current system: effects of upwelling on the production and distribution of sardine (Sardinops sagax), anchovy (Engraulis australis) and southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) in the Great Australian Bight. Fisheries Oceanography, 15: 191–207. {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2419.2006.00353.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During upwelling events, surface [[chlorophyll a]] concentrations, an indicator of phytoplankton abundance, increase tenfold.&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Phytoplankton blooms bring about swarms of [[krill]], which in turn attract [[blue whale]]s. Blue whales are found in various locations off the southeast coast of Australia, but most predominantly in the Bonney Upwelling region, which is one of 12 identified blue whale feeding sites worldwide. Marine biologist Peter Gill estimates that 100 blue whales visit the Bonney Upwelling area every year, ranging over {{convert|18,000|km2|sqmi}} of ocean from [[Robe, South Australia]] to [[Cape Otway]] in [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]. The feeding grounds may extend further northwest, encompassing the rest of the GSACUS, but incomplete whale surveys are insufficient to establish their true range.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|2; 20–24}}&lt;ref name="Diary"&gt;Clevers, Jeni. [http://www.abc.net.au/nature/bigblue/diary.htm Producer's Diary]. ‘’The Big Blue’’. [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], 2007. Accessed 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other marine life that thrives in the upwelling includes filter feeders like [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, [[bryozoan]]s, and [[coral]]s. These animals feed predators such as seabirds, fishes, [[Australian fur seal]]s, and [[penguin]]s.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|ii}} The upwelling plays also an important role in the life cycle of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (''[[Thunnus maccoyii]]''), which accumulate in the eastern Great Australian Bight during the upwelling season and feed on sardines (''[[Sardinops sagax]]'') and anchovies (''[[Engraulis australis]]'').&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willis, J., and Hobday, A.

===Economic Importance===

The GSACUS supports a productive fishery, and local fishers recognize the bounty that the upwelling provides them.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|26}} Every November, [[Portland, Victoria]] hosts an [http://www.upwellingfestival.com.au Upwelling Festival] to celebrate the abundance of the Bonney Upwelling, and to begin the summer fishing season.&lt;ref name="Festival"/&gt;

Humans have exploited the GSACUS for thousands of years. Oral histories of local Aboriginal tribes indicate a close connection to the ocean, and said tribes may possibly have eaten [[beached whale]]s.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|36}} The [[Convincing Ground massacre]], which took place near [[Portland, Victoria]] in 1829, arose over a dispute between [[Whaling in Australia|European whalers]] and the [[Gunditjmara people]] over ownership of a beached whale.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Ian D. Clark, pp17-22, ''Scars on the Landscape.

Today, [[southern rock lobster]] (referred to locally as crayfish) and [[trawling]] are the most important fishing industries in the Bonney Upwelling.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|ii;28}} whereas the upwelling off the Eyre Peninsula supports a large sardine fishery, operating chiefly out of [[Port Lincoln, South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Alongshore"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sasardines.com.au/links-resources.html |title=South Australian Sardine Industry Inc |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

Next to the [[Great Barrier Reef]], the GSACUS and its ecosystem can be regarded as one of Australia's natural wonders. Due to its importance as a blue whale feeding and aggregation site, in 2002 the Bonney Upwelling was listed as critical habitat "requiring effective protection from user impacts"&lt;ref&gt;Australia.

The overarching goals of green chemistry—namely, more resource-efficient and inherently safer design of molecules, materials, products, and processes—can be pursued in a wide range of contexts.{{Quote box

==History==
Green chemistry emerged from a variety of existing ideas and research efforts (such as [[atom economy]] and [[catalysis]]) in the period leading up to the 1990s, in the context of increasing attention to problems of chemical pollution and [[resource depletion]]. The development of green chemistry in Europe and the United States was linked to a shift in environmental problem-solving strategies: a movement from [[command and control regulation]] and mandated reduction of industrial emissions at the "end of the pipe," toward the active prevention of pollution through the innovative design of production technologies themselves. The set of concepts now recognized as green chemistry coalesced in the mid- to late-1990s, along with broader adoption of the term (which prevailed over competing terms such as "clean" and "sustainable" chemistry).&lt;ref name="WoodhouseBreyman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodhouse | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Breyman | first2 = S. | title = Green chemistry as social movement? | journal = Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–222 | date = 2005 | doi = 10.1177/0162243904271726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linthorst"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10698-009-9079-4 | title = An overview: Origins and development of green chemistry | journal = Foundations of Chemistry | volume = 12 | pages = 55 | year = 2009 | last1 = Linthorst | first1 = J. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] played a significant early role in fostering green chemistry through its pollution prevention programs, funding, and professional coordination. At the same time in the United Kingdom, researchers at the [[University of York]] contributed to the establishment of the Green Chemistry Network within the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], and the launch of the journal ''[[Green Chemistry (journal)|Green Chemistry]]''.&lt;ref name="Linthorst" /&gt;

==Principles==
In 1998, [[Paul Anastas]] (who then directed the Green Chemistry Program at the US EPA) and [[John Warner (chemist)|John C. Warner]] (then of [[Polaroid Corporation]]) published a set of principles to guide the practice of green chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Anastas | first1 = Paul T. | authorlink1 = Paul Anastas | last2 = Warner | first2 = John C. | authorlink2 = John Warner (chemist) | title = Green chemistry: theory and practice | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 1998 | location = Oxford [England]; New York | isbn = 9780198502340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve principles address a range of ways to reduce the environmental and health impacts of chemical production, and also indicate research priorities for the development of green chemistry technologies.

The principles cover such concepts as:

* the design of processes to maximize the amount of raw material that ends up in the product;
* the use of [[renewable material]] feedstocks and [[renewable energy|energy]] sources;
* the use of safe, environmentally benign substances, including solvents, whenever possible;
* the design of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] processes;
* [[Waste minimisation|avoiding the production of waste]], which is viewed as the ideal form of [[waste management]].

The '''twelve principles of green chemistry''' are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/what-is-green-chemistry/principles/12-principles-of-green-chemistry.html|title=12 Principles of Green Chemistry - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|language=en|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Prevention'''. Preventing waste is better than treating or cleaning up waste after it is created.
# '''[[Atom economy]].''' Synthetic methods should try to maximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final product.
# '''Less hazardous chemical syntheses'''. Synthetic methods should avoid using or generating substances toxic to humans and/or the environment.
# '''Designing safer chemicals.''' Chemical products should be designed to achieve their desired function while being as non-toxic as possible.
# '''Safer solvents and auxiliaries'''. Auxiliary substances should be avoided wherever possible, and as non-hazardous as possible when they must be used.
# '''Design for energy efficiency'''. Energy requirements should be minimized, and processes should be conducted at ambient temperature and pressure whenever possible.
# '''Use of renewable feedstocks'''. Whenever it is practical to do so, renewable feedstocks or raw materials are preferable to non-renewable ones.
# '''Reduce derivatives'''. Unnecessary generation of derivatives—such as the use of [[protecting group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s—should be minimized or avoided if possible; such steps require additional reagents and may generate additional waste.
# '''Catalysis'''. [[Catalysis|Catalytic]] reagents that can be used in small quantities to repeat a reaction are superior to [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] reagents (ones that are consumed in a reaction).
# '''Design for degradation'''. Chemical products should be designed so that they do not pollute the environment; when their function is complete, they should break down into non-harmful products.
# '''Real-time analysis for pollution prevention'''. Analytical methodologies need to be further developed to permit real-time, in-process monitoring and control ''before'' hazardous substances form.
# '''Inherently safer chemistry for accident prevention'''. Whenever possible, the substances in a process, and the forms of those substances, should be chosen to minimize risks such as explosions, fires, and accidental releases.

== Trends ==
Attempts are being made not only to quantify the ''greenness'' of a chemical process but also to factor in other variables such as [[chemical yield]], the price of reaction components, safety in handling chemicals, hardware demands, energy profile and ease of product workup and purification. In one quantitative study,&lt;ref name=ecoscale&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Redox|reduction]] of [[nitrobenzene]] to [[aniline]] receives 64 points out of 100 marking it as an acceptable synthesis overall whereas a synthesis of an [[amide]] using [[Sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide|HMDS]] is only described as adequate with a combined 32 points.

Green chemistry is increasingly seen as a powerful tool that researchers must use to evaluate the environmental impact of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotechproject.org/file_download/files/GreenNano_PEN8.pdf Green nanotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[nanomaterials]] are developed, the environmental and human health impacts of both the products themselves and the processes to make them must be considered to ensure their long-term economic viability.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Examples==

===Green solvents===
Solvents are consumed in large quantities in many chemical syntheses as well as for cleaning and degreasing.  Traditional solvents are often toxic or are chlorinated.  Green solvents, on the other hand, are generally derived from renewable resources and biodegrade to innocuous, often a naturally occurring product.&lt;ref&gt;Prat, D.; Pardigon, O.; Flemming, H.-W.; Letestu, S.; Ducandas, V.; Isnard, P.; Guntrum, E.; Senac, T.; Ruisseau, S.; Cruciani, P.; Hosek, P., "Sanofi’s Solvent Selection Guide: A Step Toward More Sustainable Processes", Org. Proc. Res. Devel. 2013, 17, 1517-1525.  {{DOI|10.1021/op4002565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, J.; Chin, B.; Huibers, P. D. T.; Garcia-Valls, R.; Hatton, T. A., "Solvent Replacement for Green Processing", Environ. Health Persp. 1998, 106, 253-271. {{DOI|10.2307/3433925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic techniques===
Novel or enhanced synthetic techniques can often provide improved environmental performance or enable better adherence to the principles of green chemistry. For example, the 2005 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] was awarded, to Yves Chauvin, Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock, for the development of the [[Olefin metathesis|metathesis]] method in organic synthesis, with explicit reference to its contribution to green chemistry and "smarter production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2005 | work=The Nobel Foundation  | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2005/press.html | accessdate=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 review identified three key developments in green chemistry in the field of [[organic synthesis]]: use of [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] as green solvent, [[aqueous]] [[hydrogen peroxide]] for clean [[oxidation]]s and the use of hydrogen in [[asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/B502713F| title = Pursuing practical elegance in chemical synthesis| journal = Chemical Communications| issue = 14| pages = 1807| year = 2005| last1 = Noyori | first1 = R. | authorlink = Ryōji Noyori}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some further examples of applied green chemistry are [[supercritical water oxidation]], [[on water reaction]]s, and [[dry media reaction]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Bioengineering]] is also seen as a promising technique for achieving green chemistry goals. A number of important process chemicals can be synthesized in engineered organisms, such as [[shikimate]], a [[Tamiflu]] precursor which is [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] by Roche in bacteria. [[Click chemistry]] is often cited{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} as a style of chemical synthesis that is consistent with the goals of green chemistry.  The concept of 'green pharmacy' has recently been articulated based on similar principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s12649-012-9146-2| title = Towards a Greener Pharmacy by More Eco Design| journal = Waste and Biomass Valorization| volume = 3| issue = 4| pages = 395| year = 2012| last1 = Baron | first1 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon dioxide as blowing agent====
In 1996, [[Dow Chemical]] won the 1996 Greener Reaction Conditions award for their 100% [[carbon dioxide]] blowing agent for [[polystyrene]] foam production. Polystyrene foam is a common material used in packing and food transportation.  Seven hundred million pounds are produced each year in the United States alone. Traditionally, [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] and other [[ozone]]-depleting chemicals were used in the production process of the foam sheets, presenting a serious [[environmental hazard]]. Flammable, explosive, and, in some cases toxic hydrocarbons have also been used as CFC replacements, but they present their own problems.  Dow Chemical discovered that [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] works equally as well as a blowing agent, without the need for hazardous substances, allowing the polystyrene to be more easily recycled. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; used in the process is reused from other industries, so the net carbon released from the process is zero.

===Hydrazine===
Addressing principle #2 is the Peroxide Process for producing [[hydrazine]] without cogenerating salt. Hydrazine is traditionally produced by the [[Olin Raschig process]] from [[sodium hypochlorite]] (the active ingredient in many [[bleach]]es) and [[ammonia]].  The net reaction produces one equivalent of sodium chloride for every equivalent of the targeted product hydrazine:&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;Jean-Pierre Schirmann, Paul Bourdauducq "Hydrazine" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:NaOCl  +  2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NaCl  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In the greener [[Peroxide process]] hydrogen peroxide is employed as the oxidant and the side product is water. The net conversion follows:
:2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 
Addressing principle #4, this process does not require auxiliary extracting solvents. [[Methyl ethyl ketone]] is used as a carrier for the hydrazine, the intermediate ketazine phase separates from the reaction mixture, facilitating workup without the need of an extracting solvent.

===1,3-Propanediol===
Addressing principle #7 is a green route to [[1,3-Propanediol|1,3-propanediol]], which is traditionally generated from petrochemical precursors.  It can be produced from renewable precursors via the [[bioseparation of 1,3-propanediol]] using a [[genetically modified]] [[strain (biology)|strain]] of ''[[E. coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kurian, Joseph V. "A New Polymer Platform for the Future – Sorona from Corn Derived 1,3-Propanediol" Journal of Polymers and the Environment, Vol. 13, No. 2 (April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[diol]] is used to make new polyesters for the manufacture of carpets.

===Lactide===
[[File:Lactide.png|thumb|144px|right|Lactide]]
In 2002, Cargill Dow (now [[NatureWorks]]) won the Greener Reaction Conditions Award for their improved method for [[polymerization]] of [[polylactic acid]] . Unfortunately, lactide-base polymers do not perform well and the project was discontinued by Dow soon after the award. [[Lactic acid]] is produced by fermenting corn and converted to [[lactide]], the cyclic dimer ester of lactic acid using an efficient, tin-catalyzed cyclization. The L,L-lactide enantiomer is isolated by distillation and polymerized in the melt to make a crystallizable [[polymer]], which has some applications including [[textiles]] and apparel, cutlery, and food packaging. [[Wal-Mart]] has announced that it is using/will use PLA for its produce packaging. The NatureWorks PLA process substitutes renewable materials for petroleum feedstocks, doesn't require the use of hazardous organic solvents typical in other PLA processes, and results in a high-quality polymer that is [[recyclable]] and compostable.

===Carpet tile backings===
In 2003 [[Shaw Industries]] selected a combination of polyolefin resins as the base polymer of choice for EcoWorx due to the low toxicity of its feedstocks, superior adhesion properties, dimensional stability, and its ability to be recycled. The EcoWorx compound also had to be designed to be compatible with nylon carpet fiber. Although EcoWorx may be recovered from any fiber type, nylon-6 provides a significant advantage. Polyolefins are compatible with known nylon-6 depolymerization methods. PVC interferes with those processes. Nylon-6 chemistry is well-known and not addressed in first-generation production. From its inception, EcoWorx met all of the design criteria necessary to satisfy the needs of the marketplace from a performance, health, and environmental standpoint.  Research indicated that separation of the fiber and backing through [[elutriation]], grinding, and air separation proved to be the best way to recover the face and backing components, but an infrastructure for returning postconsumer EcoWorx to the elutriation process was necessary. Research also indicated that the postconsumer carpet tile had a positive economic value at the end of its useful life. EcoWorx is recognized by MBDC as a certified [[cradle-to-cradle design]].

[[File:Isomers of oleic acid.png|thumb|right|''Trans'' and ''cis'' fatty acids]]

===Transesterification of fats===
In 2005, [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM) and [[Novozymes]] won the Greener Synthetic Pathways Award for their [[enzyme]] interesterification process. In response to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) mandated labeling of [[trans-fats|''trans''-fats]] on nutritional information by January 1, 2006, Novozymes and ADM worked together to develop a clean, enzymatic process for the [[interesterification]] of oils and fats by interchanging saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.  The result is commercially viable products without ''trans''-fats. In addition to the human health benefits of eliminating ''trans''-fats, the process has reduced the use of toxic chemicals and water, prevents vast amounts of byproducts, and reduces the amount of fats and oils wasted.

===Bio-succinic acid===
In 2011, the Outstanding Green Chemistry Accomplishments by a Small Business Award went to [[BioAmber Inc.]] for integrated production and downstream applications of bio-based [[succinic acid]]. Succinic acid is a platform chemical that is an important starting material in the formulations of everyday products. Traditionally, succinic acid is produced from petroleum-based feedstocks. BioAmber has developed process and technology that produces succinic acid from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks at a lower cost and lower energy expenditure than the petroleum equivalent while sequestering CO{{sub|2}} rather than emitting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/green-chemistry/2011-small-business-award |title=2011 Small Business Award |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory chemicals===
Several [[laboratory]] chemicals are controversial from the perspective of Green chemistry. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] created a "Green" Alternatives Wizard [http://ehs.mit.edu/greenchem/] to help identify alternatives. [[Ethidium bromide]], [[xylene]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[formaldehyde]] have been identified as "worst offenders" which have alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Coombs A. (2009). [http://www.the-scientist.com/2009/07/1/55/1/ Green at the Bench]. ''The Scientist''.&lt;/ref&gt; Solvents in particular make a large contribution to the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing and there is a growing focus on introducing Greener solvents into the earliest stage of development of these processes: laboratory-scale reaction and purification methods.&lt;ref&gt;J-C Bradley ''et al.'', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13065-015-0085-4 &amp;ldquo;Predicting Abraham model solvent coefficients&amp;rdquo;], ''Chemistry Central Journal'' 9:12 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pharmaceutical Industry, both GSK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/c0gc00918k| title = Expanding GSK's solvent selection guide – embedding sustainability into solvent selection starting at medicinal chemistry| journal = Green Chemistry| volume = 13| issue = 4| pages = 854| year = 2011| last1 = Henderson | first1 = R.

== Legislation ==

===The EU===
In 2007, The EU put into place the [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) program, which requires companies to provide data showing that their products are safe. This regulation (1907/2006) ensures not only the assessment of the chemicals' hazards as well as risks during their uses but also includes measures for banning or restricting/authorising uses of specific substances. ECHA, the EU Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, is implementing the regulation whereas the enforcement lies with the EU member states.

===United States===
The U.S. law that governs the majority of industrial chemicals (excluding pesticides, foods, and pharmaceuticals) is the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA) of 1976. Examining the role of regulatory programs in shaping the development of green chemistry in the United States, analysts have revealed structural flaws and long-standing weaknesses in TSCA; for example, a 2006 report to the California Legislature concludes that TSCA has produced a domestic chemicals market that discounts the hazardous properties of chemicals relative to their function, price, and performance.&lt;ref&gt;

Passed in 1990, the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990|Pollution Prevention Act]] helped foster new approaches for dealing with pollution by preventing environmental problems before they happen.

In 2008, the State of California approved two laws aiming to encourage green chemistry, launching the [[California Green Chemistry Initiative]]. One of these statutes required California's [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control|Department of Toxic Substances Control]] (DTSC) to develop new regulations to prioritize "chemicals of concern" and promote the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives. The resulting regulations took effect in 2013, initiating DTSC's ''Safer Consumer Products Program''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Contested definition==
There are ambiguities in the definition of green chemistry, and in how it is understood among broader science, policy, and business communities. Even within chemistry, researchers have used the term "green chemistry" to describe a range of work independently of the framework put forward by Anastas and Warner (i.e., the 12 principles).&lt;ref name="Linthorst" /&gt; While not all uses of the term are legitimate (see [[greenwashing]]), many are, and the authoritative status of any single definition is uncertain. More broadly, the idea of green chemistry can easily be linked (or confused) with related concepts like [[green engineering]], [[environmental design]], or [[sustainability]] in general. The complexity and multifaceted nature of green chemistry makes it difficult to devise clear and simple [[Green chemistry metrics|metrics]]. As a result, "what is green" is often open to debate.&lt;ref name="MatusBarriers"&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}

A '''housing development''' is a structured [[real estate development]] of residential buildings.  Popular throughout the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], they are often areas of high-density, low-impact residences of [[single-family detached home]]s, and often allow for separate ownership of each [[housing unit]], for example through [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]. A housing development is "often erected on a tract of land by one builder and controlled by one management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=dictionary.com|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/housing-development|title=housing development|accessdate=Sep 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different housing types. All of which housing developers can choose to develop. They can range from Single Detached, Duplex, Triplex, Multiplex/Big House, Side Attached, Stacked Rowhouse, Small Apartment, Low-rise Apartment, Mid-rise Apartment, Apartment over Commercial, High-Rise Apartment.&lt;ref name=corridor&gt;http://www.corridordevelopment.org/pdfs/Housing%20Types/Housing_Types_Sheets.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the different housing types will have their distinctive characteristics, density ranges, number of units, and floors.&lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

==  Housing Types ==
=== Single Detached ===
This type of housing will be detached from other housing types. This type of unit houses lower densities. Lawns are an option for this kind of design, with distinctive public and private spaces. A single detached can have up to three floors. Some of the common names for a singled detached housing type is "House, Cottage, Villa, Bungalow"&lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

=== Duplex, Triplex ===
This type of housing can have two or three dwelling units in a detached building. The units could be together or separate depending on the location of the duplex. A duplex will also have an option for a yard in order to keep their private space. This type of housing will allow for higher density housing compared to the single detached units. Duplex, and Triplex can account for 2-3 units, and have up to 3 floors. Some of the common names for Duplex, Triplex are "Semi-detached, Double House, Accessory unity, Ancillary unit, Carriage unit, Twin Home." &lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

=== Big house, Multiplex ===
Big house, Multiplex can come in many forms, it can have a single or muli-level unit. Just like the duplex, it can have multiple floors, up to 3 floors. It can account for up to 5 units as well. This type of housing will have a higher density than single detached housing. Some of the common names for the big house, multiplex are Quadruplex, Mansion townhomes, back to back semi-detached, Grand house &lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

{{Calligraphy}}
[[File:Basmalah-1wm.svg|right|thumb|The phrase [[Basmala|Bismillah]] in an 18th-century Islamic calligraphy from the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] region and called Thuluth.]]

'''Islamic calligraphy''' is the artistic practice of [[penmanship|handwriting]] and [[calligraphy]],&lt;!-- and by extension, [[bookbinding|bookmaking]],--&gt; based upon the [[Arabic alphabet|alphabet]] in the lands sharing a common Islamic cultural heritage. It includes [[Arabic calligraphy|Arabic Calligraphy]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Persian calligraphy]].&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;{{cite book |last=Blair |first=Sheila S. |title=The art and architecture of Islam : 1250–1800 |year=1995 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-06465-9 |edition=Reprinted with corrections |author2=Bloom, Jonathan M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|218}}--&gt;&lt;ref name=ens&gt;Chapman, Caroline (2012). ''Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture'', {{ISBN|978-979-099-631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as ''khatt Islami'' (خط اسلامي), meaning Islamic line, design, or construction.&lt;ref name=typography&gt;{{cite web| title=Arabic calligraphy as a typographic exercise| url=http://ilovetypography.com/2008/07/10/arabic-calligraphy-as-a-typographic-exercise/ |author=Julia Kaestle |date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Islamic calligraphy is strongly tied to the [[Qur'an]]; chapters and excerpts from the Qur'an are a common and almost universal text upon which Islamic calligraphy is based. Deep religious association with the [[Qur'an]], as well as suspicion of figurative art as [[Taghut|idolatrous]], has led calligraphy to become one of the major forms of artistic expression in Islamic cultures.&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|222}}--&gt; It has also been argued that Islamic calligraphy was motivated less by iconophobia (since, in fact, images were by no means absent in Islamic art) than by the centrality of the notion of writing and written text in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, “The Content of Form: Islamic Calligraphy Between Text and Representation,” in ''Sign and Design'', ed. B. Bedos-Rezak and J. Hamburger (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 2016), 169–190.&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy, for instance, that the Prophet Muhammad is related to have said: "The first thing God created was the pen."&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Abi Dawud, Sunnah 4699.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Islamic calligraphy is highly venerated, most works follow examples set by well-established calligraphers, with the exception of secular or contemporary works. In antiquity, a pupil would copy a master's work repeatedly until their handwriting was similar. The most common style is divided into angular and cursive, each further divided into several sub-styles.&lt;ref name=ens/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;!--[[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] calligraphy is associated with abstract [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] motifs on the walls and ceilings of [[mosque]]s as well as on the page. Contemporary [[artists]] in the [[Islamic world]] draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions in their work.
 They used it to represent God because they denied representing God with images.&lt;ref name="Bernard Lewis"&gt;Bernard Lewis and Butnzie Ellis Churchill, ''Islam : the Religion and the People'', {{ISBN|978-0-13-223085-8}}&lt;/rf&gt;--&gt;

==Instruments and media==
The traditional instrument of the Islamic calligrapher is the [[kalam]], a [[pen]] normally made of dried [[Phragmites|reed]] or [[bamboo]]; the [[ink]] is often in [[colour|color]], and chosen such that its intensity can vary greatly so that the greater strokes of the compositions can be very dynamic in their effect. Some styles are often written using a metallic-tip pen.
[[File:Niebuhr Beschreibung von Arabien Tab XIII.png|thumbnail|Five principal Arabic calligraphic cursive styles:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Naskh (نسخ nasḫ)&lt;br /&gt;
2. Nasta‘liq (نستعلیق nastaʿlīq)&lt;br /&gt;
3. Diwani (ديواني dīwānī)&lt;br /&gt;
4. Thuluth (ثلث ṯuluṯ)&lt;br /&gt;
5. Ruq‘ah (رقعة ruqʿah)]]
Islamic calligraphy is applied to a wide range of decorative mediums other than paper, such as tiles, vessels, carpets, and inscriptions.&lt;ref name=ens/&gt; Before the advent of paper, papyrus and parchment were used for writing. The advent of paper revolutionized calligraphy. While monasteries in Europe treasured a few dozen volumes, libraries in the [[Muslim world]] regularly contained hundreds and even thousands of books.&lt;ref name=Bloom /&gt;{{rp|218}}

Coins were another support for calligraphy. Beginning in 692, the Islamic caliphate reformed the coinage of the Near East by replacing visual depiction with words. This was especially true for dinars, or gold coins of high value. Generally, the coins were inscribed with quotes from the Qur'an.

By the tenth century, the Persians, who had converted to Islam, began weaving inscriptions onto elaborately patterned silks. So precious were calligraphic inscribed textiles that Crusaders brought them to Europe as prized possessions. A notable example is the [[Suaire de Saint-Josse]], used to wrap the bones of St. Josse in the Abbey of St. Josse-sur-Mer, near Caen in northwestern France.&lt;ref name=Bloom /&gt;{{rp|223–5}}

==Styles==
===Kufic===
[[File:A section of the Koran - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|left|9th century [[Qur'an]], an early kufic example from the [[Abbasid dynasty|Abbasid period]]]]
[[File:Bowl with Kufic Calligraphy, 10th century.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Bowl with [[Kufic]] [[Calligraphy]]'', 10th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

'''[[Kufic]]''' is the oldest form of the Arabic script. The style emphasizes rigid and angular strokes, which appears as a modified form of the old [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/963439648|title=A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture|last=Flood, Necipoğlu|first=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|others=|year=2017|isbn=9781119068570|volume=Volume I|location=Hoboken|pages=109-110|oclc=963439648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archaic Kufi consisted of about 17 letters without diacritic dots or accents. Afterward, dots and accents were added to help readers with pronunciation, and the set of Arabic letters rose to 28.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie (1984). ''[http://universityoftexasbrownsville.worldcat.org/title/calligraphy-and-islamic-culture/oclc/20420019&amp;referer=brief_results Calligraphy and Islamic Culture]''. New York: New York University Press. p. 4. [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special%3ABookSources/0814778305|0814778305]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is developed around the end of the 7th century in the areas of [[Kufa]], Iraq, from which it takes its name.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt; The style later developed into several varieties, including floral, foliated, plaited or interlaced, bordered, and squared kufi. It was the main script used to copy Qur'ans from the 8th to 10th century and went out of general use in the 12th century when the flowing naskh style become more practical, although it continued to be used as a decorative element to contrast superseding styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kūfic script|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324418/Kufic-script|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no set rules of using the Kufic script; the only common feature is the angular, linear shapes of the characters. Due to the lack of methods, the scripts in different regions and countries and even down to the individuals themselves have different ways to write in the script creatively, ranging from very square and rigid forms to flowery and decorative.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt;

Common varieties include&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt; square Kufic, a technique known as ''[[banna'i]]''.&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jonathan M. Bloom |author2=Sheila Blair |title=The Grove encyclopedia of Islamic art and architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA212 |accessdate=4 January 2012 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-530991-1 |pages=101, 131, 246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary calligraphy using this style is also popular in modern decorations.

Decorative Kufic inscriptions are often imitated into [[pseudo-kufic]]s in [[Middle Ages|Middle age]] and [[Renaissance]] Europe. Pseudo-kufics is especially common in [[Renaissance]] depictions of people from the [[Holy Land]]. The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13–14th-century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found natural to represent [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] in association with them.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Rosamond E.

===[[Naskh (script)|Naskh]]===
[[File:Folio from a Qur'an (Mamluk dynasty).jpg|thumb|right|[[Muhaqqaq]] script in a 14th-century Qur'an from the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]].]]

The use of cursive scripts coexisted with Kufic, but because in the early stages of their development they lacked discipline and elegance, cursive was usually used for informal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Arabic Calligraphy, a brief history |url=http://www.sakkal.com/ArtArabicCalligraphy.html |author=Mamoun Sakkal |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of Islam, a new script was needed to fit the pace of conversions, and a well-defined cursive called '''[[naskh (script)|naskh]]''' first appeared in the 10th century. The script is the most ubiquitous among other styles, used in Qur'ans, official decrees, and private correspondence.&lt;ref name="LOCFragments"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.loc.gov/intldl/apochtml/apocfragments.html |title=Library of Congress, Selections of Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Calligraphy: Qur'anic Fragments |publisher=International.loc.gov |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the basis of modern Arabic print.

Standardization of the style was pioneered by [[Ibn Muqla]] (886&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;940 A.D.) and later expanded by [[Abu Hayan at-Tawhidi]] (died 1009 A.D.) and [[Muhammad Ibn Abd ar-Rahman]] (1492&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;1545 A.D.). Ibn Muqla is highly regarded in Muslim sources on calligraphy as the inventor of the naskh style, although this seems to be erroneous. However, Ibn Muqla did establish systematic rules and proportions for shaping the letters, which use 'alif as the [[x-height]].&lt;ref&gt;Kampman, Frerik (2011). ''[http://www.islamicmanuscripts.info/reference/books/Kampman-2011-Typography-Bachelor-Thesis-Arabic-Frerik-Kampman-20120823-download.pdf Arabic Typography; its past and its future]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation of the naskh includes:
#'''[[Thuluth]]''' is developed as a display script to decorate particular scriptural ice. Letters have long vertical lines with broad spacing. The name, meaning "third", is in reference to the x-height, which is one-third of the 'alif.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/styles/thuluth-naskh.html|title=Thuluth and Naskh|last=Kvernen|first=Elisabeth|date=2009|website=CalligraphyQalam|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Riq'ah]]''' is a handwriting style derived from naskh and thuluth, first appeared in the 9th century. The shape is simple with short strokes and little flourishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/styles/tawqi-riqa.html|title=Tawqi' and Riqa'|last=Kvernen|first=Elizabeth|date=2009|website=CalligraphyQalam|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Muhaqqaq]]''' is a majestic style used by accomplished calligraphers. It was considered one of the most beautiful scripts, as well as one of the most difficult to execute. Muhaqqaq was commonly used during the Mameluke era, but the use becomes largely restricted to short phrases, such as the [[basmallah]], from the 18th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, Nassar (2011). ''Sacred Script: Muhaqqaq in Islamic Calligraphy''. New York: I.B.Tauris &amp; Co Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-84885-439-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional styles===
[[File:Miremad-1.jpg|thumb|right|Nasta'liq calligraphy by [[Mir Emad Hassani]], perhaps the most celebrated Persian calligrapher.]]
With the [[spread of Islam]], the [[Arabic script]] was established in a vast geographic area with many regions developing their own unique style. From the 14th century onward, other cursive styles began to develop in Turkey, Persia, and China.&lt;ref name="LOCFragments" /&gt;

# '''[[Nasta'liq]]''' is a [[cursive]] style originally devised to write the [[Persian language]] for literary and non-Qur'anic works.&lt;ref name=qalam&gt;{{cite web| title= An Introduction of Arabic, Ottoman, and Persian Calligraphy: Style|author=Kvernen, Elizabeth |year=2009|publisher=Calligraphy Qalam |url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/styles/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nasta'liq is thought to be a later development of the naskh and the earlier ta'liq script used in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ta'liq Script |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581497/taliq-script|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''ta'liq'' means "hanging", and refers to the slightly steeped lines of which words run in, giving the script a hanging appearance. Letters have short vertical strokes with broad and sweeping horizontal strokes. The shapes are deep, hook-like, and have high contrast.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt; A variant called ''[[Shikasta Nastaʿlīq|Shikasteh]]'' is used in more informal contexts.
# '''[[Diwani]]''' is a cursive style of Arabic calligraphy developed during the reign of the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the 16th and early 17th centuries. It was invented by [[Housam Roumi]], and reached its height of popularity under [[Süleyman I the Magnificent]] (1520–1566).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diwani script|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166798/diwani-script|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spaces between letters are often narrow, and lines ascend upwards from right to left. Larger variations called ''djali'' are filled with dense decorations of dots and diacritical marks in the space between, giving it a compact appearance. Diwani is difficult to read and write due to its heavy stylization and became the ideal script for writing court documents as it ensured confidentiality and prevented forgery.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt;
# '''[[Sini (script)|Sini]]''' is a style developed in China. The shape is greatly influenced by [[Chinese calligraphy]], using a horsehair brush instead of the standard reed pen. A famous modern calligrapher in this tradition is [[Hajji]] [[Noor Deen Mi Guangjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hajinoordeen.com/gallery.html "Gallery"], ''Haji Noor Deen''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--==Calligrams==

[[File:The Bismillah India.jpg|thumb|Bismillah calligraphy from the [[Mughal Empire]].]]

[[Calligraphy]], the most Islamic of arts in the Muslim world, also has its figurative sides. By interweaving written words, made from an "Allah", a "Muhammad", a "[[Basmala|Bismillah]]", etc., or using [[micrography]],&lt;ref name = "bnf"&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/134.htm BNF - Torah, Bible, Coran]. In French.&lt;/ref&gt; calligraphers produced anthropomorphic figures ([['Ali]], the Ideal Human of [[Sufi|mystics]], a praying man,&lt;ref name=Praying&gt;{{cite web|title=Praying Man|url=http://www.ethiopianmuslims.net/Images/calligraphy2.jpg|publisher=Ethiopian Muslims Network|accessdate=29 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217032258/http://www.ethiopianmuslims.net/Images/calligraphy2.jpg|archivedate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a face), zoomorphisms (symbolic creatures, most from the Shi'a iconography, like the lion (Ali "the Lion of God")&lt;ref name = "Cartage"&gt;[http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/GeogHist/histories/Oldcivilization/Egyptology/Calligraphy/art5.jpg Lion of 'Ali].&lt;/ref&gt; horse ([['Ali]]'s [[Duldul (mule)|Duldul]]),&lt;ref name = "Levha"&gt;[http://www.levha.net/calligraphy/calligraphy_index.html Horse of 'Ali].&lt;/ref&gt; fish,&lt;ref name = "bnf" /&gt; stork or other bird (the qur'anic [[Hudhud]])&lt;ref name = "IslArch"&gt;[http://www.islamicarchitecture.org/art/images/calligraphy/islamic.calligraphy.birdtext.101.gif HudHud].{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "UCSC"&gt;[http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/01-02/art/islamic_bird.jpg Islamic Bird], ''UC Santa Cruz Currents Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and inanimate representations (a sword ([[Zulfiqar|Dhu al-Fiqar]]), a mosque, a ship (made from the letter ''[[Waw (letter)|waw]]'', a symbol of mystical union, literally meaning "and," in Arabic)). Calligrams are related to Muslim mysticism and popular with many leading calligraphers in [[Turkey]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and [[India]] from the 17th century onward.

Although striking in appearance, calligrams have never been regarded as appropriate or a decent expression of the art by the master calligraphers. Many calligrams therefore were produced by either folk calligraphers or for the interest of uncultivated people. These calligrams were not exhibited in mosques or Sufi convents in the Ottoman state, for example.

An element in this perspective is the rejection of the interpretation by the heretic Hurufiyyah Sufi order which sees letters as true manifestations of the fate, events and creation in themselves.

In the teachings of calligraphy, figurative imagery is used to help visualize the shape of letters to trace, for example, the letter ''ha' '' looks in ''nasta'liq'' similar to two eyes, as its Persian name implies: "he' two eyes" ''he' do cheshm''). In literature and poetry seeing in letters a reflection of the natural world goes back to the [[Abbasid]] times.

One of the contemporary masters of the calligram genre is [[Hassan Massoudy]] and [[Wissam Shawkat]].

Good commercial examples are the logos of [[Al Jazeera]], an international news station based at [[Qatar]], and the [[Edinburgh Middle East Report]], a Scottish academic journal on the [[Middle East]], and also the work of the calligrapher and designer Wissam Shawkat.--&gt;

===Modern===
In the post-colonial era, artists working in North Africa and the Middle East transformed Arabic calligraphy into a modern art movement, known as the ''[[Hurufiyya movement]]''. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Flood, Necipoğlu (2017). [https://www.worldcat.org/title/a-companion-to-islamic-art-and-architecture-2-from-the-mongols-to-modernism/oclc/1006377297&amp;referer=brief_results A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture]. Volume II. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 1294. {{ISBN|1119068665}}. OCLC 1006377297.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists working in this field use calligraphy as a graphic from within a contemporary artwork. &lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term, ''hurifiyya'' is derived from the Arabic term, ''harf'' for letter. Traditionally, the term was charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is an explicit reference to a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism.  In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos. &lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hurufiyya artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead grappled with a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyyah artists  struggled to find their own individual  dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Islamic identity. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa around 1955, in the area around Sudan, with the work of [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the use of calligraphy in modern artworks appears to have emerged independently in various Islamic states. Few of the artists working in this field, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyyah to emerge in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, artworks include both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, Necipoğlu (2017). [https://www.worldcat.org/title/a-companion-to-islamic-art-and-architecture-2-from-the-mongols-to-modernism/oclc/1006377297&amp;referer=brief_results A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture].

Leading exponents of hurufiyyah art can be found in Jordan. &lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi.

The hurufiyyah art movement was not confined to painters, but also included artists working in a variety of media, such as the Jordanian ceramicist, [[Mahmoud Taha]], who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship &lt;ref&gt;Asfour. M., "A Window on Contemporary Arab Art," NABAD Art Gallery, Online: http://www.nabadartgallery.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor was the movement confined to Jordan. In Iraq, the movement was known as ''Al Bu'd al Wahad'' (or the [[One Dimension Group]])",&lt;ref&gt;"Shaker Hassan Al Said," Darat al Funum, Online: www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html;  Flood, Necipoğlu (2017).

Volume II. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 1294. {{ISBN|1119068665}}. OCLC 1006377297. &lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran, it was known as the [[Iranian modern and contemporary art#Saqqakhaneh movement|Saqqa-Khaneh movement]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Western art has influenced Arabic calligraphy in other ways, with forms such as [[calligraffiti]]; the use of calligraphy in public art to make politico-social messages or to vandalise public buildings and spaces. &lt;ref&gt;Grebenstein, M., ''Calligraphy Bible: A Complete Guide to More Than 100 Essential Projects and Techniques,'' 2012, p. 5 &lt;/ref&gt; Notable Islamic calligraffiti artists include: [[Yazan Halwani]] active in Lebanon, &lt;ref&gt;Alabaster, Olivia.

'''Mana''', in [[Austronesian languages]], means "power", "effectiveness", and "prestige". In most cases, this power and its source are understood to be supernatural and inexplicable.&lt;ref name=POLLEX&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/mana1/ |title=Entries for MANA.1 [OC&amp;#93; Power, effectiveness, prestige |publisher=Pollex.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its semantics are language-dependent. The concept is significant in [[Polynesia]]n culture and is part of contemporary [[Pacific Islander]] culture; it came to the attention of Western anthropologists through reports from island missionaries. Its study was included in [[cultural anthropology]]—specifically, the anthropology of religion. Links were seen between ''mana'' and earlier phases of Western religion: [[animism]] at first, followed by [[Robert Ranulph Marett|pre-animism]].

==Etymology==
According to the POLLEX Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|date=2011|title=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|url=http://simon.net.nz/files//2012/12/Greenhill_and_Clark2011.pdf|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=50|issue=2|pages=551–559|doi=10.1353/ol.2011.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a protoform (an ancestral form of a word) for "mana"—noted in historical-linguistic convention as *mana-"—existed in [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]], the precursor of many Pacific languages. Although the path through the tree from Proto-Oceanic to a specific language is not always clear, the word and concept are thousands of years old. According to linguist Robert Blust, "mana" means "thunder, storm, or wind" in some languages. Blust hypothesized that the term originally meant "powerful forces of nature such as thunder and storm winds that were conceived as the expression of an unseen supernatural agency. As Oceanic-speaking peoples spread eastward, the notion of an unseen supernatural agency became detached from the physical forces of nature that had inspired it and assumed a life of its own."&lt;ref name="Blust"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blust|first1=R. A|title=Proto-Oceanic *mana Revisited|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|date=2007|volume=46|issue=2|pages=404–423|doi=10.1353/ol.2008.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|In Polynesian culture}}Polynesian culture==
Mana is a foundation of the [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian worldview]], a spiritual quality with a supernatural origin and a sacred, impersonal force. To have ''mana'' implies influence, [[authority]], and efficacy—the ability to perform in a given situation. The quality of ''mana'' is not limited to individuals; peoples, governments, places and inanimate objects may also possess ''mana'', and its possessors are accorded respect.

==={{anchor|In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture}}Hawaiian and Tahitian culture===
In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture, mana is a [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] and healing power which can exist in places, objects and persons. Hawaiians believe that mana may be gained or lost by actions, and Hawaiians and Tahitians believe that mana is both external and internal. Sites on the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and in [[French Polynesia]] are believed to possess mana—for example, the top rim of the [[Haleakalā]] volcano on the island of [[Maui]] and the [[Taputapuatea marae]] on the island of [[Raiatea]] in the [[Society Islands]].

Ancient Hawaiian believed that the island of [[Molokaʻi]] possesses mana, compared with its neighboring islands. Before the unification of Hawaii by [[Kamehameha I|King Kamehameha I]], battles were fought for possession of the island and its south-shore fish ponds which existed until the late 19th century.

A person may gain mana by ''[[pono]]'' (right actions). In ancient Hawaii, there were two paths to mana: sexual means or violence. Nature is dualistic, and everything has a counterpart. A balance between the gods [[Kū]] and [[Lono]] formed, through whom are the two paths to mana (''ʻimihaku'', or the search for mana). Kū, the god of war and politics, offers mana through violence; this was how Kamehameha gained his mana. Lono, the god of peace and fertility, offers mana through sexuality.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

According to the New Zealand Ministry of Justice:

{{quote|Mana and tapu are concepts which have both been attributed single-worded definitions by contemporary writers.

===={{anchor|In general usage}}General use====
In contemporary [[New Zealand English]], the word "mana", taken from the Māori, refers to a person or organisation of people of great personal prestige and character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newzealandatoz.com/index.php?pageid=357 |title=Kiwi (NZ) to English Dictionary |publisher=New Zealand A to Z |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased use of the term mana in New Zealand society is as a result of the [[politicisation]] of Maori issues stemming from the [[Māori Renaissance]]. 

=={{anchor|In fantasy}}Gaming and literature==
{{main article|Magic (gaming)}}

[[Larry Niven]] adopted the term in his 1969 short story, [[All the Myriad Ways|"Not Long Before the End"]].  In this and subsequent stories, "mana" was the magical fuel used to cast spells. It was a non-renewable environmental resource; heavy use of magic could deplete the mana in an area.

Following on from the idea of mana as something that could be "used up", fantasy [[role-playing game]]s and video games adopted the term to quantify "magical power."&lt;ref name="Golub"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golub |first1=Alex |title=The History of Mana: How an Austronesian Concept Became a Video Game Mechanic |url=http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620052259/http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic|dead-url=no |archive-date=20 June 2014 |website=theappendix.net |publisher=The Appendix |accessdate=4 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magic points (MPs) were used by ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]'' and games influenced by it, and for example the 1987 video game ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'' replaced "magic points" with "mana points" as the definition of MPs.

Mana was used in a number of early role-playing [[board game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Matt|last2=P.

=={{anchor|The academic study of mana}}Academic study==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 116272 Southern Cross (ship).jpg|thumb|275px|alt=Photo of a three-masted schooner|The 1891 ''[[Southern Cross (1891 Melanesian Mission ship)|Southern Cross]]'', one of the ships at [[Norfolk Island]]'s [[Melanesian Mission]] where Codrington taught and worked]]

Missionary [[Robert Henry Codrington]] traveled widely in [[Melanesia]], publishing several studies of its language and culture. His 1891 book ''The Melanesians: Studies in their Anthropology and Folk-Lore'' contains the first detailed description of mana. Codrington defines it as "a force altogether distinct from physical power, which acts in all kinds of ways for good and evil, and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control".&lt;ref name="Codrington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Codrington|first1=Robert Henry|title=The Melanesians: Studies in Their Anthropology and Folk-lore|date=1891|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=New York|isbn=9780486202587|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiMHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Melanesians:+Studies+in+Their+Anthropology+and+Folklore.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TxDYVJHlGIHZggSm0YL4BA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His era had already defined [[animism]], the concept that the energy (or life) in an object derives from a spiritual component. [[Georg Ernst Stahl]]'s 18th-century animism was adopted by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], the founder of [[cultural anthropology]], who presented his initial ideas about the history of religion in his 1865 ''Researches into the Early History of Mankind''&lt;ref name="Tylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tylor|first1=Edward B.|title=Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=1108017517}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} and developed them in volumes one (1871) and two (1874) of ''Primitive Culture''.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===Tylor's cultural evolution===
In Tylor's [[cultural anthropology]], other [[primate]]s (from which evolutionists hypothesized man had evolved) did not appear to possess culture.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The discovery that primates and other mammals [[animal culture|have some culture]] (practical knowledge taught by parents who learned it from their parents) does not substantially affect the argument, since humanity's characteristically-complex learned behaviour is unique.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor did not try to find evidence of a non-cultural human state because he considered it unreachable, "a condition not far removed from that of the lower animals" and "savage life as in some sort representing an early known state."&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|33}} He described such a hypothetical state as "the human savage naked in both mind and body, and destitute of laws, or arts, or ideas, and almost of language".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|30}} According to Tylor, speculation about an acultural state is impossible. Using the method of [[Comparative cultural studies|comparative culture]], similar to [[comparative anatomy]] and the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method of historical linguistics]] and following [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], he drew up a dual classification of cultural traits ([[meme]]s and [[memeplex]]es): savage and civilised. Tylor wrote, "From an ideal point of view, civilization may be looked upon as the general improvement of mankind by higher organization of the individual and of society ... "&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|24}} and identified his model with the "progression-theory of civilization".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

===Evolution of religion===
Tylor cited a "minimum definition" of religion as "the belief in Spiritual Beings".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Noting that no savage societies lack religion and that the initial state of a religious man is beyond reach, he enumerated two stages in the evolution of religion: a simple belief in individual animae (or Doctrine of Souls) and the elaboration of dogmas. The dogmas are systems of higher spirits commanding phases of nature. In volume two of ''Primitive Culture'', Tylor called this stage the Doctrine of Spirits.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|108–110}} He used the word "animism" in two different senses.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|385}} The first is religion itself: a belief in the spiritual as an effective energy, shared by every specific religion. In his progression theory, an undogmatic version preceded rational theological systems. Animism is the simple Theory of the Soul, which [[comparative religion]] attempts to reconstruct.

Tylor's work predated Codrington's, and he was unfamiliar with the latter. The concept of mana occasioned a revision of Tylor's view of the evolution of religion. The first anthropologist to formulate a revision (which he called "pre-animistic religion") was [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], in a series of papers collected and published as ''Threshold of Religion''. In its preface he takes credit for the adjective "pre-animistic" but not the noun "pre-animism", although he does not attribute it.&lt;ref name="Marett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marett|first1=Robert Randolph|title=Threshold of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Hardpress Ltd|location=|isbn=1313151963}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

According to Marett, "Animism will not suffice as a minimum definition of religion." Tylor had used the term "natural religion",&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|386}} consistent with Georg Ernst Stahl's concept of a natural spiritual energy. The soul of an animal, for example, is its vital principle. Marett wrote, "One must dig deeper" to find the "roots of religion".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==={{anchor|Pre-animistic phase of religion}}Pre-animism===
Describing pre-animism, Marett cited the Melanesian mana (primarily with Codrington's work): "When the science of Comparative Religion employs a native expression such as mana ... it is obliged to disregard to some extent its original or local meaning ... Science, then, may adopt mana as a general category ... ".&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} In Melanesia the ''animae'' are the souls of living men, the ghosts of deceased men, and spirits "of ghost-like appearance" or imitating living people. Spirits can inhabit other objects, such as animals or stones.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|115–120}}

The most significant property of mana is that it is distinct from, and exists independently of, its source. ''Animae'' act only through mana. It is impersonal, undistinguished, and (like energy) transmissible between objects, which can have more or less of it. Mana is perceptible, appearing as a "Power of awfulness" (in the sense of awe or wonder).&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Objects possessing it impress an observer with "respect, veneration, propitiation, service" emanating from the mana's power. Marett lists a number of objects habitually possessing mana: "startling manifestations of nature", "curious stones", animals, "human remains", blood,&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|2}} thunderstorms, eclipses, eruptions, glaciers, and the sound of a [[bullroarer]].&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|14–17}}

If mana is a distinct power, it may be treated distinctly. Marett distinguishes [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, which treat mana quasi-objectively, and prayers (which address the ''anima''). An ''anima'' may have departed, leaving mana in the form of a spell which can be addressed by [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Although Marett postulates an earlier pre-animistic phase, a "rudimentary religion" or "magico-religious" phase in which the mana figures without ''animae'', "no island of pure 'pre-animism' is to be found."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|xxvi}} Like Tylor, he theorizes a thread of commonality between animism and pre-animism identified with the [[supernatural]]—the "mysterious", as opposed to the reasonable.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|22}}

==={{anchor|Criticisms}}Criticism===
In 1936, [[Ian Hogbin]] criticised the universality of Marett's pre-animism: "Mana is by no means universal and, consequently, to adopt it as a basis on which to build up a general theory of primitive religion is not only erroneous but indeed fallacious".&lt;ref name="Mana"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogbin|first1=H. Ian|title=MANA|journal=Oceania|date=March 1936|volume=6|issue=3|pages=241–274|doi=10.1002/j.1834-4461.1936.tb00187.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marett intended the concept as an abstraction.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} Spells, for example, may be found "from Central Australia to Scotland."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

Early 20th-century scholars also saw mana as a universal concept, found in all human cultures and expressing fundamental human awareness of a sacred life energy. In his 1904 essay, "Outline of a General Theory of Magic", [[Marcel Mauss]] drew on the writings of Codrington and others to paint a picture of mana as "power ''par excellence'', the genuine effectiveness of things which corroborates their practical actions without annihilating them".&lt;ref name="Mauss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mauss|first1=Marcel|title=A General Theory of Magic|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415253963|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} Mauss pointed out the similarity of mana to the [[Iroquois]] [[orenda]] and the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] [[manitou]], convinced of the "universality of the institution";&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|116}} "a concept, encompassing the idea of magical power, was once found everywhere".&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Mauss and his collaborator, [[Henri Hubert]], were criticised for this position when their 1904 ''Outline of a General Theory of Magic'' was published. "No one questioned the existence of the notion of mana", wrote Mauss's biographer [[Marcel Fournier]], "but Hubert and Mauss were criticized for giving it a universal dimension".&lt;ref name="Fournier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fournier|first1=Marcel|title=Marcel Mauss: A Biography|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691117775|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of mana as an archetype of life energy increased. According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the idea of mana is not universal; in places where it is believed, not everyone has it, and "even among the varying formulae (''mana'', ''wakan'', ''orenda'', etc.) there are, if not glaring differences, certainly nuances not sufficiently observed in the early studies".&lt;ref name="Eliade"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Patterns in Comparative Religion|date=1996|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=9780803267336|page=22|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; "With regard to these theories founded upon the primordial and universal character of mana, we must say without delay that they have been invalidated by later research".&lt;ref name="Eliade2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Myths, Dreams and Mysteries: The Encounter Between Contemporary Faiths and Archaic Realities|date=1992|publisher=Peter Smith|location=Magnolia, Massachusetts|isbn=9780844666259|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Master of Science degree in engineering''' (abbreviated '''MSE''', '''M.Sc.Eng.''' or '''MScEng''') is a type of [[Master of Science degree]] awarded by [[universities]] in many countries. It is an [[academic degree]] to be differentiated from a [[Master of Engineering degree]].

A Master of Science degree in engineering can require completion of a [[thesis]] and qualifies the holder to apply for a program leading to a [[Doctor of Philosophy degree]] (often abbreviated Ph.D. or D.Phil) in engineering while a [[Master of Engineering]] degree can require completion of a project rather than [[thesis]] and usually does not qualify its holder to apply for a [[Ph.D]] or [[D.Phil]] in engineering. The Master of Science in engineering is considered equivalent to [[diplom]] degree in engineering in the countries that haven't a specific distinction between M.Eng. and M.Sc.Eng.

Equivalent degrees are:

* Dipl. ing. (''[[Diplôme d'ingénieur]]'') before name, France;
* Dipl.-Ing. (''Diplom-Ingenieur'') before name, Austria;
* Dipl.-Ing. (''Diplom-Ingenieur'') before name, Germany &lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Phased out due to [[Bologna process]]; not to be confused with Dipl.-Ing. degrees with additions such as "FH", "DA" or "DH" which are considered as Bachelor's degrees)&lt;/small&gt;;
* Ir (''burgerlijk ingenieur'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]) before name, The Netherlands/Belgium (NL);
* Ir (''Ingénieur Civil'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]) before name, Belgium (FR);
* Civ.ing. (''Civilingenjör'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]), Sweden;
* Cand.polyt. (''Civilingeniør'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]), Denmark;
* Siv.ing. (''sivilingeniør'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]), Norway;
* DI (''[[Diplomi-insinööri]]''), Finland;
* mgr inż. (''magister inżynier'') before name, Poland;
* okl. mérnök (''okleveles mérnök''), Hungary;
* Ing. (''Ingegnere'') before name, Italy;

'''''Masters of Sex: The Life and Times of William Masters and Virginia Johnson, the Couple Who Taught America How to Love''''' is a 2009 biography by [[Thomas Maier]]. The book chronicles the early lives and work of two American [[sexologist]]s, [[William Masters|Dr. William Masters]] and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]], who studied [[human sexuality]] from 1957 to the 1990s. The 2013 [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television series ''[[Masters of Sex]]'', starring [[Michael Sheen]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]], is based on the book.&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=PD|title=Masters of Sex by Thomas Maier – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/11/masters-sex-thomas-maier-review|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;{{cite web|title=Masters of Sex: The Life and Times of William Masters and Virginia Johnson, the Couple Who Taught America How to Love Paperback – July 30, 2013|url=https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Sex-William-Virginia-Johnson/dp/0465079997|publisher=amazon.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&amp;n&gt;{{cite web|title=Masters of Sex: The Life and Times of William Masters and Virginia Johnson, the Couple Who Taught America How to Love|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/masters-of-sex-thomas-maier/1100305060?ean=9780465079995|publisher=barnesandnoble.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goodreads&gt;{{cite web|title=Masters of Sex: The Life and Times of William Masters and Virginia Johnson, the Couple Who Taught America How to Love|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6320234-masters-of-sex|publisher=goodreads.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|last=Nehring|first=Cristina|title=Practice, Practice, Practice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/books/review/Nehring-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Nina|title=The real Masters &amp; Johnson-- and their TV counterparts|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-masters-of-sex-closeup-1122-20131121,0,5023077.column|publisher=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book had a positive reception. [[Debby Applegate]] described the biography as "a terrific book about the unlikely couple who touched off the [[sexual revolution]]. More than a biography, this is an intimate history of sex in the twentieth century." ''[[The New York Times]]'' commended Maier's writing style and sense of humor. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' named it as one of their favorite non-fiction books of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Our favorite nonfiction of 2009 - Printers Row|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/printers-row/our-favorite-nonfiction-of-2009.html|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=4 December 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213012153/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/printers-row/our-favorite-nonfiction-of-2009.html|archivedate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9181">'''Microvias''' are used as the interconnects between layers in high density interconnect (HDI) substrates and [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) to accommodate the high [[input/output]] (I/O) density of advanced packages. Driven by portability and wireless communications, the electronics industry strives to produce affordable, light, and reliable products with increased functionality. At the electronic component level, this translates to components with increased I/Os with smaller footprint areas (e.g. flip-chip packages, chip-scale packages, and direct chip attachments), and on the printed circuit board and package substrate level, to the use of high density interconnects (HDIs) (e.g. finer lines and spaces, and smaller [[via (electronics)|via]]s).

== Overview ==
IPC standards revised the definition of a microvia in 2013 to a hole with an aspect ratio of 1:1. Which is ratio of the hole diameter to depth (not to exceed 0.25 mm). Previously, microvia was any hole less than or equal to 0.15 mm in diameter &lt;ref&gt;https://blog.ipc.org/2014/01/10/new-microvia-definition-seeing-broader-usage/&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of smartphones and hand-held electronic devices, microvias have evolved from single-level to stacked microvias that cross over multiple HDI layers. 
Sequential build-up (SBU) technology is used to fabricate HDI boards. The HDI layers are usually built up from a traditionally manufactured double-sided core board or multilayer PCB. The HDI layers are built on both sides of the traditional PCB one by one with microvias. The SBU process consists of several steps: layer lamination, via formation, via metallization, and via filling. There are multiple choices of materials and/or technologies for each step.&lt;ref&gt;Happy Holden et al., The HDI Handbook, 1st Edition. Available from: http://www.hdihandbook.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Microvias can be filled with different materials and processes:&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;B. Birch, “Reliability Testing for Microvias in Printed Wire Boards”, Circuit World, Vol. 35, No. 4, pp. 3 – 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (1) filled with epoxy resin (b-stage) during a sequential lamination process step; (2) filled with non-conductive or conductive material other than copper as a separate processing step; (3) plated closed with electroplated copper; (4) screen printed closed with a copper paste. Buried microvias are required to be filled, while blind microvias on the external layers usually do not have any fill requirements.&lt;ref&gt;IPC-6016, “Qualification and Performance Specification for High-density Interconnect (HDI) Structures,” May 1999&lt;/ref&gt; A stacked microvia is usually filled with electroplated copper to make electrical interconnections between multiple HDI layers and provide structural support for the outer level(s) of the microvia or for a component mounted on the outermost copper pad.

== Microvia reliability ==
The reliability of HDI structure is one of the major constraints for its successful widespread implementation in the PCB industry. Good thermo-mechanical reliability of microvias is an essential part of HDI reliability. Many researchers and professionals have studied the reliability of microvias in HDI PCBs. The reliability of microvias depends on many factors such as microvia geometry parameters, dielectric material properties, and processing parameters.

Microvia reliability research has focused on experimental assessment of the reliability of single-level unfilled microvias, as well as finite element analysis on stress/strain distributions in single-level microvias and microvia fatigue life estimation. Microvia failures identified from the research include interfacial separation (separation between the base of the microvia and the target pad), barrel cracks, corner/knee cracks, and target pad cracks (also referred to as microvia pull out). These failures result from the thermomechanical stresses caused by coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch, in the PCB thickness direction, between the metallization in a microvia structure and the dielectric materials surrounding the metal. The following paragraph highlights some of the microvia reliability research.

Ogunjimi et al.&lt;ref&gt;A. O. Ogunjimi, S. Macgregor, and M. G. Pech, “The effect of manufacturing and design process variabilities on the fatigue file of the high density interconnect vias,” Journal of Electronics Manufacturing, Vol. 5, No. 2, Jule 1995, pp. 111-119&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the effect of manufacturing and design process variables on the fatigue life of microvias, including trace(conductor) thickness, layer or layers of the dielectric around the trace and in the microvia, via geometry, via wall angle, ductility coefficient of the conductor material, and strain concentration factor. Finite element models were created with different geometries, and ANOVA method was used to determine the significance of the different process variables. The ANOVA results showed that the strain concentration factor was the most important variable, followed with the ductility factor, metallization thickness, and via wall angle. Prabhu et al.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;A. S. Prabhu, D. B. Barker, M. G. Pecht, J. W. Evans, W. Grieg, E. S. Bernard, and E. Smith, “A Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue Analysis of High Density Interconnect Vias,” Advances in Electronic Packaging, Vol. 10, No. 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  conducted a finite element analysis (FEA) on an HDI microvia structure to determine the effect of accelerated temperature cycling and thermal shock. Liu et al.&lt;ref&gt;F. Liu, J. Lu, V. Sundaram, D. Sutter, G. White and D. F. Baldwin, and Rao R, “Reliability Assessment of Microvias in HDI Printed Circuit Board”, IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies, Vol. 25, No. 2, June 2000, pp. 254-259&lt;/ref&gt; and Ramakrishna et al.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ramakrishna, F. Liu, and S. K. Sitaramana, “Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Microvia Reliability”, The Eighth Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems, 2002, pp. 932 – 939&lt;/ref&gt; conducted liquid-to-liquid and air-to-air thermal shock testing, respectively, to studied the effect of dielectric material properties and microvia geometry parameters, such as microvia diameter, wall angle and plating thickness, on microvia reliability. Andrews et al.&lt;ref&gt;[14]	P. Andrews, G. Parry, P. Reid, “Concerns in the Lead Free Assembly Environment”, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; investigated single-level microvia reliability using IST (interconnect stress test), and considered the effect of reflow cycles of lead-free solder. Wang and Lai &lt;ref&gt;T. Wang and Y. Lai, “Stress Analysis for Fracture Potential of Blind Via in a Build-up Substrate,” Circuit World, Vol. 32, No. 2, 2006, pp: 39-44&lt;/ref&gt; investigated the potential failure sites of microvias using finite element modeling. They found that filled microvias have a lower stress than unfilled microvias. Choi and Dasgupta introduced microvia non-destructive inspection method in their work.&lt;ref&gt;C. Choi and A. Dasgupta, Microvia Non-Destructive Inspection Method, Proceedings of ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Vol. 5, 2009, pp. 15-22, doi:10.1115/IMECE2009-11779.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most microvia reliability research focuses on single-level microvias, Birch &lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt; tested multiple-level stacked and staggered microvias using IST test. Weibull analysis on the test data showed that single- and 2-level stacked microvias last longer than 3- and 4-level microvias (e. g.  2-level stacked microvias experienced about 20 times more cycles to failure than 4-level stacked microvias).

== Microvia voiding and its effect on thermomechanical reliability ==
[[File:MicroviaVoiding.png|thumb|right|a cross-section view of a microvia with a void]]
One challenge for high density interconnect board development, is to fabricate reliable microvias, especially for stacked microvias, without resulting in incomplete filling, dimples, or voids in the copper plating process.&lt;ref name = "ref12"&gt;Y. Ning, M. H. Azarian, and M. Pecht, Simulation of the Influence of Manufacturing Quality on Thermomechanical Stress of Microvias, IPC APEX 2014 Technical Conference, March 25–27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of &lt;ref name = "ref12" /&gt; have been investigating the risk of microvias in terms of voids and other defects using both experimental testing and finite element analysis. They found that incomplete copper filling increases the stress levels in microvias and hence decreases microvia fatigue life. As for voids, different voiding conditions, such as different void sizes, shapes, and locations result in different effects on microvia reliability. Small voids of a spherical shape lightly increase the microvia fatigue life, but extreme voiding conditions greatly reduce the duration of microvias. This team is currently developing a qualification method that the electronics industry can use to assess the risks with using an HDI circuit board that employs microvias.

'''NetCorps''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Cyberjeunes'') was a volunteer-organizing coalition consisting of nine Canadian [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), funded by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and managed by the NetCorps coordination unit.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/faq.php?tpl=orange "NetCorps Frequently asked questions"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the program, the organizations created international [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) internships in developing countries around the world. Interns typically participated in six-month programs, leaving between August and November for host organizations in the placement countries. Positions were limited to 19–30-year-old Canadian citizens or landed immigrants who had "appropriate information and communication technologies skills".&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; Typical duties included creating webpages, developing databases, computer networking, setting up hardware, preparing manuals and other documentation, and general-to-advanced computer instruction.

==Program ==

===Objectives===

* To strengthen the ICT capacity of civil society and public-sector organizations to contribute to development goals in governance, education, health, gender equality and environmental sustainability
* Increase the professional skills and capacities of young Canadians aged 19 to 30 to contribute positively to Canadian international development efforts and secure meaningful employment
* To increase the awareness and promote greater engagement of young Canadians with respect to international development issues&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

===Budget===
During the 2007-2008 season, the program placed 240 interns and was funded by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and Human Resources and [[Social Development Canada]] (HRSDC) at a cost of C$4.6 million. The program covered all travel and accommodation expenses for the interns, provided a modest living allowance and a completion bonus.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

==History==

===NetCorps creation===

NetCorps Canada International was conceived in 1996 by Dr. David Johnston (Governor General of Canada as of 2011 and former President of the [[University of Waterloo]]), a prominent lawyer and adviser to the federal government on information-highway issues.

===Phase I===

In 1997 [[Industry Canada]], in partnership with the Special Initiatives Division of Canada's [[International Development Research Centre]] (IDRC), funded a NetCorps-style test project that sent two residents of Cape Breton to Angola for Internet and [[Geographic Information System]]s projects. This NetCorps conceptualization and placement was done through the Centre for Community and Enterprise Networking (C/CEN) and Dr.[[Michael Gurstein]], Director of the Centre and (at the time) Chair in the Management of Technology Change at the [[University College of Cape Breton]]. An initial NetCorps training program and manual were produced as a result of this program. Notably, the two placements in Angola were of previously unemployed young adults from Cape Breton; they were provided with training in [[Linux]] through C/CEN as part of a demonstration program in the economic benefits that could be achieved through local investment in Information and Communications Technologies in economically marginal regions.

===Phase II===

In 1998 the efforts of Industry Canada, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and a consortium of Canada’s largest international development volunteer-sending agencies secured 14 internships in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

===Phase III===

Further collaboration with Industry Canada and the consortium of international development agencies in 1998 saw the Canadian International Development Agency offer 30 internships in the Americas. This phase was announced by the Prime Minister at the [[2nd Summit of the Americas]] in Santiago, Chile in April 1998.

===Phase IV - NetCorps Canada International===

From 1999 to 2006, the NetCorps consortium sent more than 1700 NetCorps volunteers overseas, due to the collaboration of Industry Canada and the Youth Employment Strategy financed by [[Human Resources and Skills Development Canada]] (HRSDC).

===2006–2007 – Transition Year===

In 2006–2007, the consortium successfully organized the placement of 236 volunteers in collaboration with Industry Canada and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). 2006-2007 was the last year that Industry Canada would be involved in the NetCorps program.

===Phase VI – 2007–2008===

For 2007–2008, (CIDA) replaced Industry Canada as funders of the NetCorps program. The 240 placements offered that year were once again part of the Government of Canada’s youth-employment strategy.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/history.php?tpl=red "A history of NetCorps Canada International"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was discontinued indefinitely as of the 2008–2009 season.&lt;ref name="mainpage"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/home.php? "NetCorps News"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oriental studies''' is the academic field of study that embraces [[Near East]]ern and [[Far East]]ern societies and cultures, languages, peoples, history and archaeology; in recent years the subject has often been turned into the newer terms of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]]. Traditional Oriental studies in Europe is today generally focused on the discipline of [[Islamic studies]], while the study of China, especially traditional China, is often called [[Sinology]]. The study of [[East Asia]] in general, especially in the United States, is often called [[East Asian studies]], while the study of [[Israel]] and [[Jews]] are called [[Israel studies]] and [[Jewish studies]] respectively, although they are often considered the same field.

European study of the region formerly known as "the [[Orient]]" had primarily religious origins, which has remained an important motivation until recent times. Learning from Arabic medicine and philosophy, and the Greek translations from Arabic, was an important factor in the Middle Ages. Linguistic knowledge preceded a wider study of cultures and history, and as Europe began to encroach upon the region, political and economic factors encouraged growth in academic study. From the late 18th century archaeology became a link from the discipline to a wide European public, as treasures brought back filled new European museums. The modern study was influenced both by [[Imperialism|imperialist]] attitudes and interests, and also the sometimes naive fascination of the exotic East for Mediterranean and European writers and thinkers, captured in images by artists, that is embodied in a repeatedly-surfacing theme in the [[history of ideas]] in the West, called "[[Orientalism]]". In the last century, scholars from the region itself have participated on equal terms in the discipline.

== History of Oriental studies ==

=== Pre-Islam ===
The original distinction between the "West" and the "East" was crystallized in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] of the 5th century BC, when [[Athens|Athenian]] historians made a distinction between their "[[Athenian democracy]]" and the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] monarchy. An institutional distinction between East and West did not exist as a defined polarity before the ''Oriens-'' and ''Occidens''-divided administration of the Emperor [[Diocletian]]'s [[Roman Empire]] at the end of the 3rd century AD, and the division of the Empire into [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking portions. The classical world had intimate knowledge of their [[Ancient Persia]]n neighbours (and usually enemies), but very [[Sino-Roman relations|imprecise]] knowledge of most of the world further East, including the "[[Seres]]" (Chinese). However, there was substantial direct [[Roman trade with India]] (unlike with China) in the Imperial period.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:HaytonRemittingHisReportToThePope.JPG|left|thumb|[[Hayton of Corycus]] remitting his report on the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], to [[Pope Clement V]], in 1307.]]
The [[Spread of Islam|rise of Islam]] and [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century established a sharp opposition, or even a sense of polarity, between medieval European [[Christendom]] and the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] (which stretched from the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] to [[North Africa]] and [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]]). During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Muslim]]s and [[Jew]]s were considered the "alien" enemies of Christendom. Popular medieval European knowledge of cultures farther to the East was poor, dependent on the wildly fictionalized travels of Sir [[John Mandeville]] and legends of [[Prester John]], although the equally famous, and much longer, account by [[Marco Polo]] was a good deal more accurate.

Scholarly work was initially very largely linguistic in nature, with primarily a religious focus on understanding both [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]] and languages like [[Syriac language|Syriac]] with early Christian literature, but also from a wish to understand [[Arabic language|Arabic]] works on [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] and [[Islamic science|science]]. This effort, also called the ''[[Studia Linguarum]]'' existed sporadically throughout the Middle Ages, and the "[[Renaissance of the 12th century]]" witnessed a particular [[Latin translations of the 12th century|growth in translations]] of Arabic texts into Latin, with figures like [[Constantine the African]], who translated 37 books, mostly medical texts, from Arabic to Latin, and [[Herman of Carinthia]], one of the translators of the [[Qur'an]]. The [[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete|earliest translation]] of the Qur'an into [[Latin]] was completed in 1143, although little use was made of it until it was printed in 1543, after which it was translated into other European languages. [[Gerard of Cremona]] and others based themselves in [[Al-Andaluz]] to take advantage of the Arabic libraries and scholars there. Later, with the Christian [[Reconquista]] in full progress, such contacts became rarer in Spain. Chairs of Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic were briefly established at Oxford, and four other universities following the [[Council of Vienne]] (1312).&lt;ref&gt;''Hebrew to Latin, Latin to Hebrew: the mirroring of two cultures'' 2006 Page 75 Giulio Busi, Freie Universität Berlin. Institut für Judaistik - 2006 "According to the famous decision of the council of Vienne (1311–1312), Oxford was chosen as one of four universities (with Paris, Bologna and Salamanca) where Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Aramaic were to be taught."&lt;/ref&gt;

There was [[Chronology of European exploration of Asia|vague but increasing]] knowledge of the complex civilizations in [[China]] and [[History of India|India]], from which luxury goods (notably [[cotton]] and [[silk]] textiles as well as [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]]) were imported. Although the [[Crusades]] produced relatively little in the way of scholarly interchange, the eruption of the [[Mongol Empire]] had strategic implications for both the [[Crusader kingdoms]] and Europe itself, and led to [[Franco-Mongol alliance|extended diplomatic contacts]]. From the [[Age of Exploration]], European interest in [[Cartography of Asia|mapping Asia]], and especially the sea-routes, became intense, though mostly pursued outside the universities.

=== Renaissance to 1800 ===
{{Unreferenced section|date= July 2017}}
[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (徐光啟) (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' (幾何原本) published in 1607.]]
University Oriental studies became systematic during the Renaissance, with the linguistic and religious aspects initially continuing to dominate. There was also a political dimension, as translations for diplomatic purposes were needed, even before the West engaged actively with the East beyond the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A landmark was the publication in Spain in 1514 of the first [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Polyglot Bible]], containing the complete existing texts in [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]], in addition to Greek and Latin. At [[Cambridge University]] there has been a [[Regius Professor of Hebrew (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Hebrew]] since 1540 (the fifth oldest regular chair there), and the [[Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic|chair in Arabic]] was founded in about 1643. Oxford followed for Hebrew in 1546 (both chairs were established by Henry VIII). Distinguished scholars included [[Edmund Castell]], who published his ''Lexicon Heptaglotton Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Aethiopicum, Arabicum, et Persicum'' in 1669, whilst some scholars like [[Edward Pococke]] had travelled to the East and wrote also on the modern history and society of Eastern peoples. The [[University of Salamanca]] had Professors of Oriental Languages from at least the 1570s. In France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] initiated a training programme for "Les Jeunes de langues", young linguists with the diplomatic service, like [[François Pétis de la Croix]], who like his father and his son served as Arabic interpreter to the King. Study of the [[Far East]] was pioneered by missionaries, especially [[Matteo Ricci]] and others in the [[Jesuit China missions]], and missionary motives were to remain important, at least in linguistic studies.

During the 18th century Western scholars reached a reasonable basic level of understanding of the geography and most of the history of the region, though knowledge of the areas least accessible to Western travellers, like [[Japan]] and [[Tibet]], and their languages, remained limited. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers characterized aspects of the pagan East as superior to the Christian West, in [[Montesquieu]]'s ''Lettres Persanes'' or [[Voltaire]]'s ironic promotion of [[Zoroastrianism]]; others, like [[Edward Gibbon]], praised the relative religious tolerance of the Middle East as opposed to the intolerant Christian West, and many, including [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], the high social status of scholarship in [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]] China.
The [[Università degli Studi di Napoli "L'Orientale"]] (English: University of Naples "L'Orientale"), founded in Naples, Italy, in 1732, is the oldest school of Sinology and Oriental Studies of the European continent.

The end of the century saw the beginnings in the great increase in study of the [[archaeology]] of the period, which was to be an ever-more important aspect of the field through the next century. [[Egyptology]] led the way, and as with many other ancient cultures, provided the linguists with new material for decipherment and study.

=== Nineteenth century ===
[[File:Kolkata Asiatic Society2.jpg|thumb|The old building of the [[Asiatic Society]] in [[Calcutta]], founded by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] in 1784]]
With a great increase in knowledge of Asia among Western specialists, increasing political and economic involvement in the region, and in particular the realization of the existence of [[Indo-European languages|close relations between Indian and European languages]], by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], there emerged more complex intellectual connections between the early history of Eastern and Western cultures. Some of these developments occurred in the context of Franco–British rivalry for control of India. Liberal economists, such as [[James Mill]], denigrated Eastern civilizations as static and corrupt. [[Karl Marx]], himself of [[Jewish]] origin, characterized the [[Asiatic mode of production]] as unchanging, because of the economic narrowness of village economies and the State's role in production. [[Oriental despotism]] was generally regarded in Europe as a major factor in the relative failure of [[progress (history)|progress]] of Eastern societies. The study of Islam in particular was central to the field since the majority of people living in the geographical area termed 'the Orient' were Muslims. Interest in understanding Islam was partly fueled by economic considerations of growing trade in the Mediterranean region and the changing cultural and intellectual climate of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, ''Contending Visions of the Middle East'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004:44&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the century Western archaeology spread across the Middle East and Asia, with spectacular results. In the 1850s, for example, the French Government was determined to mount large-scale operations in Assyria  and Mesopotamia to showcase its dominance in the region. An archaeological team led by [[Victor Place]] excavated the palace of the Assyrian King [[Sargon II]] in [[Dur-Sharrukin|Khorsabad]] (formerly [[Nineveh]]), would become the first systematic excavation of the site. &lt;ref&gt;Potts, D.T. (ed), ''A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,'' Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt; This expedition resulted in a pioneering publication entitled ''Ninevah and Assyria'', jointly authored by [[Victor Place]] and [[Felix Thomas]] and published in around 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Maisels, C.K., ''The Near East: Archaeology in the Cradle of Civilization,'' Routledge, 2005, pp 40-41; Tanner, J.P., “Ancient Babylon: From Gradual Demise to Archaeological Rediscovery,” ''Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin,'' Vol. 47 ,2002, pp 11-20; Library notes on ''Ninive et L'Assyrie, Consul General Avec Des Essais De Restauration,'' by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, [3 volume set],  Imprimerie Imperiale, Paris, 1857, Online: https://www.iberlibro.com/buscar-libro/primera-edicion/tapa-dura/precio-min/30/vi/960590/sortby/1/; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;  New national museums provided a setting for important archaeological finds, most of which were in this period bought back to Europe, and put Orientalists in the public spotlight as never before.

The first serious European studies of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] were by the scholars [[Eugene Burnouf]] and [[Max Müller]]. In that time, the academic [[Islamic studies by author (non-Muslim or academic)|study of Islam]] also developed, and, by the mid-19th century, Oriental Studies was a well-established academic discipline in most European countries, especially those with imperial interests in the region. Yet, while scholastic study expanded, so did [[Racism|racist]] attitudes and stereotypes of "inscrutable", "wily" Orientals. This frequently extended to local [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] communities, who were also of [[Genetic studies on Jews|Oriental origin]] and widely recognized as such. Scholarship often was intertwined with prejudicial racist and religious presumptions,&lt;ref&gt;J. Go, "'Racism' and Colonialism: Meanings of Difference and Ruling Practice in America's Pacific Empire" in ''Qualitative Sociology' '''27'''.1 (March 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; to which the new [[biology|biological sciences]] tended to contribute until the middle of the following century.

=== Twentieth century ===
[[File:Rosetta Stone International Congress of Orientalists ILN 1874.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Experts inspecting the [[Rosetta Stone]] during the [[Second International Congress of Orientalists]] in London, 1874]]
The participation in academic studies by scholars from the newly independent nations of the region itself inevitably changed the nature of studies considerably, with the emergence of [[post-colonial studies]] and [[Subaltern Studies]]. The influence of [[Orientalism]] (in the sense used by Edward Said in his [[Orientalism (book)|book of the same name]]) in scholarship on the Middle East was seen to have re-emerged and risen in prevalence again after the end of the Cold War. It is contended that this was partly a response to "a lacuna" in identity politics in international relations generally, and within the 'West' particularly, which was brought about by the absence of Soviet communism as a global adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Hippler and Andrea Lueg (eds.), ''The Next Threat: Western Perceptions of Islam'' (Pluto Press/The Transnational Institute, London, 1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The post–Cold War era has been marked by discussions of Islamist terrorism framing views on the extent to which the culture of the [[Arab world]] and Islam is a threat to that of the West. The essence of this debate reflects a presupposition for which Orientalism has been criticized - that the 'Orient' is defined exclusively by Islam. Such considerations as these were seen to have occurred in the wider context of the way in which many Western scholars responded to international politics in the post–Cold War world; and they were arguably heightened following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, ''Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2004), pp. 223–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic of this type of response to the end of the [[Cold War]] was the popularization of the '[[clash of civilizations]]' thesis. This particular idea of a fundamental conflict between East and West was first advanced by [[Bernard Lewis]] in an article entitled "The Roots of Muslim Rage", written in 1990. Again, this was seen as a way of accounting for new forms and lines of division in post–Cold War international society. The 'clash of civilizations' approach involved another characteristic of Orientalist thought; namely, the tendency to see the region as being one, homogenous 'civilization', rather than as comprising various different and diverse cultures and strands. It was an idea that was taken on more famously by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] in his 1993 article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', called "The Clash of Civilizations?".&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Orientalism}}
The term ''Orientalism'' has come to acquire negative connotations in some quarters and is interpreted to refer to the study of the East by Westerners shaped by the attitudes of the era of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it often implies prejudiced, outsider-caricatured interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by [[Edward Said]] in ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=J.J.|title=Oriental enlightenment the encounter between Asian and Western thought|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, as opposed to those who saw nothing of value in non-Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;For example Thomas R. Trautmann in ''Aryans and British India'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-520-20546-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From "Oriental Studies" to "Asian Studies" ==

{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2012}}
Like the term ''[[Orient]]'', ''Orientalism'' derives from the Latin word ''oriens'' (rising) and, equally likely, from the Greek word ('he'oros', the direction of the rising sun). "Orient" is the opposite of ''[[Western world|Occident]]'', a term for the Western world. In terms of the [[Old World]], [[Europe]] was considered the [[Western world|Occident]] (the west), and its farthest-known extreme the [[Orient]] (the east).  Dating from the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, what is now, in the West, considered 'the [[Middle East]]' was then considered 'the Orient'.  However, use of the various terms and senses derived from "Orient" has greatly declined in the 20th century, not least as trans-Pacific links between Asia and America have grown; nowadays, Asia usually arrives at the USA from the West.

In most [[North America]]n universities, Oriental Studies has now been replaced by [[Asian Studies]] localised to specific regions, such as [[Middle East]]ern or Near Eastern Studies, [[South Asia]]n studies, and [[East Asia]]n Studies.  This reflects the fact that the Orient is not a single, monolithic region but rather a broad area encompassing multiple [[civilization]]s. The generic concept of Oriental Studies, to its opponents, has lost any use it may have once had and is perceived as obstructing changes in departmental structures to reflect actual patterns of modern scholarship.  In many universities, like Chicago, the faculties and institutions have divided; the Biblical languages may be linked with theological institutes, and the study of ancient civilizations in the region may come under a different faculty to studies of modern periods.

In 2007 the Faculty of Oriental Studies at [[Cambridge University]] was renamed the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, but Oxford still has its [[Oriental Institute, Oxford|Faculty for Oriental Studies]], as do [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Chicago]], [[Pontifical Oriental Institute|Rome]], [[School of Oriental and African Studies|London]] (covering African studies also), and [[Oriental Institute (disambiguation)|other universities]].

Various explanations for the change to "Asian studies" are offered; a growing number of professional scholars and students of Asian Studies are themselves Asian or from groups of Asian origin (like [[Asian American]]s). This change of labeling may be correlated in some cases to the fact that sensitivity to the term "Oriental" has been heightened in a more [[politically correct]] atmosphere, although it began earlier: Bernard Lewis' own department at [[Princeton University]] was renamed a decade ''before'' Said wrote his book, a detail that Said gets wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etc.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/mfs/05/Companion/near_eastern_studies.html Princeton University, Near Eastern Studies department]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   By some, the term "Oriental" has come to be thought offensive to non-Westerners. [[Area studies]] that incorporate not only philological pursuits but [[identity politics]] may also account for the hesitation to use the term "Oriental".

Supporters of "Oriental Studies" counter that the term "[[Asia#Etymology|Asian]]" is just as encompassing as "Oriental," and may well have originally had the same meaning, were it derived from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for "East" (a more common derivation is from one or both of two Anatolian proper names). Replacing one word with another is to confuse historically objectionable ''opinions'' about the East with the concept of "the East" itself. The terms Oriental/Eastern and Occidental/Western are both inclusive concepts that usefully identify large-scale cultural differences. Such general concepts do not preclude or deny more specific ones.

'''Physiological chemistry''' is the [[chemistry]] of the organs and tissues of the body and of the various physiological processes incident to life.  Physiological chemistry is essentially the precursor to modern [[biochemistry]].  In the nineteenth century, physiological chemistry dealt primarily with extracellular chemistry, such as the chemistry of digestion and other body fluids.  Modern biochemical methods have allowed a much broader study including the chemistry of [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acids]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144425/http://www.hssonline.org/teach_res/essays/allen/allenp5.html Life Sciences in the Twentieth Century, Garland E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6546">'''Preservationist''' is generally understood to mean ''historic preservationist'': one who advocates to preserve architecturally or historically significant buildings, structures, objects, or sites from demolition or degradation. [[Historic preservation]] usually refers to the preservation of the built environment, not to the preservation of, for instance, primeval forests or wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, ''[http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055105/http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources |date=2011-07-27 }}'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Preservationist'' is, however, sometimes used descriptively in other contexts, notably with regards to language and the environment.

==Other uses of the term==
Persons who work to preserve ancient or [[endangered language]]s are called [[Language preservation|language preservationists.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Language Preservation: UNESCO-CI |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11171&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060706085338/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11171&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservationist is also sometimes used in the natural [[environmentalist]] field, but while the natural environment [[conservation movement|conservationist]] movements preserve [[ecosystem]]s and the [[natural environment]], this movement is widely known as ''[[conservation ethic|conservation]]'' or ''[[environmentalism]]''. 

*Clarification: A key difference between the Preservationist and [[conservation movement|Conservationist]] [[environmentalist]] schools is this: Preservationists view the environment as having intrinsic value that should be preserved by making as little change to it as possible. Conservationists view the environment as having instrumental value that can be of help to people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Earle Funk]], ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; and generally accept [[Gifford Pinchot]]'s notion of [[sustainable yield]]: that man can harvest some forest or animal products from a natural environment on a regular basis without compromising the long-health of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;W.N. Sparhawk, "The History of Forestry in America" in Trees: Yearbook of Agriculture,1949. Washington,D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservationism has been defined by [[Richard Heinberg]] in his book ''Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World'' as distinguishing survivalist groups who wish merely to survive a collapse of civilization from preservationist communities who wish to preserve as much of human culture as is possible in the event of collapse. 

*Clarification: The idea of preservationist communities is part of a broader strategy in which individuals achieve independence from the centralized power grid, forming sustainable communities that could provide mutual support in the event of critical depletion of non-renewable resources.&lt;ref&gt;Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World ({{ISBN|9780865715103}}) (2004; British edition 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pulverizer''' or '''grinder''' is a mechanical device for the grinding of many different types of materials. For example, a pulverizer mill is used to [[Pulverized coal-fired boiler|pulverize coal]] for [[combustion]] in the steam-generating [[furnaces]] of [[fossil fuel power plant]]s.

==Types of coal pulverizers==
Coal pulverizers may be classified by speed, as follows:&lt;ref name="CPMT-GS"&gt;Coal Pulverising Mill Types, by Glenn Schumacher, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low Speed
* Medium Speed
* High Speed

===Low Speed===

====Ball and tube mills====

A ball mill is a pulverizer that consists of a horizontal rotating cylinder, up to three diameters in length, containing a charge of tumbling or cascading steel balls, pebbles, or rods.

A tube mill is a revolving cylinder of up to five diameters in length used for fine pulverization of [[ore]], rock, and other such materials; the material, mixed with water, is fed into the chamber from one end, and passes out the other end as a [[slurry]].

Both types of mill include liners that protect the cylindrical structure of the mill from wear.  Thus the main wear parts in these mills are the balls themselves, and the liners.  The balls are simply "consumed" by the wear process and must be re-stocked, whereas the liners must be periodically replaced.

The ball and tube mills are low-speed machines that grind the coal with steel balls in a rotating horizontal cylinder. Due to its shape, it is called a tube mill and due to use of grinding balls for crushing, it is called a ball mill, or both terms as a ball tube mill..

These mills are also designated as an example size, BBD-4772,

*B – Broyer (Name of inventor).
*B – Boulet (French word for balls).
*D – Direct firing.
*47 – Diameter of shell (in decimeters) i.e. 4.7&amp;nbsp;m diameter.
*72 – Length of shell (in decimeters) i.e. 7.2&amp;nbsp;m length.

The grinding in the ball and tube mill is produced by the rotating quantity of steel balls by their fall and lift due to tube rotation. The ball charge may occupy one third to half of the total internal volume of the shell. The significant feature incorporated in the BBD mills is its double end operation, each end catering to one elevation of a boiler. The system facilitated entry of raw coal and exit of pulverized fuel from same end simultaneously. This helps in reducing the number of installations per unit.

====Mill construction details====
A ball tube mill may be described as a cylinder made of steel plates having separate heads or trunions attached to the ends with each trunion resting on suitable bearings for supporting the machine. The trunions are hollow to allow for the introduction of discharge of the materials undergoing reduction in size. The mill shell is lined with chilled iron, carbon steel, manganese steel, or high chrome liners attached to shell body with counter sunk bolts. These liners are made in different shapes so that the counter inside surface of the mill is suited for requirement of a particular application.

The shells are of three pieces. The intermediate shell connects to the end shells by flange joints and the total length of shell is 7.2&amp;nbsp;m. The liners are fastened to the inner side of mill shell (cylindrical part) to protect the shell from the impact of the steel balls. There are 600 liners of ten variants in each shell weighing 60.26&amp;nbsp;tonnes. The original lift value of the liners is 55&amp;nbsp;mm. and the minimum lift allowed is 20&amp;nbsp;mm.

====Operation====
The primary air input to a ball tube mill performs a dual function. It is used for drying and as the fuel transport medium, and by regulating it the mill output is regulated. Governed by the pulverized fuel outlet temperature requirement, the cold air and hot air dampers are regulated to achieve the correct primary air temperature. In addition to raising the coal temperature inside the mill for drying and better grinding, the same air works as the transport medium to move the pulverized coal out of the mill: it travels through the annular space between the fixed trunnion tubes and the rotating hot air tube onwards to the classifier. Coal-laden air passes through double cone static classifiers, with adjustable classifier vanes, for segregation into pulverized fuel of the desired fineness, and coarse particles. The pulverised fuel continues its journey towards the coal burners for combustion. The coarse particles rejected in the classifier are returned to the mill for another cycle of grinding.

In order to avoid excess sweeping of coal from the mill, only part of the primary air, directly proportional to the boiler load demand, is passed through the mill. Furthermore, to ensure sufficient velocity of pulverized fuel to avoid settling in the pipes, an additional quantity of primary air is fed into a mixing box on the raw coal circuit. This by-pass air tapped from the primary air duct going into the mill makes an appreciable contribution to the drying of raw coal, by a flash drying effect, in addition to picking up the pulverized fuel from the mill outlet for its transportation towards the classifiers.

The tube mill output (responding to boiler load demand) is controlled by regulating the primary air-flow. This regulation, by sweeping pulverized fuel from the mill, is very fast; comparable with oil firing response, but needs the coal level to be maintained in the mill. A control circuit monitors the coal level in the mill, and controls the speed of the raw coal feeder to maintain it. Maintaining the coal level in the mill offers a built-in capacity cushion of pulverized fuel to take care of short interruptions in the raw coal circuit.

The mill is pressurized and the air-tightness is ensured by plenum chambers around the rotating trunnion filled with pressurized seal air. Bleeding seal air from plenum chamber to the mill maintains separation between pulverized fuel in the Mill and the outside atmosphere. Inadequacy or absence of seal air will allow escape of pulverized fuel into atmosphere. On the other hand, an excess of seal air leaking into mill will affect the mill outlet temperature. As such the seal air is controlled by a local control damper maintaining just sufficient differential pressure for sealing.

===Medium Speed===

====Ring and ball mill====

This type of mill consists of two types of rings separated by a series of large balls, like a [[thrust bearing]].  The lower ring rotates, while the upper ring presses down on the balls via a set of spring and adjuster assemblies, or pressurised rams. The material to be pulverized is introduced into the center or side of the pulverizer (depending on the design). As the lower ring rotates, the balls to orbit between the upper and lower rings, and balls roll over the bed of coal on the lower ring. The pulverized material is carried out of the mill by the flow of air moving through it. The size of the pulverized particles released from the grinding section of the mill is determined by a classifier separator. If the coal is fine enough to be picked up by the air, it is carried through the classifier. Coarser particles return to be further pulverized.

===Vertical spindle roller mill===

Similar to the ring and ball mill, the vertical spindle roller mill uses large "tires" to crush the coal. These mills are usually found in utility plants.

Raw coal is gravity-fed through a central feed pipe to the grinding table where it flows outwardly by centrifugal action and is ground between the rollers and table. Hot primary air for drying and coal
transport enters the windbox plenum underneath the grinding table and flows upward through a swirl ring having multiple sloped nozzles surrounding the grinding table. The air mixes with and
dries coal in the grinding zone and carries pulverized coal particles upward into a classifier.

Fine pulverized coal exits the outlet section through multiple discharge coal pipes leading to the burners, while oversized coal particles are rejected and returned to the grinding zone for further grinding.
Pyrites and extraneous dense impurity material fall through the nozzle ring and are plowed, by scraper blades attached to the grinding table, into the pyrites chamber to be removed.
Mechanically, the vertical roller mill is categorized as an applied force mill. There are three grinding roller wheel assemblies in the mill grinding section, which are mounted on a loading frame via pivot point.
The fixed-axis roller in each roller wheel assembly rotates on a segmentally-lined grinding table that is supported and driven by a planetary gear reducer direct-coupled to a motor. The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the gear reducer and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.

Depending on the required coal fineness, there are two types of classifier that may be selected for a vertical roller mill. The dynamic classifier, which consists of a stationary angled inlet vane assembly surrounding a rotating vane assembly or cage, is capable of producing [[micrometre|micrometer]]-fine pulverized coal with a narrow particle size distribution. In addition, adjusting the speed of the rotating cage can easily change the intensity of the centrifugal force field in the classification zone to achieve coal fineness control real-time to make immediate accommodation for a change in fuel or boiler load conditions. For the applications where a micrometer-fine pulverized coal is not necessary, the static classifier, which consists of a cone equipped with adjustable vanes, is an option at a lower cost since it contains no moving parts. With adequate mill grinding capacity, a vertical mill equipped with a static classifier is capable of producing a coal fineness up to 99.5% or higher &lt;50 mesh and 80% or higher &lt;200 mesh, while one equipped with a dynamic classifier produces coal fineness levels of 100% &lt;100 mesh and 95% &lt;200 mesh, or better.

In 1954 a '''Jet Pulverizer''' was developed in which operates like a Vertical Pulverizer only the item is pulverized by the high speed air action. For example, forcing coal against coal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nd8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q3YzT6TaKu2o0AHgjvW_Ag&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Jet Pulverizer."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1954, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bowl mill===
Similar to the vertical roller mill, it also uses tires to crush coal. There are two types, a deep bowl mill, and a shallow bowl mill.

Rammed earth is simple to manufacture, non-combustible, [[Thermal mass|thermally massive]], strong, and durable. However, structures such as walls can be laborious to construct of rammed earth without machinery, e. g., powered tampers, and they are susceptible to water damage if inadequately protected or maintained.

Edifices formed of rammed earth are on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in a range of environments including temperate, wet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-CAT-lecture-theatre.htm |title=Rammed Earth Lecture Theatre, CAT |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; semiarid desert, montane, and tropical regions. The availability of suitable soil and a [[architecture|building design]] appropriate for local [[climate|climatic conditions]] are the factors that favour its use.

==Composition and use==
{{Original research | section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Tapialdebarro.jpg|thumb|left|Model of construction of a wall of rammed earth on a foundation]]
Manufacturing rammed earth involves compressing a damp mixture of [[soil|earth]] that has suitable proportions of [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], and/or an added stabilizer into an externally supported frame or mold, forming either a solid wall or individual blocks. Historically, additives such as [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or animal blood were used to stabilize it,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} while modern construction adds [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[cement]], or [[asphalt]] emulsions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} To add variety, some modern builders also add coloured oxides or other materials, e.g. bottles, tires, or pieces of timber.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The construction of an entire wall begins with a temporary frame, denominated the "[[formwork]]", which is usually made of wood or plywood, as a mold for the desired shape and dimensions of each section of wall. The form must be durable and well braced, and the two opposing faces must be clamped together to prevent bulging or deformation caused by the large compressing forces. Damp material is poured into the formwork to a depth of {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and then compacted to approximately 50% of its original height.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material is compressed iteratively, in batches or courses, so as to gradually erect the wall up to the top of the [[formwork]]. Tamping was historically manual with a long ramming pole, and was very laborious, but modern construction can be made less so by employing [[pneumatic]]ally powered tampers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Paderne Morrish Castle 26 Nov 2007 (6).JPG|thumb|right|Taipa fortifications at [[Paderne Castle]] in the Algarve, Portugal]]

After a wall is complete, it is sufficiently strong to immediately remove the formwork.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is necessary if a surface texture is to be applied, e.g., by wire brushing, carving, or mold impression, because the walls become too hard to work after approximately one hour.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Construction is optimally done in warm weather so that the walls can dry and harden.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[compression strength]] of the rammed earth increases as it cures; some time is necessary for it to dry and as long as two years can be necessary for complete curing.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Exposed walls must be sealed to prevent water damage.

In modern variations of the technique, rammed-earth walls are constructed on top of conventional [[Foundation (architecture)|footings]] or a [[reinforced concrete]] slab base.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Where blocks made of rammed earth are used, they are generally stacked like regular blocks and are bonded together with a thin mud slurry instead of cement.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Special machines, usually powered by small engines and often portable, are used to compress the material into blocks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Presently more than 30% of the world's population uses earth as a building material.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Rammed earth has been used globally in a wide range of climatic conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed-earth housing may resolve homelessness caused by otherwise expensive construction techniques.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Qualities ==
[[File:Rammed earth wall surface.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the surface of a rammed-earth wall: apart from the patches of damage, the surface shows regular horizontal lines caused by the wooden [[formwork]] and subtler horizontal strata from successive courses.]]

The [[compressive strength]] of rammed earth is a maximum of {{convert|4.3|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}. This is less than that of [[concrete]] but more than sufficiently strong for domestic edifices.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webs.ashlandctc.org/jnapora/hum-faculty/syllabi/trad.html |title=A Traditional Research Paper: Rammed Earth Construction |first=Robert O. |last=Cassell  |work=Ashland  Community  and Technical College|date= 17 December 2001 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, properly constructed rammed earth endures for thousands of years, as many ancient structures that are still standing around the world demonstrate.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rammedearthconstructions.com.au/index.php?mp_id=5 |title=BENEFITS OF BUILDING IN RAMMED EARTH |work=Rammed Earth Constructions |publisher=Rammed Earth Constructions P/L |location=[[Maleny]], [[Australia]] |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rammed earth reinforced with [[rebar]], wood, or [[bamboo]] can prevent collapse caused by earthquakes or heavy storms,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} because unreinforced edifices of rammed earth resist earthquake damage extremely poorly. See [[1960 Agadir earthquake]] for an example of the total destruction which may be inflicted on such structures by an earthquake. Adding cement to soil mixtures poor in clay can also increase the load-bearing capacity of rammed-earth edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] observed in 1925 that rammed-earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses.&lt;ref name="USDA Farmer Bulletin 1500"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |title=Farmers' Bulletin No. 1500: Rammed Earth Walls for Buildings - Rammed Earth Books - The Boden Hauser |first1=Morris Cotgrave |last1=Betts |first2=Thomas Arrington Huntington |last2=Miller |work=The Boden Hauser |page=20 |date=May 1937 |origyear=1925 |accessdate=February 4, 2012 |oclc=600507592 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225224741/http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }} Originally published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Washington, DC, USA.

Soil is a widely available, inexpensive, and [[sustainable]] resource.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earth.sustainablesources.com/#Soils |title=Soils for Rammed Earth, Caliche Block, and Soil Material Construction |publisher=Sustainable Sources |location=Austin, TX, USA| accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, construction with rammed earth is very viable.{{vague|date=July 2017|reason=Viable in what sense? Compared to what? Under which circumstances?}} Unskilled labour can do most of the necessary work.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; While the cost of rammed earth is low, rammed-earth construction without mechanical tools is very time-consuming and laborious; however, with a mechanical tamper and prefabricated [[formwork]] it can require only two or three days to construct the walls of a {{convert|200|to|220|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} house.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

One significant benefit of rammed earth is its high [[thermal mass]]: like [[brick]] or [[concrete]], it can absorb heat during daytime and nocturnally release it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This action moderates daily temperature variations and reduces the need for [[air conditioning]] and [[heating]]. In colder climates, rammed-earth walls can be insulated with [[Styrofoam]] or a similar insert. It must also be protected from heavy rain and insulated with vapour barriers.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthstructures.com.au/rammed-earth-construction/ |title=Rammed Earth Construction |work=Earth Structures |location=Victoria, Australia |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can effectively regulate humidity if unclad walls containing clay are exposed to an internal space. Humidity is regulated between 40% and 60%, which is the ideal range for [[asthma]] sufferers{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and for the storage of susceptible objects such as books.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material mass and clay content of rammed earth allows an edifice to breathe more than concrete edifices, which avoids problems of condensation but prevents significant loss of heat.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Untouched, rammed-earth walls have the colour and texture of natural earth. Moisture-impermeable finishes, such as cement render, are avoided because they impair the ability of a wall to desorb moisture,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which quality is necessary to preserve its strength.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Well-cured walls accept nails and screws easily, and can be effectively patched with the same material used to build them.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Blemishes can be repaired using the soil mixture as a plaster and sanded smooth.

The thickness, typically {{convert|30|to|35|cm|in}}, and [[density]] of rammed-earth walls make them suitable for [[soundproofing]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They are also inherently [[fireproof]], resistant to [[termite]] damage, and non-toxic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Environmental effects and sustainability ==

[[File:rammed earth.jpg|thumb|left|Rammed-earth [[trombe wall]] constructed by [[Design Build Bluff]]]]

Edifices of rammed earth are thought{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly than popular techniques of construction. Because rammed-earth edifices use locally available materials, they usually have low [[embodied energy]] and generate very little waste.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The soils used are typically [[subsoil]]s low in [[clay]], between 5% and 15%,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which conserve the [[topsoil]] for agriculture. When the soil excavated in preparation for a foundation can be used, the cost and energy consumption of transportation are minimal.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Rammed earth is probably the least environmentally detrimental construction material and technique that is readily and commercially available today to construct solid masonry edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth has potentially low manufacturing impact, contingent on the amount of cement and the amount that is locally sourced; it is often quarried aggregates rather than "earth".

[[Formwork]] is removable and can be reused, reducing the need for lumber.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/ceb.html |title=Natural Building Colloquium: Compressed Earth Blocks |first=Wayne |last=Nelson |publisher=NetWorks Productions |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mixing cement with the soil can counteract sustainable benefits such as low embodied energy and humidity regulation because manufacture of the cement itself adds to the global carbon dioxide burden at a rate of 1.25 tonnes per tonne of cement produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-cement-co2.htm |title=Rammed Earth – Pollution and Cement |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial substitution of cement with alternatives such as [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]] has not been demonstrated to be effective, and implicates other questions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |title=Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |location=Washington, DC, USA |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122083859/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |archivedate=22 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of edifices: the density, thickness, and thermal conductivity of rammed earth render it an especially suitable material for [[passive solar]] heating. Warmth requires almost 12 hours to be conducted through a wall {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Rammed-earth construction may also reduce the ecological impacts of [[deforestation]] and the toxicity of artificial materials associated with conventional construction techniques.

Although it has low [[greenhouse emission]]s in theory, [[transportation]] and the production of [[cement]] can add significantly to the overall emissions of modern rammed earth construction. The most basic kind of traditional rammed earth has very low greenhouse gas emissions but the more engineered and processed variant of rammed earth has the potential for significant emissions.

== History ==
[[File:JiayuguanWall.jpg|thumb|right|A ''taipa'' section of the [[Great Wall of China]]]]
[[File:Grange.Bassey.Saint.Nicolas.Macherin.jpg|thumb|right|Rammed-earth edifice on a farm in [[France]]]]

Evidence of ancient use of rammed earth has been found in [[Neolithic]] archaeological  sites of the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] cultures along the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]], dating to 5000 BCE. By 2000 BCE, rammed-earth architectural techniques (夯土 ''Hāng tǔ'') were commonly used for walls and foundations in [[China]].&lt;ref name="Xujie Liu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Xujie |first=Liu  |editor1-first=Nancy Shatzman |editor1-last=Steinhardt  |display-authors=etal  |title=Chinese Architecture |publisher=New Haven, CT, USA: Yale University Press and Beijing, China: New World Press |date=2002 |pages = 12–14, 21–2 |oclc=186413872 |isbn=978-0-300-09559-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, rammed earth was popularized in the [[United States]] by the book ''Rural Economy'' by S. W. Johnson. The technique was used to construct the [[Borough House Plantation]]&lt;ref name="Borough House"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743001/ |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Borough House Plantation, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, vicinity of Stateburg) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, SC, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Holy Cross (Stateburg, South Carolina)|Church of the Holy Cross]]&lt;ref name="Church of the Holy Cross"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743002/index.htm |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Church of the Holy Cross, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, Stateburg vicinity) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, South Carolina, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=April 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stateburg, South Carolina]], both being [[National Historic Landmarks]].

An outstanding example of a rammed-earth edifice in [[Canada]] is [[St. Thomas Anglican Church (Shanty Bay, Ontario)|St. Thomas Anglican Church]] in [[Shanty Bay]], [[Ontario]], erected between 1838 and 1841.

From the 1920s through the 1940s rammed-earth construction in the US was studied. [[South Dakota State College]] extensively researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} For over 30 years the college investigated the use of paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1945, Clemson Agricultural College of [[South Carolina]] published the results of their research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled "Rammed Earth Building Construction".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1936, on a homestead near [[Gardendale, Alabama]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] constructed an experimental community of rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided valuable homes to low-income families.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

The [[US Agency for International Development]] is working with [[undeveloped countries]] to improve the engineering of rammed-earth houses.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It also financed the authorship of the ''Handbook of Rammed Earth''&lt;ref name="Handbook For Building Homes of Earth"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolfskill |first1=Lyle A. |last2=Dunlap |first2= Wayne A. |last3=Gallaway |first3=Bob M. |title=Handbook For Building Homes of Earth |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAE689.pdf |publisher=[[Texas Transportation Institute]] |location=College Station, Texas, USA |work=Texas Transportation Institute bulletin |number=21 |edition=1453 |accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and the [[Texas Transportation Institute]]. The ''Handbook'' was unavailable for purchase by the public until the Rammed Earth Institute International gained permission to reprint it.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Interest in rammed earth declined after [[World War II]] when the cost of modern construction materials decreased.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth was considered substandard, and still is opposed by many contractors, engineers, and tradesmen who are unfamiliar with earthen construction techniques.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The prevailing perception that such materials and techniques perform poorly in regions prone to earthquakes has prevented their use in much of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In [[Chile]], for example, rammed earth edifices normally cannot be conventionally insured against damage or even be approved by the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A notable example of 21st century use of rammed earth is the façade of the [[Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada. As of 2014 it is the largest rammed earth wall in [[North America]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Relational sociology''' is a collection of sociological theories that emphasize [[relationalism]] over [[substantivalism]] in explanations and interpretations of social phenomena and is most directly connected to the work of [[Harrison White]] and [[Charles Tilly]] in the United States and [[Pierpaolo Donati]] and [[Nick Crossley]] in Europe.

==Background==
Relational sociology draws on a perspective or social ontology that Tilly and Donati refer to as ''[[relational realism]]'' or "the doctrine that transactions, interactions, social ties and conversations constitute the central stuff of social life."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories, Identities, and Political Change|author=Tilly, C.|date=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781461642602|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zU57AAAAQBAJ|page=72|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although, Donati argues that other relational sociologies based on constructivist ontology are not truly relational realism.)&lt;ref name="Sociologists in a Global Age: Biographical Perspectives" /&gt; This redefines the object of sociology, as Donati argues: "Society is not a space “containing” relations, or an arena where relations are played. It is rather the very tissue of relations (society “is
relation” and does not “have relations”).&lt;ref name="relationalstudies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.relationalstudies.net/uploads/2/3/1/5/2315313/donati_birth_and_development_of_the_relational_theory_of_society.pdf|date=15 February 2011|title=Birth and development of the relational theory of society: a journey looking for a deep 'relational sociology'|author=Pierpaolo Donati|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although several relational thinkers emerge throughout human thought, these presumably disparate theoretical ideas were consolidated in the United States under one banner during what some,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xS2wAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22New%20York%20School%22&amp;f=false ''Conceptualizing Relational Sociology: Ontological and Theoretical Issues'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dTt0rG_B130C&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;ots=HrWugxwyhk&amp;dq=%22relational%20sociology%22%20%22new%20york%20school%22&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q=%22New%20York%20School%22&amp;f=false ''Understanding Terrorism in the Age of Global Media: A Communication Approach'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ssc.wisc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~emirbaye/Mustafa_Emirbayer/BIO.html|title=BIO|publisher=ssc.wisc.edu|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Ann Mische]], refer to as [[New York School (sociology)|The New York School]] of relational sociology in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Mische, Ann 2011"&gt;Mische, Ann.

While substantivalism (similar to [[substantialism]] in philosophy) tends to view individuals (or other social objects) as self-subsistent or self-acting entities, relationalism underscores that practices constitute individuals, and that all action is always trans-action: always with implication transcending the momentary intent.&lt;ref&gt;Emirbayer, Mustafa. "Manifesto for a Relational Sociology" ''The American Journal of Sociology'' 103 (1997): 281-317. {{JSTOR|231209}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is frequently cited by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] who borrowed it from [[Ernest Cassirer]],&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociological Insights of Great Thinkers: Sociology Through Literature, Philosophy, and Science|author1=Edling, C.|author2=Rydgren, J.|date=2011|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780313384707|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9XojFmUmNQC|page=115|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically, Cassirer's 1923 publication ''[[Substance and Function]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cassirer|first1=Ernest|title=Substance and Function And Einsteins Theory Of Relativity|date=1923|publisher=Dover Publications|url=https://archive.org/details/substanceandfunc033163mbp|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, "relational theorists reject the notion that one can posit discrete, pre-given units such as the individual or society as ultimate starting points of sociological analysis" &lt;ref&gt;Emirbayer, Mustafa.

==History==

In [[Mustafa Emirbayer]]'s 1997 "Manifesto for a Relational Sociology" he traces the tradition of privileging relations over substances to the pre-Socratic, Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]]. He is attributed the cryptic saying "Ever-newer waters flow on those who step into the same rivers," from which the simpler "everything flows" (Panta rhei) emerges. Among the classical sociologists, Emirbayer and sociologist [[Marion Fourcade]]&lt;ref&gt;Fourcade, Marion. "Theories of markets and theories of society." American Behavioral Scientist 50.8 (2007): 1015–1034.&lt;/ref&gt; agree that relational ideas emerge in the work of several founders of sociology, including [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Max Weber|Weber]], [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]], [[George Herbert Mead|Mead]], and [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]]. Among early and mid-20th century sociologists, the most prominently relational theorists are [[John Dewey]], [[Arthur F. Bentley]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Norbert Elias]], and [[Niklas Luhmann]]. [[Pierpaolo Donati]] contends that Simmel, specifically the concept ''[[Wechselwirkung]]'', is "the first one to give sociology the "relational turning point."&lt;ref name="Sociologists in a Global Age: Biographical Perspectives"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donati|first1=Pierpaolo|title=Sociologists in a Global Age: Biographical Perspectives|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=O6HSJ1IcpwgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Donati,+Pierpaolo#v=onepage&amp;q=Donati%2C%20Pierpaolo&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donati's own "Manifesto" for his own variety of relational sociology&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociologists in a Global Age: Biographical Perspectives|author=Deflem, P.M.|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Limited|isbn=9781409490838|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O6HSJ1IcpwgC|page=167|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first published in 1983 in Italian, entitled ''Introduzione alla sociologia relazionale''.&lt;ref name="francoangeli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francoangeli.it/Ricerca/Scheda_libro.aspx?CodiceLibro=1534.1.5|title=Introduzione alla sociologia relazionale|publisher=francoangeli.it|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the French sociologist [[Guy Bajoit]] authored "Pour une sociologie relationnelle,"&lt;ref&gt;Bajoit, Guy. Pour une sociologie relationnelle. Presses Universitaires de France-PUF, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; which is contemporary with the relational movement in American sociology, but is only engaged, briefly, by Donati's relational sociology.

Lazarsfeld Center for the Social Sciences]] at [[Columbia University]], as well as the [[The New School|Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research]]&lt;ref name="orgtheory.wordpress.com"/&gt; and [[New York University]]. These sociologists included [[Harrison White]], [[Charles Tilly]], [[Mustafa Emirbayer]], [[David R. Gibson|David Gibson]], [[Ronald Burt]], [[Mimi Sheller]], [[Jeff Goodwin]], [[Ann Mische]] and [[Melissa Fischer]]. During the 1990s New York was the site of many conferences and workshop discussing relational ideas: Harrison White hosted several conferences at the Lazersfeld Center discussing the themes of time, language, identities, and networks; Charles Tilly hosted the ''Workshop on Contentious Politics'';&lt;ref name="Charles Tilly's Obituary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Tilly's Obituary|url=http://www.hacereditorial.es/contingut/m_pujadocuments/documents/File/CharlesTillyFinalOBit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mustafa Emirbayer organized a study group on Theory and Culture at the New School&lt;ref name="Mustafa Emirbayer's CV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mustafa Emirbayer's CV|url=http://ssc.wisc.edu/~emirbaye/Mustafa_Emirbayer/HOME_files/Mustafa%20Vita.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which discussed early drafts of his ''Manifesto for Relational Sociology''.&lt;ref name="Mische, Ann 2011"/&gt; A 2008 symposium cited White's ''Identity and Control'', Mische's ''Partisan Publics'', Tilly's ''Contentious Politics in Great Britain, 1758–1834'', [[Peter Bearman|Bearman]]'s ''Relations into Rhetorics'', and [[Roger V.

===Spread of relational sociology===

In September 2008, the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] hosted an international symposium on relational sociology organized by [[Jan Fuhse]] titled ''Relational Sociology: Transatlantic Impulses for the Social Sciences''. The symposium centered on the work of Harrison White.&lt;ref name="janfuhse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janfuhse.de/relational-sociology/relational.html|title=Relational Sociology, Symposium, Berlin 2008 - Relational Sociology|author=Jan Fuhse|publisher=janfuhse.de|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="janfuhse2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janfuhse.de/relational-sociology/hcw.html|title=Relational Sociology, Symposium, Berlin 2008 - Harrison White|author=Jan Fuhse|publisher=janfuhse.de|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to White, presenters included: [[John Levi Martin]], [[Patrik Aspers]], [[Eiko Ikegami]], [[Ann Mische]], [[Stephan Fuchs]] and [[Sophie Muetzel]].&lt;ref name="janfuhse3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janfuhse.de/relational-sociology/program.html|title=Relational Sociology, Symposium, Berlin 2008 - Program|author=Jan Fuhse|publisher=janfuhse.de|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, sociologist [[Yanjie Bian]] hosted the ''International Conference on Relational Sociology'' at the Institute for Empirical Social Science Research of [[Xi'an Jiaotong University]].&lt;ref name="iessr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iessr.xjtu.edu.cn:8080/newdetail.aspx?news_type=zhxw&amp;news_id=85|title=IESSR Xi'an JiaoTong University|publisher=iessr.xjtu.edu.cn:8080|accessdate=18 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022125434/http://iessr.xjtu.edu.cn:8080/newdetail.aspx?news_type=zhxw&amp;news_id=85|archivedate=22 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference included keynote speakers [[Nan Lin]] and [[Peter Li]].

In 2010, the [[University of California-Davis]] hosted a conference on [[relational work]],&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2010/07/15/recent-conference-on-relational-sociology/|title=recent conference on relational sociology &amp;#124; orgtheory.net|publisher=orgtheory.wordpress.com|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[Fred Block]]&lt;ref name="ucdavis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociology.ucdavis.edu/people/fzblock/people/fzblock/CVFB.doc|title=CURRICULUM VITAE|author=Fred L.

Italian sociologist [[Pierpaolo Donati]] is one of the founders of relational sociology in Europe&lt;ref name="socialtrendsinstitute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialtrendsinstitute.org/experts/all/pierpaolo-donati|title=Pierpaolo Donati &amp;#124; Social Trends Institute|publisher=socialtrendsinstitute.org|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published ''Relational Sociology: A New Paradigm for the Social Sciences'' in 2011. Also in 2011, British sociologist [[Nick Crossley]] published ''Towards Relational Sociology''.

Beginning in 2011, the [[Canadian Sociological Association]] has held meetings at every annual conference to develop a research cluster devoted to relational sociology.&lt;ref name=csa /&gt; The most recent meeting was organized by [[François Dépelteau]] and Chris Powell from the [[Laurentian University]] and Ryerson University.

A 2013 call for papers from the''Sociological Network Research'' section of the [[German Sociological Association]] argues that, while major methodological advances occurred in the United States, relational sociology has strong roots in the German-language tradition of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hamburg-sunbelt2013.org/789/ "The German-Language Tradition: Approaches to Social Networks"]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Simmel, Marx, [[Norbert Elias|Elias]] and [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]], such German relational sociologists include: [[Leopold von Wiese]], [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Theodor Litt]], [[Alfred Schütz]], and [[Helmuth Plessner]]. The invitation was for oral presentations which addressed scholars who are part of the German-language tradition of relational sociology.

Also in 2013, two books were published on relational sociology by F. Dépelteau and C. Powell. ''Conceptualizing Relational Sociology'' and ''Applying Relational Sociology'',&lt;ref&gt;Powell, C. and Dépelteau, F. (2013) ''Conceptualizing Relational Sociology: Ontological and Theoretical Issues'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Dépelteau, F. and Powell, C. (2013) ''Applying Relational Sociology: Relations, Networks, and Society'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; both published with Palgrave Macmillan, are collections of texts presenting the variety of the last theoretical and empirical researches done within this intellectual current.

In 2014, a research cluster on relational cluster was created through the Canadian Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.csa-scs.ca/files/webapps/csapress/relational/&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years has seen the development of a relational approach to organizational theory in education by [[Scott Eacott]]&lt;ref&gt;See http://scottteacott.com&lt;/ref&gt;, best captured in "Beyond leadership: A relational approach to organizational theory in education". &lt;ref&gt; See https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811065675&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Sociologist [[Richard Swedberg]], argues that relational sociology disregards the potential role that [[Interest (emotion)|interests]] play in social action:

{{Quotation| In several types of modern sociology...interests are seen as having no or little influence on what is happening. According to so-called relational sociology, for example, it is old fashioned and wrong to explain things through 'substances' (such as interests); everything should be seen in terms of relations, and only relations can be used to explain.| Richard Swedberg ''Interests'' 2005 pg 4|&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swedberg [https://books.google.com/books?id=kJJYS8EvypYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=JRfArK7DGv&amp;dq=%22richard%20swedberg%22%20%22relational%20sociology%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22relational%20sociology%22&amp;f=false ''Interests''] 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sociologist [[Christian Smith (sociologist)|Christian Smith]] states in ''What is a Person?'' that he rejects Emirbayer's position that substantialism and relationalism represent fundamentally different points of view, rather:

{{Quotation|...pure relationality cannot and does not create objects. Relations need substances and substances need relations. All that exists and every way it works requires relations and substances.| Christian Smith ''What is a Person?'' 2010 pg 232&lt;ref&gt;Christian Smith [https://books.google.com/books?id=sT9r_h8X8I4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=what+is+a+person&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fb82VIHDGcmVyASd6YK4Cg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Relations%20need%20substances&amp;f=false ''What is a Person?''] 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Richard Pew''' (born April 22, 1933) is a recognized American engineering psychologist in the field of [[human factors]].

Pew earned a [[Bachelor of Electrical Engineering]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1956 where he was a member of [[Sigma Pi]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=May 1956|volume=43|number=1|magazine=The Emerald of Sigma Pi|title=Orchids to:  Cornell Sigma Pi|page=27|url=http://www.enivation.com/SigmaPi/archive/Emerald/1956/SP_EMERALD_VOL_43_NO_1_MAY_1956.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned an [[AM (degree)|AM]] in psychology from [[Harvard University]] in 1960. He completed a [[PhD]] in psychology in 1963 under the guidance of [[Paul Fitts]] at the [[University of Michigan]], and subsequently became a faculty member there. Pew has spent many years as a research scientist at [[BBN Technologies]], and is a Fellow of the [[Human  Factors and Ergonomics Society]].&lt;ref name="hfes fellow"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hfes.org/web/awards&amp;fellows/fellowprofiles/profile_pew.pdf |title= HFES Fellow profile |format= PDF |publisher= [[Human  Factors and Ergonomics Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are variations in the perception and display of sexual suggestiveness, including but not limited to gender, culture and generation. Different cultures and different generations have varying views on what is considered to be sexually suggestive. For example, in British culture, it is normal for a woman to wear shorts and bare her legs on a hot, sunny day, but a woman with naked flesh on show would be considered [[promiscuous]] in certain cultures around the world. For the majority of the 20th century in western culture, it was considered vulgar for women to have their sexual ornaments ([[breasts]]) fully on show; in more modern times, this may not be a deviation from the norm. In [[evolution]]ary terms, sexual suggestiveness is a mode from which sexual mates are gained. Therefore, the ability to use sexual suggestiveness effectively is a trait that is part of [[sexual selection]].

Displays of sexual suggestiveness include things such as; women in swimsuit adverts, sexually-themed music or music with a strong beat meant for dancing, [[sexting]], erotic [[lingerie]] or "[[wolf whistling]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Research Council |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pp_whatis.html |title=What Is Pornography? |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christian.org.uk/news/sexually-suggestive-ms-bus-advert-banned/ |title=Sexually suggestive M&amp;S bus advert banned &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; The Christian Institute |publisher=Christian.org.uk |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crisisinterventioncenter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisinterventioncenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=147:what-is-sexting&amp;catid=39:teens&amp;Itemid=79|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126151309/http://www.crisisinterventioncenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=147:what-is-sexting&amp;catid=39:teens&amp;Itemid=79 |archive-date=2012-01-26 |dead-url=yes|title=What is Sexting|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= |title=Brain Potentials to Sexually Suggestive Whistles Show Meaning Modulates the Mismatch Negativity |journal=NeuroReport |volume=16 |issue=12 |pages=1313–1317 |pmc=1361366  |date=2013-03-25 |author1=Frangos |first1=J |last2=Ritter |first2=W |last3=Friedman |first3=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HHQDbNk0v94C&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Popular Music: The rock era - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-07|isbn=9780415332682 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual suggestiveness may also involve nudity, or the exposure of the nipples, genitals, buttocks or other [[taboo]] areas of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingcharts.com/interactive/one-in-five-teens-sends-sexually-explicit-images-7416/ |title=One in Five Teens Sends Sexually Explicit Images |publisher=Marketingcharts.com |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ESeO4E-ffKsC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Family Life Education: Principles and Practices for Effective Outreach - Stephen F.

In some cases, displays of sexual suggestiveness may be misinterpreted which may lead to dangerous or harmful situations.

==Evolutionary perspective==

From an evolutionary point of view, sexual suggestiveness evolved in order to aid in securing a [[sexual partner]] or mate. Once the individual has decided on a mate to pursue, sexual suggestiveness helps in attracting the mate - this is a skill which has been sexually selected ([[sexual selection]]) for during evolution. Sexually suggestive behaviors include things such as "showing more skin" and [[flirting]]. Both of these examples are behaviors which the individual would intentionally display. There is also research to suggest that sexually suggestive behaviors may not always be deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;Haselton, M. G., Mortezaie, M., Pillsworth, E. G., Bleske-Rechek, A., &amp; Frederick, D. A. (2007). Ovulatory shifts in human female ornamentation: Near ovulation, women dress to impress. Hormones and Behavior, 51, 40 – 45&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst to the individual, factors such as the [[menstrual cycle]], voice pitch and rate of money spending can all have an effect on sexual success and sexually suggestive behavior. For example, when females were in the work place and [[ovulation|ovulating]] they were more likely to engage in sexually suggestive behaviors e.g. showing more skin; further, females who work as lap dancers earn more money when they are in the ovulating stage. This may be because the female unwittingly behaves in a more sexual way and therefore puts out more sexually suggestive cues.&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"&gt;Gallup Jr, G. G., &amp; Frederick, D. A. (2010). The science of sex appeal: An evolutionary perspective. Review of General Psychology, 14(3), 240.&lt;/ref&gt; There is not, however, any evidence to show that these females are aware that their actions or earnings are intrinsically linked to their [[menstrual cycle]].

== 21st century==

The rise of the media, advertising and film industries as well as the growth of the fashion industry are all contributing factors to increase sexually suggestive content in an every-day setting. There are far more displays of sexually suggestive  behavior in modern-day life than there ever has been before and not just within advertising. The idea that [[sex sells]] is evident in many aspects of daily modern life particularly within social media and film where [[female sexual ornaments]] are a focal point. For example, many films include additional sex scenes and sexually suggestive female characters regardless of the film’s narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Benshoff, H. M., &amp; Griffin, S. (2011). America on film: Representing race, class, gender, and sexuality at the movies. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, D. H. (1986). Causes of sexual dysfunction: The role of anxiety and cognitive interference. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 54(2), 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The progression of the Internet and social media means that sexual content is far more available and accessible in the 21st century than ever before. This has a knock on effect on people’s [[sexualization]] and [[sexual behavior]]. Children’s sexuality develops at an earlier age if they have been exposed to more sexual content when young. For example, young adolescents engage in more sexual behaviors if they have been exposed to more sexual content in the media or on television.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, A. (2009). Teens and Sexting: How and why minor teens are sending sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images via text messaging.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strasburger, V. C. (1995). Adolescents and the media: medical and psychological impact. Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; On average, females become [[puberty|pubescent]] earlier in their development if they have been exposed to sexual content or sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M., &amp; Rivadeneyra, R. (1999). Contributions of entertainment television to adolescents’ sexual attitudes and expectations: The role of viewing amount versus viewer involvement. Journal of Sex Research, 36(3), 237-249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D. (2002). Mass media influences on sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 39(1), 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Most psychologists agree that this physical display of sexuality is due to evolutionary reasons and that girls develop their sexuality (e.g. behaving sexually suggestively) at an earlier age in order to [[sexual competition|sexually compete]] with other women and in order [[reproductive success|successfully reproduce]].&lt;ref&gt;Malamuth, N. M. (1996). Sexually explicit media, gender differences, and evolutionary theory. Journal of Communication, 46(3), 8-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. J., &amp; Scott, C. L. (Eds.) (2002). Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research. New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misinterpretation==

The increase in sexual content in modern society often results in a more nonchalant approach to sexually suggestive behavior.  People, predominantly women, often act in a way that they themselves do not consider to be sexually suggestive but which can be misinterpreted by others.&lt;ref&gt;Stockdale, M. S. (1993). The Role of Sexual Misperceptions of Women′ s Friendliness in an Emerging Theory of Sexual Harassment. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 42(1), 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Synovitz, L. B., &amp; Byrne, T. J. (1998). Antecedents of sexual victimization: Factors discriminating victims from non-victims. Journal of American College Health, 46(4), 151-158.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, wearing clothes or skirts/shorts that show skin is not something that most Western women would consider to be overtly provocative but it is still regarded as sexually suggestive by others. Misconstruing people’s behaviour can have disastrous consequences, contributing to [[harassment]] and [[rape culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Thornhill, N. W. (1983). Human rape: An evolutionary analysis. Ethology and Sociobiology, 4(3), 137-173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koukounas, E., &amp; Letch, N. M. (2001). Psychological correlates of perception of sexual intent in women. The Journal of social psychology, 141(4), 443-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] explains that this misinterpretation is the result of [[sexual selection]]. Men have adapted through sexual selection to have the maximum number of offspring possible, and therefore exhibit certain behaviors that facilitate maximum reproduction. Men perceive sexually suggestive behavior and other sexual cues, including [[biological ornament]]s, as signs of reproductive ability and willingness.&lt;ref&gt;Clutton-Brock, T. (2007). Sexual selection in males and females. Science, 318(5858), 1882-1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypothesis]] of [[rape]] as an [[adaption]] states that the rape of reproductive-age females was favoured by [[directional selection|direct selection]] in order to increase the chance of [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2001). A Natural History of Rape. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, C. T. (1991). Human rape: Adaptation or by‐product?. Journal of Sex Research, 28(3), 365-386.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexually suggestive behavior and biological ornamentation are signs of [[sexual maturity]] and thus females who display more of these behaviors, or who have more obvious ornamentation, are more likely to be at a higher risk of harassment, or even rape.&lt;ref&gt;McKibbin, W. F., Shackelford, T. K., Goetz, A. T., &amp; Starratt, V. G. (2008). Why do men rape? An evolutionary psychological perspective. Review of General Psychology, 12(1), 86.&lt;/ref&gt; This evolutionary explanation also extends to women. At their most fertile stage in their [[menstrual cycle]], during [[estrus]], women are far less likely to engage in rape-risky behaviors such as walking alone late at night, than women who are in the least fertile stage of their menstrual cycle, the [[menstrual cycle|luteal phase]] or women using [[hormonal contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;Chavanne, T. J., &amp; Gallup, G. G. (1998). Variation in risk taking behavior among female college students as a function of the menstrual cycle. Evolution and Human Behavior, 19(1), 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because women who are in the luteal phase or women using a hormonal contraceptive are much less likely to become pregnant after sexual intercourse than estrus women are.&lt;ref&gt;Gangestad, S. W., &amp; Thornhill, R. (2008). Human oestrus. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 275(1638), 991-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

These evolutionary explanations serve only to increase the psychological understanding of sexual behaviors. Sexual suggestiveness, rape, and all other sexual behaviors, are proven to be products of past evolution. In the case of rape, however, just because it is natural does not make it acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2000). A Natural History of Rape. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R. (1998). Biology of Human Rape, The. Jurimetrics, 39, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2002). Rape and evolution: a reply to our critics. Psychology, Evolution &amp; Gender, 4(3), 283-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flirting ==
[[Flirting]] can be sexually suggestive, which can intentionally elicit a [[sexual arousal|sexual response]] from another person.&lt;ref name=Henni2004 /&gt; Research has identified different motivations for engaging in flirting behaviors. There is flirting with a sexual motivation, which is done with a view to engaging in [[sexual behavior|Human sexual activity]] and there is also flirting with a fun motivation, in which the interaction itself is the pleasurable part.&lt;ref name=Henni2004 /&gt; An instrumental motivation of flirting behavior is flirting performed in order to accomplish an instrumental goal, such as getting someone to buy you a drink. However, flirting can sometimes lead to unintentional responses. If the motivation behind sexually suggestive behavior is misinterpreted or miscommunicated, then a sexual response could be elicited where it is not wanted. If escalated, this can lead to [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace or sexual coercion in a relationship.&lt;ref name=Rich1999 /&gt; In line with evolutionary explanations of sexually suggestive behavior, research has shown that females are more likely to consider the use of flirting as being for relational purposes, and males are more likely to interpret female flirting as having a sexual motivation.&lt;ref name=Henni2004&gt;Henningsen, D. D. (2004). Flirting with Meaning: An Examination of Miscommunication in Flirting Interactions, Sex Roles, 50, (7), pp 481-489&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rich1999&gt;Richman, J. A., et al. (1999) Sexual Harassment and Generalized Workplace Abuse Among University Employees: Prevalence and Mental Health Correlates. ''Journal of American Health'', 89, (3), pp358-363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==

There are some reported gender differences between how sexual suggestiveness is perceived. Males and females have different thresholds for the perception of sexual suggestiveness or intent. Males are, in general, more sexually occupied than females. To support this assumption research shows that males perceive people as more interested in a sexual encounter than females do.&lt;ref&gt;Shotland, R. L., &amp; Craig, J. M. (1988). Can men and women differentiate between friendly and sexually interested behavior?. Social Psychology Quarterly, 66-73.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that males find it difficult to differentiate between [[Like#As a verb|liking]], [[love]] and sexual intent, and in this case sexual suggestiveness. Unfortunately, this difficulty in separation between the two from the male’s point of view may lead to rape or other [[sexual assault]]. During the evolution of [[human sexuality]], the fact that females are the choosy gender meant that males who were able to quickly detect a female's willingness were the males who passed along their [[genes]] effectively. In light of this, males, therefore, tend to read sexual acceptance signals in friendly actions even when this may not be the females intention.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2000). Why men rape. The Sciences, 40(1), 30-36. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; Females are however better at reading platonic signals from the opposite sex and at differentiating between liking, loving and sexual suggestiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Abbey, A. (1982). "Sex Differences in Attributions for Friendly Behavior: Do Males Misperceive Females' Friendliness?" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 42:830-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also gender differences between how sexual suggestiveness is displayed via flirting. Recent research has shown that females are more likely than males to flirt with the intention of developing a new relationship,&lt;ref&gt;Messman, S. J., Canary, D. J., &amp; Hause, R. S. (2000). Motives to remain platonic, equity and the use of maintenance strategies in opposite sex friendships. Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 17, 67-94.&lt;/ref&gt; or with the intention of intensifying an existing relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, J. L., Damhave, K. W. (1991) The effect of place, type of comment and effort expended on the perception of flirtation. Journal of Social Behavior and Personality, 6, 35-43&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that females use flirting as a way of assessing the interest of a potential mate; as the end result is sexual activity, it can be inferred that this is a sexually suggestive act.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. M., &amp; Butler, D. I. (1989). Predictive aspects of non-verbal courtship behavior in women. Semiotica, 76, 205-215&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a variety of different researchers have found that males are significantly more sexually motivated in their displays of sexual suggestiveness (such as flirting) than females.&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, D. D. (2004). Flirting with meaning: An examination of miscommunication in flirting interactions. Sex Roles, 50(7-8), 481-489&lt;/ref&gt; The research done by Clark and Hatfield (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R. D., &amp; Hatfield, E. (1989). Gender differences in awareness of courtship initiation tactics. Sex Roles, 32, 717-734.&lt;/ref&gt; supports these assumptions by clearly suggesting that female courtship is motivated by relationship development and that male courtship is motivated by sexual desire. It is these gender differences that can explain the potential miscommunication of social actions.

==Cultural differences==

Since the 1990s there has a been a dramatic increase in the understanding of human sexuality from an [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2015). Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary theory proposes that humans all behave in the same way, in order to maximise survival and [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"/&gt; However, as with much of human behavior, there are substantial differences in the sexual suggestiveness of people from different cultures. What may be a culturally appropriate display of 'sexiness' in one culture may be considered inappropriate in another, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"/&gt; For example, in many Westernized cultures women displaying their bare legs in public is considered to be a relatively unassuming display of suggestiveness, while in many African societies, for example, the same behavior would be considered immodest. It can be argued that religion is a significant factor in the cultural differences of sexual suggestiveness, especially with regards to what displays of suggestiveness are considered appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Melman, B. (2016). Women’s Orients: English Women and the Middle East, 1718–1918: Sexuality, Religion and Work. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] communities are more strict on what levels of suggestiveness are appropriate for unmarried young women.

==In the media ==

===General===
A considerable amount of research has concluded that sexually suggestive content is pervasive in the media. The most common type of sexually suggestive content in adolescent programming is in the form of a sexual [[innuendo]]. Sexual [[innuendo]]es give a suggestive alternative meaning to an otherwise neutral phrase. For example, the use of the phrase "bend over backwards" when describing a colleague, in the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', is used by the main character Barney to imply something in both a figurative sense (i.e. that she is willing to work hard) and a suggestive sense (alluding to her flexibility in sexual positions). Content analyses of sexual behavior in the media found that sexual content on television has risen from 45% in 1975 to 81% now.&lt;ref name=kunkel1999&gt;Kunkel, D., Cope, K., Farinola, W., Biely, E., Rollin, E., &amp; Donnerstein, E. (1999). Sex on TE.' A biennial report to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 2001. Menlo Park, CA: The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; 83% of all programs on television contain sexual content.&lt;ref name=pardun2005&gt;Pardun, C.J., L’Engle, K.L., &amp; Brown, J.D. (2005). Linking exposure to outcomes: Early adolescents’ consumption of sexual content in six media. Mass Communication &amp; Society, 8(2), 75-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collins2004&gt;Collins, R.L., Elliott, M. N., Berry, S. H. et al. (2004). Watching sex on television predicts adolescent initiation of sexual Behavior. Pediatrics. 114(3). Available at: www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/114/3/e280&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of programs contain sexually suggestive references, and 49% of shows contain sexual behavior which include flirting.&lt;ref name=kunkel1999 /&gt; Sexual [[innuendo]]es occur as much as twice per program in popular American sitcoms, whilst flirting occurred at least once per programme.&lt;ref name=pardun2005 /&gt; The use of sexual [[innuendo]]es in the media is also done through newspapers, magazines and music, and accounts for roughly 12% of the entire sexual content shown in the media overall.&lt;ref name=pardun2005 /&gt;  Analysis of sexually suggestive behavior in sports media showed that there was considerable gender differences in how sports stars are portrayed visually.&lt;ref name=clavio2011&gt;Clavio, G., Eagleman, A. N. (2011). Gender and Sexually Suggestive Images in Sports Blogs. Journal of Sport Management, 7, 295-304&lt;/ref&gt; For example, females are photographed nude more frequently than men, and were photographed in a ''hetero-sexy'' manner which was done to attract the [[male gaze]], such as with sports equipment covering their genitalia due to its suggestive nature.&lt;ref name=clavio2011 /&gt; Overall, females are portrayed in a manner that alludes to their status as a [[sex symbol]].

Sexual content in the form of [[innuendo]], suggestive imagery and [[double entendre]] is used as a tool in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, A., Whipple, T. (1983). Sex Stereotyping in Advertising (Lexington, MA: Heath)&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestive advertising is used to draw in attention,&lt;ref name=reichert2004&gt;Reichert, T. Carpenter, C. (2004). An update on sex in magazine advertising: 1983 to 2003. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly, 81(4), 823-837&lt;/ref&gt; by monopolizing attentional resources, and as a means of distinguishing their products from similar products which are usually advertised in the same medium (such as in the same magazine).&lt;ref name=reichert2004 /&gt; Furthermore, advertisers use sexually suggestive material to imply an association between their product and benefits which are in some way related to sex (such as mate attraction).&lt;ref name=reichert2000&gt;Reichert, T. Ramirez, A. (2000) "Defining Sexually Oriented Appeals in Advertising: a Grounded Theory Investigation". Association for Consumer Research, 27, 267-273.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a significant increase in the amount of advertisements from 1983 to 2003 which used sexually suggestive images of models,&lt;ref name=reichert2004 /&gt; suggesting that advertisers are finding it beneficial. While the physical properties of the model are the most sexually suggestive, a number of non-verbal communicative features have also been identified as being provocative, such as the models pose (plumped lips, cocked head to show the neck) as well as verbal communicative features such as suggestive comments.&lt;ref name=reichert2000 /&gt;

=== Effects ===
A number of studies have looked at the effects of sexual content in the media on [[preadolescent]] and [[adolescent]] sexual development. It has been put forth that watching a high level of television, in which there is a lot of sexually suggestive behavior, can lead to the initiation of sexual intercourse at a younger age than those who watch the least amount of sexually suggestive programming.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt; In addition to this, adolescents who had been exposed to a high level of sexual content, would engage in a level of sexual activity expected by those up to three years older who watched less sexual content.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt; It has been suggested that according to [[social learning theory]], television is a method by which children can acquire behaviors, through observational learning,&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A., Ross, D., Ross, S.A. (1963). Imitation of film-mediated aggressive models. J Abnorm Soc Psychol, 66, 3–11&lt;/ref&gt; and that this is a potential method through which children are becoming increasingly sexualized.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, J. L., Sorsoli, C. L., Collins, K., Zylbergold, B. A., Schooler, D., &amp; Tolman, D. L. (2007). From sex to sexuality: Exposing the heterosexual script on primetime network television. Journal of Sex Research, 44, 145 – 157&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) and [[pregnancy]] in the U.S are more common among adolescents who begin sexual activity earlier, demonstrating that earlier sexualization, for which sexually suggestive content in the media has been implicated, has far reaching effects.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt;

Sexually suggestive content can also affect adolescents' views and attitudes towards sex, and their sexual socialization as whole. Research conducted with the [[cultivation theory]] in mind, has found that there is an association between people with a high regular exposure to sexually oriented genres (such as [[soap operas]] and [[hip-hop music]]) and more liberal attitudes towards sexual behavior like the acceptance of pre-marital sex, as well as non-relational sex and sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M. (2002). Does television exposure affect emerging adults’ attitudes and assumptions about sexual relationships? Correlational and experimental confirmation. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 31, 1–15&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as sexual competence is portrayed as a positive attribute on television, particularly for males, regular exposure to sexual content can cause adolescents to form unrealistic expectations, and view their own sexual experiences  (or lack thereof) as negative.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M. (2003). Understanding the role of entertainment media in the sexual socialization of American youth: A review of empirical research. Developmental Review, 23, 347-388&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the vast majority of this sexual content alludes to the positive nature of sex only, suggesting that sexually suggestive behavior in the media is serving to perpetuate a view that there are little negative consequences of engaging in sexual activity. Research has shown that the effects of sexually suggestive references in the media are also moderated by the developmental stage of the viewer. For example, 12 year olds have more difficulty correctly interpreting [[innuendos]] than 14 year olds.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman-Watkins, L. T.,  Sprafkin, J. N. (1983). Adolescents’ comprehension of televised sexual innuendos. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 4, 359–369&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, pre-pubescent adolescents often view sexual references on television with disgust and embarrassment, whereas pubescent adolescents viewed it with interest.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D., White, A. B., Nikipoulou, L. (1993). Disinterest, intrigue and resistance: Early adolescent girls’ use of sexual media content. In B. Greenberg, J. D. Brown, &amp; N.

[[File:BelorusianSkomorokhs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belarus]]ian skomorokhs as they appear in a 1555 German etching]]

A '''skomorokh''' (скоморох in [[Russian language|Russian]], скоморохъ in [[Old East Slavic]], скоморaхъ in [[Church Slavonic]]) was a [[medieval]] East Slavic [[harlequin]], or actor, who could also sing, dance, play musical instruments and compose for oral/musical and dramatic performances. The [[etymology]] of the word is not completely clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fshare%2Fstarling%2Fmorpho&amp;morpho=1&amp;basename=%5Cusr%5Clocal%5Cshare%5Cstarling%5Cmorpho%5Cvasmer%5Cvasmer&amp;first=1&amp;text_word=%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%85&amp;method_word=substring Vasmer's Etymological Dictionary entry for skomorokh]&lt;/ref&gt; There are hypotheses that the word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] σκώμμαρχος (cf. σκῶμμα, "joke"); from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''scaramuccia'' ("joker", cf. [[English language|English]] ''[[scaramouch]]''); from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''masẋara''; and many others.

The skomorokhs appeared in [[Kievan Rus]] no later than the mid-11th century, but [[fresco]] depictions of skomorokh musicians in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] date to the 11th century.

The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' on skomorokhs concurs with the period. The monk chronicler denounced them as devil servants. Furthermore, the Orthodox Church often railed against them and other elements of popular culture as being irreverent, detracting from the worship of God or being downright diabolical. For example [[Theodosius of Kiev]], one of the co-founders of the Caves Monastery in the 11th century, called the skomorokhs "evils to be shunned by good Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Feodosii Pecherskii, ''Sochinenia'', I. I. (Izmail Ivanovich) Sreznevksii, ed., in ''Ucheniia zapiski vtorogo otdelenie Imperatorskoi Akademii Nauk'', Vol. 2, no. 2, (St. Petersburg: Tipografii Imperatorskoi Akademii Nauk, 1856), 195; See Russell Zguta, "Skomorokhi: The Russian Minstrel-Entertainers", ''Slavic Review'' 31 No. 2 (June 1972), 297&amp;ndash;298; Idem, ''Russian Minstrels: A History of the Skomorokhi'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Their art was related and addressed to the common people and usually opposed the ruling groups, who considered them not just useless but even ideologically detrimental and dangerous by both the feudalists and the clergy.

They were persecuted in the years of the [[Mongol yoke]], when the church strenuously propagated ascetic living. Its art reached its peak in the 15th to the 17th centuries. Their repertoire included mock songs, dramatic and satirical sketches, called ''glumy'' (глумы), performed in masks and skomorokh dresses to the sounds of [[domra]], [[balalaika]], [[gudok]], [[bagpipes]] or [[buben]] (a kind of [[tambourine]]). The appearance of [[Russian puppet theatre]] was directly associated with skomorokh performances.

Skomorokhs performed in the streets and city squares, engaging with the spectators to draw them into their play. Usually, the main character of the skomorokh performance was a fun-loving saucy ''[[muzhik]]'' (мужик) of comic simplicity. In the 16 and 17th centuries, skomorokhs would sometimes combine their efforts and perform in a ''vataga'' (ватага, big crowd) numbering 70 to 100 people. The skomorokhs were often persecuted by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and civilian authorities. 

In 1648 and 1657, [[Tsar]] [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexei Mikhailovich]] issued [[ukase]]s banning skomorokh art as blasphemous, but actors would still occasionally perform during popular celebrations. In the 18th century, skomorokh art gradually died away; passing on some of its traditions to the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|balagans|ru|3=Балаган}}'' (балаган) and ''[[rayok]]s'' (раёк).

{{use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}
The '''Smurfette principle''' is the practice in media, such as film, television series and television networks, to include only one woman in an otherwise entirely male ensemble.&lt;ref name="DayKugler2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lori Day|author2=Charlotte Kugler|title=Her Next Chapter: How Mother-Daughter Book Clubs Can Help Girls Navigate Malicious Media, Risky Relationships, Girl Gossip, and So Much More|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6k2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-61374-859-6|pages=203–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/07/the-problem-with-smurfette/242690/|title=The Problem With Smurfette|last=Richards|first=Jason|date=2011-07-28|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Katha Pollitt]] in 1991 in ''[[The New York Times]]'':&lt;ref name="hers"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/07/magazine/hers-the-smurfette-principle.html Hers; The Smurfette Principle]. ''The New York Times'', 7 April 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

It establishes a male-dominated narrative, where the woman is the exception and exists only in reference to the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/is-smurfette-giving-it-awy_b_1011329.html|title=Is Smurfette Giving It Away?

She may or may not play a major role in the story, but typically is “everything female.” Some examples that Pollitt cites include the mother figure, a “glamour queen,” or a female sidekick of sorts.&lt;ref name="hers" /&gt; As a consequence, works employing this [[Trope (literature)|trope]] often fail the [[Bechdel test]], an indicator of gender bias in fiction.{{quote|Contemporary shows are either essentially all-male, like "[[Garfield]]", or are organized on what I call the Smurfette principle: a group of male buddies will be accented by a lone female, stereotypically defined... The message is clear. Boys are the norm, girls the variation; boys are central, girls peripheral; boys are individuals, girls types. Boys define the group, its story and its code of values. Girls exist only in relation to boys.}}This term continues to be used in discourse to describe not only "preschool culture," but also popular media from the last 40 years.

== Origin ==
Pollitt observed this as what she thought of in terms of a common media practice while shopping for her daughter’s Christmas toys. The initial use of the term was in relation to “preschool culture,” that to Pollitt, would hinder a child’s understanding of gender. She goes further to say, “The sexism in preschool culture deforms both boys and girls. Little girls learn to split their consciousness, filtering their dreams and ambitions through boy characters while admiring the clothes of the princess.”&lt;ref name="hers" /&gt;

== Recent developments ==
In 2011 Pollitt discussed her term again in ''[[The Atlantic]]''. She said that the issue is still highly prevalent in the current media. She specifically cited the then major blockbuster, ''[[Super 8 (2011 film)|Super 8]]'', which had only one female main character (played by [[Elle Fanning]]). Also at this time, she extended the principle to include television networks. The only major anchor in the MSNBC lineup in 2011, according to Pollitt was [[Rachel Maddow]]. She said, "there's one Rachel Maddow, and then there's that whole male lineup. There's Ed [Schultz], there used to be Keith [Olbermann], and Lawrence O'Donnell, and now there's going to be Al Sharpton. It's quite remarkable that there's only this one woman, and it's never equal."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This term has not disappeared by any means, making many appearances in popular literature and discourse. Journalists complain that major blockbusters that will turn out millions of dollars, include only one female, and this trend is not fading anytime soon.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/movies/the-smurfette-principle-why-can%E2%80%99t-hollywood-accept-gender-equality/ar-BBGz820?li=AA5a2k|title=The Smurfette Principle: why can’t Hollywood accept gender equality?|website=www.msn.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is visible in ensemble movie posters, like with [[Ocean's Eleven|''Ocean's Eleven'']], [[The Matrix|''The Matrix'']] and [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4616798/movie-posters-single-woman/|title=This Is the Disturbing Movie Poster 'Smurfette Principle'|last=TIME|website=Time|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Rose looks at Eleven’s situation in the TV show ''[[Stranger Things]]'', where she is essentially replaced (while on her own adventures) by Max, another young girl, who is also teased, then “lusted after,” another common reaction to a lone female character.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The “Smurfette,” or sole female cast member, has been understood to typically have a stereotypical role of a romantic partner, a “brooding badass,” or exists to deflate the tension of an all-male cast.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

As a result of the discontent about the lack of women, a new pattern has emerged, of “gender-inversion,” casts of exclusively female actresses, like ''[[Ocean's 8|Ocean’s 8]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]''.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tn2magazine.ie/smurfette-principle/|title=The Smurfette Principle|date=2017-08-25|work=TN2 Magazine|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|Geena Davis Institute]] found that only “10% of all films have a gender balanced cast,” thus reinforcing the existence of the lack of fair female representation, i.e. the Smurfette Principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/symposiums-on-gender-in-media/gender-bias-without-borders/|title=Gender Bias Without Borders - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In an article and video for ''Bitch Magazine'', [[Anita Sarkeesian]] asserts that the reoccurrence of this issue is that media from the 1980s and 1990s is continuously being remade, which still typically adhere to this principle, creating an ongoing cycle. She also called on the film industry to include more female characters, or even a female dominated cast, ''and'' pass the [[Bechdel test]]. After these are kept in mind and actually accomplished, meaningful diversity will be possible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://feministfrequency.com/video/tropes-vs-women-3-the-smurfette-principle/|title=Tropes vs. Women: #3 The Smurfette Principle|date=2011-04-21|work=Feminist Frequency|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses in scholarship ==
Rickie Solinger, in a review of some of Pollitt’s major works up to 1993, stated that the “Smurfette Principle” is applicable to preschoolers and adults alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solinger|first=Rickie|date=1995|editor-last=Pollitt|editor-first=Katha|title=First-Class Citizen|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4022132|journal=The Women's Review of Books|volume=12|issue=7|pages=1–3|doi=10.2307/4022132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Susina, a scholar and researcher of child and adolescent literature, used the term in a 1995 edition of the journal, ''The Lion and the Unicorn'', to back up his assertion that children’s literature is being “dumbed down” as a larger symptom of cultural problems, particularly that entertainment is like “junk food,” or unrewarding to the audience. He uses Pollitt’s term as evidence that a lack of women contributes to low quality media for children and also that the popular media has picked up on this issue in major publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Susina|first=Jan|date=1993|title=Editor's Note: Kiddie Lit(e): The Dumbing Down of Children's Literature|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/244499|journal=The Lion and the Unicorn|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=v–ix|doi=10.1353/uni.0.0256|issn=1080-6563}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Examples==
Named after [[Smurfette]], the only female among [[the Smurfs]] (a group of comic book creatures), the principle has been observed in the following works among others:

'''''Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene''''' is a 2016 book by [[Donna Haraway]], published by [[Duke University Press]]. In it, Haraway offers "making kin" as a way to consider multiple species and interact in a multiple species world. 

By emphasizing connectedness, ''Staying with the Trouble'' can be thought of as a continuation of major themes from "[[A Cyborg Manifesto]]" and ''[[The Companion Species Manifesto]]''. Haraway's book can also be thought of as a critique of the [[Anthropocene]] as a way of making sense of the present, de-emphasizing human exceptionalism in favor of multispecism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thechart.me/book-review-donna-haraway-staying-with-the-trouble/|title=Book Review: Donna Haraway’s Staying with the Trouble|date=2017-06-21|work=The Chart|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32834">'''Steam-assisted gravity drainage''' (SAGD; "Sag-D") is an [[enhanced oil recovery]] technology for producing [[heavy crude oil]] and [[Asphalt|bitumen]]. It is an advanced form of [[steam injection (oil industry)|steam stimulation]] in which a pair of [[Directional drilling|horizontal well]]s is drilled into the [[Petroleum reservoir|oil reservoir]], one a few metres above the other. High pressure steam is continuously injected into the upper [[wellbore]] to heat the oil and reduce its [[viscosity]], causing the heated oil to drain into the lower wellbore, where it is pumped out. Dr. Roger Butler, engineer at Imperial Oil from 1955 to 1982, invented the steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process in the 1970s. Butler "developed the concept of using horizontal pairs of wells and injected steam to develop certain deposits of bitumen considered too deep for mining".&lt;ref name="butlerhalloffame" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt; In 1983 Butler became director of technical programs for the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] (AOSTRA),&lt;ref name="butlerhalloffame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AOSTRA is now known as the Alberta Energy Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]] created by Alberta [[Peter Lougheed|Premier Lougheed]] to promote new technologies for [[oil sands]] and [[heavy crude oil]] production. AOSTRA quickly supported SAGD as a promising innovation in oil sands extraction technology.&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt;

Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) [[Steam_injection_(oil_industry)]] are two commercially applied primal thermal recovery processes used in the oil sands &lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang"&gt;{{cite conference|title=Review of Thermal Recovery Technologies for the Clearwater and Lower Grand Rapids Formations in the Cold Lake Area in Alberta|author1=Qi Jiang|author2=Bruce Thornton|author3=Jen Russel-Houston|author4=Steve Spence|publisher=Osum Oil Sands Corp|conference=Canadian International Petroleum Conference|url=http://www.osumcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/CIPC_Review-of-Thermal-Recovery-Technologies-for-the-Clearwater-and-Lower-Grand-Rapids-Formations-in-the-Cold-Lake-Area-of-Alberta.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Formation (stratigraphy)|Geological formation]] sub-units, such as Grand Rapids Formation, Clearwater Formation, McMurray Formation, General Petroleum Sand, Lloydminster Sand, of the [[Mannville Group]], a [[Geochronology|Stratigraphic range]] in the [[Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin]].

Canada is now the single largest supplier of imported oil to the United States, supplying over 35% of US imports, much more than Saudi Arabia or Venezuela, and more than all the [[OPEC]] countries combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbblpd_m.htm |title=U.S. Imports by Country of Origin |work=EIA |accessdate=3 February 2015 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the new production comes from Alberta's vast oil sands deposits. There are two primary methods of oil sands recovery. The strip-mining technique is more familiar to the general public, but can only be used for shallow bitumen deposits. However, the more recent steam-assisted gravity drainage technique (SAGD) is better suited to the much larger deep deposits that surround the shallow ones. Much of the expected future growth of production in the Canadian oil sands is predicted to be from SAGD.&lt;ref name="GlassmanMar2011"&gt;{{cite report|publisher=The Water-Energy Nexus|title=Adding Water to the Energy Agenda|series=A World Policy Paper|author1=Diana Glassman|author2=Michele Wucker|author3=Tanushree Isaacman|author4=Corinne Champilou|author5=Annie Zhou|date=March 2011|url=http://www.nationalfoodhub.com/images/THE_WATER-ENERGY_NEXUS_REPORT.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage emissions are equivalent to what is emitted by the steam flood projects which have long been used to produce heavy oil in California's [[Kern River Oil Field]] and elsewhere around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tar-sands-extraction-without-strip-mining/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The SAGD process of heavy oil or bitumen production is an enhancement on the [[Steam injection (oil industry)| steam injection]] techniques originally developed to produce heavy oil from the [[Kern River Oil Field]] of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.spe.org/dl/docs/2011/Law.pdf | last = Law | first = David | title = A New Heavy Oil Recovery Technology to Maximize Performance and to Maximize Performance and Minimize Environmental Impact | work = SPE Distinguished Lecturer Program | publisher  = [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] | accessdate = 2016-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to all steam flooding processes is to deliver heat to the producing formation to reduce the viscosity of the heavy oil and enable it to move toward the producing well. The cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) process developed for the California heavy oil fields was able to produce oil from some portions of the Alberta oil sands, such as the [[Cold Lake oil sands]], but did not work as well to produce bitumen from heavier and deeper [[McMurray Formation | deposits]] in the [[Athabasca oil sands]] and [[Peace River oil sands]], where the majority of Alberta's oil sands reserves lie. To produce these much larger reserves, the SAGD process was developed, primarily by Dr. Roger Butler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/roger-butler.html | title = Dr. Roger M. Butler | work = Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame | publisher  = [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] | accessdate = 2016-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Imperial Oil]] with the assistance of the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] and industry partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Practical_Reservoir_Simulation.html?id=qUx5t8oPlZAC | title = Practical Reservoir Simulation: Using, Assessing, and Developing Results | last = Carlson | first = M.R. | publisher  = [[PennWell Books]] | date = 1 January 2003 | accessdate = 2016-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAGD process is estimated by the [[National Energy Board]] to be economic when oil prices are at least US$30 to $35 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/rprt/archive/pprtntsndchllngs20152006/pprtntsndchllngs20152006-eng.pdf | title = Canada's Oil Sands: Opportunities and Challenges to 2015 | publisher  = [[National Energy Board]] | accessdate = 2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the SAGD process, two parallel horizontal [[oil well]]s are drilled in the [[Petroleum geology|formation]], one about 4 to 6 metres above the other. The upper well injects steam, and the lower one collects the heated [[Petroleum|crude oil]] or bitumen that flows down due to gravity, plus recovered water from the condensation of the injected steam. The basis of the SAGD process is that thermal communication is established with the reservoir so that the injected steam forms a "steam chamber". The heat from the steam reduces the [[viscosity]] of the heavy crude oil or bitumen which allows it to flow down into the lower wellbore. The steam and associated gas rise because of their low density compared to the heavy crude oil below, ensuring that steam is not produced at the lower production well, tend to rise in the steam chamber, filling the void space left by the oil. Associated gas forms, to a certain extent, an insulating heat blanket above (and around) the steam.&lt;ref name="Holdaway_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=Harness Oil and Gas Big Data with Analytics: Optimize Exploration and Production with Data Driven Models |first=Keith |last=Holdaway |work=Wiley |date=13 May 2014  |accessdate=3 February 2014 |isbn=1118910958 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXaVAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=Oil+and+water+flow+is+by+a+countercurrent,+gravity+driven+drainage+into+the+lower+well+bore.+The+condensed+water+and&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TE27OxNN7W&amp;sig=AzqWxxf0GAhoRBTj8B99CYBwKhA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JDDSVIycCM7HsQTJv4KADg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil and water flow is by a countercurrent, gravity driven drainage into the lower well bore. The condensed water and [[Petroleum|crude oil]] or bitumen is recovered to the surface by pumps such as progressive cavity pumps that work well for moving high-viscosity fluids with suspended solids.&lt;ref name="Alberta_Energy_2013"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/OilSands/pdfs/FS_SAGD.pdf |format=PDF |title=Talk about SAGD |work=Energy Alberta |date=November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-cool is the difference between the saturation temperature (boiling point) of water at the producer pressure and the actual temperature at the same place where the pressure is measured. The higher the liquid level above the producer the lower the temperature and higher is the sub-cool. However real life reservoirs are invariably heterogeneous therefore it becomes extremely difficult to achieve a uniform sub-cool along the entire horizontal length of a well. As a consequence many operators, when faced with uneven stunted steam chamber development, allow a small quantity of steam to enter into the producer to keep the bitumen in the entire wellbore hot hence keeping its viscosity low with the added benefit of transferring heat to colder parts of the reservoir along the wellbore. Another variation sometimes called Partial SAGD is used when operators deliberately circulate steam in the producer following a long shut-in period or as a startup procedure. Though a high value of sub-cool is desirable from a thermal efficiency standpoint as it generally includes reduction of steam injection rates but it also results in slightly reduced production due to a corresponding higher viscosity and lower mobility of bitumen caused by lower temperature. Another drawback of very high sub-cool is the possibility of steam pressure eventually not being enough to sustain steam chamber development above the injector, sometimes resulting in collapsed steam chambers where condensed steam floods the injector and precludes further development of the chamber.

Continuous operation of the injection and production wells at approximately reservoir pressure eliminates the instability problems that plague all high-pressure and cyclic steam processes and SAGD produces a smooth, even production that can be as high as 70% to 80% of oil in place in suitable reservoirs. The process is relatively insensitive to shale streaks and other vertical barriers to steam and fluid flow because, as the rock is heated, differential thermal expansion allows steam and fluids to gravity flow through to the production well. This allows recovery rates of 60% to 70% of oil in place, even in formations with many thin shale barriers. Thermally, SAGD is generally twice as efficient as the older cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) process, and it results in far fewer wells being damaged by the high pressures associated with CSS. Combined with the higher oil recovery rates achieved, this means that SAGD is much more economic than cyclic steam processes where the reservoir is reasonably thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Speight | first = James G.  | title = The Chemistry and Technology of Petroleum

== History ==

The gravity drainage idea was originally conceived by Dr. Roger Butler, an engineer for [[Imperial Oil]] in the 1970s&lt;ref name="butlerhalloffame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/roger-butler.html|title=Dr. Roger M. Butler|year=2012|publisher=Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt; In 1975 Imperial Oil transferred Butler from Sarnia, Ontario to [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]] to head their heavy oil research effort. He tested the concept with Imperial Oil in 1980, in a pilot at [[Cold Lake oil sands|Cold Lake]] which featured one of the first horizontal wells in the industry, with vertical injectors.

=== Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority (AOSTRA) 1974 ===

In 1974, former Premier of Alberta Peter Lougheed created the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] (AOSTRA) as an Alberta [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]] to promote the development and use of new technology for oil sands and heavy crude oil production, and enhanced recovery of conventional crude oil. Its first facility was owned and operated by ten industrial participants and received ample government support (Deutsch and McLennan 2005)&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt; including from the [[Alberta Investment Management Corporation|Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund]].&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alberta-oil-sands-technology-and-research-authority/ | title= Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority.

In 1984, AOSTRA initiated the Underground Test Facility in the [[Athabasca oil sands]], located between the MacKay Rivers and the Devon River west of the Syncrude plant as an [[in-situ]] [[Steam assisted gravity drainage|SAGD]] bitumen recovery facility.&lt;ref name="guidebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AOSTRA1974"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harbir Chhina keeps Cenovus Energy Inc. running smoothly|publisher=Alberta Oil|first=Marzena|last=Czarnecka|date=1 January 2013|url=http://www.albertaoilmagazine.com/2013/01/the-executive-vice-president-oil-sands-keeps-cenovus-energy-inc-running-smoothly/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that their first test of twin (horizontal) SAGD wells took place, proving the feasibility of the concept, briefly achieving positive cash flow in 1992 at a production rate of about 2000 bbl/day from 3 well pairs.

=== Foster Creek ===

The Foster Creek plant in Alberta Canada, built in 1996 and operated by [[Cenovus Energy]], was the first commercial Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) project and by 2010 Foster Creek "became the largest commercial SAGD project in Alberta to reach royalty payout status. "&lt;ref name="AOSTRA1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YedlinChhina2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/energy-resources/Yedlin+Showing+cynics+business+done/8545972/story.html?__lsa=50b1-7af0|publisher=Calgary Herald|title=Yedlin: Showing cynics how oil business is done|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=19 June 2013|first=Deborah|last=Yedlin}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original UTF SAGD wells were drilled horizontally from a tunnel in the limestone underburden, accessed with vertical [[Shaft mining|mine shafts]].  The concept coincided with development of directional drilling techniques that allowed companies to drill horizontal wells accurately, cheaply and efficiently, to the point that it became hard to justify drilling a conventional vertical well any more. With the low cost of drilling horizontal well pairs, and the very high [[peak oil|recovery rates]] of the SAGD process (up to 60% of the oil in place), SAGD is economically attractive to oil companies.

At Foster Creek Cenovus has employed its patented&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2591498/summary.html?query=cenovus&amp;start=1&amp;num=50&amp;type=basic_search&lt;/ref&gt; 'wedge well' technology to recover residual resources bypassed by regular SAGD operations, this improves the total recovery rate of the operation. The 'wedge well' technology works by accessing the residual bitumen that is bypassed in regular SAGD operations by drilling an infill well between two established operating SAGD well pairs once the SAGD steam chambers have matured to the point where they have merged and are in fluid communication and then what is left to recover in that reservoir area between the operating SAGD well pairs is a 'wedge' of residual, bypassed oil. Wedge well technology has been shown to improve overall recovery rates by 5%-10% at a reduced capital cost as less steam is required once the steam chambers mature to the point where they are in fluid communication and typically at this stage in the recovery process, also commonly known as the 'blow down' phase&lt;ref&gt;https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-165481-MS&lt;/ref&gt;, the injected steam is replaced with a non-condensable gas such as methane, further reducing production costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://aer.ca/documents/oilsands/insitu-presentations/2011AthabascaCenovusFosterCreekSAGD8623.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current applications ==

This technology is now being exploited due to [[2000s energy crisis|increased oil prices]]. While traditional drilling methods were prevalent up until the 1990s, high crude prices of the 21st Century are encouraging more unconventional methods (such as SAGD) to extract crude oil. The Canadian oil sands have many SAGD projects in progress, since this region is home of one of the largest deposits of bitumen in the world ([[Canada]] and [[Venezuela]] have the world's largest deposits).

The SAGD process allowed the [[Ministry of Energy (Alberta)|Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB)]] to increase its proven [[oil reserves]] to 179 billion barrels, which raised Canada's oil reserves to the third highest in the world after [[Venezuela]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and approximately quadrupled North American oil reserves. As of 2011, the oil sands reserves stand at around 169 billion barrels.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Oil and water nexus ===

SAGD, a thermal recovery process, consumes large quantities of water and natural gas.&lt;ref name="GlassmanMar2011" /&gt;{{rp|4}}
{{quote|"Petroleum from the Canadian oil sands extracted via surface mining techniques can consume 20 times more water than conventional oil drilling.

"Petroleum from the Canadian oil sands extracted via surface mining techniques can consume 20 times more water than conventional oil drilling." However, by 2011 there was inadequate data on the amount of water used in the increasingly important steam-assisted gravity drainage technique (SAGD) method.&lt;ref name="GlassmanMar2011" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Evaporators can treat the SAGD produced water to produce high quality freshwater for reuse in SAGD operations.&lt;ref name="Alberta Innovates"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lightbown|first1=Vicki|title=NEW SAGD TECHNOLOGIES SHOW PROMISE IN REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OIL SAND PRODUCTION|url=http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925201815/http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-25|website=Alberta Innovates|publisher=Alberta Innovates|accessdate=June 2015|ref=Alberta Innovates}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, evaporators produce a high volume blowdown waste which requires further management.&lt;ref name="Alberta Innovates"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lightbown|first1=Vicki|title=NEW SAGD TECHNOLOGIES SHOW PROMISE IN REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OIL SAND PRODUCTION|url=http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925201815/http://albertainnovates.ca/media/20420/sagd_technologies_ogm_lightbown.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-25|website=Alberta Innovates|publisher=Alberta Innovates|accessdate=June 2015|ref=Alberta Innovates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of natural gas for steam generation ===

As in all thermal recovery processes, cost of steam generation is a major part of the cost of oil production. Historically, [[natural gas]] has been used as a fuel for Canadian oil sands projects, due to the presence of large [[stranded gas reserve]]s in the oil sands area. However, with the building of natural gas pipelines to outside markets in Canada and the United States, the price of gas has become an important consideration. The fact that natural gas production in Canada has peaked and is now declining is also a problem. Other sources of generating heat are under consideration, notably gasification of the heavy fractions of the produced bitumen to produce [[syngas]], using the nearby (and massive) deposits of [[coal]], or even building [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]] to produce the heat.

=== Use of water for steam generation ===

A source of large amounts of fresh and brackish water and large water re-cycling facilities are required in order to create the steam for the SAGD process. Water is a popular topic for debate in regards to water use and management. As of 2008, American petroleum production (not limited to SAGD) generates over 5 billion gallons of produced water every day.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph M. Hall, Statement to the Committee on Science and Technology for the Produced Water Utilization Act of 2008, 110th Congress 2d Session, Report 110-801.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Use Breakdown in Alberta 2005|url=http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/water/GWSW/quantity/waterinalberta/allocation/AL3_purpose.html|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419171620/http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/water/GWSW/quantity/waterinalberta/allocation/AL3_purpose.html|archive-date=2012-04-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concern of using large amounts of water has little to do with proportion of water used, rather the quality of the water. Traditionally close to 70 million cubic metres of the water volume that was used in the SAGD process was fresh, surface, water. There has been a significant reduction in fresh water use as of 2010, when approximately 18 million cubic metres were used. Though to offset the drastic reduction in fresh water use, industry has begun to significantly increase the volume of saline [[groundwater]] involved.  This, as well as other, more general water saving techniques have allowed surface water usage by oil sands operations to decrease by more than threefold since production first began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volume and Quality of Water used in Oil and Gas 1976-2010|url=http://environment.alberta.ca/01729.html|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=4 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209182743/http://environment.alberta.ca/01729.html|archive-date=2011-12-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Relying upon gravity drainage, SAGD also requires comparatively thick and homogeneous reservoirs, and so is not suitable for all heavy-oil production areas.

== Alternative methods ==

By 2009 the two commercially applied primal thermal recovery processes, Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS), were used in oil sands production in the [[Clearwater Formation|Clearwater]] and [[Lower Grand Rapids Formation]]s in the Cold Lake Area in Alberta.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

=== Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) ===

[[Canadian Natural Resources]] employs cyclic steam or "huff and puff" technology to develop bitumen resources. This technology requires one well bore and the production consists of the injection to fracture and heat the formation prior to the production phases. First steam is injected above the formation fracture point for several weeks or months, mobilizing cold bitumen, the well is then shut in for several weeks or months to allow the steam to soak into the formation. Then the flow on the injection well is reversed producing oil through the same injection well bore. The injection and production phases together comprise one cycle. Steam is re-injected to begin a new cycle when oil production rates fall below a critical threshold due to the cooling of the reservoir.&lt;ref name="CNRL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|publisher=CNRL|year=2013|title=Cyclic Steam Stimulation|series=Thermal in situ oil sands|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016105950/http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|archivedate=2015-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) also has a number of CSS Follow-up or Enhancement Processes, including Pressure Up and Blow Down (PUBD), Mixed Well Steam Drive and Drainage (MWSDD), Vapor Extraction (Vapex), Liquid Addition to Steam for Enhanced Recovery of Bitumen (LASER) and HPCSS Assisted SAGD and Hybrid Process.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

=== High pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) ===

"Roughly 35 per cent of all ''in situ'' production in the Alberta oil sands uses a technique called High Pressure Cyclic Steam Stimulation (HPCSS), which cycles between two phases: first, steam is injected into an underground oil sands deposit to fracture and heat the formation to soften the bitumen just like CSS does, excepting at even higher pressures; then, the cycle switches to production where the resulting hot mixture of bitumen and steam (called a “bitumen emulsion”) is pumped up to the surface through the same well, again just like CSS, until the resulting pressure drop slows production to an uneconomical stage. The process is then repeated multiple times. "&lt;ref name="SeversonBaker29Jul2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Lake bitumen blowout first test for new energy regulator|author=Chris Severson-Baker|date=29 July 2013|url=http://www.pembina.org/blog/741}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Alberta Energy Regulator]] (AER) news release explained the difference between high pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). "HPCSS has been used in oil recovery in Alberta for more than 30 years. The method involves injecting high-pressure steam, well above the ambient reservoir pressure, into a reservoir over a prolonged period of time. As heat softens the bitumen and water dilutes and separates the bitumen from the sand, the pressure creates fractures, cracks and openings through which the bitumen can flow back into the steam-injector wells. HPCSS differs from steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operations where steam is continuously injected at lower pressures without fracturing the reservoir and uses gravity drainage as the primary recovery mechanism. "&lt;ref name="AER18jul2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/news-releases/3632|title=Alberta Energy Regulator orders enhanced monitoring and further steaming restrictions at Primrose and Wolf Lake projects due to bitumen emulsion releases|date=18 July 2013|publisher=AER|access-date=2013-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730233259/http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/news-releases/3632|archive-date=2013-07-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Clearwater Formation near Cold Lake, Alberta the High Pressure Cyclic Steam Stimulation (HPCSS) is used.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt; There are both horizontal and vertical wells. Injection is at fracture pressure. There is a 60 m to 180 m spacing for horizontal wells. Vertical wells are spaced at 2 to 8 Acre spacing for vertical wells. The development can be as low as 7 m net pay. It is used in areas generally with no to minimal bottom water or top gas. The CSOR is 3.3 to 4.5. The ultimate recovery is predicted at 15 to 35%.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt; SAGD thermal recovery method is also used in Clearwater and [[Mannville Group#Grand Rapids Formation#Subunits|Lower Grand Rapids Formations]] with Horizontal Well Pairs (700 to 1000 m), Operating pressure 3 to 5 MPa, Burnt Lake SAGD was started with higher operating pressure close to dilation pressure, 75 m to 120 m spacing, Development to as low as 10 m net pay, In areas with or without bottom water, CSOR: 2.8 to 4.0 (at 100% quality), Predicted ultimate recovery: 45% to 55%.&lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

[[Canadian Natural Resources|Canadian Natural Resources Limited’s (CNRL)]] Primrose and Wolf Lake in situ oil sands project near [[CFB Cold Lake|Cold Lake, Alberta]] in the [[Clearwater Formation]], operated by CNRL subsidiary [[Horizon Oil Sands]], use the high pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS). &lt;ref name="OSUM2009Jiang" /&gt;

=== Vapor Extraction (Vapex) ===

Alternative enhanced oil recovery mechanisms include VAPEX ('''V'''apor '''A'''ssisted '''P'''etroleum '''Ex'''traction), Electro-Thermal Dynamic Stripping Process (ET-DSP), and ISC (for In Situ Combustion). VAPEX, a "gravity-drainage process that uses vapourized solvents rather than steam to displace or produce heavy oil and reduce its viscosity, was also invented by Butler.&lt;ref name="UofC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlocking the oil sands: The late Dr. Roger Butler, Schulich School of Engineering|publisher=University of Calgary|location=Calgary, Alberta|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/community/research/dr_roger_butlers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ET-DSP is a patented process that uses electricity to heat oil sands deposits to mobilize bitumen allowing production using simple vertical wells.  ISC uses [[oxygen]] to generate heat that diminishes oil viscosity; alongside carbon dioxide generated by heavy crude oil displace oil toward production wells. One ISC approach is called THAI for Toe to Heel Air Injection.&lt;ref name="UofC" /&gt;

=== Enhanced Modified Steam and Gas Push (eMSAGP)===

eMSAGP is a MEG Energy patented&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2776704/summary.html?query=meg+energy&amp;start=1&amp;num=50&amp;type=basic_search&lt;/ref&gt; process wherein MEG, in partnership with Cenovus&lt;ref&gt;https://katusaresearch.com/canadian-oil-sands-us-shale-innovation-via-necessity/&lt;/ref&gt;, developed a modified recovery process dubbed “enhanced Modified Steam and Gas Push” (eMSAGP), a modification of SAGP designed to improve the thermal efficiency of SAGD by utilizing additional producers located midway between adjacent SAGD well pairs, at the elevation of the SAGD producers. These additional producers, commonly referred to as “infill” wells, are an integral part of the eMSAGP recovery system.

{{Stress v strain A36 2.svg |290px |caption=[[Stress–strain curve]] for low-[[carbon steel]]. Hooke's law (see above) is only valid for the portion of the curve between the origin and the [[yield point]] (2).}}

Structural engineering depends on the knowledge of materials and their properties, in order to understand how different materials support and resist loads.

Common structural materials are:

==Iron==

===Wrought iron===
{{main|Wrought iron}}

Wrought iron is the simplest form of iron, and is almost pure iron (typically less than 0.15% carbon). It usually contains some [[slag]]. Its uses are almost entirely obsolete, and it is no longer commercially produced.

Wrought iron is very poor in fires. It is ductile, malleable and tough. It does not [[corrosion|corrode]] as easily as steel.

===Cast iron===
{{main|Cast iron}}

Cast iron is a brittle form of iron which is weaker in tension than in compression. It has a relatively low melting point, good fluidity, castability, excellent machinability and wear resistance. Though almost entirely replaced by steel in building structures, cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications, including pipes, machine and car parts.

Cast iron retains high strength in fires, despite its low melting point. It is usually around 95% iron, with between 2.1% and 4% carbon and between 1% and 3% silicon. It does not corrode as easily as steel.

===Steel===
[[File:gateway arch.jpg|thumb|right|The 630-foot (192 m) high, stainless-clad (type 304) [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial#The Gateway Arch|Gateway Arch]] in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]]]]
{{main|Steel|Structural steel}}
{{see also|Steel frame}}

Steel is an iron alloy with controlled level of carbon (between 0.0 and 1.7% carbon).

Steel is used extremely widely in all types of structures, due to its relatively low cost, high strength-to-weight ratio and speed of construction.

Steel is a ductile material, which will behave elastically until it reaches yield (point 2 on the stress–strain curve), when it becomes plastic and will fail in a ductile manner (large strains, or extensions, before fracture at point 3 on the curve). Steel is equally strong in tension and compression.

Steel is weak in fires, and must be protected in most buildings. Despite its high strength to weight ratio, steel buildings have as much thermal mass as similar concrete buildings.

The [[elastic modulus]] of steel is approximately 205 [[GPa]].

Steel is very prone to corrosion ([[rust]]).

===Stainless steel===
{{main|Stainless steel}}

Stainless steel is an iron-carbon alloy with a minimum of 10.5% chromium content. There are different types of stainless steel, containing different proportions of iron, carbon, [[molybdenum]], [[nickel]]. It has similar structural properties to steel, although its strength varies significantly.

It is rarely used for primary structure, and more for architectural finishes and building cladding.

It is highly resistant to corrosion and staining.

==Concrete==

[[File:Barcelona sagrada familia interno.jpg|thumb|The interior of the [[Sagrada Familia]], constructed of [[reinforced concrete]] to a design by [[Antoni Gaudí]]]]
[[File:trebar.jpg|thumb|right|A "cage" of [[rebar|reinforcing steel]]]]
{{main|Concrete}}

Concrete is used extremely widely in building and civil engineering structures, due to its low cost, flexibility, durability, and high strength. It also has high resistance to fire.

Concrete is a non-linear, non-elastic and brittle material. It is strong in compression and very weak in tension. It behaves non-linearly at all times. Because it has essentially zero strength in tension, it is almost always used as [[reinforced concrete]], a composite material. It is a mixture of [[sand]], aggregate, cement and water. It is placed in a mould, or form, as a liquid, and then it sets (goes off), due to a chemical reaction between the water and cement. The hardening of the concrete is called hydration. The reaction is exothermic (gives off heat).

Concrete increases in strength continually from the day it is cast. Assuming it is not cast under water or in constantly 100% relative humidity, it shrinks over time as it dries out, and it deforms over time due to a phenomenon called [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. Its strength depends highly on how it is mixed, poured, cast, compacted, cured (kept wet while setting), and whether or not any admixtures were used in the mix. It can be cast into any shape that a form can be made for. Its colour, quality, and finish depend upon the complexity of the structure, the material used for the form, and the skill of the worker.

The [[elastic modulus]] of concrete can vary widely and depends on the concrete mix, age, and quality, as well as on the type and duration of loading applied to it. It is usually taken as approximately 25 [[GPa]] for long-term loads once it has attained its full strength (usually considered to be at 28 days after casting). It is taken as approximately 38 [[GPa]] for very short-term loading, such as footfalls.

Concrete has very favourable properties in fire – it is not adversely affected by fire until it reaches very high temperatures. It also has very high mass, so it is good for providing sound insulation and heat retention (leading to lower energy requirements for the heating of concrete buildings). This is offset by the fact that producing and transporting concrete is very energy intensive. To study the material behavior plenty of numerical models were developed, e.g. the [[microplane model for constitutive laws of materials]].

=== Reinforced concrete ===
{{main|Reinforced concrete}}

Reinforced concrete is concrete in which steel reinforcement bars ("rebars"), plates or fibers have been incorporated to strengthen a material that would otherwise be brittle. In industrialised countries, nearly all concrete used in construction is reinforced concrete. Due to its weakness in tension capacity, concrete will fail suddenly and in brittle manner under flexural (bending) or tensile force unless adequately reinforced with steel.

=== Prestressed concrete ===
{{main|Prestressed concrete}}

'''Prestressed concrete''' is a method for overcoming the concrete's natural weakness in [[tension (mechanics)|tension]].&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcrete&gt;{{cite book|title= Prestressed Concrete|author=Nawy, Edward G.|date=1989|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=0-13-698375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcreteDesign&gt;{{cite book|title= Design of Prestressed Concrete|author=Nilson, Arthur H.|date=1987|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=0-471-83072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to produce [[beam (structure)|beam]]s, floors or bridges with a longer [[Span (architecture)|span]] than is practical with ordinary [[reinforced concrete]]. Prestressing tendons (generally of high [[tension (mechanics)|tensile]] steel [[wire rope|cable]] or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a [[compressive stress]] that offsets the [[tensile stress]] that the concrete [[compression member]] would otherwise experience due to a bending load.

==Aluminium==

2. [[Yield strength]]&lt;br&gt;
3. Proportional Limit Stress&lt;br&gt;
4. Rupture&lt;br&gt;
5. Offset strain (typically 0.002).]]
{{main|Aluminium|Aluminium alloy}}

Aluminium is a soft, lightweight, malleable metal. The yield strength of pure aluminium is 7–11 MPa, while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa. Aluminium has about one-third the density and stiffness of steel. It is ductile, and easily machined, cast, and extruded.

Corrosion resistance is excellent due to a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide that forms when the metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further oxidation. The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper.

Aluminium is used in some building structures (mainly in facades) and very widely in aircraft engineering because of its good strength to weight ratio. It is a relatively expensive material.

In aircraft it is gradually being replaced by carbon composite materials.

==Composites==
[[File:rutan.variEze.g-veze.arp.jpg|thumb|right|[[VariEze|Light composite aircraft]]]]
{{main|Composite material}}

Composite materials are used increasingly in vehicles and aircraft structures, and to some extent in other structures. They are increasingly used in bridges, especially for conservation of old structures such as [[Coalport]] cast iron bridge built in 1818. Composites are often anisotropic (they have different material properties in different directions) as they can be laminar materials. They most often behave non-linearly and will fail in a brittle manner when overloaded.

They provide extremely good strength to weight ratios, but are also very expensive. The manufacturing processes, which are often extrusion, do not currently provide the economical flexibility that concrete or steel provide. The most commonly used in structural applications are [[glass-reinforced plastic]]s.

==Masonry==
[[File:Flemish Bond.jpg|thumb|A brick wall built using [[Brickwork#Flemish bond|Flemish bond]]]]
{{main|Masonry}}

Masonry has been used in structures for thousands of years, and can take the form of stone, brick or blockwork. Masonry is very strong in compression but cannot carry tension (because the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between bricks or blocks is unable to carry tension). Because it cannot carry structural tension, it also cannot carry bending, so masonry walls become unstable at relatively small heights. High masonry structures require stabilisation against lateral loads from [[buttress]]es (as with the [[flying buttress]]es seen in many European medieval churches) or from [[windpost]]s.

Historically masonry was constructed with no mortar or with lime mortar. In modern times cement based mortars are used. The mortar glues the blocks together, and also smooths out the interface between the blocks, avoiding localised point loads that might have led to cracking.

Since the widespread use of concrete, stone is rarely used as a primary structural material, often only appearing as a cladding, because of its cost and the high skills needed to produce it. Brick and concrete blockwork have taken its place.

Masonry, like concrete, has good sound insulation properties and high thermal mass, but is generally less energy intensive to produce. It is just as energy intensive as concrete to transport.

==Timber==

{{main|Timber}}

Timber is the oldest of structural materials, and though mainly supplanted by steel, masonry and concrete, it is still used in a significant number of buildings. The properties of timber are non-linear and very variable, depending on the quality, treatment of wood, and type of wood supplied. The design of wooden structures is based strongly on empirical evidence.

Wood is strong in tension and compression, but can be weak in bending due to its fibrous structure. Wood is relatively good in fire as it chars, which provides the wood in the centre of the element with some protection and allows the structure to retain some strength for a reasonable length of time.

'''The Lightning Process''' ('''LP''') is a three-day personal training programme developed by British [[Osteopathy|osteopath]] Phil Parker.&lt;ref Name=Laura&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/laura-mvula-i-dont-think-im-good-at-being-a-pop-star-its-making-me-too-paranoid-9129575.html "Laura Mvula: 'I don't think I'm good at being a pop star. It's making me too paranoid'"], ''The Independent'', 16 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It claims to be beneficial for various conditions, including [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], depression and chronic pain. The Lightning Process is not recommended by the [[NHS]] for the treatment of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]. &lt;ref name=nhs_choices&gt;{{cite web|title=Lightning Process 'could help children with chronic fatigue syndrome', study claims|url=https://www.nhs.uk/news/medical-practice/lightning-process-could-help-children-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-study-claims/|website=nhs.uk|accessdate=5 October 2017|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed in the late 1990s, it aims to teach techniques for managing the [[Fight-or-flight response|acute stress response]] that the body experiences under threat. The course aims to help recognise the stress response, calm it and manage it in the long term. It also applies some ideas drawn from [[neurolinguistic programming]], as well as elements of [[life coaching]]. The approach has raised some controversy.&lt;ref name="Cormier2008b"/&gt;&lt;ref Name=BMJ/&gt; It is [[trademark]]ed.&lt;ref name=Crawley-2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crawley E, Mills N, Hollingworth W, etal |title=Comparing specialist medical care with specialist medical care plus the Lightning Process for chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (SMILE Trial) |journal=Trials |volume=14 |issue= |page=444 |year=2013 |pmid=24370208 |pmc=3879423 |doi=10.1186/1745-6215-14-444 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Lightning Process comprises three group sessions conducted on three consecutive days, lasting about 12 hours altogether, conducted by trained practitioners.&lt;ref name=Crawley-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker 2010 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="what_is_lightning_process"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lightningprocess.com/what-is-the-lightning-process/ |title=What is the Lightning Process?  |first=Phil |last=Parker |work=The Lightning Process |date= |accessdate=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its developer, Phil Parker, the programme aims to teach participants about the [[Fight-or-flight response|acute stress response]] the body experiences under threat. It aims to help trainees spot when this response is happening and learn how to calm it. Techniques based on movement, postural awareness and personal coaching are intended to modify the production of stress hormones. Participants practise a learnt series of steps to habituate the calming method.&lt;ref name="Parker 2010 7"/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro&gt;Parker (2010), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="PHM"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rimmer |first=Vikki |date=August 2008 |title=The Lightning Process Treatment for ME |journal=Positive Health Magazine |issue=150 |url=http://www.positivehealth.com/article/cfs-me/the-lightning-process-treatment-for-me |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for the programme draws on ideas of osteopaths [[Andrew Taylor Still]] and J M Littlejohn regarding nervous system dysregulation and addressing clients' needs in a [[holistic]] manner rather than focusing solely on symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|pp=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro42&gt;Parker (2010), pp. 42-44&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; It also  incorporates ideas drawn from [[neuro-linguistic programming]] and [[life coaching]].&lt;ref name="Cormier2008a"&gt;{{cite news | last = Cormier | first = Zoe | date =March 8, 2008 | title = 'Talk Therapy' Takes On Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Coming Soon To Canada | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/science/medicine-talk-therapy-takes-on-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-coming-soon-to-canada/article26391/ |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A basic premise is that individuals can influence their own  physiological responses in controlled and repeatable ways.&lt;ref name="Parker 2010 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such learnt [[emotional self-regulation]], it is suggested, could help overcome illness and improve well being, if the method is practised consistently.&lt;ref name="Parker 2010 17"/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro17&gt;Parker (2010), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Parker advocates attending the training course in order to gain a full understanding of the tools in a safe and supportive context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro11&gt;Parker (2010), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; He also lays emphasis on the trainee playing an active role in recovery (the course is framed as a fully participatory 'training', not a passive 'treatment' or set of answers given to a 'patient').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|pp=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro16&gt;Parker (2010), pp. 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=Intro27&gt;Parker (2010), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; He claims that the programme has helped to resolve various conditions including depression, panic attacks, insomnia, drug addictions, chronic pain and [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|2010|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref Name=Intro26&gt;Parker (2010), pp. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  The program has also been used with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref Name=BMJ&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d3780 |title=Dangers of research into chronic fatigue syndrome |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=342 |number=d3780 |date=22 June 2011 |last=Hawkes |first=Nigel |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHM" /&gt;

==Criticism and support==
There has been criticism of the cost of the three-day course.&lt;ref name="Kinnes"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kinnes | first = Sally |date=September 2, 2007 |title=Coping with ME |work=[[The Sunday Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=talktherapy&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/medicine-talk-therapy-takes-on-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-coming-soon-to-canada/article958170/?page=1 |title=Medicine: 'Talk therapy' takes on chronic fatigue syndrome: coming soon to Canada |newspaper=Globe and Mail |date=13 March 2009 |last=Cormier |first=Zoe |accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been criticism of the claimed benefits (see also [[#Advertising Standards Authority ruling|below]]).&lt;ref name="Cormier2008b"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cormier |first=Zoe |date=April 18, 2008 |title=Lightning Process - Controversial training program comes to Canada |work=[[CBC News]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/health/lightning-process.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=talktherapy/&gt; John Greensmith, of the British advocacy group ME Free For All, stated "We think their claims are extravagant... if patients get better, they claim the success of the treatment — but if they don't, they say the patient is responsible."&lt;ref name="Cormier2008b"/&gt;

Some chronic fatigue syndrome [[patient support groups]] have strongly objected to the perceived implication that the disease has psychological causes.&lt;ref name="Cormier2008b"/&gt; However, the Lightning Process website states that it is a neuro-physiological approach and that it considers CFS/ME to be a physical illness.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lightningprocess.com/facts-and-myths/ |title=Facts and Myths |last=Parker |first=Phil |work=The Lightning Process |accessdate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigel Hawkes writing for the BMJ describes the Lightning Process as being "secretive about its methods, lacks overall medical supervision, and has a cultish quality because many of the therapists are former sufferers who deliver the programme with great conviction" and that "Some children who do not benefit have said that they feel blamed for the failure".&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hawkes|first1=Nigel|title=Training for children with chronic fatigue works better than medical care alone, finds study|journal=BMJ|date=21 September 2017|pages=j4372|doi=10.1136/bmj.j4372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have claimed rapid cures for longstanding illnesses.&lt;ref name="Cormier2008b"/&gt; Prominent advocates of the process include [[Esther Rantzen]] (whose daughter has [[coeliac disease]] and chronic fatigue syndrome),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rantzen |first=Esther |title=At last, I have discovered the secret of Emily's 14 lost years, by Esther Rantzen | newspaper = [[Daily Mail]] |date=February 15, 2011 |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1356316/At-I-discovered-secret-Emilys-14-lost-years-Esther-Rantzen.html |accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[Patrick Strudwick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strudwick|first=Patrick|authorlink=Patrick Strudwick|title=Lightning cure ... or a flash in the pan? |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=February 22, 2011 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; French dancer Chris Marques,&lt;ref name="MidSussexTimes"&gt;{{cite news |date=April 14, 2008 |title=Young ME sufferer Anna thanks her 'cool' headteacher |work=[[Mid Sussex Times]] |url = http://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/509/Young-ME-sufferer-Anna-thanks.3978784.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hardy|first=Rebecca|title=Austin Healey: I'd been through hell before Strictly| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1093798/Austin-Healey-Id-hell-Strictly.html |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and singer [[Laura Mvula]].&lt;ref Name=Laura/&gt;

===Advertising Standards Authority ruling===  
In 2011 Hampshire Trading Standards requested that the UK [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) give a ruling on the website www.lightningprocess.com, arguing that the information on the site was misleading in four areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |department=Committees of Advertising |title=Health: The Lightning process |url=https://www.asa.org.uk/advice-online/health-the-lightning-process.html |work=Advertising Standards Authority UK |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASA upheld two of the four challenges.&lt;ref name="ASA" /&gt; They concluded that although there seemed to be some evidence of participant improvement during trials conducted, the trials were not controlled, the evidence was not sufficient enough to draw robust conclusions, and more investigation was necessary; consequently, the website's claims at the time were deemed misleading.&lt;ref name="ASA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/8/Phil-Parker-Group-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_158035.aspx|title=ASA Adjudication on Phil Parker Group Ltd|publisher=ASA|quote=The pilot study conducted with the International Centre For Wellness Research reported positive results from a sample of 17 participants. However, we understood that the study was not controlled and had concluded that further investigation was necessary... We noted that the trials conducted by the ME Association, the Brighton and Sussex Medical School and the Sussex &amp; Kent CFS/ME Society reported positive results but were self-assessment studies and had not been controlled. We considered that those studies and surveys did not constitute a suitably robust body of evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LP in the treatment of CFS/ME. Because of that, we concluded that the CFS/ME page of the website was likely to mislead... The claims on the website should not appear again in their current form. We told Phil Parker Group to ensure they did not make medical claims for the LP unless they were supported with robust evidence.|accessdate=May 4, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031120421/http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/8/Phil-Parker-Group-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_158035.aspx|archivedate=31 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
A registered clinical trial (UK SMILE pilot study) was conducted in England at Bristol University, with results published in 2017.&lt;ref name=SMILE&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawley|first1=Esther M|last2=Gaunt|first2=Daisy M|last3=Garfield|first3=Kirsty|last4=Hollingworth|first4=William|last5=Sterne|first5=Jonathan A C|last6=Beasant|first6=Lucy|last7=Collin|first7=Simon M|last8=Mills|first8=Nicola|last9=Montgomery|first9=Alan A|title=Clinical and cost-effectiveness of the Lightning Process in addition to specialist medical care for paediatric chronic fatigue syndrome: randomised controlled trial|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|date=20 September 2017|pages=archdischild-2017-313375|doi=10.1136/archdischild-2017-313375}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the results are promising its use is not recommended as of 2017 by the [[National Health Services]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=nhs_choices/&gt;

A [[qualitative study]] on experiences of the course among a group of young people with chronic fatigue syndrome was published in 2003.&lt;ref Name=BPS&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8287.2012.02093.x |volume=18 |title=Experiences of young people who have undergone the Lightning Process to treat chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis - a qualitative study |year=2012 |journal=British Journal of Health Psychology |pages=508–525 |last1 = Endresen Reme |first1=Silje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public reaction to research===
Esther Crawley said that "I never expected it would work" and that "This is an important study as it provides another treatment approach that some may find helpful. However, while these results are promising, further research is needed to establish which aspects of the process are helpful, whether it is an effective treatment on its own, and whether it could be used to help more severely affected patients."&lt;ref name=bmj/&gt;

Research into chronic fatigue syndrome is often a target of criticism.&lt;ref Name=BMJ/&gt; The SMILE study received some public criticism for recruiting children when adult subjects are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meassociation.org.uk/?page_id=1341 |title=Study involving children and the Lightning Process is unethical, says joint charity statement |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investinme.org/Article-501%20Childrens%20Study.shtml |title=SMILE Study |date=October 2010 |work=Invest in ME Research |accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meagenda.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/church-times-dr-esther-crawley-responds-to-prof-robin-gill-smile-lightning-process-pilot-study/ |title=Church Times: Dr Esther Crawley responds to Prof Robin Gill (SMILE Lightning Process pilot study) |last=Gill |first=Robin |work=ME Agenda |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was approved by the [[Health Research Authority|National Research Ethics Service]].&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Britton|first=Tony|title=Ethics committee finally approves controversial 'SMILE' pilot study into Lightning Process and children with ME/CFS |url=http://www.meassociation.org.uk/?p=3719|work=ME Association |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |date=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paediatrician supervising the study, Esther Crawley, has commented "If the Lightning Process is dangerous, as they say, we need to find out. They should want to find it out, not prevent research."&lt;ref Name=BMJ/&gt;

Results of the study by Crawley were publicized at the [[Science Media Centre]] in September 2017; an editorial on its own presentation of the results of the SMILE study stated: "If you had only read the headlines for the CFS/ME story you may conclude that the treatment tested at Bristol might be worth a try if you are blighted by the illness, when in truth the author said repeatedly that the findings would first have to be replicated in a bigger trial."&lt;ref name=Fox92017&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/inconvenient-truths/ |title=Inconvenient truths |first=Fiona |last=Fox |author-link=Fiona Fox (press officer) |work=Science Media Centre |location=London |date=September 28, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions to their briefing were stronger than expected: "it was the criticism from within the scientific community that we had not anticipated."&lt;ref name=Fox92017 /&gt; The briefing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/the-lightning-process-a-controversial-treatment-for-children-with-chronic-fatigue/ |title=The Lightning Process – a controversial treatment for children with chronic fatigue |date=September 20, 2017 |work=Science Media Centre |location=London |accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; invited four psychologists to make comments on the study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Expert reaction to controversial treatment for CFS/ME |url=http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-controversial-treatment-for-cfsme/ |date=September 20, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |work=Science Media Centre |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were mild in their reactions, while the commentary on the September 28, 2017 article evoked detailed, well-referenced but anonymous criticisms of the SMILE study and the Lightning Process in the comments section.&lt;ref name=Fox92017 /&gt;

Dorothy Bishop from Oxford University commented that "The gains for patients in this study seem solid. However, while the patient allocation and statistical analysis of the trial appear to be done to a high standard, the intervention that was assessed is commercial and associated with a number of warning signs. The Lightning Process appears based on neurolinguistic programming, which has long been recognised as pseudoscience.”&lt;ref name=bmj/&gt;

== Laboratories and organizations==

With the initiative of the Society for Wildlife Forensic Science (SWFS), the Scientific Working Group for Wildlife Forensic Sciences (SWGWILD) was formed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SWGWILD |work=Society for Wildlife Forensic Science |date=14 January 2013 |url=http://www.wildlifeforensicscience.org/swgwild/|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope==

While animals and plants are the victims in the crimes of illegal [[wildlife trade]] and [[animal abuse]], society also pays a heavy price when those crimes are used to fund illegal drugs, weapons and terrorism. Links between [[human trafficking]], [[public corruption]] and [[illegal fishing]] have also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 2009. [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-111SPRT48323/html/CPRT-111SPRT48323.htm Trafficking and extortion of Burmese migrants in Malaysia and Southern Thailand: a report to the Committee on Foreign Relations], United States Senate. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; The continued development and integration of wildlife forensic science as a field will be critical for successful management of the many significant social and conservation issues related to the illegal wildlife trade and wildlife [[law enforcement]].

'''Wyoming Catholic College''' is a private, [[Catholic]] [[liberal arts college]] in [[Lander, Wyoming|Lander]], [[Wyoming]].  It uses the town's sole Catholic church and accompanying facilities as an interim campus. WCC is the only private four-year institution of higher education in the state. It is endorsed by [[The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College]].

The college takes no federal aid money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/to-keep-free-of-federal-reins-wyoming-catholic-college-rejects-student-aid.html | title = To keep free of federal reins, Wyoming Catholic College rejects student aid | date = April 11, 2015 | accessdate = April 11, 2015 | last = Healy | first = Jack | newspaper = [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
WCC is one of the newest colleges in the United States, admitting its first class in 2007 and graduating them in the spring of 2011. WCC was granted Institutional Preaccreditation status by the [[American Academy for Liberal Education]] (AALE) on September 1, 2010, and  achieved candidate status by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyomingcatholiccollege.com/about-wcc/faq/index.aspx FAQs] at ''wyomingcatholiccollege''.com. Accessed 2011-10-13.  "The conferral of this status “signifies institutional integrity and a strong commitment to undergraduate education,” according to AALE’s Standards and Criteria for Program Accreditation. This status of accreditation allows Wyoming Catholic College to operate in an accredited manner until it receives full Institutional Accreditation in the next few months.&lt;/ref&gt; WCC received final accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission on November 15, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wyomingcatholic.org/college-receives-formal-notice-accreditation-higher-learning-commission-hlc/|title=College Receives Formal Notice of Accreditation from The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) - Wyoming Catholic College|date=2018-11-07|work=Wyoming Catholic College|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Because it offers a four-year, integrated, [[Great Books]] curriculum, Wyoming Catholic College has no majors, minors, specialized degrees or graduate programs; it awards graduating students the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Liberal Arts.  As of spring of 2018, there were over 160 students enrolled.

In the spring of 2016, Wyoming Catholic College became the second college in the nation to accept the [[Classic Learning Test]] (CLT) as an alternative to the SAT and ACT for college admissions.

The curriculum was designed to give students a general liberal arts education through a study of the [[Great Books]]. Courses include Humanities, Theology, Philosophy, Math/Science, Fine Arts, Latin, Trivium, and Leadership.&lt;ref name="wyocath"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wyomingcatholic.org/academics/ |title=Academics |work=Wyoming Catholic College Website |accessdate=2018-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the college's vision comes from the [[Integrated Humanities Program]] founded by John Senior at the [[University of Kansas]].

The school's Outdoor Leadership Program supplements the curriculum by taking students into the nearby [[Wind River Mountains]] (among other locations in the Wyoming/Utah area) to help them form their memories and imaginations through sense experience of the created world.  In addition, the program teaches leadership and decision-making skills all while aiming to help the students grow in the [[Cardinal virtues|Cardinal Virtues]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} All of the Freshmen go on a three week backpacking course in the Rocky mountains before beginning the school year.

==Student life==
On Sunday evenings, students gather together for [[Swing (dance)|swing dancing]] and [[waltz]]ing.  At various times in the academic year, there are formal themed dances put on by each of the classes.  The Easter Dance is put on by everyone, starting after the Easter Vigil Mass with a feast that moves into hours of dancing and traditionally finishing with watching the sunrise.

About four times a year, the college invites a guest lecturer to take part in its Distinguished Lecture Series, which is attended by all students in formal attire.  The topics vary, but often focus on the Philosophical and Theological traditions of Western Civilization. 
[[File:Wyoming_Catholic_College_Dorms.jpg|thumb|Wyoming Catholic College Dorms, ]]
Often, some of the dormitories will hold events that often involve singing [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk]] songs, playing instruments, and baking together.

Throughout the year, the college offers intramurals such as soccer, basketball, volleyball, and frisbee.

Outside of classes, the students participate in a number of outdoor activities such as [[rock climbing]], [[caving]], running, biking, and [[Abseiling|rappelling]].  In 2016, the college opened up Crux Coffee, an outdoor themed coffee shop open to the public. There is also a vibrant extra-curricular choral program featuring a mixed choir and both men and women's [[schola|scholas]] currently under the direction of Dr. Christopher Hodkinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wyomingcatholic.org/person/christopher-hodkinson/|title=Christopher Hodkinson, M.A., M.Phil. - Wyoming Catholic College|work=Wyoming Catholic College|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choir regularly sings Sacred music from the 15th centuries all the way to recent compositions of composers like [[Arvo Pärt|Arvo Part]] and Christoph Dalitz.

===Spiritual Life===
The college offers Mass and confessions from Sunday through Friday at the shared Holy Rosary Parish in Lander.  Three times a week, the college offers the [[Tridentine Mass|Extraordinary Form of the Mass]].  On weekday afternoons, [[Eucharistic adoration|Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament]] is offered at De Smet chapel in its Baldwin classroom building. The chapel, used occasionally for Mass with a custom made [[Ad orientem|ad-orientem]] altar, is named after [[Pierre-Jean De Smet|Father Pierre-Jean De Smet]], the first priest to celebrate Mass in the Wyoming territory. 

In addition, the College regularly offers theological and spiritual practicums for its students.

At a microscopic level, spheres are found in the meteorite that are rich in [[carbon]] compared to surrounding areas that lack such spheres.

==Discovery and naming==
The 41st [[Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition]] (JARE) found the meteorite in late December 2000 on the [[Yamato Glacier]] at the [[Queen Fabiola Mountains]], [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Imae 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Yamato nahklites: Petrography and mineralogy | journal = Antarctic Meteorite Research | date = 2003 | first = N. | last = Imae |author2=Y.

==Description==
The mass of the meteorite is {{convert|13.7|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt; It is an unbrecciated cumulus [[igneous rock]] consisting predominantly of elongated [[augite]] crystals —a [[solid solution]] in the [[pyroxene]] group.&lt;ref name="Imae 2003"/&gt; Japanese scientists from the National Institute of Polar Research reported in 2003 that the meteorite contains [[iddingsite]], which forms from the weathering of basalt in the presence of liquid water.&lt;ref name="Imae 2003"/&gt; In addition, NASA researchers reported in February 2014 that they also found carbon-rich spheres encased in multiple layers of iddingsite, as well as microtubular features emanating from iddingsite veins displaying curved, undulating shapes consistent with bio-alteration textures that have been observed in terrestrial basaltic glass.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt; However, the scientific consensus is that "morphology alone cannot be used unambiguously as a tool for primitive life detection."&lt;ref name=morphology&gt;{{cite journal | title = Morphological behavior of inorganic precipitation systems - Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology II | journal = SPIE Proceedings | date = December 30, 1999 | first = Juan-Manuel Garcia-Ruiz | volume = Proc.
