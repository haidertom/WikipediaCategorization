'''Aldo Rossi''' (3 May 1931 – 4 September 1997) was an Italian [[architect]] and [[designer]] who achieved international recognition in four distinct areas: architectural theory, drawing and design and also product design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Germano |last=Celant |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Diane |last2=Ghirardo |title=Aldo Rossi: Drawings |publisher=Skira |location=Milan |year=2008 |isbn=978-88-6130-143-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first Italian to receive the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;Pritzker Prize for Architecture - [http://www.pritzkerprize.com/about/purpose chriteria]&lt;/ref&gt; for architecture.

==Early life==

He was born in [[Milan]], [[Italy]].  After early education by the [[Somaschi Fathers|Somascan Religious Order]] and then at [[:it:Collegio arcivescovile Alessandro Volta|Alessandro Volta College]] in [[Lecco]], in 1949 he went to the school of architecture at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]].  His thesis advisor was [[:it:Piero Portaluppi|Piero Portaluppi]] and he  graduated in 1959.

In 1955 he had started writing for, and from 1959 was one of the editors of, the architectural magazine [[Casabella|Casabella-Continuità]], with editor in chief [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]]. Rossi left in 1964, when the chief editorship went to Gian Antonio Bernasconi. Rossi went on to work for [[:it:Società (rivista)|Società magazine]] and Il_contemporaneo, making him one of the most active participants in the fervent cultural debate of the time.

His early articles cover architects such as [[Alessandro Antonelli]],  [[:it:Mario Ridolfi|Mario Ridolfi]], [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Emil Kaufmann]] and much of this material became part of his second book, ''Scritti scelti sull'architettura e la città 1956-1972'' (''Selected writings on architecture and the city from 1956 to 1972''). He married the Swiss actress Sonia Gessner, who introduced him to the world of film and theater. Culture and his family became central to his life. His son Fausto was active in movie-making both in front of and behind the camera and his daughter Vera was involved with theatre.

==Career==

He began his professional career at the studio of [[Ignazio Gardella]] in 1956, moving on to the studio of [[Marco Zanuso]]. In 1963 also he began teaching, firstly as an assistant to [[:it:Ludovico Quaroni|Ludovico Quaroni]] (1963) at the school of urban planning in [[Arezzo]], then to [[Carlo Aymonino]] at the [[Università Iuav di Venezia|Institute of Architecture in Venice]]. In 1965 he was appointed lecturer at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]] and the following year he published ''The architecture of the city'' which soon became a classic of architectural literature.

His professional career, initially dedicated to architectural theory and small building work took a huge leap forward when [[Carlo Aymonino|Aymonino]] allowed Rossi to design part of the [[Monte Amiata Housing|Monte Amiata complex]] in the [[Gallaratese|Gallaratese quarter]] of Milan. In 1971 he won the design competition for the extension of the San Cataldo Cemetery in [[Modena]], which made him internationally famous.

After suspension from teaching in Italy in those politically troubled times, he moved to [[ETH Zurich]], occupying the chair in architectural design from 1971 to 1975.

In 1973 he was director of the International Architecture Section at the [[:it:XV Triennale di Milano|XV Milan Triennial Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Architecture]], where he presented, among others, his student [[Arduino Cantafora]].  Rossi's design ideas for the exhibition are explained in the International Architecture Catalogue and in a 16mm documentary ''Ornament and crime'' directed by Luigi Durissi and produced along with Gianni Braghieri and Franco Raggi.  In 1975, Rossi returned to the teaching profession in Italy, teaching architectural composition in Venice.

In 1979 he was made a member of the prestigious [[Accademia di San Luca|Academy of Saint Luke]]. Meanwhile, there was international interest in his skills.  He taught at several universities in the United States, including [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca (New York State).  At Cornell he participated in the ''Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies'' joint venture with New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], travelling to China and Hong Kong and attending conferences in South America.

In 1981 he published his autobiography, ''A scientific autobiography''. In this work the author, "in discrete disorder", brings back memories, objects, places, forms, literature notes, quotes, and insights and tries to "... go over things or impressions, describe, or look for ways to describe."  In the same year he won first prize at the international competition for the design of an apartment block on the corner of Kochstraße and Wilhelmstraße in central [[Berlin]].

In 1984 together with [[Ignazio Gardella]] and [[Fabio Reinhart]], he won the competition for the renovation of the [[Teatro Carlo Felice]] in [[Genoa]], which was not fully completed until 1991. In 1985 and 1986 Rossi was director of the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture|3rd (respectively 4th) International Architecture Exhibition]] at the [[Venice Biennale]] including further away display spaces such as Villa Farsetti in [[Santa Maria di Sala]].

In 1987 he won two international competitions: one for a site at the [[Parc de la Villette]] in Paris, the other for the [[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] in Berlin, which was never brought to fruition. In 1989 he continued product design work for Unifor (now part of [[:it:Molteni&amp;C|Molteni Furniture]]) and [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]]. His espresso maker ''La Cupola'', designed for Alessi came out in 1988.

In 1990 he was awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name=Goldberger1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberger|first1=Paul|title=Aldo Rossi: Sentiment For The Unsentimental|work=New York Times|date=22 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Fukuoka]] in Japan honoured him for his work on the hotel complex ''The Palace'' and he won the 1991 Thomas Jefferson Medal in Public Architecture from the [[American Institute of Architects]]. These prestigious awards were followed by exhibitions at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, the [[Beurs van Berlage]] in Amsterdam, the [[Berlinische Galerie]] in Berlin and the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Ghent, Belgium.

In 1996 he became an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and the following year he received their special cultural award in architecture and design.  He died in Milan on 4 September 1997, following a car accident. Posthumously he received the ''[[Torre Guinigi]]'' prize for his contribution to urban studies and the ''Seaside Prize'' of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150509102932/http://seasideinstitute.org/what-we-do/ Seaside Institute], Florida, where he had built a detached family home in 1995.

On appeal his proposals won the 1999 competition for the restoration of the [[Teatro La Fenice]], Venice and it reopened in 2004.  In 1999 the Faculty of Architecture of the [[University of Bologna]], based in [[Cesena]], was named after him.

==Work==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stainless steel kettle "Il Conico" (designed by Aldo Rossi).png|thumb|200px|left|Stainless steel kettle ''Il Conico'', 1986]] --&gt;
[[File:Aldo Rossi La Cupola Alessi Coffee Maker Austin Calhoon Photograph.jpg|thumb|200px|Aldo Rossi La Cupola Espresso Maker 1988, produced by Alessi]]
His earliest works of the 1960s were mostly theoretical and displayed a simultaneous influence of 1920s [[Italian modernism]] (''see [[Giuseppe Terragni]]''), classicist influences of Viennese architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the reflections of the painter [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. A trip to the [[Soviet Union]] to study [[Stalinist architecture]] also left a marked impression.

In his writings Rossi criticized the lack of understanding of the city in current architectural practice. He argued that a city must be studied and valued as something constructed over time; of particular interest are urban artifacts that withstand the passage of time. Rossi held that the city remembers its past (our "collective memory"), and that we use that memory through monuments; that is, monuments give structure to the city. Inspired by the persistence of Europe's ancient cities, Rossi strove to create similar structures immune to obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aldo Rossi, Modena Cemetery, Model, c.1983.jpg.png|thumb|right|200px|Model of San Cataldo Cemetery, [[Modena]], Italy, 1971-]]  --&gt;
He became extremely influential in the late 1970s and 1980s as his body of built work expanded and for his theories promoted in his books ''[[The Architecture of the City]]'' (''L'architettura della città'', 1966) and ''A Scientific Autobiography'' (''Autobiografia scientifica'', 1981).The largest of Rossi's projects in terms of scale was the San Cataldo Cemetery, in [[Modena]], Italy, which began in 1971 but is yet to be completed. Rossi referred to it as a "city of the dead".

The distinctive independence of his buildings is reflected in the micro-architectures of the products designed by Rossi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buerdek |first=Bernhard E. |year=2005 |title=Design: History, theory and practice of product design |url= |location=Basel, Switzerland |publisher=Birkhauser-Publishers for Architecture |isbn=978-3-764-37029-9 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s Rossi designed stainless steel [[French press|cafetières]] and other products for [[Alessi (company)|Alessi]], [[Pirelli]], and others.

[[File:Bonnefanten2013-04.jpg|thumb|200px|Central staircase [[Bonnefanten Museum]], [[Maastricht]]]]

==Exhibits==

For the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1979 Rossi designed a floating ''Teatro del Mondo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archidose.blogspot.com/1999/02/teatro-del-mondo.html |title=Teatro del Mondo |date=8 February 1999 |access-date=29 October 2018 |work=A Daily Dose of Architecture |first=John |last=Hill |publisher=[[Blogspot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seated 250 people. For the Venice Biennale in 1984, he designed a triumphal arch at the entrance to the exhibition site. In 2006 two [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] based on an original 1989 design by Aldo Rossi were erected in front of the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht by the Delft architectural firm Ufo Architecten.

== Issues==
There are scholars and theologians who consider only the original autographs of Scripture as infallible and as final authority, while others hold more to what is called the "Ecclesiastical Text" view, that [[Bible Canon|Scripture canon]] is also authoritative in various renderings in later copies or [[Bible manuscript#Textual criticism|manuscript traditions]], or established "apo-grapha" (meaning "copied-writings"), and not just the [[Biblical manuscript|original autographs]] alone. The reason being that the "original autographs" no longer actually exist, in tangible extant form, so later verified copies of copies, or "apographa", are the only real tangible or present "canon" that we have, and providentially preserved for current knowledge.  And that the "apographa" or "Ecclesiastical Text" is all that is really available and should be mainly considered realistically, from established and accepted confessions, church traditions, revivals, productivity, understandings, and interpretations, and should be all that is accepted reasonably, efficiently, or sufficiently, for study or edification.&lt;ref&gt; Dr. Jeffrey Khoo - [http://www.deanburgonsociety.org/Preservation/sola.htm SOLA AUTOGRAPHA OR SOLA APOGRAPHA?

MacDonald, Jr. - [https://ajmacdonaldjr.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/the-ecclesiastical-text/ The Ecclesiastical Text] - wordpress.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theologians and scholars hold to what's called the "Critical Text" position,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gotquestions.org/critical-text.html  Question: "What is the Critical Text?"] - GotQuestions.org.&lt;/ref&gt; such as put forth by [[Westcott and Hort]], that seeks to find out and put forth what the original Apostles and Prophets actually wrote, regardless of later tradition or confessional history, or "majority text" views.&lt;ref name="gotquestions critical text"&gt;[https://www.gotquestions.org/verbal-plenary-preservation.html What is Verbal Plenary Preservation?] - GotQuestions.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Westcott and Hort's work, according to Bible scholar and translator [[Bruce M.

'''''Art and Illusion, A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation''''', is a 1960 book of [[art theory]] and [[art history|history]] by [[Ernst Gombrich]], derived from the 1956 [[Bollingen Foundation#Number 35: The A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts|A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts]]. The book had a wide impact in art history,&lt;ref&gt;Shone, Richard and Stonard, John-Paul, eds. ''The Books That Shaped Art History: From Gombrich and Greenberg to Alpers and Krauss'', chapter 9. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but also in history (e.g. [[Carlo Ginzburg]], who called it "splendid"&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, Carlo. "From Aby Warburg to E.H. Gombrich." In Clues, Myths, and the Historical Method, 47. Baltimore: JHU Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[aesthetics]] (e.g. [[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''[[Languages of Art]]''&lt;ref&gt;N. Goodman: ''Languages of Art'', Indianapolis and Cambridge, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[semiotics]] ([[Umberto Eco]]'s ''Theory of Semiotics''&lt;ref&gt;U. Eco: ''Theory of Semiotics'', Bloomington, 1976, pp.204-05.&lt;/ref&gt;), and music psychology ([[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s schema theory of [[Galant style]] music).

In ''Art and Illusion,'' Gombrich argues for the importance of "schemata" in analyzing works of art: he claims that artists can only learn to represent the external world by learning from previous artists, so representation is always done using stereotyped figures and methods.

In 2018, China's [[artificial intelligence]] industry lags behind that of the [[United States]], both in terms of technological and theoretical development. However, in 2017 China issued a [[Artificial_intelligence_industry_in_China#New_Generation_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Development_Plan|plan]] to become the global leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. 

==Current industry and academia==
[[China]] is home to several major AI-centric companies, including [[Baidu]], [[Tencent]], and [[Alibaba]]. China is also home to countless startups related to the development of AI. SenseTime, founded in 2014 by researchers at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], produces computer vision technology for large Chinese companies such as [[China Mobile]] and [[JD.com]]. Peking University introduced the first academic course on AI in 2004, leading many other Chinese universities to adopt AI as a discipline.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cyranoski|first1=David|title=China enters the battle for AI talent|journal=Nature|date=January 17, 2018|volume=553|issue=7688|page=260-261|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-00604-6|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00604-6|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with the West==
The gap between China's AI industry and that of the [[United States]] is closing fast in terms of private investment, patents, and publications &lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;. Many AI experts have speculated that China will struggle to recruit experts in the field &lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;. However, China also boasts of some advantages which could prove to be critical. China has a strong precedent of government investment leading to industrial development. Further, fewer regulations hinder data collection and usage in China, which has proven to be advantageous in the realm of facial recognition &lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Will|title=China's AI Awakening|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609038/chinas-ai-awakening/|accessdate=April 3, 2018|agency=MIT|publisher=Technology Review|date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In summary, China benefits from stronger government dedication to the industry and fewer obstacles related to privacy and data integrity.

In April 2018, [[CNN]] noted that the two AI startups with the highest evaluation, SenseTime (4.5 billion USD) and Yitu Technology (2.4 billion USD), are both Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pham|first1=Sherisse|title=Chinese AI startup dwarfs global rivals with $4.5 billion valuation|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/09/technology/china-ai-sensetime-startup/index.html|accessdate=10 April 2018|work=CNNMoney|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complete List of Unicorn Companies|url=https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies|website=CB Insights|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New generation of artificial intelligence development plan==
China's State Council issued the "A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (State Council Document [2017] No. 35) on July 8, 2017, in which the [[Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China|CCP Central Committee]] and the State Council urge the governing bodies of China to promote the development of artificial intelligence. The State Council predicts that China will become a world-leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. Specifically, the State Council plans to spend $2.1 billion on an AI industrial park in [[Mentougou_District|Mentougou district]] &lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;. In order to achieve this end, the State Council states the need for massive talent acquisition, theoretical and practical developments, and public and private investments. In the document, the State Council lists myriad sectors open to the future influence of artificial intelligence, including transportation, healthcare, environmental protection, national security, social governance, and education. Throughout the document, the State Council emphasizes the need for focus on the ethics of artificial intelligence. &lt;ref name="State"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Council Notice on the Issuance of the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan|url=https://na-production.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/translation-fulltext-8.1.17.pdf|publisher=New America|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

The State Council cites many motivating factors in their desire to become a global leader in artificial intelligence. Primarily, the [[State_Council_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China|State Council]] focuses on the potential for industrial growth and transformation. The State Council recognizes that "AI has become the core driving force for a new round of industrial transformation."&lt;ref name="State" /&gt; Many of their motivating factors resemble those of the West -- industry and national security, as well as "education, medical care, pensions, environmental protection, urban operations, judicial services, and other fields."&lt;ref name="State" /&gt; However, the State Council also alludes to motivating factors that do not resemble those of the West. The State Council details the potential of artificial intelligence to "grasp group cognition and psychological changes in a timely manner... elevate the capability and level of social governance... maintain social stability." &lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

==Relative advantages and disadvantages==
The State Council acknowledges several relative advantages and disadvantages with regard to AI innovation potential, when compared to the West.

===Advantages===
The State Council cites preceding development plans, such as the National Key Research and Development Plan, Internet +, and AI Three-Year Activities and Implementation Program as evidence of forthcoming success. The State Council draws attention to the fact that China is "leading the world in voice recognition and visual recognition technologies."&lt;ref name="State" /&gt; Further, they note that China is second in the world in international publications and patents in the domain of artificial intelligence. Instructing their audience to "fully give play to the advantages of the socialist system," the State Council claims that the greater levels of central coordination will allow them to more efficiently make advancements in such a complex industry.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt; Developments in AI will require a collaboration between the regulatory bodies, private enterprises, educational institutions, and military researchers, so they make a valid point with their claim. 

===Disadvantages===
The State Council acknowledges that China is not quite at the level of developed countries (particularly the United States) with regard to AI development. They admit that China is "lacking major original results in basic theory, core algorithms, key equipment, high-end chips, major products and systems. foundational materials, components, software and interfaces, etc." &lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

==Timeline==
The State Council reports three general milestones for their integration of artificial intelligence into their industrial economy.

===2020===
By 2020, China expects to be "in step with globally advanced levels" of artificial intelligence theoretical and technological development. The State Council foresees that by this time "AI technology applications will have become a new way to improve people's livelihoods." The State Council predicts that China will have contributed globally to hardware, software, and methods pertinent to artificial intelligence. Specifically, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 150 billion RMB, with a value of over 1 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

===2025===
By 2025, the State Council aims for China to have fundamentally contributed to basic AI theory, solidifying its place as a global leader in AI research. Further, the State Council aims that "AI becomes the main driving force for China's industrial upgrading and economic transformation" by this time. The State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 400 billion RMB, with a value of over 5 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

===2030===
By this time, the State Council targets China to be the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology. The State Council claims that China will have developed a "mature new-generation AI theory and technology system." At this point, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry to be worth 1 trillion RMB, with a value of over 10 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

==Talent acquisition==
The State Council recognizes that talent acquisition is arguably the most crucial endeavor in bolstering its AI industry. The State Council wishes to produce individuals capable of reasoning about the whole spectrum of AI development, including components such as basic theory, application, and product development. The State Council states a desire to solidify AI as a discipline, and formalize its treatment in universities. Further, they plan on constructing "national AI industrial parks." They even go so far as to suggest AI-related courses in primary and secondary schools. Extending upon educational infrastructure, the State Council aims to provide "AI 'hackerspaces'" and "entrepreneurial service agencies" dedicated to AI.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

==Ethical considerations==
The State Council emphasized the importance of ethics in AI development. In each of their three milestones (2020, 2025, and 2030), the State Council includes a specific goal related to the development of research into or enforcement of AI-related ethics. Despite the fear of many Westerners that the Chinese will disregard privacy concerns and other data-related rights infringements, the State Council states its wishes to "increase disciplinary efforts aimed at the abuse of data, violations of personal privacy, and actions contrary to moral ethics." In the short term, the State Council aims to look into AI's effects on employment, while it aims to look into AI's effects on social ethics in the long term.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

==Statement on Climate Change==
[[File:Climate scientists protest CSIRO staff cuts AMOS conference.jpg|thumb|right|Climate scientists attending the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (AMOS) climate science conference in Melbourne stage protest against cuts to CSIRO climate research programs. Photo: John Englart]]AMOS has issued a ''Statement on Climate Change'', wherein they conclude, “Global [[climate change]] and [[global warming]] are real and observable…It is highly likely that those human activities that have increased the concentration of [[greenhouse gases]] in the [[atmosphere]] have been largely responsible for the observed warming since 1950. The warming associated with increases in greenhouse gases originating from human activity is called the enhanced [[greenhouse effect]]. The atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] has increased by more than 30% since the start of the [[industrial age]] and is higher now than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years. This increase is a direct result of burning [[fossil fuels]], broad-scale [[deforestation]] and other human activity.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amos.org.au/publications/cid/3/t/publications AMOS ''Statement on Climate Change'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|bulbs as defined '''botanically'''|bulbs in the wider gardening sense|Ornamental bulbous plant|other uses}}

[[File:Shallots-Whole.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Shallot]] bulbs]]
[[File:Amaryllisbulb.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Hippeastrum]]'' (amaryllis) bulb]]
In [[botany]], a '''bulb''' is structurally a short [[Plant stem|stem]] with fleshy [[leaf|leaves]] or leaf bases&lt;ref&gt;Bell, A.D. 1997. ''Plant form: an illustrated guide to flowering plant morphology''. Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt; that function as [[food]] [[storage organ]]s during [[dormancy]]. (In [[gardening]], plants with other kinds of storage organ are also called "[[ornamental bulbous plant]]s" or just "bulbs".)

A bulb's leaf bases, also known as scales, generally do not support leaves, but contain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse weather conditions. At the center of the bulb is a vegetative growing point or an unexpanded flowering shoot. The base is formed by a reduced [[Plant stem|stem]], and plant growth occurs from this basal plate. [[Root]]s emerge from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves from the upper side. '''Tunicate''' bulbs have dry, membranous outer scales that protect the continuous lamina of fleshy scales.&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giqdNdoJNQsC |first=S.R. |last=Mishra |title=Plant Reproduction |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |year=2005 |isbn=978-81-7141-955-5 |pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species in the genera ''[[Allium]]'', ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'', and ''[[Tulip]]a'' all have tunicate bulbs. Non-tunicate bulbs, such as ''[[Lilium]]'' and ''[[Fritillaria]]'' species, lack the protective tunic and have looser scales.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeSW3gkjXFMC |first=Barbara W. |last=Ellis |title=Bulbs |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-618-06890-6 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical term '''[[geophyte]]''' encompasses plants that form underground storage organs, including bulbs as well as [[tubers]] and [[corms]]. Some [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[orchid]]s (family [[Orchidaceae]]) form above-ground storage organs called '''[[pseudobulb]]s''', that superficially resemble bulbs.

Nearly all plants that form true bulbs are [[monocotyledon]]s, and include:
*''[[Amaryllis]]'', ''[[Crinum]]'', ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', ''[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]]'', and several other members of the amaryllis family [[Amaryllidaceae]]. This includes [[onion]], [[garlic]], and other [[allium]]s, members of the Amaryllid subfamily [[Allioideae]].
*[[Lily]], [[tulip]], and many other members of the lily family [[Liliaceae]].
*Two groups of ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' species, family [[Iridaceae]]: subgenus ''[[Iris_subg._Xiphium|Xiphium]]'' (the "Dutch" irises) and subgenus ''[[Hermodactyloides]]'' (the miniature "rock garden" irises).
''[[Oxalis]]'', in the family [[Oxalidaceae]], is the only [[dicotyledon]] genus that produces true bulbs.&lt;ref name="Hartmann"&gt;{{cite book |first=Hudson Thomas |last=Hartmann |author2=Dale E. Kester |title=Hartmann and Kester's Plant Propagation: Principles and Practices |edition=7 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-13-679235-2 |page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OberEmshBellDrey09&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oberlander |first=K.

Bulbous plant species cycle through vegetative and reproductive growth stages; the bulb grows to flowering size during the vegetative stage and the plant flowers during the reproductive stage. Certain environmental conditions are needed to trigger the transition from one stage to the next, such as the shift from a cold winter to spring.&lt;ref name="Mishra"/&gt; Once the flowering period is over, the plant enters a foliage period of about six weeks during which time the plant absorbs nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun for setting flowers for the next year. Bulbs dug up before the foliage period is completed will not bloom the following year but then should flower normally in subsequent years.

After the foliage period is completed, bulbs may be dug up for replanting elsewhere. Any surface moisture should be dried, then the bulbs may be stored up to about 4 months for a fall planting. Storing them much longer than that may cause the bulbs to dry out inside and become nonviable.

== Bulbil ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lilium]] --&gt;
A '''bulbil''' is a small bulb, and may also be called a '''bulblet''', '''bulbet''', or '''bulbel'''.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book |author=Bell, A.D. |year=1997  |title=Plant form: an illustrated guide to flowering plant morphology |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, U.K.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bulbs can develop or propagate a large bulb. If one or several moderate-sized bulbs form to replace the original bulb, they are called '''renewal bulbs'''.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; '''Increase bulbs''' are small bulbs that develop either on each of the leaves inside a bulb, or else on the end of small underground stems connected to the original bulb.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;

Some lilies, such as the tiger lily ''[[Lilium lancifolium]]'', form small bulbs, called bulbils, in their leaf [[axil]]s. Several members of the onion family, Alliaceae, including ''Allium sativum'' ([[garlic]]), form bulbils in their flower heads, sometimes as the flowers fade, or even instead of the flowers (which is a form of [[apomixis]]). The so-called [[tree onion]] (''Allium'' × ''proliferum'') forms small onions which are large enough for [[pickling]].

Some ferns, such as [[Asplenium bulbiferum|the hen-and-chicken fern]], produce new plants at the tips of the fronds' pinnae that are sometimes referred to as bulbils.

The '''conservation and restoration of new media art''' is the study and practice of techniques for sustaining [[new media art]] created using from materials such as digital, biological, performative, and other variable media.

Artists' increased use of [[multi-media]], [[Digital data|digital]], and [[internet]] media since the 1960s has called into question the conventional strategies by which society preserves, cares for, and redisplays cultural artifacts created with or on [[ephemera]] media formats. While the most obvious vulnerability of [[new media art]] is rapid technological [[obsolescence]], the study of its other aspects that defy traditional conservation—including hybrid, contextual, or 'live' qualities—has provoked investigation into new strategies for preserving [[conceptual art]], [[performance art|performance]], [[installation art]], [[video art]], and even to a limited extent [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].

==Relationship to other preservation efforts==

The catchall term sometimes applied to such genres, ''variable media'', suggests that it is possible to recapture the experience of these works independently of the specific physical material and equipment used to display them in a given exhibition or performance. As the nature of multi-media artworks calls for the development of new standards, techniques, and [[metadata]] within preservation strategies, the idea that certain artworks incorporating an array of media elements could be variable opens up the possibility for experimental standards of preservation and reinterpretation.

Nevertheless, many new media preservationists work to integrate new preservation strategies with existing documentation techniques and [[metadata]] standards. This effort is made in order to remain compatible with previous frameworks and models on how to archive, store and maintain variable media objects in a standardized repository utilizing a systematized vocabulary, such as the [[Open Archival Information System]] model.

While some of this research parallels and exploits progress made in the practice of [[Digital preservation]] and [[Web archiving]], the preservation of new media art offers special challenges and opportunities. Whereas scientific data and legal records may be easily [[#Migration|migrated]] from one platform to another without losing their essential function, artworks are often sensitive to the look and feel of the media in which they are embedded. On the other hand, artists who are invited to help imagine a long-term plan for their work often respond with creative solutions.

== Preservation strategies ==

===Storage===
The acquisition and storage of the physical media-equipment, such as DVD players or computers, used in multi-media or digital artworks has proven a short-term tactic at best, as hardware can quickly become obsolete or can 'stale' in storage.&lt;ref name="Depocas"&gt;{{cite book|title=Permanence Through Change: The Variable Media Approach|year=2003|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|location=New York|isbn=0968469329|page=129|author1=Depocas, Alain |author2=Jon Ippolito |author3=Caitlin Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129}} Storage is also notoriously bad at capturing the contextual and live aspects of works such as [[Internet art]], [[performance art]] and [[live electronic music]].

Variations on storage include:

* '''Refreshing'''
The periodic transfer of an audiovisual or digital file from one cassette or disk to another device of identical format.

* '''Restoration'''
The cleaning or repair of an existing artifact or file, especially when the new version supersedes or replaces the original.

* '''Networked storage'''
The use of computers linked by a persistent data loop to keep critical files in circulation or as multiple copies cloned on multiple hard drives.

===Migration===
To migrate a work of art is to upgrade its format from an aged medium to a more current one, such as from VHS to DVD, accepting that some changes in quality may occur while still maintaining the integrity of the original.&lt;ref name="Depocas"/&gt;{{rp|126}} This strategy assumes that preserving the content or information of an artwork, despite its change in media, trumps concerns over fidelity to the original look and feel.

===Emulation===
The process of simulating an older operating system (or by extension, other supporting infrastructure) on a newer software or hardware platform is called [[emulator|emulation]].&lt;ref name="Depocas"/&gt;{{rp|125}} As in migration, the impetus behind emulation is to keep a work alive though its original media may become obsolete; unlike migration, however, emulation of computer-based art preserves the original code underlying the artwork. Emulation software is currently in various stages of development and efficiency.

==== ''Seeing Double'': an emulation testbed ====
In 2004, the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], in conjunction with the [[Daniel Langlois Foundation]], held an exhibition entitled ''Seeing Double: Emulation in Theory and Practice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variablemedia.net/e/seeingdouble/ ''Seeing Double: Emulation in Theory and Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt; as a trial of emulation. In the exhibition, artworks operating on their original physical media were displayed alongside versions emulated on newer physical media. The exhibition was organized with the participation of computer researcher and emulation specialist, [[Jeff Rothenberg]]. In 1998, Rothenberg had published "Avoiding Technological Quicksand: Finding a Viable Technical Foundation for Digital Preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.clir.org/PUBS/reports/rothenberg/contents.html|title=Avoiding Technological Quicksand: Finding a Viable Technical Foundation for Digital Preservation|date=January 1998|author=Jeff Rothenberg}} ([http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/rothenberg/pub77.pdf 1999 full text])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinterpretation===
The most powerful, but also most risky, preservation strategy for new media art is to reinterpret the work each time it is re-created. Reinterpretation may require rewriting code for a completely different platform, following site-specific instructions regarding installation, or recasting a work in a contemporary medium with the metaphoric value of an outdated medium. Reinterpretation is a dangerous technique when not warranted by the artist, but it may be the only way to re-create performed, installed, or networked art designed to vary with context.&lt;ref name="Depocas"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

==Preservation tools==

===Variable Media Questionnaire===
First developed in 2000 by [[Jon Ippolito]], associate curator at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], the Variable Media Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.variablemedia.net/e/welcome.html The Variable Media Network]&lt;/ref&gt; is an interactive form linked to a larger database, which is designed to capture behavioral information about digital, performative, and other variable media artworks upon their acquisition by a museum. The goal is to specifically define 'what it is' and 'what is needed' when the museum is acquiring a work of this kind. The goal of the Questionnaire is to assist artists and museum professionals in understanding which attributes of an artwork may change and how best to make those changes when future re-creations necessitate them.

Based on the premise that some aspects of an artwork's logic or presentation can be considered independently from the physical context and equipment used to display that artwork, the Questionnaire captures information about the following ''behaviors'' or medium-independent aspects:

* '''Contained'''
Covers glazing; coating; support/structure/mounting; frame; acceptable change in surface.

* '''Installed'''
Covers space; boundary; access; lighting; sound; security; base/s; distribution of elements; display equipment for inert elements; architectural placement; equipment visibility.

* '''Performed'''
Covers props; set; costumes; performers; number of performers; format of instructions; instructions apply to...; documentation of new performances; audience location; boundary; synchronization of performance.

* '''Interactive'''
Covers user input; interaction mechanism; maintenance.

* '''Reproduced'''
Covers relationship to artist master; location of master; status of master; acceptable fabricators and vendors; acceptable submasters or exhibition copy; permission to create submaster; fate of exhibition copy; permission to compress/digitize.

* '''Duplicable'''
Covers [[Chemically inert|inert]] material; physical attributes of inert material; authorized fabricators and vendors; materials duplicated according to...; electronic equipment and hardware; fate of exhibition copies.

* '''Encoded'''
Covers screen resolution; color palette; external data source; fonts; source openness.

* '''Networked'''
Covers exhibition context; external [[database|data sources]]; non-standard protocol; minimum [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]; network model.

==Metadata standards==

===Media Art Notation System (MANS)===

Developed by [[Richard Rinehart]], Digital Media Director and Adjunct Curator, [[Berkeley Art Museum]]/Pacific Film Archive, MANS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard Rinehart|url=http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/about/formalnotation.pdf|title=A System of Formal Notation for Scoring Works of Digital and Variable Media Art |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609135334/http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/about/formalnotation.pdf|archivedate=June 9, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; is described as a 'formal [[notation system]] for [[media art]]' that is in keeping with existing preservation frameworks and vocabularies currently being used to document and preserve other forms of art by museums.

Using the metaphor of the [[sheet music|musical score]], as a form of declarative and conceptual notation of music, Rinehart likens Media Art to musical compositions that are able to maintain their original integrity while being realized by different instruments or in different arrangements, over evolving time periods; in this sense, scores are considered to be inherently variable. In Rinehart's view, [[media art]] (in which logical information is considered separate from physical hardware) is able to be 'scored' based on the information acquired from a document like the Variable Media Questionnaire to be realized by different media-equipment.

Maintaining the notion of the musical score, the Media Art Notation System is derived as (and has as its underlying structure) an interpretation of computer programming languages, drawing primarily from [[Declarative programming|Digital Item Declaration Language]] (DIDL), a type of [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML) that allows for greater, more granular descriptions of a multi-component [[Digital object identifier|digital object]]. MANS has three layers; the conceptual model of documentation, the preferred expression format (vocabulary) for the model (the interpretation of DIDL XML) and, its top layer, the score, which serves as a record of the work that is database-processable.

It is hoped that by interweaving the ideas of a declarative language and a more procedural language, MANS is able to act as a backbone to the artwork by being specifically suggestive though not overly prescriptive of how to best delineate and then, later, reinterpret an artwork.

== History of new media art preservation ==

===Individual efforts===
Numerous contemporary art conservators have contributed individual efforts toward new media art preservation:

*Carol Stringari of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York
As a deputy director and chief conservator, Stringari led laser research of a monochromatic painting by [[Ad Reinhardt]] and project on conservation of the works of [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. She later won the CAA/Heritage Preservation Award for Distinction for Scholarship and Conservation for her work on Ad Reinhardt's technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdaily.com/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=28750&amp;int_modo=1| title= Guggenheim's Carol Stringari Wins CAA/Heritage Preservation Award| accessdate= January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*Pip Laurenson of the [[Tate Gallery]] in London
Head of Time-based media conservation at the Tate, Laurenson is currently working to achieve her PhD in the care and management of time-based media works of art at University College London.

*Jill Sterret of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].
Director of Collections &amp; Conservation at SFMOMA, Sterret is an avid collector and preserver of artworks made by contemporary artists. She is committed to the vital collaborations between artists, curators, technical experts, registrars, and conservators that support contemporary art conservation practice.

===Consortium efforts===
The variable media concept was developed in 1998, first as a creative strategy Ippolito brought to the adversarial collaborations produced with artists Janet Cohen and Keith Frank, and later as a preservation strategy called the Variable Media Initiative that he applied to endangered artworks in the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]'s collection. In 2002 the Guggenheim  partnered with the [[Daniel Langlois Foundation]] for Art, Science and Technology in Montreal to form the Variable Media Network, a concerted effort to develop a museum-standard, best practice for the collection and preservation of [[new media art]]. Apart from Stringari and Ippolito, other key members of the Variable Media Network included [[Alain Depocas]], Director of the Centre for Research and Documentation, Daniel Langlois Foundation; and Caitlin Jones, former Daniel Langlois Variable Media Preservation Fellow at the Guggenheim Museum.

Around this time similar investigations into the preservation of digital/media art were being led on the West Coast by Richard Rinehart, who published an article on the subject, "The Straw that Broke the Museum's Back? Collecting and Preserving Digital/Media Art for the Next Century",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://switch.sjsu.edu/nextswitch/switch_engine/front/front.php?artc=233|title=The Straw that Broke the Museum's Back? Collecting and Preserving Digital/Media Art for the Next Century|date=June 14, 2000|author=Richard Rinehart|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723084714/http://switch.sjsu.edu/nextswitch/switch_engine/front/front.php?artc=233|archivedate=July 23, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000. Rinehart had also established Conceptual &amp; Intermedia Arts Online (CIAO)&lt;ref name=Avantegarde&gt; [http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/about_bampfa/avantgarde.html Archiving the Avant-Garde]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419010721/http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/about_bampfa/avantgarde.html |date=April 19, 2007 }} &lt;/ref&gt;with Franklin Furnace, the New York-based performance art-grants giving organization and archive/advocate of performance, 'ephemeral' or non-traditional art under the directorship of [[Martha Wilson]].

Members of the Variable Media Network and CIAO subsequently joined forces with other organizations, including [[Rhizome.org]], an affiliate of New York's [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]], for collective preservation endeavors such as Archiving the Avant Garde.&lt;ref name=Avantegarde/&gt; This broader coalition, operating under the rubric Forging the Future,&lt;ref&gt;[http://forging-the-future.com バイク買取＠東京ならここで査定！]&lt;/ref&gt; is managed by the [[Still Water]] lab at the University of Maine and offers free, open-source tools for new media preservation, including the 3rd-generation Variable Media Questionnaire.

In 2002, Timothy Murray founded the [[Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]]. Named after the pioneering critic of the commercialization of mass media, the late Professor Rose Goldsen of Cornell University. The Archive hosts international art work produced on CD-Rom, DVD-Rom, video, digital interfaces, and the internet. Its collection of supporting materials includes unpublished manuscripts and designs, catalogues, monographs, and resource guides to new media art. The curatorial vision emphasizes digital interfaces and artistic experimentation by international, independent artists. Designed as an experimental center of research and creativity, the Goldsen Archive includes materials by individual artists and collaborates on conceptual experimentation and archival strategies with international curatorial and fellowship projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813.001/7761936a|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important initiatives include [[DOCAM]], an international research alliance on the documentation and the conservation of the media arts heritage organized by the Daniel Langlois Foundation, and the International Network for the Conservation of Contemporary Art (INCCA), organized by the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage (ICN).

'''Daud Rahbar''' (1926 – 5 October 2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1048229/scholar-writer-daud-rahbar-passes-away-in-us |title=Scholar, writer Daud Rahbar passes away in US |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a scholar of [[comparative religions]], [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Urdu literature|Urdu]] literature and [[Indian classical music]]. Rahbar is regarded as accomplished essayist, poet,&lt;ref&gt;Husain, Intizar. "Point of View: Dawood Rahbar as a poet" in ''Dawn Magazine''. December 2001&lt;/ref&gt; composer, short story writer, translator, philosopher, contributor to inter-civilization dialogue, musicologist, drummer, singer and guitarist.&lt;ref name="books_amazon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-author=Daud%20Rahbar&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3ADaud%20Rahbar | title=Books by Daud Rahbar | accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He translated his own Urdu works to English, such as ''The Cup of Jamshid: A Collection of Ghazal Poetry'' and then translated the ''[[Letters of Ghalib|Urdu letters of Mirzā Asadu'lldh Khān Ghālib]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Khaled. "Tracking Down Daud Rahbar," in ''The Friday Times'' vol 12, no. 18, 30 June – 6 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

After a teaching career in England, Canada, [[Turkey]] and the United States, he retired as Professor Emeritus of [[Comparative religions]] from [[Boston University]] in 1991.

== Early life ==
Daud Rahbar grew up in [[Model Town, Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] between 1929 and 1949. The town was the first cooperative society in the Indian subcontinent, a suburb based on the design of a Hindu architect, Divan Khem Chand. The town was autonomous from Lahore City's jurisdiction, and sectioned into blocks. Each block was populated by either [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]] or [[Hindus]] (where the Hindus constitute the largest community). He remarked that his close association with Hindus "made the love of Hindu communities a natural condition of [his] soul."{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=87}} His childhood was spent writing poetry (he took the pen name 'Rahbar' at the age of eight), gardening and walking with his father while discussing [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] and [[Persian literature]]. He was an excellent tennis player.

== Family ==
Rahbar's father, Dr. Muhammad Iqbal (1894–1948), was named after [[Sir Muhammad Iqbal]].&lt;ref name="other_iqbal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jul2011-weekly/nos-31-07-2011/lit.htm#3 |title=The other Iqbal |publisher=The News International |author=Mohyeddin, Zia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620235743/http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jul2011-weekly/nos-31-07-2011/lit.htm#3 |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with an [[Master of Arts|M.A]] in [[Arabic]] and was the recipient of a State scholarship from the [[University of Cambridge]]. He studied under Arabist professors [[Edward G. Browne]], [[Reynold A. Nicholson|R.A. Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Ashley Bevan]]. After receiving his PhD, Iqbal was appointed Professor of [[Persian language]] at the [[University of the Punjab]] in 1922 and remained for 26 years. He was later appointed President of [[Oriental College, Lahore]].

Rahbar had five siblings. Rahbar married Sabiha Ahmed on 9 April 1950. The couple had two daughters, Sameera and Anisa. Sabiha's father Aga Ghiassudin Ahmed, was a lawyer and botanist and President of Agricultural College in [[Faisalabad|Lyallpur]] (now [[University of Agriculture, Faisalabad]]). Sabiha was a poet as well, although she never received recognition.

His first cousin, [[Zia Mohyeddin]],&lt;ref name="other_iqbal" /&gt; is a well-known media personality and artist from [[Pakistan]], who played the lead role in ''[[Passage to India]] on Broadway'' and in several British television specials and movies.

== Education ==
Rahbar graduated from the [[Government College, Lahore]] with an M.A in Arabic in 1947. He received the McLeod Research Scholarship and was hired on to teach [[Arabic literature]] at [[Oriental College, Lahore]], where his father was President. In 1949, Rahbar went to [[Cambridge University]] and completed his PhD dissertation entitled ''Studies in the Ethical Doctrine of the Qur'an'' under the supervision of [[Reuben Levy]]. After a short time in [[Lahore]], Rahbar accepted the position of Senior Teaching Fellow at [[McGill University]], Canada, in 1954, at the invitation of [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]]. In 1956 he was appointed to the chair of Urdu and [[Pakistan studies]] at [[Ankara University]], Turkey, where he stayed until 1959. In 1959, he began lecturing in [[Islamic studies]] as well as enrolling in [[Christian theology]] seminars at the [[Hartford Seminary Foundation]], Connecticut, USA.

In 1962, he was appointed Visiting Professor of Urdu and Pakistan studies at [[Hartford Seminary Foundation]] and was awarded tenure from 1962 to 1966. In 1964, he took a two-year leave to teach at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], where he began a systematic study of Indian and Western classical music, concentrating on achieving mastery of Indian classical vocal genres. In that same period, he began writing English poetry with the encouragement of [[David McCord]] and [[Louis Untermeyer]].

In 1967, Rahbar joined the faculty of [[Boston University]] where he taught until his retirement in 1991: initially at the School of Theology and from 1975 onwards at the Department of Religion in the College of Liberal Arts, where he was one of the department's most popular teachers, his courses on eastern religions enrolling hundreds of students each semester.

== Lahore International Islamic Colloquium ==
On 2 January 1958, he presented a paper to the International Islamic Colloquium in Lahore,&lt;ref name="colloquium_lhr"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1958.tb02570.x/abstract | title=The International Islamic Colloquium | author=Dodge, Bayard | journal=The Muslim World | year=1958 | doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1958.tb02570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second of its kind that brought scholars of Islamic subjects together from across the world. Rahbar's paper, entitled ''The Challenge of Muslim Ideas and Social Values to Muslim Society'' produced criticism from conference attendees, to the point that he was not allowed to return to the platform to explain his points. Rahbar maintains that it was "an innocent and mild statement" that he did not perceive to be "radically unorthodox."{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=303}} The opposing members of the conference asked the paper to be withdrawn later that day, but eventually agreed that an amended edition should be written. In the October 1958 issue of ''The Muslim World'',&lt;ref name="colloquium_lhr" /&gt; the paper was published with an introductory note outlining the objections of the council and the amendments made thereafter. In his introductory note, Rahbar explained that much of the controversy was due to the inherent brevity of the statements. Therefore, he hoped that the expanded treatment would clarify those objections raised at the colloquium.

== Contributor to inter-civilizational and interfaith dialogue ==
Rahbar was raised as Muslim but converted to Christianity as a professor at [[Ankara University]]. He records in his memoir that he was baptised as a Christian by a Protestant United States Air Force Chaplain, Meredith Smith, in Ankara, on 6 July 1959.{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=385}} Rahbar noted that his conversion was not a result of the 1958 Colloquium, but was more closely related to the memories of [[Partition of India]] and the then environment in Turkey. He stated that the "categorical mercy" of the [[New Testament]] and the "Christian world seemed to...offer a spiritual home"{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=343}} from his growing pessimism. A couple of months later, Rahbar wrote ''A letter to Christian and Muslim Friends'' as a confession of faith.

This confession, however, was not fully accepted by some Muslim intellectuals. [[Khaled Ahmed (journalist)|Khaled Ahmed]], a Pakistani political and cultural analyst, stated that Rahbar's supposed conversion to Christianity was nothing more than a "myth created in Lahore"&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Khaled. "Tracking Down Daud Rahbar," in ''The Friday Times'' vol 12, no. 18, 30 June – 6 July 2000. Khaled Ahmed has republished this article in his book ''Pakistan: Behind the Ideological Mask (Facts about Great Men we don't want to know)'', p. 176-186. Lahore: Vanguard, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; by those who did not fully understand "what he really stood for."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ahmed, Khaled. 30 June – 6 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained  that Rahbar's "entire career has been a defence of Islam"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and that "anyone who has read his ''Kalchar Kay Ruhani Anasir'' (Spiritual Elements of Culture)"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; will no longer need to question his faith, but rather realise that "he is tolerant of all faiths because he known the essence of them all."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His continued respect and appreciation for the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and [[Islam]] is demonstrated in his published writings.&lt;ref&gt;Rahbar, Daud. "Muhammad and All Men." In {{cite book|author=John Robert Nelson|title=No man is alien: Essays on the Unity of Mankind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdEUAAAAIAAJ|pp=64–84|year=1971|publisher=Brill Archive|id=GGKEY:P577BDY9T76 |location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the published version of his dissertation, ''God of Justice: A Study in the Ethical Doctrine of the Qur'an'' published by E. J. Brill in 1960, Rahbar advanced the position that God's mercy is always subordinate to justice, so mercy is only available to believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God, Muhammad and the unbelievers: a Qur'anic study |last=Marshall |first=David |pages=79–85 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-7007-1086-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to poetry and classical music theory &amp; composition ==
Throughout his academic career, Rahbar continued to make significant contributions to [[Urdu literature]] and music. He performed in concerts and poetry readings both in the United States and Pakistan. His love was for classical South Asian music, particularly the Agra School. His flair for poetic expression is infused throughout his autobiography, ''Memories and Meanings.'' "Music has been my solace for the last forty years," he wrote. "Without it I perhaps could not have been a friend to myself and to others. Music and poetry have made life easier for me everywhere and at every stage of my adult life.".{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=454}} His published works in the field of [[Urdu literature]] include:

* ''Salaam o Payaam.'' Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 1996 – Letters to his friends and associates. Subsequent volumes were published in 2004 and 2009.
* ''Kalcar ke Ruhani Anasir.'' Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 1998 – Culture and Religion.
* ''Pragandah Taba' Log.'' Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2000 – Short stories.

== Death ==
Daud Rahbar died at a nursing home in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]] on 5 October 2013.&lt;ref name="ppf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pakistanpressfoundation.org/obituaries/73245/scholar-writer-daud-rahbar-passes-away-in-us/ | title=Scholar, writer Daud Rahbar passes away in US | publisher=Pakistan Press Foundation | accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37086">The '''Democratic National Committee cyber attacks''' took place in 2015 and 2016, in which [[hacker (computer security)|computer hackers]] infiltrated the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) [[computer network]], leading to a [[data breach]]. Some [[cybersecurity]] experts, as well as the U.S. government, stated that the [[cyberespionage]] was the work of Russian intelligence agencies.

Forensic evidence analyzed by several cybersecurity firms, [[CrowdStrike]], [[Fidelis Security Systems (company)|Fidelis]], and [[Mandiant]] (or [[FireEye]]), strongly indicates that two [[Russian Federation|Russian]] intelligence agencies infiltrated the DNC computer systems. The American [[cybersecurity]] firm CrowdStrike, which removed the hacking programs, revealed a history of encounters with both groups and had already named them, calling one of  them [[Cozy Bear]] and the other [[Fancy Bear]], names which are used in the media.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;{{cite news|last=Rid|first=Thomas|title=All Signs Point to Russia Being Behind the DNC Hack|newspaper=Motherboard|publisher=Vice Media|date=July 25, 2016|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=sanger/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanger |first1=David E. |last2=Schmitt |first2=Eric |date=July 26, 2016 |title=Spy Agency Consensus Grows That Russia Hacked D.N.C. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/spy-agency-consensus-grows-that-russia-hacked-dnc.html |newspaper=New York Times|access-date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2016, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] told U.S. legislators the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] concluded Russia conducted the [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|cyberattacks and other operations during the 2016 U.S. election]] to assist [[Donald Trump]] in winning the presidency.&lt;ref name=secretcia /&gt; Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that specific individuals tied to the Russian government provided WikiLeaks with the stolen emails from the DNC, as well as stolen emails from [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign chairman, who was also the target of [[Podesta emails|a cyberattack]].&lt;ref name=secretcia /&gt; These intelligence organizations additionally concluded Russia hacked the [[Republican National Committee]] (R.N.C.) as well as the D.N.C., but chose not to leak information obtained from the R.N.C.&lt;ref name=russiahackedrepublican /&gt;

== Cyber attacks and responsibility==
Cyber attacks that successfully penetrated the DNC computing system began in 2015. Attacks by "Cozy Bear" began in the summer of 2015. Attacks by "Fancy Bear" began in April 2016. It was after the "Fancy Bear" group began their activities that the compromised system became apparent. The groups were presumed to have been spying on communications, stealing [[opposition research]] on [[Donald Trump]], as well as reading all [[email]] and chats. Both were finally identified by CrowdStrike in May 2016. Both groups of intruders were successfully expelled from the DNC systems within hours after detection. These attacks are considered to be part of a group of recent attacks targeting U.S. government departments and several political organizations, including 2016 campaign organizations.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=sanger/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On July 22, 2016, a person or entity going by the moniker "[[Guccifer 2.0]]" claimed on a [[WordPress]]-hosted blog to have been acting alone in hacking the DNC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Uchill|first1=Joe|title=Evidence mounts linking DNC email hacker to Russia|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/289296-guccifer-20-used-russian-language-vpns-to-leak-documents|website=The Hill|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/288883-wikileaks-posts-20000-dnc-emails|title=WikiLeaks posts 20,000 DNC emails|last=Uchill|first=Joe|date=2016-07-22|website=[[The Hill (newspaper)]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to send significant amounts of stolen electronic DNC documents to [[WikiLeaks]].

According to separate reports in the ''New York Times'' and the ''Washington Post'', [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence agencies]] have concluded with "high confidence"&lt;ref name="SpyAgencyConsensus"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spy Agency Consensus Grows That Russia Hacked D.N.C.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/spy-agency-consensus-grows-that-russia-hacked-dnc.html|work=|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC.&lt;ref name="SpyAgencyConsensus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoMaster"&gt;Ellen Nakashima, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/is-there-a-russian-master-plan-to-install-trump-in-the-white-house-some-intelligence-officials-are-skeptical/2016/07/27/788accf8-5428-11e6-bbf5-957ad17b4385_story.html Is there a Russian master plan to install Trump in the White House?

President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a discussion about [[computer security]] issues, which took place as a side segment during the [[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit|then-ongoing G20 summit]] in China in September 2016. Obama said Russian hacking stopped after his warning to Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/obama-putin-232754 |title=Obama says he told Putin to ‘cut it out’ on Russia hacking |date=December 16, 2016|newspaper=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a joint statement on October 7, 2016, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that the US intelligence community is confident that the Russian government directed the breaches and the release of the obtained or allegedly obtained material in an attempt to "… interfere with the US election process."&lt;ref name="Nakashima"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|title=US government officially accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-government-officially-accuses-russia-of-hacking-campaign-to-influence-elections/2016/10/07/4e0b9654-8cbf-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ackerman_Thielman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Spencer|last2=Thielman|first2=Sam|title=US officially accuses Russia of hacking DNC and interfering with election|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election|website=The Guardian|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/us-blames-russia-for-targeting-election-systems/index.html|title=US accuses Russia of trying to interfere with 2016 election|last=CNN|first=Evan Perez and Theodore Schleifer|website=CNN|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
As is common among Russian intelligence services, both groups used similar hacking tools and strategies. It is believed that neither group was aware of the other. Although this is antithetical to American [[espionage|computer intelligence]] methods, for fear of undermining or defeating [[American intelligence|intelligence operation]]s of the other, this has been common practice in the Russian intelligence community since 2004.&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecfr&gt;

Both are believed connected to the Russian intelligence services. Also, both access resources and demonstrate levels of proficiency matching nation-state capabilities.

"Cozy Bear" has in the past year infiltrated unclassified computer systems of the [[White House]], the [[U.S. State Department]], and the [[U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. According to [[CrowdStrike]], other targeted sectors include''':''' Defense, Energy, [[Mining industry|Mining]], Financial, Insurance, Legal, Manufacturing, Media, [[Think tank]]s, Pharmaceutical, [[Research]] and [[Technology]] industries as well as universities. "Cozy Bear" observed attacks have occurred in [[Western Europe]], Brazil, [[China]], Japan, Mexico, [[New Zealand]], South Korea, [[Turkey]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;

"Fancy Bear" has been operating since the mid-2000s. [[CrowdStrike]] reported targeting has included [[Aerospace]], Defense, Energy, Government and the Media industries. "Fancy Bear" intrusions have occurred in [[United States]], Western Europe, Brazil, [[Canada]], China, [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]], [[Iran]], Japan,  [[Malaysia]] and [[South Korea]]. Targeted [[defense ministries]] and military organizations parallel Russian Federation government interests. This may indicate affiliation with the [[Main Intelligence Directorate]] (GRU, a Russian military intelligence service). Specifically, "Fancy Bear" has been linked to intrusions into the [[German Bundestag]] and France’s [[TV5 Monde]] (television station) in April 2015.&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt; [[SecureWorks]], a cybersecurity   firm headquartered in the United States, concluded that from March 2015 to May 2016, the "Fancy Bear" target list included not merely the DNC, but tens of thousands of foes of Putin and the Kremlin in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, and Syria. Only a handful of Republicans were targeted, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  | first =  | title = Russian hackers pursued Putin foes, not just U.S. Democrats | url = https://www.staradvertiser.com/2017/11/01/breaking-news/hit-list-exposes-russian-hacking-beyond-u-s-elections/ | work = [[Star-Advertiser]] | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = November 1, 2017 | accessdate = November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hacking the DNC ==
On January 25, 2018 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] newspaper [[de Volkskrant]] and TV program [[Nieuwsuur]] reported that in 2014 the Dutch Intelligence agency [[General Intelligence and Security Service]] (AIVD) successfully infiltrated the computers of [[Cozy Bear]] and observed the hacking of the head office of the DNC and subsequently The White House and were the first to alert the [[National Security Agency]] about the cyber-intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2213767-dutch-intelligence-first-to-alert-u-s-about-russian-hack-of-democratic-party.html Dutch intelligence first to alert U.S. about Russian hack of Democratic Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cozy Bear" had access to DNC systems since the summer of 2015; and "Fancy Bear", since April 2016. There was no evidence of collaboration or knowledge of the other's presence within the system. Rather, the "two Russian espionage groups compromised the same systems and engaged separately in the theft of identical credentials".&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecfr/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr&gt;

at various times and in various DNC systems. "Fancy Bear" employed [[X Agent (spyware)|X Agent]] malware, which enabled distant [[command (computing)|command execution]], [[file transfer|transmissions of files]] and [[keylogging]], as well as the "X-Tunnel" malware.

DNC leaders became aware of the compromise in April 2016. These attacks broadly reflect Russian government interest in the U.S. political system, as well as political leaders' policies, tendencies and  proclivities while assessing possible beneficial outcomes. The attacks also broadly reflect Russian government interest in the strategies, policies, and practices of the U.S. Government. This also globally reflects foreign governments' interest in ascertaining information on Donald Trump as a new entry into U.S. political leadership roles, in contrast to information likely to have been garnered over the decades pertaining to the Clintons.&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;

The DNC commissioned the cybersecurity company, [[CrowdStrike]], to defeat the intrusions. Its [[Chief Technology Officer]], [[Dmitri Alperovitch]], who is also a cybersecurity expert, stated:

{{quote|CrowdStrike stands fully by its analysis and findings identifying two separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries present in the DNC network in May 2016[...] We've had lots of experience with both of these actors attempting to target our customers in the past and know them well. In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis. Their [[tradecraft]] is superb, [[operational security]] second to none and the extensive usage of 'living-off-the-land' techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter.&lt;ref name=alperovitch/&gt;}}

Other cybersecurity firms, [[Fidelis Cybersecurity]] and [[FireEye]], independently reviewed the malware and came to the same conclusion as [[CrowdStrike]]&amp;mdash;that expert Russian hacking groups were responsible for the breach.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kan, [http://www.computerworld.com/article/3086314/security/russian-hackers-were-behind-dnc-breach-says-fidelis-cybersecurity.html Russian hackers were behind DNC breach, says Fidelis Cybersecurity], [[International Data Group|IDG News Service]]/''[[ComputerWorld]]'' (June 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, US authorities identified 6 Russian individuals who conducted the hack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-hackers/u-s-authorities-identify-six-russian-officials-in-dnc-hack-wsj-idUSKBN1D21MI|title=U.S. authorities identify six Russian officials in DNC hack: WSJ|date=2 Nov 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in December 2016 the Russian government arrested [[Mikhailov case|Sergei Mikhailov]], a high ranking government cyber-spy, Ruslan Stoyanov, a private sector cyber-security expert, Georgy Fomchenkov, a former government cyber-spy, and Dmitry Dokuchaev, a Mikhailov associate and charged them with aiding U.S. intelligence agencies which the New York Times associated with the DNC hacking.&lt;ref&gt;Shane, Scott; Sanger, David E.; and Kramer, Andrew E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1250">'''Departure resistance''' is a quality of an [[aircraft]] which enables it to remain in controlled flight and resist entering potentially dangerous less-controlled maneuvers such as [[spin (flight)|spin]].

Depending on its design, an aircraft may be more or less likely to leave (depart from) controlled flight when the [[aircraft pilot|pilot]] applies extreme control inputs. Good departure resistance characteristics allow the pilot to remain in control of the aircraft in such situations.

Departure resistance is considered to contribute more towards flight safety than ''departure recovery''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peter2000.co.uk/aviation/misc/3-105960-Cirrusstall-spinreport.pdf Cirrus Design SR 20 Equivalent of safety for Spin requirement]&lt;/ref&gt; Departure recovery is the ability of an aircraft to return to controlled flight once in a certain uncontrolled maneuver. Being able to [[Spin_(flight)#Entry and recovery|recover from spin]] is an example of departure recovery.

'''Directed evolution''' ('''DE''') is a method used in [[protein engineering]] that mimics the process of [[natural selection]] to steer [[proteins]] or [[nucleic acid]]s toward a user-defined goal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lutz S | title = Beyond directed evolution--semi-rational protein engineering and design | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 734–43 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20869867 | pmc = 2982887 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2010.08.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of subjecting a [[gene]] to iterative rounds of [[mutagenesis]] (creating a library of variants), selection (expressing those variants and isolating members with the desired function), and amplification (generating a template for the next round). It can be performed ''[[in vivo]]''(in living organisms), or ''[[in vitro]]'' (in cells or free in solution). Directed evolution is used both for [[protein engineering]] as an alternative to rationally designing modified proteins, as well as studies of fundamental [[evolution|evolutionary principles]] in a controlled, laboratory environment.

== History ==
Directed evolution has its origins in the 1960s&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cobb RE, Chao R, Zhao H | title = Directed Evolution: Past, Present and Future | journal = AIChE Journal.

Early [[phage display]] techniques in the 1980s allowed targeting of mutations and selection to a single protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith GP | title = Filamentous fusion phage: novel expression vectors that display cloned antigens on the virion surface | journal = Science | volume = 228 | issue = 4705 | pages = 1315–7 | date = June 1985 | pmid = 4001944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled selection of enhanced [[binding protein]]s, but was not yet compatible with selection for catalytic activity of [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chen|first=Keqin|last2=Arnold|first2=Frances H. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1991|title=Enzyme Engineering for Nonaqueous Solvents: Random Mutagenesis to Enhance Activity of Subtilisin E in Polar Organic Media|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1191-1073|journal=Bio/Technology|language=En|volume=9|issue=11|pages=1073–1077|doi=10.1038/nbt1191-1073|issn=0733-222X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods to evolve enzymes were developed in the 1990s and brought the technique to a wider scientific audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Eun-Sung|date=2008-11-27|title=Directed Evolution: A Historical Exploration into an Evolutionary Experimental System of Nanobiotechnology, 1965–2006|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-008-9108-9|journal=Minerva|language=en|volume=46|issue=4|pages=463–484|doi=10.1007/s11024-008-9108-9|issn=0026-4695}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field rapidly expanded with new methods for making libraries of gene variants and for screening their activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Packer MS, Liu DR | title = Methods for the directed evolution of proteins | language = En | journal = Nature Reviews.

==Principles==

[[File:DE landscape.png|thumb|left|300px|Directed evolution is analogous to climbing a hill on a '[[fitness landscape]]' where elevation represents the desired property. Each round of selection samples mutants on all sides of the starting template (1) and selects the mutant with the highest elevation, thereby climbing the hill. This is repeated until a local summit is reached (2).]]

Directed evolution is a mimic of the natural evolution cycle in a laboratory setting. Evolution requires three things to happen: [[Genetic diversity|variation]] between replicators, that the variation causes [[Fitness (biology)|fitness differences]] upon which selection acts, and that this variation is [[heritability|heritable]]. In DE, a single gene is evolved by iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection or screening, and amplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Voigt CA, Kauffman S, Wang ZG | title = Rational evolutionary design: the theory of in vitro protein evolution | journal = Advances in Protein Chemistry | volume = 55 | pages = 79–160 | date = 2000 | pmid = 11050933 | doi = 10.1016/s0065-3233(01)55003-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rounds of these steps are typically repeated, using the best variant from one round as the template for the next to achieve stepwise improvements.

The likelihood of success in a directed evolution experiment is directly related to the total library size, as evaluating more mutants increases the chances of finding one with the desired properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalby PA | title = Strategy and success for the directed evolution of enzymes | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 473–80 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21684150 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2011.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generating variation===

[[File:DE Mutations.png|thumb|300px|Starting [[gene]] (left) and library of variants (right). [[Point mutations]] change single nucleotides. [[indel|Insertions and deletions]] add or remove sections of DNA. [[Genetic recombination|Shuffling]] recombines segments of two (or more) similar genes.]]

The first step in performing a cycle of directed evolution is the generation of a library of variant genes. The [[sequence space]] for random sequence is vast (10&lt;sup&gt;130&lt;/sup&gt; possible sequences for a 100 [[amino acid]] protein) and extremely sparsely populated by functional proteins. Neither experimental,&lt;ref name="Lipovsek D 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lipovsek D, Plückthun A | title = In-vitro protein evolution by ribosome display and mRNA display | journal = Journal of Immunological Methods | volume = 290 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 51–67 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15261571 | doi = 10.1016/j.jim.2004.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nor natural&lt;ref name="Dryden DT 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dryden DT, Thomson AR, White JH | title = How much of protein sequence space has been explored by life on Earth? | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 5 | issue = 25 | pages = 953–6 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18426772 | pmc = 2459213 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2008.0085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2016}} evolution can ever get close to sampling so many sequences. Of course, natural evolution samples variant sequences close to functional protein sequences and this is imitated in DE by mutagenising an already functional gene.
Some calculations suggest it is entirely feasible that for all practical (i.e. functional and structural) purposes, protein sequence space has been fully explored during the course of evolution of life on Earth.&lt;ref name="Dryden DT 2008"/&gt;

The starting gene can be mutagenised by random [[point mutations]] (by chemical mutagens or error prone [[PCR]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuchner O, Arnold FH | title = Directed evolution of enzyme catalysts | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 523–30 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9418307 | doi = 10.1016/s0167-7799(97)01138-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sen S, Venkata Dasu V, Mandal B | title = Developments in directed evolution for improving enzyme functions | journal = Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology | volume = 143 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–23 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18057449 | doi = 10.1007/s12010-007-8003-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[indel|insertions and deletions]] (by transposons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones DD | title = Triplet nucleotide removal at random positions in a target gene: the tolerance of TEM-1 beta-lactamase to an amino acid deletion | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 33 | issue = 9 | pages = e80 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15897323 | pmc = 1129029 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gni077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic recombination|Gene recombination]] can be mimicked by [[DNA shuffling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stemmer WP | title = Rapid evolution of a protein in vitro by DNA shuffling | journal = Nature | volume = 370 | issue = 6488 | pages = 389–91 | date = August 1994 | pmid = 8047147 | doi = 10.1038/370389a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crameri A, Raillard SA, Bermudez E, Stemmer WP | title = DNA shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolution | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = 6664 | pages = 288–91 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9440693 | doi = 10.1038/34663 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of several sequences (usually of more than 70% homology) to jump into regions of sequence space between the shuffled parent genes. Finally, specific regions of a gene can be systematically randomised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reetz MT, Carballeira JD | title = Iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM) for rapid directed evolution of functional enzymes | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 891–903 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17446890 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2007.72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a more focused approach based on structure and function knowledge. Depending on the method, the library generated will vary in the [[Distribution of fitness effects|proportion of functional variants]] it contains. Even if an organism is used to express the gene of interest, by mutagenising only that gene, the rest of the organism’s genome remains the same and can be ignored for the evolution experiment (to the extent of providing a constant genetic environment).

===Detecting fitness differences===
The majority of [[mutation]]s are deleterious and so libraries of mutants tend to mostly have variants with reduced [[catalytic activity|activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartl DL | title = What can we learn from fitness landscapes? | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 21 | pages = 51–7 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25444121 | pmc = 4254422 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2014.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a high-throughput [[assay]] is vital for measuring activity to find the rare variants with beneficial mutations that improve the desired properties. Two main categories of method exist for isolating functional variants. '''Selection''' systems directly couple protein function to survival of the gene, whereas '''screening''' systems individually assay each variant and allow a quantitative threshold to be set for sorting a variant or population of variants of a desired activity. Both selection and screening can be performed in living cells (''in vivo'' evolution) or performed directly on the [[protein]] or [[RNA]] without any cells (''in vitro'' evolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Badran AH, Liu DR | title = In vivo continuous directed evolution | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 24 | pages = 1–10 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25461718 | pmc = 4308500 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2014.09.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar A, Singh S | title = Directed evolution: tailoring biocatalysts for industrial applications | journal = Critical Reviews in Biotechnology | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 365–78 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 22985113 | doi = 10.3109/07388551.2012.716810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During ''in vivo'' evolution, each cell (usually [[bacteria]] or [[yeast]]) is [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]] with a [[plasmid]] containing a different member of the variant library. In this way, only the gene of interest differs between the cells, with all other genes being kept the same. The cells express the protein either in their [[cytoplasm]] or [[plasma membrane|surface]] where its function can be tested. This format has the advantage of selecting for properties in a cellular environment, which is useful when the evolved protein or RNA is to be used in living organisms. When performed without cells, DE involves using [[In vitro compartmentalization#In Vitro transcription.2Ftranslation|''in vitro'' transcription translation]] to produce proteins or RNA free in solution or compartmentalised in [[In vitro compartmentalization|artificial microdroplets]]. This method has the benefits of being more versatile in the selection conditions (e.g. temperature, solvent), and can express proteins that would be toxic to cells. Furthermore, ''in vitro'' evolution experiments can generate far larger libraries (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) because the library DNA need not be [[Transformation (genetics)|inserted]] into cells (often a limiting step).

====Selection====
Selection for [[Protein binding|binding activity]] is conceptually simple. The target molecule is immobilised on a solid support, a library of variant proteins is flowed over it, poor binders are washed away, and the remaining bound variants recovered to isolate their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Willats WG | title = Phage display: practicalities and prospects | journal = Plant Molecular Biology | volume = 50 | issue = 6 | pages = 837–54 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12516857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Binding of an enzyme to immobilised covalent [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] has been also used as an attempt to isolate active catalysts. This approach, however, only selects for single catalytic turnover and is not a good model of substrate binding or true substrate reactivity. If an enzyme activity can be made necessary for cell survival, either by synthesizing a vital metabolite, or destroying a toxin, then cell survival is a function of enzyme activity.&lt;ref name="Leemhuis H 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leemhuis H, Stein V, Griffiths AD, Hollfelder F | title = New genotype-phenotype linkages for directed evolution of functional proteins | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 472–8 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16043338 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2005.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verhoeven KD, Altstadt OC, Savinov SN | title = Intracellular detection and evolution of site-specific proteases using a genetic selection system | journal = Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology | volume = 166 | issue = 5 | pages = 1340–54 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22270548 | doi = 10.1007/s12010-011-9522-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such systems are generally only limited in throughput by the [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] efficiency of cells. They are also less expensive and labour-intensive than screening, however they are typically difficult to engineer, prone to artefacts and give no information on the [[Distribution of fitness effects|range of activities]] present in the library.

====Screening====
An alternative to selection is a screening system. Each variant gene is individually [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|expressed]] and [[assay]]ed to quantitatively measure the activity (most often by a [[Coloured|colourgenic]] or [[fluorogenic]] product). The variants are then ranked and the experimenter decides which variants to use as templates for the next round of DE. Even the most high throughput assays usually have lower coverage than selection methods but give the advantage of producing detailed information on each one of the screened variants. This disaggregated data can also be used to characterise the distribution of activities in libraries which is not possible in simple selection systems. Screening systems, therefore, have advantages when it comes to experimentally characterising adaptive evolution and fitness landscapes.

===Ensuring heredity===
[[File:DE Linkage.png|thumb|350px|An [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|expressed protein]] can either be [[covalent bond|covalently linked]] to its [[gene]] (as in [[mRNA]], left) or compartmentalized with it ([[Cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[Microfluidics|artificial compartments]], right). Either way ensures that the gene can be isolated based on the activity of the encoded protein.]]

When functional proteins have been isolated, it is necessary that their genes are too, therefore a [[heredity|genotype-phenotype]] link is required.&lt;ref name="Leemhuis H 2005"/&gt; This can be covalent, such as [[mRNA display]] where the [[mRNA]] gene is linked to the protein at the end of translation by puromycin.&lt;ref name="Lipovsek D 2004"/&gt; Alternatively the protein and its gene can be co-localised by compartmentalisation in living cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen AW, Daugherty PS | title = Evolutionary optimization of fluorescent proteins for intracellular FRET | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 355–60 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15696158 | doi = 10.1038/nbt1066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or emulsion droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaerli Y, Hollfelder F | title = The potential of microfluidic water-in-oil droplets in experimental biology | journal = Molecular bioSystems | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 1392–404 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20023716 | doi = 10.1039/b907578j }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene sequences isolated are then amplified by PCR or by transformed host bacteria. Either the single best sequence, or a pool of sequences can be used as the template for the next round of mutagenesis. The repeated cycles of Diversification-Selection-Amplification generate protein variants adapted to the applied selection pressures.

==Comparison to rational protein design==

===Advantages of directed evolution===
[[Protein design|Rational design]] of a protein relies on an in-depth knowledge of the [[protein structure]], as well as its [[catalytic mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marshall SA, Lazar GA, Chirino AJ, Desjarlais JR | title = Rational design and engineering of therapeutic proteins | journal = Drug Discovery Today | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 212–21 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12634013 | doi = 10.1016/s1359-6446(03)02610-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson CJ | title = Rational protein design: developing next-generation biological therapeutics and nanobiotechnological tools | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Nanomedicine and Nanobiotechnology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 330–41 | date = 27 October 2014 | pmid = 25348497 | doi = 10.1002/wnan.1310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific changes are then made by [[site-directed mutagenesis]] in an attempt to change the function of the protein. A drawback of this is that even when the structure and mechanism of action of the protein are well known, the change due to mutation is still difficult to predict. Therefore, an advantage of DE is that there is no need to understand the mechanism of the desired activity or how mutations would affect it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giger L, Caner S, Obexer R, Kast P, Baker D, Ban N, Hilvert D | title = Evolution of a designed retro-aldolase leads to complete active site remodeling | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 494–8 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23748672 | pmc = 3720730 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations of directed evolution===
A restriction of directed evolution is that a high-throughput assay is required in order to measure the effects of a large number of different random mutations. This can require extensive research and development before it can be used for directed evolution. Additionally, such assays are often highly specific to monitoring a particular activity and so are not transferable to new DE experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bornscheuer UT, Pohl M | title = Improved biocatalysts by directed evolution and rational protein design | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–43 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11282339 | doi = 10.1016/s1367-5931(00)00182-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, selecting for improvement in the assayed function simply generates improvements in the assayed function. To understand how these improvements are achieved, the properties of the evolving enzyme have to be measured. Improvement of the assayed activity can be due to improvements in enzyme catalytic activity or enzyme concentration. There is also no guarantee that improvement on one substrate will improve activity on another. This is particularly important when the desired activity cannot be directly screened or selected for and so a ‘proxy’ substrate is used. DE can lead to evolutionary specialisation to the proxy without improving the desired activity. Consequently, choosing appropriate screening or selection conditions is vital for successful DE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52400248|title=Directed enzyme evolution: screening and selection methods|last=Arnold|first=Frances|last2=Georgiou|first2=George|date=2003|publisher=Humana Press|others=|year=|isbn=9781588292865|location=Totowa, N.J.|pages=|oclc=52400248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinatorial approaches===
Combined, 'semi-rational' approaches are being investigated to address the limitations of both rational design and directed evolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldsmith M 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldsmith M, Tawfik DS | title = Directed enzyme evolution: beyond the low-hanging fruit | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 406–12 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22579412 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2012.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beneficial mutations are rare, so large numbers of random mutants have to be screened to find improved variants. 'Focused libraries' concentrate on randomising regions thought to be richer in beneficial mutations for the mutagenesis step of DE. A focused library contains fewer variants than a traditional random mutagenesis library and so does not require such high-throughput screening.

Creating a focused library requires some knowledge of which residues in the structure to mutate. For example, knowledge of the [[active site]] of an enzyme may allow just the residues known to interact with the  [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]] to be randomised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen MM, Snow CD, Vizcarra CL, Mayo SL, Arnold FH | title = Comparison of random mutagenesis and semi-rational designed libraries for improved cytochrome P450 BM3-catalyzed hydroxylation of small alkanes | journal = Protein Engineering, Design &amp; Selection | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 171–8 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22334757 | doi = 10.1093/protein/gzs004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Acevedo-Rocha CG, Hoebenreich S, Reetz MT | title = Iterative saturation mutagenesis: a powerful approach to engineer proteins by systematically simulating Darwinian evolution | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 1179 | pages = 103–28 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25055773 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4939-1053-3_7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, knowledge of which protein regions are [[Segregating site|variable]] in nature can guide mutagenesis in just those regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jochens H, Bornscheuer UT | title = Natural diversity to guide focused directed evolution | journal = Chembiochem | volume = 11 | issue = 13 | pages = 1861–6 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20680978 | doi = 10.1002/cbic.201000284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jochens H, Aerts D, Bornscheuer UT | title = Thermostabilization of an esterase by alignment-guided focussed directed evolution | journal = Protein Engineering, Design &amp; Selection | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages = 903–9 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20947674 | doi = 10.1093/protein/gzq071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein engineering===

As a protein engineering tool, DE has been most successful in three areas:

# Improving [[protein stability]] for biotechnological use at high temperatures or in harsh solvents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gatti-Lafranconi P, Natalello A, Rehm S, Doglia SM, Pleiss J, Lotti M | title = Evolution of stability in a cold-active enzyme elicits specificity relaxation and highlights substrate-related effects on temperature adaptation | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 395 | issue = 1 | pages = 155–66 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19850050 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2009.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao H, Arnold FH | title = Directed evolution converts subtilisin E into a functional equivalent of thermitase | journal = Protein Engineering | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–53 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 10065710 | doi = 10.1093/protein/12.1.47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution studies===
The study of natural [[evolution]] is traditionally based on extant organisms and their genes. However, research is fundamentally limited by the lack of [[fossil]]s (and particularly the lack of [[ancient DNA]] sequences)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pääbo S, Poinar H, Serre D, Jaenicke-Despres V, Hebler J, Rohland N, Kuch M, Krause J, Vigilant L, Hofreiter M | title = Genetic analyses from ancient DNA | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 645–79 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15568989 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.37.110801.143214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Höss M, Jaruga P, Zastawny TH, Dizdaroglu M, Pääbo S | title = DNA damage and DNA sequence retrieval from ancient tissues | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 1304–7 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8614634 | pmc = 145783 | doi = 10.1093/nar/24.7.1304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and incomplete knowledge of ancient environmental conditions.

DE allows control of [[selection pressure]], [[mutation rate]] and [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] (both the [[abiotic component|abiotic environment]] such as temperature, and the biotic environment, such as other genes in the organism). Additionally, there is a complete record of all evolutionary intermediate genes.

[[File:Paris July 2011-30.jpg|thumb|The [[Arc de Triomphe]] of the [[Place de l'Étoile]], one of the most famous example of Empire architecture, commissioned in 1806 after the victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon|Emperor Napoleon I]]]]
The '''Empire style''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃.piːʁ}}, ''style Empire'') is an early-nineteenth-century [[design]] movement in [[architecture]], [[furniture]], other [[decorative arts]], and the [[visual arts]], representing the second phase of [[Neoclassicism]]. It flourished between 1800 and 1815 during the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and the [[First French Empire]] periods, although its life span lasted until the late-1820s. From France it spread into much of Europe and the United States. 

The style originated in and takes its name from the rule of the Emperor [[Napoleon I]] in the [[First French Empire]], when it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The previous fashionable style in France had been the [[Directoire style]], a more austere and minimalist form of Neoclassicism, that replaced the [[Louis XVI style]].  The Empire style brought a full return to ostentatious richness.  The style corresponds somewhat to the [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal style]] in the United States, and the [[Regency style]] in Britain. 

==History==
[[File:Versailles Grand Trianon Napoleon's Chamber.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's bedchamber in the [[Grand Trianon]], [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] epitomizes the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical style]] of the [[First French Empire]]]]

The style developed and elaborated the Directoire style of the immediately preceding period, which aimed at a simpler, but still elegant evocation of the virtues of the [[Ancient Roman Republic]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[stoicism|stoic]] virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. ''Conventionels'' saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after [[Brutus]], [[Solon]] and [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] as antique rituals.  Even the chairs in which the committee of ''Salut Publique'' sat were made on antique models devised by David. ...In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Honour|1977|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Empire style "turned to the florid opulence of Imperial Rome. The abstemious severity of [[Doric order|Doric]] was replaced by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] richness and splendour".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honour|1977|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two French architects, [[Charles Percier]] and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Pierre Fontaine]], were together the creators of the French Empire style. The two had studied in [[Rome]] and in the 1790s became leading furniture designers in [[Paris]], where they received many commissions from Napoleon and other statesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fredlund |first=Jane |year=2008 |title=Stilguiden: möbler &amp; inredning 1700–2000 |edition=2nd |location=Stockholm |publisher=Prisma |page=108 |oclc=234047178 |isbn=9789151849874 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture of the Empire style was based on elements of the [[Roman Empire]] and its many archaeological treasures, which had been rediscovered starting in the eighteenth century.  The preceding Louis XVI and [[Directoire (style)|Directoire]] styles employed straighter, simpler designs compared to the [[Rococo]] style of the eighteenth century.  Empire designs strongly influenced the contemporary American [[Federal style]] (such as design of the [[United States Capitol]] building), and both were forms of [[propaganda]] through architecture.  It was a style of the people, not ostentatious but sober and evenly balanced.  The style was considered to have "liberated" and "enlightened" architecture just as Napoleon "liberated" the peoples of Europe with his [[Napoleonic Code]].
[[File:Église de la Madeleine 3753x3156.jpg|left|thumb|[[Église de la Madeleine]] in [[Paris]], a Temple to the Glory of Napoleon's [[Grande Armée]]]]
The Empire period was popularized by the inventive designs of [[Percier and Fontaine]], Napoleon's architects for [[Château de Malmaison|Malmaison]].  The designs drew for inspiration on symbols and ornaments borrowed from the glorious ancient Greek and Roman empires.  Buildings typically had simple timber frames and box-like constructions, [[wood veneer|veneer]]ed in expensive [[mahogany]] imported from the [[colonies]]. Biedermeier furniture also used [[ebony]] details, originally due to financial constraints. [[Ormolu]] details (gilded bronze furniture mounts and embellishments) displayed a high level of craftsmanship.

[[File:View to Kazan Cathedral by Ivan Smelov.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]

General Bernadotte, later to become King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Karl Johan]] of Sweden and Norway, introduced the Napoleonic style to Sweden, where it became known under his own name. The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared from other parts of Europe. France paid some of its debts to Sweden in ormolu bronzes instead of money, leading to a vogue for crystal [[chandeliers]] with bronze from France and crystal from Sweden.

After Napoleon lost power, the Empire style continued to be in favour for many decades, with minor adaptations.  There was a revival of the style in the last half of the nineteenth century in France, again at the beginning of the twentieth century, and again in the 1980s.

The most famous Empire-style structures in France are the grand neoclassical [[Arc de Triomphe|Arc de Triomphe of Place de l'Étoile]], [[Place du Carrousel#The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel|Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]], [[Vendôme column]], and [[Église de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]], which were built in Paris to emulate the edifices of the Roman Empire.  The style also was used widely in [[Imperial Russia]], where it was used to celebrate the victory over Napoleon in such memorial structures as the [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General Staff Building]], [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], [[Alexander Column]], and [[Narva Triumphal Gate]]. [[Stalinist architecture]] is sometimes referred to as Stalin's Empire style.

The style survived in Italy longer than in most of Europe, partly because of its Imperial Roman associations, partly because it was revived as a national style of architecture following the unification of Italy in 1870. [[Mario Praz]] wrote about this style as the Italian Empire.  In the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States, the Empire style was adapted to local conditions and gradually acquired further expression as the [[Egyptian Revival]], [[Greek Revival]], [[Biedermeier|Biedermeier style]], [[Regency style]], and [[Federal style|late-Federal style]].

{{Italic title}}
'''''Esoteric Buddhism''''' is a book originally published in 1883 in London; it was compiled by a member of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]].{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=154}} It was one of the first books written for the purpose explain of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] for the wide range of readers,{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}} and was "made up of the [[Mahatma Letters|author's correspondence]] with an [[Koot Hoomi|Indian mystic]]."{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}} This is the most significant theosophical work of the author. According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]], it "disseminated the basic teachings of Theosophy in its new Asian cast."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|"His [Sinnett's] second book, ''Esoteric Buddhism,'' an outline of some of the main teachings of theosophy, attracted much attention and served as a harbinger of [[Helena Blavatsky|H.P.B.'s]] monumental work, ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
Through the mediation of [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]]{{refn|group=note|P. Washington wrote that Blavatsky with Sinnett and his wife Patience has been in sincere friendship.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 3}}}} Sinnett began a correspondence in 1880 with the two adepts, who sponsored the Theosophical Society, the [[mahatma]]s [[Kuthumi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].{{sfn|Theosopedia}}{{refn|group=note|Goodrick-Clarke wrote that "the very concept of the [[mahatma|Masters]]" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]] noted that between 1880 and 1884 Sinnett received from the mahatmas circa one hundred twenty letters with explanation of "[[occult]] cosmology". From this material, he attempted to formulate in his new book "the basis of a revised theosophy."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=381}} By foundation of the book became "Cosmological notes" received from the Mahatma Morya{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letters 12, 13}} together with a long series of answers to questions sent by mahatma Kuthumi{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letters 14–18}} during the summer of 1882.{{sfn|Hanson|1980|loc=Ch. IX}}&lt;br/&gt;[[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]] received from his Master mahatma Morya the instruction to provide assistance to Sinnett in his work on the book, but, according to the memoirs of the author, he did it reluctantly, and what little help. The main help came from the mahatmas through Blavatsky in the form of answers to the questions referred to her by the author.{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=23}}

In preface to the original edition author says that [[exoteric]] [[Buddhism]] "has remained in closer union with the [[esoteric]] doctrine" than any other [[Major religious groups|world religion]]. Thus, specification of the "inner knowledge" addressed to modern readers will be connected with the familiar features of the Buddhist teaching. Sinnett argues that esoteric teaching "be most conveniently studied in its Buddhist aspect."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=123}}

=== Esoteric teachers ===
At the beginning of the first chapter the author makes the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am bringing to my readers knowledge which I have obtained by favour{{refn|group=note|[[Mahatma Letters|Letters from mahatmas]] formed the basis of two theosophical books by Sinnett.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=61}}}} rather than by effort. It will not be found the less valuable on that account; I venture, on the contrary, to declare that it will be found of incalculably greater value, easily as I have obtained it, than any results in a similar direction which I could possibly have procured by ordinary methods of research."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=1|Лесевич|1887|2p=16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the question of the whereabouts of his teachers Sinnett says that for a long time in [[Tibet]] there is a "certain secret region," hitherto unknown and inaccessible to ordinary people and for those living in the surrounding mountains as well as for visitors, "in which adepts have always congregated. But the country generally was not in Buddha's time, as it has since become, the chosen habitation of the great brotherhood. Much more than they are at present, were the Mahatmas in former times, distributed about the world." But the development of civilization has led to the fact that many occultists gathered in Tibet. The system of rules and laws for them has been developed in the 14th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsong-ka-pa]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=181–182}}{{sfn|Lopez|1999|p=50}}

=== The constitution of man ===
The author argues that "a complete, or perfect man" is made up of [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven elements]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#The [[Physical body|Physical Body]] (''[[Rūpa]]'').
#Vitality (''[[Prana]]'', or ''Jiva'').
#[[Subtle body|Astral Body]] (''Linga Sharira'').
#Animal [[Soul]] ([[Kāma|''Kāma Rūpa'']]).
#Human Soul ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|''Manas'']]).
#Spiritual Soul (''[[Buddhi]]'').
#[[Spirit]] ([[Ātman (Buddhism)|''Ātma'']]).{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=24|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|2p=17}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The world periods ===
A French philosopher [[René Guénon]] stated that the central place of the Theosophical doctrine [which there is in Sinnett's book] is occupied the "idea of evolution." He then wrote that, according to the Theosophical teaching, there are
&lt;blockquote&gt;"seven '[[Root race|mother-races]]' succeed one another in the course of a 'world period', that is to say while the 'wave of life' sojourns on a given planet. Each 'race' includes seven 'sub-races', each of which is divided into seven 'branches'. On the other hand, the 'wave of life' successively runs through seven globes in a '[[Round (Theosophy)|round]]', and this 'round' is repeated seven times in a same 'planetary chain', after which the 'wave of life' passes to another 'chain', composed likewise of seven planets which will be traversed seven times in their turn. Thus there are seven 'chains' in a 'planetary system', also called an 'enterprise of evolution'; and finally, our solar system is formed of ten 'planetary systems'... We are presently in the fifth 'race' of our 'world period', and in the fourth 'round' of the 'chain' of which the earth forms part and in which it occupies the fourth rank. This 'chain' is also the fourth of our 'planetary system'."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=55, 131|Guénon|2004|2p=98}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Man after death ===
In the fifth chapter of his book, Sinnett explains the fate of man after death. Of the seven components that make up our personality, the three lower at the time of physical death, moving away from us.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=77}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}} The four upper components move on [[Astral plane|Kama loca]], and "from there [soul] proceed to Devachan, a kind of theosophical version of heaven." (The analogy should not be carried overly; Sinnett argues that Devachan is a state, not a place.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=81}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}}) Then these four components divide themselves, the law of [[karma]] specifies that it will happen to them—different souls receive different devachanic experience. Only after a long stay in this state, the soul [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reincarnates]].{{refn|group=note|"The lower four, or quaternary, are transitory, while the upper triad is related to the eternal element in man, his real nature and identity with the universal soul."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=24}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=17}}}} New incarnations on the [[Physical plane|earth plane]] are actually rather rare, "but re-birth in less than fifteen hundred years is spoken of as almost impossible."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=98}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}}

Sinnett says that the mediums contact with the inhabitants of Devachan, but very rare, and in this time occurs the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The spirit of the [[Psychic|sensitive]], getting odylized,{{sfn|Melton|2001}} so to say, by the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of the spirit in the Devachan, ''becomes'' for a few minutes that departed personality, and writes in the handwriting of the latter, in his language and in his thoughts, as they were during his lifetime. The two spirits become blended in one, and the preponderance of one over the other during such phenomena determines the preponderance of personality in the characteristic exhibited. Thus it may incidentally be observed, what is called ''[[rapport]],'' is, in plain fact, an identity of molecular vibration between the astral part of the incarnate medium and the astral part of the disincarnate personality."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=95|Hammer|2003|2p=467}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult philosophy ===
[[File:Man on planet.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Diagram "Man on a Planet".{{refn|group=note|"Man evolves in seven major or root-races; 49 minor races; and the subordinate races or offshoots. The arrow indicates the direction taken by the evolutionary impulse.&lt;br/&gt;
I, II, III, IV, etc., are the seven major or [[root race|root-races]].&lt;br/&gt;
1, 2, 3, etc., are the minor races.&lt;br/&gt;
a, a, a, are the subordinate or offshoot races.&lt;br/&gt;
N, the initial and terminal point of evolution on the planet.&lt;br/&gt; 
S, the axial point where the development equilibrates or adjusts itself in each race evolution.&lt;br/&gt; 
E, the equatorial points wherein the descending arc intellect overcomes spirituality and in the ascending arc spirituality outstrips intellect.&lt;br/&gt;
A word or two [globe, earth] added to make it apply as well  to a whole manwantaric chain of worlds."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Lavoie noted that in Sinnett's book there are the two major questions – "the structure of the universe and [[spiritual evolution]]." He selected "some key terms" in the book.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}

[[Avīci|'''Avitchi''']] is a state "of punishment reached only in exceptional cases and by exceptional natures." The usual man will work his karma out in a new [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|incarnation]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=93}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Sukhavati|'''Devachan''']] is a state of greatest bliss where "the levels of intensity and the duration of stay are based on the karma one produces in his/her lifetime."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=92}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''Eighth sphere''' is a planet associated with our planetary chain that is more materialistic than the earth.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=113}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}} The Soul in the mean of the fifth round "can be sent to the eighth sphere for annihilation if it has developed a positive attraction to materialism and a repulsion of spirituality."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=162}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Astral plane|'''Kama loca''']] is "an unconscious state of gestation. It is here that the fourth principle (the animal soul) is separated from the others." The fourth component and some of the fifth component stays in Kama loca while "the rest of the principles continue on in their spiritual evolution."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=100–101}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}} The Ego's duration in Kama loca can last from few moments to years.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=97}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''[[Manvantara]]''' is a period of activity or manifestation.{{sfn|Glossary|1999}} There are three different manvantaras: 1) the mahamanvantara, 2) the solar manvantara, 3) the minor manvantara.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Monad (philosophy)|'''Monad''']] is upper triad of the seven principles of man (Atma-Buddhi-Manas).{{sfn|Glossary|1999}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''[[Pralaya]]''' is a state of nonbeing.{{sfn|Glossary|1999}} "Pralaya is described by Sinnett as a type of sleep, rest, or a time of inactivity." There are three different pralayas: 1) the mahapralaya, 2) the solar pralaya, 3) the minor pralaya.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Round (Theosophy)|'''Round''']] is a full turnover via the seven globes. "During each round there is a maximum of 120 incarnations for each monad in each race with the average of 8,000 years between incarnations."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=143}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}

Man begins as a monad and dwells in seven major races on each of the seven planets. Each race takes circa one million years. Only 12,000 of those will be used for objective existence on the planets. The rest of that time will be used mainly in a subjective existence on the [[Mental plane|devachanic plane]]. "This meant that out of one million years – 988,000 years are spent reaping the effects of karma."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=142–143}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=199}}{{refn|group=note|In ''Mahatma Letters'' (letter 14) this number is "slightly different."{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=244}} The letter states that man "has passed in all his lives upon our planet (in this Round) but 77,700 years he has been in the subjective spheres 922,300 years."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}}} A branch race is one of seven belonging to a subrace, itself one of seven belonging to a main race. "If each monad in each race incarnates once, the total number of incarnations in each globe would be 343 (7 branch races x 7 subraces x 7 [[root race]]s); however, each monad incarnates typically at a minimum of two times and some even more frequently."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=60–61, 140}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=199}} In ''Mahatma Letters'' it is said that "one life in each of the seven root-races; seven lives in each of the 49 sub-races – or 7 x 7 x 7 = 343 and add 7 more. And then a series of lives in offshoot and branchlet races; making the total incarnations of man in each station or planet 777."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=244}}

=== Theosophical Buddha ===
The ninth chapter of Sinnett's book called "Buddha". It begins with the words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The historical Buddha, as known to the custodians of the esoteric doctrine, is a personage whose birth is not invested with the quaint marvels popular story has crowded round it. Nor was his progress to adeptship traced by the literal occurrence of the supernatural struggles depicted in symbolic legend. On the other hand, the incarnation, which may outwardly be described as the birth of Buddha, is certainly not regarded by occult science as an event like any other birth, nor the spiritual development through which Buddha passed during his earth-life a mere process of intellectual evolution, like the mental history of any other philosopher. The mistake which ordinary European writers make in dealing with a problem of this sort lies in their inclination to treat exoteric legend either as a record of a miracle about which no more need be said, or as pure myth, putting merely a fantastic decoration on a remarkable life."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=167|Lopez|2008|2pр=187–188}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Lopez]], author of ''Esoteric Buddhism'' "has a broader view of the Buddha" than that of Western Buddhologists and scholars of Oriental studies. Sinnett stated that the Buddha is simply one of a row "of adepts who have appeared over the course of the centuries."{{Sfn|Lopez|2008|p=189}} Buddha's next incarnation happened approximately sixty years after his death. He appeared as [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], the well-known Vedantic philosopher. Sinnett noted that for the uninitiated it is known that date of Shankara's birth is one thousand years after Buddha's death, and that he was hostile to Buddhism. Sinnett wrote that the Buddha came as Shankara "to fill up some gaps and repair certain errors in his own previous teaching."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=176}} The Buddha had leaved "from the practice of earlier adepts by opening the path" to adeptship to men of all [[caste]]s. "Although well-intentioned, this led" to a deterioration of occult knowledge when it was penetrated into ignominious hands.{{Sfn|Lopez|2008|p=189}} Sinnett wrote that to further appeared a need "to take no candidates except from the class which, on the whole, by reason of its hereditary advantages, is likely to be the best nursery of fit candidates."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=177}}&lt;br/&gt;Sinnett claimed that the  Buddha's next incarnation was as the great Tibetan adept reformer of the 14th century Tsong-ka-pa.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=181}}

=== Against blind faith ===
In the tenth chapter Sinnett expresses (as well as the Mahatmas) his very negative attitude to religiosity of any kind. He argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nothing can produce more disastrous effects on human progress, as regards the destiny of individuals, than the very prevalent notion that one religion followed out in a pious spirit, is as good as another, and that if such and such doctrines are perhaps absurd when you look into them, the great majority of good people will never think of their absurdity, but will recite them in a blamelessly devoted attitude of mind."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=194–195|Guénon|2004|2p=126}}{{refn|group=note|"It is priestly imposture that rendered these gods so terrible to man; it is religion that makes of him the selfish bigot, the fanatic that hates all mankind out of his own sect without rendering him any better or more moral for it. It is the belief in God and gods that makes two-thirds of humanity the slaves of a handful of those who deceive them under the false pretence of saving them. &lt;...&gt; In our [Tibetan] temples there is neither a god nor gods worshipped, only the thrice sacred memory of the greatest as the holiest [[Gautama Buddha|''man'']] that ever lived."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 10}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The presence of a secret or esoteric teaching in Buddhism is "not accepted by orthodox Buddhist."{{sfn|Harris}} For example, [[Thomas Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this connection, I shall doubtless be expected to say a few words on Theosophy, if only because one of the books giving an account of that very curious and widely spread movement has been called ''Esoteric Buddhism.'' It has always been a point of wonder to me why the author should have chosen this particular title for his treatise. For if there is anything that can be said with absolute certainty about the book it is, that it is not esoteric, and not Buddhism. The original Buddhism was the very contrary of esoteric."{{sfn|Rhys Davids|1896|pp=209–210}}{{refn|group=note|Nonetheless [[Christmas Humphreys|Humphreys]] wrote that "Buddha's Teaching was not born from a spiritual vacuum, but was an expression of some portion of that Gupta Vidya 'the accumulated Wisdom of the ages', which antedates all known religions."{{sfn|Humphreys|2012|p=23}}&lt;br/&gt;
"'''Gupta-vidya''' (Sanskrit) ''Gupta-vidyā'' [from ''gupta'' from the verbal root ''gup'' to conceal, preserve + ''vidyā'' knowledge, wisdom] Secret knowledge, secret wisdom; the source of all religions and philosophies known to the world: theosophy, the ancient wisdom-religion, the esoteric philosophy."{{sfn|Glossary|1999}}}}{{refn|group=note|Sinnett received instructions from the Tibetan Masters, and Rhys Davids believed that [[Lamaism]] was a Religion not only different from Buddhism, but and being in his time in antagonism with the teachings and the institutions of original Buddhism.{{sfn|Лесевич|1887|p=16}} See also a book by Eva M. Dargyay{{sfn|Dargyay|1979}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[René Guénon|Guénon's]] opinion on the subject was the same. He wrote that never was genuine "esoteric Buddhism." The ancient Buddhism was substantially an exoteric teaching "serving as theoretical support for a social movement with egalitarian tendencies."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=93}} According to Guénon, Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophism]] known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}}

Some Theosophists did not share the views presented by Sinnett in his new work; for example, according to [[Anna Kingsford|Kingsford]], this book was very distant from the esoteric, and the main mistake of the author was that he thought about the symbols as reality.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 4}}

== New editions and translations ==
After its first publication in 1883 the book was reprinted several times: in the same 1883 came 2nd edition, in 1885 – 5th, 1898 – 8th. This work has been translated into several European languages: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian.{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{refn|group=note|"153 editions published between 1883 and 2016 in 8 languages and held by 610 WorldCat member libraries worldwide".{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}}}}

In [[anatomy]], a '''fissure''' ([[Latin]] ''fissura'', [[plural]] ''fissurae'') is a groove, natural division, deep furrow, elongated cleft, or tear in various parts of the body also generally called a [[sulcus (morphology)|sulcus]], or in the brain a [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulcus]].

==Types==

===Brain===
*''[[Medial longitudinal fissure]]'' or ''Longitudinal fissure'': which divides the cerebrum into the two hemispheres.

*''[[Collateral fissure]]'': found in the inferior surface of the cerebrum.
*''[[Hippocampal sulcus]]'': a sulcus that extends from the brain's corpus callosum to the tip of the temporal lobe.
*''[[Horizontal fissure of cerebellum|Horizontal fissure]] or [[Horizontal fissure of cerebellum|Transverse fissure]]'': found between the cerebrum and the cerebellum.  Note that a "transverse fissure" can also be found in the [[liver]] and [[lung]]s.
*''[[Occipitoparietal fissure]]'': found between the occipital and parietal lobes of the brain.
*''[[Fissure of Sylvius]]'': separates the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain from the temporal lobe.
*''[[Wernicke's fissure]]'': separates the brain's temporal and parietal lobes from the occipital lobe. 
*''[[Zygal fissure]]'': found in the cerebrum.

===Skull===
*''[[Auricular fissure]]'': found in the [[temporal bone]]
*''[[Pterygomaxillary fissure]]''
*''[[Petrotympanic fissure]]''
*''[[Sphenoidal fissure]]'': separates the wings and the body of the [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] [[bone]].
*''[[Superior orbital fissure]]''

===Liver===
*''[[Transverse fissure of liver]]'': found in the lower surface of the [[liver]].
*''[[Portal fissure]]'': found in the under-surface of the liver.
*''[[Umbilical fissure]]'': found in front of the liver.
*fissure for [[ligamentum teres hepatis]]
*fissure for [[ligamentum venosum]]

===Spinal cord===
*[[ventral median fissure]]

===Lung===
*[[oblique fissure]] of right &amp; left lung
*[[horizontal fissure of right lung]]
*azygos fissure of right lung

===Other===
*''[[Henle's fissure]]'': the connective tissue between the muscle fibers of the [[heart]].
*''[[Palpebral fissure]]'': separates the upper and lower [[eyelid]]s.
* [[Anal fissure|Anal Fissure]]: a break or tear in the skin of the anal canal.
* [[Fissure of the nipple]]

==Abnormal fissure==
Fissure can also refer to an unnatural tract or ulcer, most commonly found in the [[anus]] and called an [[anal fissure]].

[[File:GlobalFlyer at KSC before launch.jpg|thumb|With a fuel fraction of nearly 85%, the [[Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer|GlobalFlyer]] could carry 5 times its weight in fuel.]]

In [[aerospace engineering]], an aircraft's '''fuel fraction''', '''fuel weight fraction''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brandt | first = Steven | title = Introduction to Aeronautics: a Design Perspective | publisher = AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Ast) | page = 359 | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-56347-701-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a spacecraft's '''propellant fraction''', is the weight of the fuel or propellant divided by the gross take-off weight of the craft (including propellant):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vinh | first = Nguyen | title = Flight Mechanics of High-Performance Aircraft | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | page = 139| year = 1993 | isbn = 0-521-47852-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \zeta = \frac{\Delta W}{W_1} &lt;/math&gt;

The fractional result of this mathematical division is often expressed as a percent. For aircraft with external [[drop tank]]s, the term '''internal fuel fraction''' is used to exclude the weight of external tanks and fuel. 

Fuel fraction is a key parameter in determining an aircraft's range, the [[Range (aircraft)|distance it can fly without refueling]].
[[Louis Charles Breguet|Breguet]]’s aircraft [[range (aircraft)|range]] equation describes the relationship of range with [[airspeed]], [[lift-to-drag ratio]], [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]], and the part of the total fuel fraction available for cruise, also known as the '''cruise fuel fraction''', or ''' cruise fuel weight fraction'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Fighter aircraft==

At today’s state of the art for jet [[fighter aircraft]], fuel fractions of 29 percent and below typically yield subcruisers; 33 percent provides a quasi–[[supercruise]]r; and 35 percent and above are needed for useful supercruising missions. The U.S. [[F-22 Raptor]]’s fuel fraction is 29 percent,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050908090849/http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=199 8200/27900 = 0.29]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurofighter]] is 31 percent, both similar to those of the subcruising [[F-4 Phantom II]], [[F-15 Eagle]] and the Russian [[Mikoyan MiG-29]] "Fulcrum". The Russian supersonic interceptor, the [[Mikoyan MiG-31]] "Foxhound", has a fuel fraction of over 45 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/do-000812-f22.htm The F-22 Program FACT VERSUS FICTION] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421194617/http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/do-000812-f22.htm |date=2007-04-21 }} by Everest E. Riccioni, Col. USAF, Ret.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Panavia Tornado]] had a relatively low internal fuel fraction of 26 percent, and frequently carried drop tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Spick | first = Mike | title = Brassey's Modern Fighters | publisher = Potomac Books | location = Washington | year = 2002 | pages = 51–53 | isbn = 1-57488-462-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airliners==

Airliners have a fuel fraction of less than half their takeoff weight, between 26% for [[medium-haul]] to 45% for [[long-haul]]:

'''Herbchronology''' is the analysis of annual [[growth rings]] (or simply annual rings) in the secondary root [[xylem]] of [[perennial]] [[herbaceous plants]]. While leaves and stems of perennial herbs die down at the end of the growing season the root often persists for many years or even the entire life.&lt;ref name="JBRCDB2002"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dietz H, Schweingruber FH |title=Annual rings in native and introduced forbs of lower Michigan, USA
 |journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|volume=80|year=2002|pages=642–649|doi=10.1139/b02-048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perennial herb species belonging to the [[dicotyledon]] group (also known as perennial [[forbs]]) are characterized by [[secondary growth]], which shows as a new [[growth ring]] added each year to persistent roots. About two thirds of all perennial dicotyledonous herb species with a persistent root that grow in the strongly seasonal zone of the northern hemisphere show at least fairly clear annual  growth rings.&lt;ref name="JBRCDB2002" /&gt;

Counting of annual growth rings can be used to determine the age of a perennial herb similarly as it is done in trees using [[dendrochronology]].&lt;ref name="PB2006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=von Arx G, Dietz H |title=Growth rings in the roots of temperate forbs are robust annual markers|journal=Plant Biology|volume=8|year=2006|pages=224–233|doi=10.1055/s-2005-873051}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way it was found that some perennial herbs live up to 50 years and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Growth rings in herbs and shrubs: life span, age determination and stem anatomy|vauthors=Schweingruber FH, Poschlod P |pages=195–415|year=2005|issn=1424-5108|publisher=Haupt|location=Bern}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECO2006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=von Arx G, Edwards PJ, Dietz H |title=Evidence for life history changes in high altitude populations of three perennial forbs|journal=Ecology|volume=87|year=2006|pages=665–674|doi=10.1890/05-1041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term herb-chronology is referring to [[dendrochronology]] because of the similarity of the structures investigated. The term was introduced in the late 1990s,&lt;ref name="AB1998"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dietz H, Ullmann I |title=Ecological application of 'Herbchronology': Comparative stand age structure analyses of the invasive plant Bunias orientalis L.|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=82|year=1998|pages=471–480|doi=10.1006/anbo.1998.0706}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the existence of annual rings in perennial herbs was already observed in earlier times by several researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Petersen HE|title=Diapensiaceae|journal=Meddelelser am Gronland|volume=36|year=1908|pages=141–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zoller H|title=Beitrag zur Altersbestimmung von Pflanzen aus der Walliser Felsensteppe|journal=Bericht über das Geobotanische Forschungsinstitut Rübel in Zürich|year=1949|pages=61–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bakshi TS, Coupland RT |title=Vegetative propagation in Linaria vulgaris|journal=Journal of Botany|volume=38|year=1960|pages=243–249|doi=10.1139/b60-022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual growth rings==
Like trees and woody plants, perennial herbs have a growth zone called [[vascular cambium]] between the root bark and the root [[xylem]]. The [[vascular cambium ring]] is active during growing season and produces a new layer of [[xylem]] tissue or growth ring every year. This addition of a new lateral layer each year is called [[secondary growth]] and is exactly the same as in woody plants. Each individual growth ring consists of [[Wood#Earlywood and latewood in softwood|earlywood]] tissue that is formed at the beginning of the growing season and [[Wood#Earlywood and latewood in softwood|latewood]] tissue formed in summer and fall. Earlywood tissue is characterized by wide [[vessel element|vessels]] or denser arrangement of vessels, whereas latewood tissue shows narrower vessels and/or lower vessel density.&lt;ref name="JBRCDB2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PB2006" /&gt;

Annual growth rings in herbs are usually only visible by means of a microscope and a specific staining method. Ring-like patterns visible in roots cross sections by the naked eye may be false rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Werner PA|title=On the determination of age in Liatris aspera using cross-sections of corms: implications for past demographic studies|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=112|year=1978|pages=1113–1120|doi=10.1086/283350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The width of annual growth rings depends on conditions during formation; in a favorable year it is wider and in a less favorable year narrower.&lt;ref name="ECO2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dietz H, von Arx G |title=Climatic fluctuation causes large-scale synchronous variation in radial increments of the main roots of northern hemisphere forbs|journal=Ecology|volume=86|year=2005|pages=327–333|doi=10.1890/04-0801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Herbchronology is used in many fields of ecological and biological research, for instance in  [[community ecology]], [[population biology]], [[plant ecology]] and [[Invasion biology terminology|invasion biology]].

Herbchronology is used as a tool to estimate plant age. This may be relevant information to determine :
*… the longevity of a perennial [[herbaceous plant]] species; this is valuable information for flora books and an important aspect of life history strategy of a species.&lt;ref name="ECO2006"/&gt;
*… the population age structure; this is valuable for questions into population dynamics or the spreading patterns of invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dietz H|title=Plant invasion patches - reconstructing pattern and process by means of herb-chronology|journal=Biological Invasions|volume=4|year=2002|pages=211–222|doi=10.1023/a:1020971509871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Moloney KA, Knaus F, Dietz H |title=Evidence for a shift in life-history strategy during the secondary phase of a plant invasion|journal=Biological Invasions|volume=11|year=2009|pages=625–634|doi=10.1007/s10530-008-9277-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbchronology allows to assess long-term annual growth rates of a perennial [[herbaceous plant]] without having to monitor it. This may be relevant information to assess …
*… the impact of fluctuations in specific climatic conditions on growth.&lt;ref name="ECO2005" /&gt;
*… the impact of changes in site conditions such as competition.&lt;ref name="AB1998" /&gt;
*… lifetime growth patterns.&lt;ref name="ECO2006" /&gt;

'''Cultural heritage tourism''' (or just '''heritage tourism''' or '''diaspora tourism''') is a branch of [[tourism]] oriented towards the [[cultural heritage]] of the location where tourism is occurring. 

The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in the United States defines heritage tourism as "traveling to experience the places, artifacts and activities that authentically represent the stories and people of the past",&lt;ref name="nthp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Tourism|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/information-center/economics-of-revitalization/heritage-tourism/#.Uz7tU1flvqE|publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "heritage tourism can include cultural, historic and natural resources".&lt;ref name="nthp"/&gt;

==Culture==
[[Culture]] has always been a major object of travel, as the development of the [[Grand Tour]] from the 16th century onwards attests. In the 20th century, some people have claimed, culture ceased to be the objective of tourism: tourism is now culture. Cultural attractions play an important role in tourism at all levels, from the global highlights of world culture to attractions that underpin local identities. (Richards, 1996)&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |last= Richards |first= Greg |title= Production and consumption of European Cultural Tourism. Annals of Tourism Research | page = |year= 1996 |publisher= Tillburg University Press |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Weiler and Hall, culture, heritage and the arts have long contributed to appeal of tourist destination. However, in recent years 'culture' has been rediscovered as an important marketing tool to attract those travellers with special interests in heritage and arts. 

According to the Hollinshead, cultural heritage tourism defines as cultural heritage tourism is the fastest growing segment of the tourism industry because there is a trend toward an increase specialization among tourists. This trend is evident in the rise in the volume of tourists who seek adventure, culture, history, [[archaeology]] and interaction with local people.

Cultural heritage tourism is important for various reasons; it has a positive economic and social impact, it establishes and reinforces identity, it helps preserve the cultural heritage, with culture as an instrument it facilitates harmony and understanding among people, it supports culture and helps renew tourism (Richards, 1996). As Benjamin 
Porter and [[Noel B. Salazar]] have ethnographically documented, however, cultural heritage tourism can also create tensions and even conflict between the different stakeholders involved (Porter and Salazar 2005).&lt;ref name="Porter and Salazar"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=Porter, Benjamin W. and Noel B. Salazar
 |year=2005
 |title=Heritage tourism, conflict, and the public interest
 |journal=International Journal of Heritage Studies
 |volume=11
 |issue=5
 |doi=10.1080/13527250500337397
 |pages=361–370
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural heritage tourism has a number of objectives that must be met within the context of [[sustainable development]] such as; the conservation of cultural resources, accurate  interpretation of resources, authentic visitors experience, and the stimulation of the earned revenues of cultural resources. We can see, therefore, that cultural heritage tourism is not only concerned with identification, management and protection of the heritage values but it must also be involved in understanding the impact of tourism on communities and regions, achieving economic and social benefits, providing financial resources for protection, as well as marketing and promotion. ([[J. M. Fladmark]], 1994)

Heritage tourism involves visiting historical or industrial sites that may include old [[canal]]s, [[railway]]s, battlegrounds, etc. The overall purpose is to gain an appreciation of the past. It also refers to the marketing of a location to members of a [[diaspora]] who have distant family roots there.

==Immigration==
[[Decolonization]] and [[immigration]] form the major background of much contemporary heritage tourism. Falling travel costs have also made heritage tourism possible for more people.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, T. (2007). ''Post-Conflict Heritage, Postcolonial Tourism: Tourism, Politics and Development at Angkor''. Routledge. {{ISBN|041543095X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible form involves religious travel or [[pilgrimage]]s. Many [[Catholics]] from around the world come to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and other sites such as [[Lourdes]] or [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]]. [[Islam]] commands its followers to take the ''[[hajj]]'' to [[Mecca]], thus differentiating it somewhat from tourism in the usual sense, though the trip can also be a culturally important event for the pilgrim.&lt;ref&gt;Basu, P. (2007). ''Highland homecomings: Genealogy and heritage tourism in the Scottish diaspora''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritage tourism can also be attributed to historical events that have been dramatised to make them more entertaining. For example, a historical tour of a town or city using a theme such as ghosts or Vikings. Heritage tourism focuses on certain historical events, rather than presenting a balanced view of that historical period. Its aim may not always be the presentation of accurate historical facts, as opposed to economically developing the site and surrounding area. As a result, heritage tourism can be seen as a blend of education, entertainment, preservation and profit.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy, D., &amp; Olsen, D. (Eds.). (2006). ''Tourism, religion and spiritual journeys''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous peoples==
[[Anthropology]] and [[Ethnology]] were two major disciplines interested by the life of aborigines, their customs and political structures.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, M. (2001). The rise of anthropological theory: A history of theories of culture. AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, the firsts fieldworkers were not interested in expanding the colonization of main European powers, the fact was that their notes, books and field-work notes were employed by colonial officials to understand the aboriginal mind.&lt;ref&gt;Restrepo, E., &amp; Escobar, A. (2005). ‘Other Anthropologies and Anthropology Otherwise’Steps to a World Anthropologies Framework. ''[[Critique of Anthropology]]'', 25(2), 99-129.&lt;/ref&gt; From that moment on, anthropology developed a strange fascination for the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]'s culture.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, J., Dombrowski, K., Graburn, N., LeiteGoldberg, N., Phillips, R., Watkins, J., &amp; Clifford, J. (2004). Looking several ways: Anthropology and native heritage in Alaska. ''[[Current anthropology]]'', 45(1), 5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of heritage and colonization were inextricably intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Starzmann, M. T. (2008). Cultural imperialism and heritage politics in the event of armed conflict: prospects for an ‘activist archaeology’. ''Archaeologies'', 4(3), 368-389.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Community Tourism (Riven No 2).webm|thumb|Community tourism in Sierra Leone: The story of a community in Sierra Leone trying to manage tourism in a socially responsible manner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Tourism - Number2 River Association, Sierra Leone|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL32A3F6F949A3F26D|work=The Vrinda Project|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Another problem with heritage tourism is the effect on indigenous peoples whose land and culture is being visited by tourists. If the indigenous people are not a part of the majority, or ruling power in the country, they may not benefit from the tourism as greatly as they should. For example, in Mexico tourism has increased because of the predicted [[end of the Maya Calendar]]. However, the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]] are not benefitting from the increased traffic through the ruins and other cultural landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayans Demand Inclusion in 'Doomsday Tourism' |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/01/21/mayans-demand-inclusion-doomsday-tourism-73721|work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|accessdate=4 April 2014|date=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion and facilitation ==
Heritage tourism is supported by municipalities through promotion and tourist information in many countries and their administrative units, e.g. cities as Polish [[Bydgoszcz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visit Bydgoszcz|url=http://www.visitbydgoszcz.pl/en/|work= |publisher=Bydgoszcz Information Centre (Bydgoskie Centrum Informacji)|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WarsawTour|url=http://www.warsawtour.pl/en|work= |publisher=Warsaw Tourist Office|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also many forms of presenting selected tourist topics in a harmonized way, for instance [[European Route of Brick Gothic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europäische Route der Backsteingotik|url=http://www.eurob.org/|work= |publisher=Europäische Route der Backsteingotik e.V.|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others ([[Cultural Route of the Council of Europe]]).

[[File:Ur_chariot.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[wheel]], invented sometime before the 4th millennium BC, is one of the most ubiquitous and important technologies. This detail of the "Standard of Ur", c. 2500 BC., displays a Sumerian [[chariot]]]]

The '''history of technology''' is the history of the [[invention]] of [[tool]]s and techniques and is one of the categories of the [[Human history|history of humanity]]. Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as [[stone tools]] to the complex [[genetic engineering]] and [[information technology]] that has emerged since the 1980s. The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech. It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used to described advancements and changes which affect the environment around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/history-of-technology|title=history of technology – Summary &amp; Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely, many scientific endeavors are made possible by [[technologies]] which assist humans in [[travel|traveling]] to places they could not previously reach, and by [[scientific instrument]]s by which we study nature in more detail than our natural senses allow.

Since much of technology is [[applied science]], technical history is connected to the [[history of science]]. Since technology uses [[resource]]s, technical history is tightly connected to [[economic history]]. From those [[Resource (Windows)|resources]], technology produces other resources, including ''technological artifacts'' used in [[everyday life]].

[[Technological change]] affects and is affected by, a society's cultural [[tradition]]s. It is a force for [[economic growth]] and a means to develop and project economic, political, military power and wealth.

== Measuring technological progress ==
{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}
Many [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have created [[social theory|social theories]] dealing with [[social evolution|social]] and [[cultural evolution]]. Some, like [[Lewis H. Morgan]], [[Leslie White]], and [[Gerhard Lenski]] have declared [[technological progress]] to be the primary factor driving the development of human civilization. Morgan's concept of three major stages of social evolution (savagery, [[Primitive culture|barbarism]], and [[civilization]]) can be divided by technological milestones, such as [[fire]]. White argued the measure by which to judge the evolution of culture was [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Elliot|last2=Smith|first2=Karen|title=American Materialism|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=American%20Materialism|website=The University of Alabama – Department of Anthropology|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For White, "the primary function of [[culture]]" is to "harness and control energy." White differentiates between five stages of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]: In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use the energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants ([[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of [[natural resource]]s: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of the efficiency of technical factors using the energy. In his own words, "culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased". [[Nikolai Kardashev]] extrapolated his theory, creating the [[Kardashev scale]], which categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations.

Lenski's approach focuses on [[information]]. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of [[natural environment]]) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He identifies four stages of human development, based on advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through experience. In the third, the humans start using signs and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s, develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in [[communications technology]] translate into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], [[distribution of wealth]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy:
* [[hunter-gatherer]],
* simple [[Agriculture|agricultural]],
* advanced agricultural,
* [[Industry|industrial]],
* special (such as fishing societies).

In economics, [[productivity]] is a measure of technological progress. Productivity increases when fewer inputs (classically labor and capital but some measures include energy and materials) are used in the production of a unit of output. Another indicator of technological progress is the development of new products and services, which is necessary to offset unemployment that would otherwise result as labor inputs are reduced. In developed countries productivity growth has been slowing since the late 1970s; however, productivity growth was higher in some economic sectors, such as manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way It Worked and Why It Won't: Structural Change and the Slowdown of U.S. Economic Growth |last=Bjork |first= Gordon J.|authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher =Praeger|location= Westport, CT; London|isbn=978-0275965327 |pages=2, 67| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, employment in [[manufacturing in the United States]] declined from over 30% in the 1940s to just over 10% 70 years later. Similar changes occurred in other developed countries. This stage is referred to as ''post-industrial''.

In the late 1970s sociologists and anthropologists like [[Alvin Toffler]] (author of ''[[Future Shock]]''), [[Daniel Bell]] and [[John Naisbitt]] have approached the theories of [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]], arguing that the current era of [[industrial society]] is coming to an end, and [[Service (economics)|services]] and information are becoming more important than [[industry]] and [[good (economics)|goods]]. Some extreme visions of the post-industrial society, especially in [[Fictional technology|fiction]], are strikingly similar to the visions of near and post-[[Technological singularity|Singularity]] societies.

==== Stone Age ====
{{Main|Stone Age}}
[[File:Prehistoric Tools - Les Combarelles - Les Eyzies de Tayac - MNP.jpg|thumb|left|A variety of [[stone tool]]s]]
During most of the '''[[Paleolithic]]''' – the bulk of the Stone Age – all humans had a lifestyle which involved limited tools and few permanent settlements. The first major technologies were tied to survival, hunting, and food preparation. [[Stone tools]] and weapons, [[control of fire by early humans|fire]], and [[History of clothing and textiles|clothing]] were technological developments of major importance during this period.

Human ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' approximately 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501000000*/http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/ha/sap.htm | title=Human Ancestors Hall: Homo sapiens | accessdate=8 December 2007 | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest methods of [[stone tool]] making, known as the [[Oldowan]] "industry", date back to at least 2.3 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/336555.stm | title=Ancient 'tool factory' uncovered | accessdate=18 February 2007 | publisher=BBC News | date=6 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in [[Ethiopia]] within the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]], dating back to 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Environment and Behavior of 2.5-Million-Year-Old Bouri Hominids | last=Heinzelin | first=Jean de | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=April 1999 | volume=284 | issue=5414 | pages=625–629 | doi= 10.1126/science.284.5414.625 | pmid=10213682 | last2=Clark | first2=JD | last3=White | first3=T | last4=Hart | first4=W | last5=Renne | first5=P | last6=Woldegabriel | first6=G | last7=Beyene | first7=Y | last8=Vrba | first8=E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This era of stone tool use is called the ''[[Paleolithic]]'', or "Old stone age", and spans all of human history up to the development of [[agriculture]] approximately 12,000 years ago.

To make a stone tool, a "[[lithic core|core]]" of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as [[flint]]) was struck with a [[hammerstone]]. This flaking produced sharp edges which could be used as tools, primarily in the form of [[chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] or [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]].&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=17 May 2008|url=http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04|title=Archaeology|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Americana]]|author=Burke, Ariane |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080521022936/http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools greatly aided the early humans in their [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to perform a variety of tasks including [[butcher]]ing carcasses (and breaking bones to get at the [[Bone marrow|marrow]]); chopping wood; cracking open nuts; skinning an animal for its [[Hide (skin)|hide]], and even forming other tools out of softer materials such as bone and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flaked Stones and Old Bones: Biological and Cultural Evolution at the Dawn of Technology|author= Plummer, Thomas|publisher=[[Yearbook of Physical Anthropology]]|year=2004|issue=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest stone tools were irrelevant, being little more than a fractured rock. In the [[Acheulian]] era, beginning approximately 1.65 million years ago, methods of working these stone into specific shapes, such as [[hand axe]]s emerged. This early Stone Age is described as the [[Lower Paleolithic]].

The [[Middle Paleolithic]], approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the [[prepared-core technique]], where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone.&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology" /&gt; The [[Upper Paleolithic]], beginning approximately 40,000 years ago, saw the introduction of [[pressure flaking]], where a wood, bone, or antler [[punch (engineering)|punch]] could be used to shape a stone very finely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|author= Haviland, William A.|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0534624873|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the last Ice Age about 10,000 years ago is taken as the end point of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the beginning of the [[Epipaleolithic]] / [[Mesolithic]]. The Mesolithic technology included the use of [[microliths]] as composite stone tools, along with wood, bone, and antler tools.

The later Stone Age, during which the rudiments of agricultural technology were developed, is called the [[Neolithic]] period. During this period, polished [[stone tool]]s were made from a variety of hard rocks such as [[flint]], [[jade]], [[jadeite]], and [[Greenschist|greenstone]], largely by working exposures as quarries, but later the valuable rocks were pursued by tunneling underground, the first steps in mining technology. The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared. These stone axes were used alongside a continued use of stone tools such as a range of [[Projectile point|projectiles]], knives, and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], as well as tools, made organic materials such as wood, bone, and antler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Zsuzsanna|last1=Tóth | editor1-first=Alexandra |editor1-last=Anders | editor2-first=Zsuzsanna |editor2-last=Siklósi | year=2012 | title=Bone, Antler, and Tusk tools of the Early Neolithic Körös Culture | contribution=The First Neolithic Sites in Central/South-East European Transect, Volume III: The Körös Culture in Eastern Hungary | page= | location=Oxford | publisher=BAR International Series 2334 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone Age cultures developed [[Prehistoric music|music]] and engaged in organized [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. Stone Age humans developed ocean-worthy [[outrigger canoe]] technology, leading to [[History of Papua New Guinea|migration]] across the [[Malay archipelago]], across the Indian Ocean to [[Madagascar]] and also across the Pacific Ocean, which required knowledge of the ocean currents, weather patterns, sailing, and [[celestial navigation]].

Although Paleolithic cultures left no written records, the shift from nomadic life to settlement and agriculture can be inferred from a range of archaeological evidence. Such evidence includes ancient tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lovgren|first1=Stefan|title=Ancient Tools Unearthed in Siberian Arctic|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/01/0114_040114_siberianhumans.html|website=National Geographic News|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cave painting]]s, and other [[prehistoric art]], such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. Human remains also provide direct evidence, both through the examination of bones, and the study of [[mummy|mummies]]. Scientists and historians have been able to form significant inferences about the lifestyle and culture of various prehistoric peoples, and especially their technology.

{{Main|Ancient technology}}

==== Copper and bronze Ages ====
{{Main|Bronze Age}}

[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|upright|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade]]

Metallic copper occurs on the surface of weathered copper ore deposits and copper was used before copper [[smelting]] was known.  Copper smelting is believed to have originated when the technology of pottery [[kiln]]s allowed sufficiently high temperatures.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  The concentration of various elements such as arsenic increase with depth in copper ore deposits and smelting of these ores yields [[arsenical bronze]], which can be sufficiently work hardened to be suitable for making tools.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  [[Bronze]] is an alloy of copper with tin; the latter being found in relatively few deposits globally caused a long time to elapse before true tin bronze to became widespread. (See: [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]]) [[Bronze]] was a major advance over stone as a material for making tools, both because of its mechanical properties like strength and ductility and because it could be cast in molds to make intricately shaped objects.  

Bronze significantly advanced shipbuilding technology with better tools and bronze nails.  Bronze nails replaced the old method of attaching boards of the hull with cord woven through drilled holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC|location= New York|isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Better ships enabled long distance trade and the advance of civilization. 
   
This technological trend apparently began in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and spread outward over time. These developments were not, and still are not, universal. The [[three-age system]] does not accurately describe the technology history of groups outside of [[Eurasia]], and does not apply at all in the case of some isolated populations, such as the [[Spinifex People]], the [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]], and various Amazonian tribes, which still make use of Stone Age technology, and have not developed agricultural or metal technology.

==== Iron Age ====
{{Main|Iron Age}}
[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|An [[axe]]head made of iron, dating from the Swedish [[Iron Age]]]]
Before iron smelting was developed the only iron was obtained from meteorites and is usually identified by having nickel content.  [[Meteoric iron]] was rare and valuable, but was sometimes used to make tools and other implements, such as fish hooks.

The '''[[Iron age]]''' involved the adoption of iron [[bloomery|smelting]] technology. It generally replaced bronze and made it possible to produce tools which were stronger, lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents. The raw materials to make iron, such as ore and limestone, are far more abundant than copper and especially tin ores. Consequently, iron was produced in many areas. 

It was not possible to mass manufacture steel or pure iron because of the high temperatures required.  Furnaces could reach melting temperature but the crucibles and molds needed for melting and casting had not been developed.  [[Steel]] could be produced by [[forging]] bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a somewhat controllable way, but steel produced by this method was not homogeneous.

In many Eurasian cultures, the Iron Age was the last major step before the development of written language, though again this was not universally the case.

In Europe, large [[hill fort]]s were built either as a refuge in time of war or sometimes as permanent settlements. In some cases, existing forts from the Bronze Age were expanded and enlarged. The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increased, providing more farmland to support the growing population.

==== Egyptians ====
The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many simple machines, such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] to aid construction processes. Egyptian society made significant advances during dynastic periods in areas such as astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. They also made paper and monuments. The Egyptians made significant advances in shipbuilding. Astronomy was used by Egyptian leaders to govern people.

==== Indus Valley ====
The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area, is notable for its early application of city planning and sanitation technologies. Indus Valley construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding of materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation.

==== Mesopotamians ====
The peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkad (region)|Akkadians]], [[Assyria]]ns, and [[Babylonia]]ns) have been credited with the invention of the [[wheel]], but this is no longer certain. They lived in cities from c. 4000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;JN Postgate, ''Early Mesopotamia'', Routledge (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a sophisticated architecture in mud-brick and stone,&lt;ref&gt;See entries under [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of the true arch. The walls of Babylon were so massive they were quoted as a [[Wonder of the World]]. They developed extensive water systems; canals for transport and irrigation in the alluvial south, and catchment systems stretching for tens of kilometers in the hilly north. Their palaces had sophisticated drainage systems.&lt;ref name=Dalley2013&gt;S Dalley, ''The Mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon'', Oxford University Press(2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing was invented in Mesopotamia, using the [[cuneiform]] script. Many records on clay tablets and stone inscriptions have survived. These civilizations were early adopters of bronze technologies which they used for tools, weapons and monumental statuary. By 1200&amp;nbsp;BC they could cast objects 5 m long in a single piece. The Assyrian King [[Sennacherib]] (704–681&amp;nbsp;BC) claims to have invented automatic sluices and to have been the first to use water screws, of up to 30 tons weight, which were cast using two-part clay molds rather than by the 'lost wax' process.&lt;ref name=Dalley2013/&gt; The Jerwan Aqueduct (c. 688&amp;nbsp;BC) is made with stone arches and lined with waterproof concrete.&lt;ref&gt;T Jacobsen and S Lloyd, ''Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan'', Chicago University Press, (1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]] spanned 800 years. They enabled meticulous astronomers to plot the motions of the planets and to predict eclipses.&lt;ref&gt;CBF Walker, ''Astronomy before the telescope,'' British Museum Press, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chinese ====
The Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early [[Seismometer|seismological detectors]], matches, [[paper]], sliding calipers, the double-action piston pump, [[cast iron]], the iron plough, the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the wheelbarrow, the [[suspension bridge]], the parachute, natural gas as fuel, the [[compass]], the [[raised-relief map]], the propeller, the [[crossbow]], the [[South Pointing Chariot]] and [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|coauthors= Joseph Needham|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=| postscript = &lt;Based on the works of Joseph Needham&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period include [[block printing]], [[movable type|movable type printing]], phosphorescent paint, endless power [[chain drive]] and the clock escapement mechanism. The solid-fuel [[rocket]] was invented in China about 1150, nearly 200 years after the invention of [[gunpowder]] (which acted as the rocket's fuel). Decades before the West's age of exploration, the Chinese emperors of the [[Ming Dynasty]] also sent [[Treasure voyages|large fleets]] on maritime voyages, some reaching Africa.

==== Greek ====
[[File:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[aeolipile]], the earliest steam-powered device]]

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] engineers [[Ancient Greek technology|were responsible for myriad inventions and improvements to existing technology]]. The [[Hellenistic period]], in particular, saw a sharp increase in technological advancement, fostered by a climate of openness to new ideas, the blossoming of a mechanistic philosophy, and the establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] and its close association with the adjacent [[museion]]. In contrast to the typically anonymous inventors of earlier ages, ingenious minds such as [[Archimedes]], [[Philo of Byzantium]], [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]], [[Ctesibius]], and [[Archytas]] remain known by name to posterity.

Ancient Greek innovations were particularly pronounced in mechanical technology, including the ground-breaking invention of the [[watermill]] which constituted the first human-devised motive force not to rely on muscle power (besides the [[sail]]). Apart from their pioneering use of waterpower, Greek inventors were also the first to experiment with wind power (see [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]]'s windwheel) and even created the earliest steam engine (the [[aeolipile]]), opening up entirely new possibilities in harnessing natural forces whose full potential would not be exploited until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The newly devised right-angled [[gear]] and [[screw]] would become particularly important to the operation of mechanical devices. That is when the age of mechanical devices started.

[[File:Overshot water wheel schematic.svg|thumb|left|The compartmented water-wheel, here its overshot version, was invented in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]].]]

Ancient agriculture, as in any period prior to the modern age the primary mode of production and subsistence, and its irrigation methods, were considerably advanced by the invention and widespread application of a number of previously unknown water-lifting devices, such as the vertical [[water-wheel]], the compartmented wheel, the water [[turbine]], [[Archimedes' screw]], the bucket-chain and pot-garland, the [[force pump]], the [[suction pump]], the double-action [[piston pump]] and quite possibly the [[chain pump]].&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f."&gt;{{Cite book

In music, the [[water organ]], invented by Ctesibius and subsequently improved, constituted the earliest instance of a [[keyboard instrument]]. In time-keeping, the introduction of the inflow [[Water clock|clepsydra]] and its mechanization by the dial and pointer, the application of a [[feedback|feedback system]] and the [[escapement]] mechanism far superseded the earlier outflow clepsydra.

The famous [[Antikythera mechanism]], a kind of analogous computer working with a [[differential gear]], and the [[astrolabe]] both show great refinement in astronomical science.

Greek engineers were also the first to devise [[automata]] such as [[vending machine]]s, suspended ink pots, automatic [[washstand]]s, and doors, primarily as toys, which however featured many new useful mechanisms such as the [[cam]] and [[gimbal]]s.

In other fields, ancient Greek inventions include the [[catapult]] and the [[gastraphetes]] crossbow in warfare, hollow bronze-casting in metallurgy, the [[dioptra]] for surveying, in infrastructure the [[lighthouse]], [[central heating]], the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos|tunnel excavated from both ends by scientific calculations]], the [[Diolkos|ship trackway]], the [[dry dock]], and plumbing. In horizontal, vertical and transport, great progress resulted from the invention of the [[crane (machine)|crane]], the [[winch]], the [[wheelbarrow]] and the [[odometer]].

Further newly created techniques and items were [[List of ancient spiral stairs|spiral staircases]], the [[chain drive]], [[caliper|sliding calipers]] and [[shower]]s.

==== Roman ====
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created [[Roman law|laws]] providing for individual ownership, advanced stone masonry technology, advanced [[Roman road|road-building]] (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the [[reaper|Gallic reaper]] that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. Roman engineers were the first to build monumental arches, [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[reservoir]]s and [[dam]]s, vaults and domes on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day.

==== Inca, Maya, and Aztec ====
The engineering skills of the [[Inca]] and the [[Mayans]] were great, even by today's standards. An example of this great engineering is the use of pieces weighing upwards of one ton in their stonework placed together so that not even a blade can fit into the cracks. Inca villages used irrigation canals and [[drainage]] systems, making agriculture very efficient. While some claim that the Incas were the first inventors of [[hydroponics]], their agricultural technology was still soil based, if advanced.

Though the [[Maya civilization]] did not incorporate metallurgy or wheel technology in their architectural constructions, they developed complex writing and astronomical systems, and created beautiful sculptural works in stone and flint. Like the Inca, the Maya also had command of fairly advanced agricultural and construction technology. The Maya are also responsible for creating the first pressurized water system in Mesoamerica, located in the Maya site of [[Palenque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.livescience.com/5959-ancient-mayans-fountains-toilets.html|title=Ancient Mayans Likely Had Fountains and Toilets|date=December 23, 2009|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main contribution of the [[Aztec]] rule was a system of communications between the conquered cities and the ubiquity of the ingenious agricultural technology of [[chinampas]]. In [[Mesoamerica]], without draft animals for transport (nor, as a result, wheeled vehicles), the roads were designed for travel on foot, just as in the Inca and Mayan civilizations. The Aztec, subsequently to the Maya, inhereted many of the technologies and intellectual advancements of their predecessors: the [[Olmec]] (see [[Native American inventions and innovations]]).

=== Medieval to early modern ===
One of the most significant development of the Medieval era was the development of economies where water and wind power were more significant than animal and human muscle power.&lt;ref name="Stark_2005"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism and Western Success|last= Stark|first= Rodney |year= 2005 |publisher =Random House Trade Paperbacks|location= New York |isbn=0-8129-7233-3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}} Most water and wind power was used for milling grain.  Water power was also used for blowing air in [[blast furnace]], pulping rags for paper making and for felting wool.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' recorded 5,624 water mills in Great Britain in 1086, being about one per thirty families.&lt;ref name="Stark_2005"/&gt;

As earlier empires had done, the Muslim [[caliphate]]s united in trade large areas that had previously traded little. The conquered sometimes paid lower taxes than in their earlier independence, and ideas spread even more easily than goods. Peace was more frequent than it had been. These conditions fostered improvements in agriculture and other technology as well as in sciences which largely adapted from earlier Greek, Roman and Persian empires, with improvements.

==== Medieval Europe ====

[[File:Trebuchet.jpg|thumb|Medieval [[trebuchet|counterweight trebuchet]] (reconstruction)]]

{{Main|Medieval technology}}

While medieval technology has been long depicted as a step backwards in the evolution of Western technology, sometimes willfully so by modern authors intent on denouncing the church as antagonistic to scientific progress (see e.g. [[Myth of the Flat Earth]]), a generation of medievalists around the American historian of science [[Lynn White]] stressed from the 1940s onwards the innovative character of many medieval techniques. Genuine medieval contributions include for example [[mechanical clock]]s, [[spectacles]] and vertical [[windmill]]s. Medieval ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of seemingly inconspicuous items like the [[watermark]] or the [[push button|functional button]]. In navigation, the foundation to the subsequent [[age of exploration]] was laid by the introduction of pintle-and-gudgeon [[rudder]]s, [[lateen sail]]s, the [[dry compass]], the horseshoe and the [[astrolabe]].

Significant advances were also made in military technology with the development of [[plate armour]], steel [[crossbow]]s, [[trebuchet|counterweight trebuchets]] and [[cannon]]. The Middle Ages are perhaps best known for their architectural heritage: While the invention of the [[rib vault]] and [[arch|pointed arch]] gave rise to the high rising [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], the ubiquitous medieval fortifications gave the era the almost proverbial title of the 'age of castles'.

[[Papermaking]], a 2nd-century Chinese technology, was carried to the Middle East when a group of Chinese papermakers were captured in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Timeline: 8th century|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191735516.timeline.0001|website=Oxford reference|publisher=HistoryWorld|accessdate=9 April 2015|doi=10.1093/acref/9780191735516.timeline.0001|doi-broken-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papermaking technology was spread to Europe by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Safita|first1=Neathery|title=A Brief History Of Paper.|url=http://users.stlcc.edu/nfuller/paper/|accessdate=9 April 2015|date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper mill was established in Sicily in the 12th century. In Europe the fiber to make pulp for making paper was obtained from linen and cotton rags. [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] credited the spinning wheel with increasing the supply of rags, which led to cheap paper, which was a factor in the development of printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Renaissance technology ====
{{Main|Renaissance technology}}
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|left|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]
Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

Due to the casting of cannon, the [[blast furnace]] came into widespread use in France in the mid 15th century.  The blast furnace had been used in China since the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last1=Merson |first1= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, NY |isbn= 978-0879513979|page=69| postscript = A companion to the PBS Series “The Genius That Was China”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the movable cast metal type [[printing press]], whose pressing mechanism was adapted from an olive screw press, (c. 1441) lead to a tremendous increase in the number of books and the number of titles published.  Movable ceramic type had been used in China for a few centuries and woodblock printing dated back even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=}}Based on the works of Joseph Needham&lt;/ref&gt;

The era is marked by such profound technical advancements like [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perceptivity]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] or [[Bastion fortress]]es. Note books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as [[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied. Architects and engineers were inspired by the structures of [[Ancient Rome]], and men like [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] created the large dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] as a result. He was awarded one of the first [[patent]]s ever issued in order to protect an ingenious [[crane (machine)|crane]] he designed to raise the large masonry stones to the top of the structure. Military technology developed rapidly with the widespread use of the [[cross-bow]] and ever more powerful [[artillery]], as the city-states of Italy were usually in conflict with one another. Powerful families like the [[Medici]] were strong patrons of the arts and sciences. [[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement.

==== Age of Exploration ====
{{Main|Age of Exploration}}

An improved sailing ship, the (nau or [[carrack]]), enabled the [[Age of Exploration]] with the [[European colonization of the Americas]], epitomized by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[New Atlantis]]''. Pioneers like [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Cabral]], [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] and [[Christopher Columbus]] explored the world in search of new trade routes for their goods and contacts with Africa, India and China to shorten the journey compared with traditional routes overland. They produced new maps and charts which enabled following mariners to explore further with greater confidence. Navigation was generally difficult, however, owing to the [[History of longitude|problem of longitude]] and the absence of accurate [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]]. European powers rediscovered the idea of the [[civil code]], lost since the time of the Ancient Greeks.

====Pre-Industrial Revolution====
The [[stocking frame]], which was invented in 1598, increased a knitter's number of knots per minute from 100 to 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mines were becoming increasingly deep and were expensive to drain with horse powered bucket and chain pumps and wooden piston pumps. Some mines used as many as 500 horses. Horse-powered pumps were replaced by the [[Thomas Savery#First steam engine mechanism|Savery steam pump]] (1698) and the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engine]] (1712).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Industrial Revolution]] is characterized by developments in the areas of textile machinery, [[mining]], [[metallurgy]] and [[transport]] the [[steam engine]] and the invention of [[machine tool]]s.

Before invention of machinery to spin yarn and weave cloth, spinning was done the spinning wheel and weaving done on a hand and foot operated loom. It took from three to five spinners to supply one weaver.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David. S.|year= 1969|publisher =Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location= Cambridge, NY|isbn=  978-0521094184|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ayres| first = Robert | title =Technological Transformations and Long Waves| year = 1989 |page= | url = http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] in 1733 doubled the output of a weaver, creating a shortage of spinners. The [[spinning frame]] for wool was invented in 1738. The [[spinning jenny]], invented in 1764, was a machine that used multiple spinning wheels; however, it produced low quality thread. The [[water frame]] patented by Richard Arkwright in 1767, produced a better quality thread than the spinning jenny. The [[spinning mule]], patented in 1779 by [[Samuel Crompton]], produced a high quality thread.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"/&gt; The [[power loom]] was invented by Edmund Cartwright in 1787.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"/&gt;

In the mid 1750s the steam engine was applied to the water power-constrained iron, copper and lead industries for powering blast bellows. These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping. Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768. Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed. (Lime rich slag was not free-flowing at the previously used temperatures.) With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron. Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel. As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution was driven by cheap energy in the form of [[coal]], produced in ever-increasing amounts from the abundant resources of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Coal converted to [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] fueled higher temperature [[blast furnace]]s and produced [[cast iron]] in much larger amounts than before, allowing the creation of a  range of structures such as [[The Iron Bridge]]. Cheap coal meant that industry was no longer constrained by water resources driving the mills, although it continued as a valuable source of power. The steam engine helped drain the mines, so more coal reserves could be accessed, and the output of coal increased. The development of the high-pressure steam engine made locomotives possible, and a transport revolution followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title='The Mechanical Age': technology, innovation and industrialisation|url=https://eastanglia.academia.edu/EmmaGriffin/Books|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|publisher=Palgrave|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[steam engine]] which had existed since the early 18th century, was practically applied to both [[steamboat]] and [[railway]] transportation. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], the first purpose built railway line, opened in 1830, the [[Rocket locomotive]] of [[Robert Stephenson]] being one of its first working [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] used.

Manufacture of ships' pulley [[Block and tackle|blocks]] by all-metal machines at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in 1803 instigated the age of sustained [[mass production]]. [[Machine tools]] used by engineers to manufacture parts began in the first decade of the century, notably by [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. The development of [[interchangeable parts]] through what is now called the [[American system of manufacturing]] began in the firearms industry at the U.S Federal arsenals in the early 19th century, and became widely used by the end of the century.

=== Second Industrial Revolution (1860s–1914) ===
{{main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Stephenson's Rocket.jpg|thumb|left|The preserved ''Rocket'']]

The 19th century saw astonishing developments in transportation, construction, manufacturing and communication technologies originating in Europe. After a recession at the end of the 1830s and a general slowdown in major inventions, the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] was a period of rapid innovation and industrialization that began in the 1860s or around 1870 and lasted until [[World War I]]. It included rapid development of chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel technologies connected with highly structured technology research.

[[Telegraphy]] developed into a practical technology in the 19th century to help run the railways safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Visible Hand: The Management Revolution in American Business |last=Chandler Jr. |first= Alfred D. |year= 1993|publisher =Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn= 978-0674940529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the development of telegraphy was the patenting of the first [[telephone]]. March 1876 marks the date that Alexander Graham Bell officially patented his version of an "electric telegraph". Although Bell is noted with the creation of the telephone, it is still debated about who actually developed the first working model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-greatest-inventions-of-the-19th-century.php|title=Top 10 Greatest Inventions of the 19th Century |date=2010-08-09|work=Toptenz.net|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on improvements in vacuum pumps and materials research, [[incandescent light bulb]]s became practical for general use in the late 1870s. This invention had a profound effect on the workplace because factories could now have second and third shift workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA, USA and London, England |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoe production was mechanized during the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States|last=Thomson |first= Ross |authorlink= |year= 1989|publisher =University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0807818671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass production of [[sewing machine]]s and [[agricultural machinery]] such as reapers occurred in the mid to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles were mass-produced beginning in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"/&gt;

Steam-powered factories became widespread, although the conversion from water power to steam occurred in England before in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ironclad warship]]s were found in battle starting in the 1860s, and played a role in the opening of Japan and China to trade with the West.

=== 20th century ===

[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11|Landing on the Moon]]]]

20th-century technology developed rapidly. Broad teaching and implementation of the [[scientific method]], and increased research spending contributed to the advancement of modern science and technology. New technology improved communication and transport, thus spreading technical understanding.

[[Mass production]] brought [[automobile]]s and other high-tech goods to masses of consumers. [[Military research]] and development sped advances including electronic [[computing]] and [[jet engine]]s. [[Radio]] and [[telephony]] improved greatly and spread to larger populations of users, though near-universal access would not be possible until [[mobile phones]] became affordable to [[developing world]] residents in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

Energy and engine technology improvements included [[nuclear power]], developed after the [[Manhattan project]] which heralded the new [[Atomic Age]]. [[Rocket]] development led to long range missiles and the first [[space age]] that lasted from the 1950s with the launch of Sputnik to the mid-1980s.

[[Electrification]] spread rapidly in the 20th century. At the beginning of the century electric power was for the most part only available to wealthy people in a few major cities such as New York, London, Paris, and Newcastle upon Tyne, but by the time the [[World Wide Web]] was invented in 1990 an estimated 62 percent of homes worldwide had electric power, including about a third of households in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyfordevelopment.com/2014/11/rural-electrification-by-numbers-1970_2.html|title=Two Billion People Gain Electricity Access: 1970–2010|website=www.energyfordevelopment.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rural developing world.

[[Birth control]] also became widespread during the 20th century. [[Electron microscopes]] were very powerful by the late 1970s and genetic theory and knowledge were expanding, leading to developments in [[genetic engineering]].

The first "[[test tube baby]]" [[Louise Brown]] was born in 1978, which led to the first successful [[gestational surrogacy]] pregnancy in 1985 and the first pregnancy by [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] in 1991, which is the implanting of a single sperm into an egg. [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] was first performed in late 1989 and led to successful births in July 1990. These procedures have become relatively common.

The massive data analysis resources necessary for running transatlantic research programs such as the [[Human Genome Project]] and the [[Large Electron-Positron Collider]] led to a necessity for distributed communications, causing Internet protocols to be more widely adopted by researchers and also creating a justification for [[Tim Berners-Lee]] to create the [[World Wide Web]].

[[Vaccination]] spread rapidly to the developing world from the 1980s onward due to many successful humanitarian initiatives, greatly reducing childhood mortality in many poor countries with limited medical resources.

The US [[National Academy of Engineering]], by expert vote, established the following ranking of the most important technological developments of the 20th century:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greatest Engineering Achievements of the 20th Century|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/|website=greatachievements.org|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===

[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|thumb|The [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s have provided huge amounts of information by functioning well beyond NASA's original lifespan estimates.]]

{{Main|2000s in science and technology}}

In the early 21st century research is ongoing into [[quantum computers]], [[gene therapy]] (introduced 1990), [[3D printing]] (introduced 1981), [[nanotechnology]] (introduced 1985), [[bioengineering]]/[[biotechnology]], [[nuclear technology]], [[Materials science|advanced materials]] (e.g., graphene), the [[scramjet]] and [[Unmanned combat air vehicle|drones]] (along with [[railgun]]s and high-energy laser beams for military uses), [[superconductivity]], the [[memristor]], and green technologies such as [[alternative fuel]]s (e.g., [[fuel cells]], self-driving electric and plug-in hybrid cars), [[augmented reality]] devices and [[wearable electronics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and more efficient and powerful [[LEDs]], [[solar cells]], [[integrated circuits]], [[wireless power]] devices, engines, and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].

Perhaps the greatest research tool built in the 21st century is the [[Large Hadron Collider]], the largest single machine ever built. The understanding of [[particle physics]] is expected to expand with better instruments including larger [[particle accelerator]]s such as the LHC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Largest Science Experiment comes to Northern Ireland|url=https://www.stfc.ac.uk/2668.aspx|website=Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council|accessdate=9 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413064023/https://www.stfc.ac.uk/2668.aspx|archivedate=13 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and better [[neutrino detector]]s. [[Dark matter]] is sought via underground detectors and observatories like [[LIGO]] have started to detect [[gravitational wave]]s.

Genetic engineering technology continues to improve, and the importance of [[epigenetics]] on development and inheritance has also become increasingly recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/nov/cover|title=DNA Is Not Destiny: The New Science of Epigenetics |publisher=DiscoverMagazine.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New [[spaceflight]] technology and [[spacecraft]] are also being developed, like the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] and [[Dragon V2|Dragon]]. New, more capable [[Space observatory|space telescopes]], such as the [[James Webb Space Telescope|James Webb Telescope]], to be launched to orbit in early 2021, and the [[Extremely large telescope#Colossus Telescope|Colossus Telescope]] are being designed. The [[International Space Station]] was completed in the 2000s, and [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] plan a [[manned mission to Mars]] in the 2030s. The [[Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket]] (VASIMR) is an electro-magnetic thruster for spacecraft propulsion and is expected to be tested in 2015.

[[Breakthrough Initiatives]], together with famed physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], plan to send [[Breakthrough Starshot|the first ever spacecraft to visit another star]], which will consist of numerous super-light chips driven by [[Electric propulsion]] in the 2030s, and receive images of the [[Proxima Centauri]] system, along with, possibly, the [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets|potentially habitable planet]] [[Proxima Centauri b]], by midcentury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3|title=Breakthrough Initiatives|website=breakthroughinitiatives.org|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2004 saw the [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|first manned commercial spaceflight]] when [[Mike Melvill]] crossed the [[boundary of space]] on June 21, 2004.

'''Indian Veterinary Research Institute''' ('''IVRI''') is located at [[Izatnagar]], [[Bareilly]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] state.  It is [[India]]'s premier advanced research facility in the field of [[veterinary medicine]] and allied branches.  It has regional campuses at [[Mukteshwar]], [[Bangalore]], [[Palampur]], [[Bhopal]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Srinagar]].  Formerly known as Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, it was renamed in 1925 as Imperial Veterinary Research Institute. The name of the Institute was changed following independence to Indian Veterinary Research Institute.  Administrative control of the Institute is currently under [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research|Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)]], [[New Delhi]]. The Ministry of Education, Govt. of India on the recommendation of University Grants Commission conferred the status of the [[Deemed university|Deemed]] to be University on 16 November 1983 under Section 3 of UGC Act 1956.

The '''''Inscriptiones Graecae''''' ('''IG'''), [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Greek inscriptions'', is an academic project originally begun by the [[Prussian Academy of Science]], and today continued by its successor organisation, the ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften''. Its aim is to collect and publish all known [[ancient]] [[inscriptions]] from the mainland and islands of [[Greece]].

The project was designed as a continuation of the ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'' (''Corpus of Greek Inscriptions'', abbreviated CIG) published by [[August Böckh]] between 1825 and 1860, and as a parallel to the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' (''Corpus of Latin Inscriptions'') founded by [[Theodor Mommsen]] in 1847. From 1860 to 1902, it was directed by [[Adolf Kirchhoff]]. From 1902 to 1931, [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] was in control of the project; he reorganised and re-energised the IG, turning it into one of the most important series for the publication of source material in [[Classical studies]].

After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the project suffered from a lack of financial and motivational support. It came to a temporary halt in 1972, but was revived by the newly reformed Berlin-Brandenburg Academy in 1994.

So far, 49 [[fascicle (book)|fascicle]]s have been published, some of them in several editions. The preparation of individual volumes is partially entrusted to external scholars, in which case the Berlin Academy retains the final [[editing]]. The Academy also maintains a collection of [[squeeze (copying method)|"squeezes"]] (paper copies) of Greek inscriptions. The project is currently directed by [[Peter Funke]]. Editors of previous volumes include [[Wilhelm Dittenberger]], [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]], [[Johannes Kirchner]] and [[Günther Klaffenbach]].

All editorial texts are published in [[Latin language|Latin]], a fact that is occasionally criticised in view of the decreasing use of that language and the extra effort required from editors. The inscriptions were published without translation, but [[German language|German]] translations for all volumes since 2012 are available on the IG website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87488">'''Italian Renaissance painting''' is the painting of the period beginning in the late 13th century and flourishing from the early 15th to late 16th centuries, occurring in the Italian peninsula, which was at that time divided into many political states, some independent but others controlled by external powers. The painters of Renaissance Italy, although often attached to particular courts and with loyalties to particular towns, nonetheless wandered the length and breadth of Italy, often occupying a diplomatic status and disseminating artistic and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Antonello da Messina who travelled from Sicily to Venice via Naples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Florence]] in [[Tuscany]] is renowned as the birthplace of the [[Renaissance]], and in particular of Renaissance painting, although later in the era Rome and Venice assumed increasing importance in painting. A detailed background is given in the companion articles Renaissance and [[Renaissance architecture]].

Italian Renaissance painting is most often be divided into four periods: the Proto-Renaissance (1300–1425), the Early Renaissance (1425–1495), the [[High Renaissance]] (1495–1520), and [[Mannerism]] (1520–1600). The dates for these periods represent the overall trend in Italian painting and do not cover all painters as the lives of individual artists and their personal styles overlapped these periods.  

The Proto-Renaissance begins with the professional life of the painter [[Giotto]] and includes [[Taddeo Gaddi]], [[Orcagna]] and [[Altichiero]].
The Early Renaissance style was started by [[Masaccio]] and then further developed by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Verrocchio]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].  The High Renaissance period was that of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Coreggio]], [[Giorgione]], the latter works of [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]].  The Mannerist period, dealt with in a separate article, included the latter works of [[Michelangelo]], as well as [[Pontormo]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Bronzino]] and [[Tintoretto]].

The influences upon the development of Renaissance painting in Italy are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government and other aspects of society. The following is a summary of points dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.

===Philosophy===
A number of Classical texts, that had been lost to Western European scholars for centuries, became available. These included Philosophy, Poetry, Drama, Science, a thesis on the Arts and Early Christian Theology.  The resulting interest in [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosophy meant that man's relationship with humanity, the universe and with God was no longer the exclusive province of the Church. A revived interest in the [[Classical literature|Classics]] brought about the first archaeological study of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and sculptor [[Donatello]]. The revival of a style of architecture based on classical precedents inspired a corresponding classicism in painting, which manifested itself as early as the 1420s in the paintings of [[Masaccio]] and [[Paolo Uccello]].

===Science and technology===
Simultaneous with gaining access to the Classical texts, Europe gained access to advanced mathematics which had its provenance in the works of [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine]] and Islamic scholars.
The advent of movable type [[printing]] in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broad public. The development of [[oil paint]] and its introduction to Italy had lasting effects on the art of painting.

===Society===
The establishment of the [[Medici]] Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, [[Florence]]. [[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder|Cosimo de' Medici]] set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy. The [[serendipity|serendipitous]] presence within the region of [[Florence]] of certain individuals of artistic genius, most notably [[Giotto]], [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], formed an ethos that supported and encouraged many lesser artists to achieve work of extraordinary quality.&lt;ref name=Hartt&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar heritage of artistic achievement occurred in [[Venice]] through the talented [[Jacopo Bellini|Bellini]] family, their influential inlaw [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]] and [[Tintoretto]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB&gt;Michael Baxandall, ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Aston, ''The Fifteenth Century, the Prospect of Europe'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

Much painting of the Renaissance period was commissioned by or for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. These works were often of large scale and were frequently cycles painted in [[fresco]] of ''the Life of Christ'', the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' or the life of a saint, particularly [[St. Francis of Assisi]]. There were also many [[allegory|allegorical]] paintings on the theme of [[Salvation]] and the role of the Church in attaining it. Churches also commissioned [[altarpiece]]s, which were painted in [[tempera]] on [[panel painting|panel]] and later in [[oil paint|oil]] on [[canvas]]. Apart from large altarpieces, small devotional pictures were produced in very large numbers, both for churches and for private individuals, the most common theme being the ''Madonna and Child''.

Throughout the period, civic commissions were also important. Local government buildings were decorated with frescoes and other works both secular, such as [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''[[The Allegory of Good and Bad Government]]'', and religious, such as [[Simone Martini]]'s fresco of the ''[[Maestà (Simone Martini)|Maestà]]'', in the [[Palazzo Pubblico]], [[Siena]].

Portraiture was uncommon in the 14th and early 15th centuries, mostly limited to civic commemorative pictures such as the equestrian portraits of Guidoriccio da Fogliano by [[Simone Martini]], 1327, in Siena and, of the early 15th century, [[John Hawkwood]] by [[Uccello]] in [[Florence Cathedral]] and its companion portraying [[Niccolò da Tolentino]] by [[Andrea del Castagno]].

During the 15th century portraiture became common, initially often formalised profile portraits but increasingly three-quarter face, bust-length portraits. Patrons of art works such as altarpieces and fresco cycles often were included in the scenes, a notable example being the inclusion of the Sassetti and [[Medici]] families in [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s cycle in the [[Sassetti Chapel]]. Portraiture was to become a major subject for High Renaissance painters such as [[Raphael]] and [[Titian]] and continue into the Mannerist period in works of artists such as [[Bronzino]].

With the growth of [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanism]], artists turned to Classical themes, particularly to fulfill commissions for the decoration of the homes of wealthy patrons, the best known being [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]] ''for the Medici. Increasingly, Classical themes were also seen as providing suitable allegorical material for civic commissions. Humanism also influenced the manner in which religious themes were depicted, notably on [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Ceiling of the Sistine Chapel]]''.

Other motifs were drawn from contemporary life, sometimes with allegorical meaning, some sometimes purely decorative. Incidents important to a particular family might be recorded like those in the ''[[Camera degli Sposi]]'' that [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] painted for the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] family at [[Mantua]]. Increasingly, still lifes and decorative scenes from life were painted, such as ''the Concert'' by [[Lorenzo Costa]] of about 1490.

Important events were often recorded or commemorated in paintings such as Uccello's ''[[Battle of San Romano]]'', as were important local religious festivals. History and historic characters were often depicted in a way that reflected on current events or on the lives of current people. Portraits were often painted of contemporaries in the guise of characters from history or literature.  The writings of [[Dante]], Voragine's ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and [[Boccaccio]]'s Decameron were important sources of themes.

In all these subjects, increasingly, and in the works of almost all painters, certain underlying painterly practices were being developed: the observation of nature, the study of anatomy, of light, and perspective.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Christiansen, ''Italian Painting'', (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions of 13th-century Tuscan painting===
The art of the region of Tuscany in the late 13th century was dominated by two masters of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] style, [[Cimabue]] of [[Florence]] and [[Duccio]] of [[Siena]]. Their commissions were mostly religious paintings, several of them being very large altarpieces showing the Madonna and Child. These two painters, with their contemporaries, [[Guido of Siena]], [[Coppo di Marcovaldo]] and the mysterious painter upon whose style the school may have been based, the so-called Master of St Bernardino, all worked in a manner that was highly formalised and dependent upon the ancient tradition of icon painting.&lt;ref&gt;John White, ''Duccio'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; In these [[tempera]] paintings many of the details were rigidly fixed by the subject matter, the precise position of the hands of the Madonna and Christ Child, for example, being dictated by the nature of the blessing that the painting invoked upon the viewer. The angle of the Virgin's head and shoulders, the folds in her veil, and the lines with which her features were defined had all been repeated in countless such paintings. Cimabue and Duccio took steps in the direction of greater naturalism, as did their contemporary, [[Pietro Cavallini]] of Rome.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

===Giotto===
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -36- - Lamentation (The Mourning of Christ) adj.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Giotto]]: ''The Lamentation'', c. 1305, [[Scrovegni Chapel]], foreshadows the Renaissance.|alt= Square fresco.

[[Giotto]], (1266–1337), by tradition a shepherd boy from the hills north of Florence, became Cimabue's apprentice and emerged as the most outstanding painter of his time.&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', (1568)&lt;/ref&gt; Giotto, possibly influenced by [[Pietro Cavallini]] and other Roman painters, did not base the figures he painted upon any painterly tradition, but upon the observation of life. Unlike those of his Byzantine contemporaries, Giotto's figures are solidly three-dimensional; they stand squarely on the ground, have discernible anatomy and are clothed in garments with weight and structure. But more than anything, what set Giotto's figures apart from those of his contemporaries are their emotions. In the faces of Giotto's figures are joy, rage, despair, shame, spite and love. The cycle of [[fresco]]es of ''the Life of Christ'' and ''the Life of the Virgin'' that he painted in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] set a new standard for narrative pictures. His ''Ognissanti Madonna'' hangs in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence, in the same room as Cimabue's ''Santa Trinita Madonna'' and Duccio's ''Ruccellai Madonna'' where the stylistic comparisons between the three can easily be made.&lt;ref&gt;All three are reproduced and compared at [[Italian Renaissance painting, development of themes]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the features apparent in Giotto's work is his observation of naturalistic perspective. He is regarded as the herald of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=Eimerl&gt;Sarel Eimerl, The World of Giotto, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

The light from the angel touches the mountainside, figures and sheep.]]

===Giotto's contemporaries===
Giotto had a number of contemporaries who were either trained and influenced by him,  or whose observation of nature had led them in a similar direction. Although several of Giotto's pupils assimilated the direction that his work had taken, none was to become as successful as he. [[Taddeo Gaddi]] achieved the first large painting of a night scene in an ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' in the [[Baroncelli Chapel]] of the Church of Santa Croce, Florence.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

The paintings in the ''Upper Church'' of the [[Basilica of St. Francis, Assisi]], are examples of naturalistic painting of the period, often ascribed to Giotto himself, but more probably the work of artists surrounding [[Pietro Cavallini]].&lt;ref name=Eimerl/&gt; A late painting by [[Cimabue]] in the ''Lower Church'' at Assisi, of the ''Madonna and St. Francis'', also clearly shows greater naturalism than his panel paintings and the remains of his earlier frescoes in the upper church.

===Mortality and redemption===
[[File:Orcagna Triumph of Death detail 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Orcagna]]: ''The Triumph of Death'' (detail), c.&amp;nbsp;1350, Museum of Santa Croce|alt= A small section of a badly damaged fresco showing people who are doomed to Hell. While horrible demons are clutching at them, the humans are intent on pursuing their evil ways of murder and seduction, seeming ignorant of their precarious state on the edge of a pit.]]
A common theme in the decoration of Medieval churches was the ''[[Last Judgement]]'', which in northern European churches frequently occupies a sculptural space above the west door, but in Italian churches such as Giotto's [[Scrovegni Chapel]], is painted on the inner west wall. The [[Black Death]] of 1348 caused its survivors to focus on the need to approach death in a state of penitence and absolution. The inevitability of death, the rewards for the penitent and the penalties of sin were emphasised in a number of frescoes, remarkable for their grim depictions of suffering and their surreal images of the torments of [[Hell]].

These include the ''Triumph of Death'' by Giotto's pupil [[Orcagna]], now in a fragmentary state at the Museum of Santa Croce, and the ''Triumph of Death'' in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] at [[Pisa]] by an unknown painter, perhaps [[Francesco Traini]] or [[Buonamico Buffalmacco]] who worked on the other three of a series of frescoes on the subject of Salvation. It is unknown exactly when these frescoes were begun but it is generally presumed they post-date 1348.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

Two important fresco painters were active in [[Padua]] in the late 14th century, [[Altichiero]] and [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]]. Giusto's masterpiece, the decoration of the [[Padua Cathedral|Cathedral]]'s Baptistery, follows the theme of humanity's Creation, Downfall and Salvation, also having a rare [[Apocalypse]] cycle in the small chancel. While the whole work is exceptional for its breadth, quality and intact state, the treatment of human emotion is conservative by comparison with that of [[Altichiero]]'s ''Crucifixion'' at the [[Basilica of Sant'Antonio]], also in [[Padua]]. Giusto's work relies on formalised gestures, where Altichiero relates the incidents surrounding Christ's death with great human drama and intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Mgr. Giovanni Foffani, ''Frescoes by Giusto de' Menabuoi'', (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florence, at the ''Spanish Chapel'' of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Novella|Santa Maria Novella]], Andrea Bonaiuti&lt;!---don't link because it goes to the wrong page.---&gt; was commissioned to emphasise the role of the Church in the redemptive process, and that of the [[Dominican Order]] in particular. His fresco ''Allegory of the Active and Triumphant Church'' is remarkable for its depiction of [[Florence Cathedral]], complete with the dome which was not built until the following century.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

===International Gothic===
During the later 14th century, [[International Gothic]] was the style that dominated Tuscan painting.  It can be seen to an extent in the work of Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which is marked by a formalized sweetness and grace in the figures, and Late Gothic gracefulness in the draperies. The style is fully developed in the works of [[Simone Martini]] and [[Gentile da Fabriano]], which have an elegance and a richness of detail, and an idealised quality not compatible with the starker realities of Giotto's paintings.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

In the early 15th century, bridging the gap between International Gothic and the Renaissance are the paintings of [[Fra Angelico]], many of which, being altarpieces in tempera, show the Gothic love of elaboration, gold leaf and brilliant colour. It is in his frescoes at his [[convent]] of Sant' Marco that Fra Angelico shows himself the artistic disciple of [[Giotto]]. These devotional paintings, which adorn the cells and corridors inhabited by the friars, represent episodes from the life of [[Jesus]], many of them being scenes of ''[[the Crucifixion]]''. They are starkly simple, restrained in colour and intense in mood as the artist sought to make spiritual revelations a visual reality.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, ''Art through the Ages'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florence===
The earliest truly Renaissance images in Florence date from 1401, although they are not paintings. That year a competition was held amongst seven young artists to select the artist to create a pair of bronze doors for the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistry of St. John]], the oldest remaining church in the city.  The competitors were each to design a bronze panel of similar shape and size, representing ''the Sacrifice of Isaac''.

Two of the panels from the competition have survived, those by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. Each panel shows some strongly classicising motifs indicating the direction that art and philosophy were moving, at that time. Ghiberti used the naked figure of Isaac to create a small sculpture in the Classical style. The figure kneels on a tomb decorated with acanthus scrolls that are also a reference to the art of Ancient Rome. In Brunelleschi's panel, one of the additional figures included in the scene is reminiscent of a well-known Roman bronze figure of a boy pulling a thorn from his foot. Brunelleschi's creation is challenging in its dynamic intensity. Less elegant than Ghiberti's, it is more about human drama and impending tragedy.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M&gt;R.E. Wolf and R. Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghiberti won the competition. His first set of [[Baptistry doors]] took 27 years to complete, after which he was commissioned to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground for many of the artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of [[linear perspective]], the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art.

===Masaccio - Brancacci Chapel===
{{main|Brancacci Chapel}}

The first Early Rennaissance frescos or paintings were in started in 1425 when two artists commenced painting a fresco cycle of ''the Life of St. Peter'' in the chapel of the Brancacci family, at the Carmelite Church in Florence. They both were called by the name of Tommaso and were nicknamed [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]], Slovenly Tom and Little Tom.

More than any other artist, Masaccio recognized the implications in the work of Giotto. He carried forward the practice of painting from nature. His frescos demonstrate an understanding of anatomy, of foreshortening, of linear perspective, of light, and the study of drapery. In the [[Brancacci Chapel]], his ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|Tribute Money]]'' fresco has a single vanishing point and uses a strong contrast between light and dark to convey a three-dimensional quality to the work.  As well, the figures of ''[[Adam and Eve]] being expelled from Eden'', painted on the side of the arch into the chapel, are renowned for their realistic depiction of the human form and of human emotion. They contrast with the gentle and pretty figures painted by Masolino on the opposite side of ''Adam and Eve receiving the forbidden fruit''. The painting of the Brancacci Chapel was left incomplete when Masaccio died at 26 in 1428. The ''Tribute Money'' was completed by Masolino while the remainder of the work in the Chapel was finished by [[Filippino Lippi]] in the 1480s. Masaccio's work became a source of inspiration to many later painters, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name=OC&gt;Ornella Casazza, ''Masaccio and the Brancacci Chapel'', (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of linear perspective===
[[File:Paolo Uccello 043.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|Paolo Uccello: ''The Presentation of the Virgin'' shows his experiments with perspective and light.|alt=Fresco. A scene in muted colours showing the porch of a temple, with a steep flight of steps. The Virgin Mary, as a small child and encouraged by her parents, is walking up the steps towards the High Priest.]]
During the first half of the 15th century, the achieving of the effect of realistic space in a painting by the employment of [[linear perspective]] was a major preoccupation of many painters, as well as the architects [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] who both theorised about the subject. Brunelleschi is known to have done a number of careful studies of the piazza and octagonal baptistery outside [[Florence Cathedral]] and it is thought he aided Masaccio in the creation of his famous [[trompe l'oeil]] niche around the ''Holy Trinity'' he painted at [[Santa Maria Novella]].&lt;ref name=OC/&gt;

According to Vasari, [[Paolo Uccello]] was so obsessed with perspective that he thought of little else and experimented with it in many paintings, the best known being the three [[Battle of San Romano]] paintings (completed by 1450s) which use broken weapons on the ground, and fields on the distant hills to give an impression of perspective.

In the 1450s [[Piero della Francesca]], in paintings such as ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]'', demonstrated his mastery over linear perspective and also over the science of light. Another painting exists, a cityscape, by an unknown artist, perhaps Piero della Francesca, that demonstrates the sort of experiment that Brunelleschi had been making. From this time linear perspective was understood and regularly employed, such as  by [[Perugino]] in his ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter]]'' (1481-82) in the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;

The ruler sits to the left on a throne. The building is Ancient Roman in style. To the right, two richly dressed men and a barefooted youth stand in a courtyard, much closer to the viewer, so appearing larger.]]

===Understanding of light===
[[Giotto]] used tonality to create form. [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in his nocturnal scene in the Baroncelli Chapel demonstrated how light could be used to create drama. [[Paolo Uccello]], a hundred years later, experimented with the dramatic effect of light in some of his almost monochrome frescoes. He did a number of these in ''terra verde'' or "green earth", enlivening his compositions with touches of vermilion. The best known is his equestrian portrait of [[John Hawkwood]] on the wall of [[Florence Cathedral]]. Both here and on the four heads of prophets that he painted around the inner clockface in the cathedral, he used strongly contrasting tones, suggesting that each figure was being lit by a natural light source, as if the source was an actual window in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Annarita Paolieri, ''Paolo Uccello, Domenico Veneziano, Andrea del Castagno'', (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piero della Francesca]] carried his study of light further. In the ''Flagellation'' he demonstrates a knowledge of how light is proportionally disseminated from its point of origin. There are two sources of light in this painting, one internal to a building and the other external. Of the internal source, though the light itself is invisible, its position can be calculated with mathematical certainty. Leonardo da Vinci was to carry forward Piero's work on light.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Murray and Pier Luigi Vecchi, Piero della Francesca, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], revered by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] worldwide, was particularly evoked in Florence, where there was a miraculous image of her on a column in the corn market and where both the Cathedral of "Our Lady of the Flowers" and the large Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] were named in her honour.

The miraculous image in the corn market was destroyed by fire, but replaced with a new image in the 1330s by [[Bernardo Daddi]], set in an elaborately designed and lavishly wrought canopy by [[Orcagna]]. The open lower storey of the building was enclosed and dedicated as [[Orsanmichele]].

Depictions of the [[Madonna and Child]] were a very popular art form in Florence. They took every shape from small mass-produced terracotta plaques to magnificent altarpieces such as those by [[Cimabue]], [[Giotto]] and [[Masaccio]].

In the 15th and first half of the 16th centuries, one workshop more than any other dominated the production of Madonnas. They were the della Robbia family, and they were not painters but modellers in clay. [[Luca della Robbia]], famous for his ''cantoria gallery'' at the cathedral, was the first sculptor to use glazed terracotta for large sculptures. Many of the durable works of this family have survived. The skill of the della Robbias, particularly [[Andrea della Robbia]], was to give great naturalism to the babies that they modelled as [[Jesus]], and expressions of great piety and sweetness to the Madonna. They were to set a standard to be emulated by other artists of Florence.

Among those who painted devotional Madonnas during the Early Renaissance are [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Verrocchio]] and [[Davide Ghirlandaio]]. The custom was continued by Botticelli who produced a series of Madonnas over a period of twenty years for the [[Medici]]; [[Perugino]], whose Madonnas and saints are known for their sweetness and  [[Leonardo da Vinci]], for whom a number of small attributed Madonnas such as the ''[[Benois Madonna]]'' have survived. Even [[Michelangelo]] who was primarily a sculptor, was persuaded to paint the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'', while for [[Raphael]], they are among his most popular and numerous works.

===Andrea Mantegna in Padua and Mantua===
One of the most influential painters of northern Italy was [[Andrea Mantegna]] of [[Padua]], who had the good fortune to be in his teen years at the time in which the great Florentine sculptor [[Donatello]] was working there. Donatello created the enormous equestrian bronze, the first since the Roman Empire, of the condotiero [[Erasmo da Narni|Gattemelata]], still visible on its plinth in the square outside the [[Basilica of Sant'Antonio]]. He also worked on the high altar and created a series of bronze panels in which he achieved a remarkable illusion of depth, with perspective in the architectural settings and apparent roundness of the human form all in very shallow relief.

At only 17 years old, Mantegna accepted his first commission, fresco cycles of the ''Lives of Saints James and Christopher'' for the [[Ovetari Chapel]] in the transept of the[[church of the Eremitani]], near the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in Padua. Unfortunately the building was mostly destroyed during World War II, and they are only known from photographs which reveal an already highly developed sense of perspective and a knowledge of antiquity, for which the ancient University of Padua had become well known, early in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;Diana Davies, Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists, (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
Mantegna's last work in Padua was a monumental  [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno altarpiece]], created for the abbot of the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], [[Verona]] from 1457 to 1459.&lt;ref name=EL/&gt; This polyptych of which the predella panels are particularly notable for the handling of landscape elements, was to influence the further development of Renaissance art in Northern Italy&lt;ref name=EL&gt;Elena Lanzanova, trans. Giorgina Arcuri, ''[http://www.arcadja.com/artmagazine/en/2008/06/23/restoration-of-mantegna’s-san-zeno-altarpiece-in-florence/ Restoration Of Mantegna’S San Zeno Altarpiece In Florence]'', Arcadja, (2008-06-23), (accessed: 2012-07-13)&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000960 metmuseum Madonna and Child with Saints Girolamo dai Libri  (Italian, Verona 1474–1555 Verona), edit: 2000–2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantegna's most famous work is the interior decoration of the [[Camera degli Sposi]] for the [[Gonzaga family]] in [[Mantua]], dated about 1470. The walls are frescoed with scenes of the life of the Gonzaga family, talking, greeting a younger son and his tutor on their return from Rome, preparing for a hunt and other such scenes that make no obvious reference to matters historic, literary, philosophic or religious. They are remarkable for simply being about family life. The one concession is the scattering of jolly winged cherubs who hold up plaques and garlands and clamber on the illusionistic pierced balustrade that surrounds a [[trompe l'oeil]] view of the sky that decks the ceiling of the chamber.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;  Mantegna's main legacy in considered the introduction of spatial illusionism, carried out by a mastery of perspective, both in frescoes and in ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' paintings: his tradition of ceiling decoration was followed for almost three centuries.

===Antonello da Messina===
In 1442 [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] became [[Kingdom of Naples|ruler of Naples]], bringing with him a collection of [[Flemish painting]]s and setting up a [[Humanism|Humanist Academy]]. [[Antonello da Messina]] seems to have had access to the King's collection, which may have included the works of [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence indicates that Antonello was likely in contact with Van Eyck's most accomplished follower, [[Petrus Christus]], in Milan in early 1456 and likely learned the techniques of oil painting, including painting almost microscopic detail and minute gradations of light, directly from Christus.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt;  As well, his works' calmer expressions on peoples' faces and calmness in the works' overall composition also appears to be a Netherlandish influence.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361)&lt;/ref&gt; Antonello went to [[Venice]] in 1475 and remained there until the fall of 1476 so it is likely that Antonello passed on the techniques of using oil paints,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361; Hartt pg. 563&lt;/ref&gt; painting the gradation of light, and the principles of calmness to Venetian Painters, including Giovanni Bellini, one of the most significant painters of the High Renaissance in Northern Italy, during that visit.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 563; Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Antonello painted mostly small meticulous portraits in glowing colours. But one of his most famous works, ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Antonello da Messina)|St. Jerome in His Study]]'', demonstrates his superior ability at handling linear perspective and light. The composition of the small painting is framed by a late Gothic arch, through which is viewed an interior, domestic on one side and ecclesiastic on the other, in the centre of which the saint sits in a wooden corral surrounded by his possessions while his lion prowls in the shadows on the floor. The way the light streams in through every door and window casting both natural and reflected light across the architecture and all the objects would have excited [[Piero della Francesca]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; 

==Progression Towards the High Renaissance==

===Patronage and Humanism===

In Florence, in the later 15th century, most works of art, even those that were done as decoration for churches, were generally commissioned and paid for by private patrons. Much of the patronage came from the Medici family, or those who were closely associated with or related to them, such as the Sassetti, the Ruccellai and the Tornabuoni.

In the 1460s Cosimo de' Medici the Elder had established [[Marsilio Ficino]] as his resident [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosopher, and facilitated his translation of [[Plato]] and his teaching of [[Platonic philosophy]], which focused on humanity as the centre of the natural universe, on each person's personal relationship with God, and on fraternal or "platonic" love as being the closest that a person could get to emulating or understanding the love of God.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;Hugh Ross Williamson, ''Lorenzo the Magnificent'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Medieval]] period, everything related to the Classical period was perceived as associated with paganism. In the Renaissance it came increasingly to be associated with enlightenment. The figures of [[Classical mythology]] began to take on a new symbolic role in Christian art and in particular, the Goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] took on a new discretion. Born fully formed, by a sort of miracle, she was the new [[Eve]], symbol of innocent love, or even, by extension, a symbol of the [[Virgin Mary]] herself. We see Venus in both these roles in the two famous tempera paintings that Botticelli did in the 1480s for Cosimo's nephew, Pierfrancesco Medici, the ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' and the ''[[Birth of Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Baldini, ''Primavera'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], a meticulous and accurate draughtsman and one of the finest portrait painters of his age, executed two cycles of frescoes for Medici associates in two of Florence's larger churches, the [[Sassetti Chapel]] at Santa Trinita and the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]] at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. In these cycles of the ''Life of St Francis'' and the ''Life of the Virgin Mary'' and ''Life of John the Baptist'' there was room for portraits of patrons and of the patrons' patrons. Thanks to Sassetti's patronage, there is a portrait of the man himself, with his employer, [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]], and Lorenzo's three sons with their tutor, the Humanist poet and philosopher, [[Agnolo Poliziano]]. In the Tornabuoni Chapel is another portrait of Poliziano, accompanied by the other influential members of the Platonic Academy including Marsilio Ficino.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

===Flemish influence===
From about 1450, with the arrival in Italy of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Flemish painter]] [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and possibly earlier, artists were introduced to the medium of [[oil paint]]. Whereas both tempera and fresco lent themselves to the depiction of pattern, neither presented a successful way to represent natural textures realistically. The highly flexibly medium of oils, which could be made opaque or transparent, and allowed alteration and additions for days after it had been laid down, opened a new world of possibility to Italian artists.

In 1483 the huge altarpiece of ''[[Portinari Altarpiece|the Adoration of the Shepherds]]'' painted by [[Hugo van der Goes]] arrived in Florence. Painted as early as 1475 at the behest of the Portinari family, it was shipped out from Bruges and installed in the Chapel of Sant' Egidio at the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. The altarpiece glows with intense reds and greens, contrasting with the glossy black velvet robes of the Portinari donors. In the foreground is a [[still life]] of flowers in contrasting containers, one of glazed pottery and the other of glass. The glass vase alone was enough to excite attention. But the most influential aspect of the triptych was the extremely natural and lifelike quality of the three shepherds with stubbly beards, workworn hands and expressions ranging from adoration to wonder to incomprehension. [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] promptly painted his own version, with a beautiful Italian Madonna in place of the long-faced Flemish one, and himself, gesturing theatrically, as one of the shepherds.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;

===Papal commission===
[[File:Entrega de las llaves a San Pedro (Perugino).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Perugino: ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to Peter (Sistine Chapel)|Christ Giving the Keys to Peter]]''|alt=Rectangular fresco. The scene is like Raphael's Marriage of the Virgin, above, which is based on it. There is a similar townscape and circular building in perspective, with an ancient Roman triumphal arch to either side. In the foreground, Jesus gives the keys of Heaven to St Peter, who is kneeling. To the right and left stand the other disciples and some onlookers, who are distinguished by Renaissance clothing. There are many more small figures in the square behind them.]]In 1477 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] replaced the derelict old chapel at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] in which many of the papal services were held. The interior of the new chapel, named the [[Sistine Chapel]] in his honour, appears to have been planned from the start to have a series of 16 large frescoes between its pilasters on the middle level, with a series of painted portraits of popes above them.

In 1480, a group of artists from Florence was commissioned with the work: Botticelli, [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]]. This fresco cycle was to depict ''Stories of the Life of Moses'' on one side of the chapel, and ''Stories of the Life of Christ'' on the other with the frescoes complementing each other in theme. ''The Nativity of Jesus'' and the ''Finding of Moses'' were adjacent on the wall behind the altar, with an [[altarpiece]] of the ''Assumption of the Virgin''  between them. These  paintings, all by Perugino, were later  destroyed to paint Michelangelo's ''Last Judgement''.[[File:Ghirlandaio,_Domenico_-_Calling_of_the_Apostles_-_1481.jpg|thumb|380px|Domenico Ghirlandaio and workshop:''[[Vocation of the Apostles]]'', [[Sistine Chapel]]|alt=Rectangular fresco]]
The remaining 12 pictures indicate the virtuosity that these artists had attained, and the obvious cooperation between individuals who normally employed very different styles and skills. 
The paintings gave full range to their capabilities as they included a great number of figures of men, women and children and characters ranging from guiding angels to enraged [[Pharaoh]]s and the devil himself. Each painting required a [[landscape]]. Because of the scale of the figures that the artists agreed upon, in each picture, the landscape and sky take up the whole upper half of the scene. Sometimes, as in [[Botticelli]]'s scene of ''The Purification of the Leper'', there are additional small narratives taking place in the landscape, in this case ''[[The Temptation of Christ (Sistine Chapel)|The Temptations of Christ]]''.

[[Perugino]]'s scene of ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to Peter (Perugino)|Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter]]''  is remarkable for the clarity and simplicity of its composition, the beauty of the figurative painting, which includes a self-portrait among the onlookers, and especially the perspective cityscape which includes reference to Peter's ministry to Rome by the presence of two [[triumphal arch]]es, and centrally placed an octagonal building that might be a Christian [[baptistry]] or a Roman [[Mausoleum]].&lt;ref name=Giaco&gt;{{cite book|first=Massimo|last= Giacometti|title=The Sistine Chapel|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Renaissance painting==

The High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundrum "Early Renaissance" and "Renaissance and Mannerism" in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', Tashen, 2007. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995. Pg. 308; Wundrum Pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; the realistic depiction of both physical&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  and psychological features,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, [[sfumato]] (softening the transition between colours) and [[chiaroscuro]] (contrast between light and dark),&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 148; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; in a single unifying style&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture''; Harry N. Abrams Incorporated, New York, 1985, pg. 601; Wundrum pg. 147; Marilyn Stokstad ''Art History'', Third Edition, Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, 2008. pg 659&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to a dynamic whole.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, pg. 659 and 662&lt;/ref&gt; Painting of the High Renaissance is considered to be the absolute zenith of western painting&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 145 &lt;/ref&gt; and achieved the balancing and reconciliation, in harmony, of contradictory and seemingly mutually exclusive artistic positions, such as real versus ideal, movement versus rest, freedom versus law, space versus plane, and line versus colour.&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most art historians state that the High Renaissance started around 1495 or 1500&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; David Piper, ''The Illustrated History of Art'', Crescent Books, New York, 1991, pg. 129; Jacob Burchhardt, '' Cinerone'' 1841; Franz Kugler ''Handbook of Art History'' 1841.&lt;/ref&gt; and ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael,&lt;ref&gt;Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; Piper pg. 129; Wurdram pg. 147; Johann Joachim Winklemann, ''Lives of Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' 1672.&lt;/ref&gt; although some say the High Renaissance ended about 1525&lt;ref&gt;Kugler; Honour and Flemming, pg. 466&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1527 with the Sack of Rome by the army of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Lanzi.&lt;/ref&gt; or about 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 310&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cite Leonardo da Vinci's the [[Last Supper|''Last Supper'']], started in 1495 and completed in 1498, as being the first work of the High Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; Piper pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture and Architecture'', 1985, Frederick Hartt states that 1520 to 1530 was a transition period between the High Renaissance and Mannerism.  The High Renaissance was dominated by three painters - Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael; while Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and Titian were the leaders of Venetian High Renaissance painting, with Correggio and Andrea de Sarto being other significant painters of the High Renaissance style.

===Leonardo da Vinci===
[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] (1452-1519) spent his formative years training in the [[Florence]] workshop of [[Verrocchio]] before moving Milan where he worked from 1482-1499 before spending 1500-1506 back in Florence.  Because of the scope of his interests and the extraordinary degree of talent that he demonstrated in so many diverse areas, he is regarded as the archetypal "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]". But it was first and foremost as a painter that he was admired in his own time, and as a painter, he drew on the knowledge he gained from his other interests.
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci 002.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Leonardo da Vinci: ''[[The Last Supper (da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''|alt= Rectangular fresco, in very damaged condition, of the Last Supper. The scene shows a table across a room which has three windows at the rear. At the centre, Jesus sits, stretching out his hands, the left palm up and the right down. Around the table, are the disciples, twelve men of different ages. They are all reacting in surprise or dismay at what Jesus has just said. The different emotional reactions and gestures are portrayed with great naturalism.]]
Leonardo was a scientific observer. He learned by looking at things. He studied and drew the flowers of the fields, the eddies of the river, the form of the rocks and mountains, the way light reflected from foliage and sparkled in a jewel. In particular, he studied the human form, dissecting thirty or more unclaimed [[cadaver]]s from a hospital in order to understand muscles and sinews.

Leonardo achieved a degree of realism in the expression of human emotion, prefigured by Giotto but unknown since Masaccio's ''Adam and Eve''. Leonardo's ''Last Supper'', painted from 1495-1498 in the refectory of a monastery in Milan, became the benchmark for religious narrative painting for the next half millennium.  Many other Renaissance artists painted versions of ''the Last Supper'', but only Leonardo's was destined to be reproduced countless times in wood, alabaster, plaster, lithograph, tapestry, crochet and table-carpets.

More than any other artist, he advanced the study and painting of "atmosphere". In his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (c.1503-1517) and ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' (1483-1486) (the earliest complete work fully of his hand), he used light and shade with such subtlety that, for want of a better word, it became known as Leonardo's "sfumato" or "smoke".  He exhibited a revolutionary use of colour by defining the transition between figures by colour modulation instead of by actual lines.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; His work invited the viewer into a mysterious world of shifting shadows, chaotic mountains and whirling torrents.  Another significant work of Leonardo's was ''[[The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]'' (c.1503-1519); the monumental three-dimensional quality of the group and the calculated effects of dynamism and tension in the composition made it a model that inspired Classicists and the Mannerists in equal measure.&lt;ref&gt;"Leonardo da Vinci" in ''Encyclopedia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the direct impact of the works themselves, Leonardo's studies of light, anatomy, landscape, and human expression were disseminated in part through his generosity to a retinue of students.&lt;ref&gt; name=Vasari/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelangelo===
[[File:Creación de Adám.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Michelangelo: ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''|alt= Rectangular fresco. God is in the act of creating the first man, who lies languidly on the ground, propped on one elbow, and reaching towards God. God, shown as a dynamic elderly man, is reaching his hand from Heaven to touch Adam and fill him with life.]]
In 1508 [[Pope Julius II]] succeeded in getting the Florentine sculptor [[Michelangelo]] (1475-1564) to agree to continue the decorative scheme of the Sistine Chapel. The [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] was constructed in such a way that there were twelve sloping pendentives supporting the vault that formed ideal surfaces on which to paint the [[Twelve Apostles]]. Michelangelo soon devised an entirely different scheme, far more complex both in design and in iconography. The scale of the work, which he executed single handed except for manual assistance, was titanic and took nearly five years to complete.

The Pope's plan for the Apostles would thematically have formed a pictorial link between the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] narratives on the walls, and the popes in the gallery of portraits.&lt;ref name=Giaco/&gt; It is the [[twelve apostles]], and their leader Peter as first Bishop of Rome, that make that bridge. But Michelangelo's scheme  went the opposite direction. The theme of Michelangelo's ceiling is not God's grand plan for humanity's salvation. The theme is about humanity's disgrace. It is about why humanity and the faith needed Jesus.&lt;ref name=TLT&gt;T.L.Taylor, ''The Vision of Michelangelo'', Sydney University, (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Superficially, the ceiling is a [[Humanism|Humanist]] construction. The figures are of superhuman dimension and, in the case of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], of such beauty that according to the biographer [[Vasari]], it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he certainly has not presented the Humanist ideal of [[platonic love]]. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.&lt;ref name=TLT/&gt;

Vasari praised Michelangelo's seemingly infinite powers of invention in creating postures for the figures. [[Raphael]], who was given a preview by [[Bramante]] after Michelangelo had downed his brush and stormed off to Bologna in a temper, painted at least two figures in imitation of Michelangelo's prophets, one at the church of Sant' Agostino and the other in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], his portrait of Michelangelo himself in ''[[The School of Athens]]''.&lt;ref name=Giaco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Bartz and Eberhard König, ''Michelangelo'', (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Goldschieder, ''Michelangelo'', (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's later work, ''The Last Judgement'', painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541, shows a Mannerist style, with generally elongated bodies, which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.

===Raphael===
With [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]]'s (1483-1520) name is synonymous with the High Renaissance, although he was younger than Michelangelo by 18 years and Leonardo by almost 30 and died at the age of 37 just one year after Leonardo. It cannot be said that he greatly advanced the state of painting as his two famous contemporaries did. Rather, his work was the culmination of all the developments of the High Renaissance.

A gloomy figure in the foreground sits leaning on a block of marble.|Raphael: ''The [[School of Athens]]'', commissioned by [[Pope Julius II]] to decorate a suite now known as the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the Vatican]]
Raphael was born the son of a painter, so his career path, unlike that of Michelangelo who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the [[Umbria]]n workshop of [[Perugino]], an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first signed and dated painting, executed at the age of 21, is the ''Betrothal of the Virgin'', which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's ''Christ giving the Keys to Peter''.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; 

Raphael, who moved to Florence in 1504 and to Rome in 1508, unashamedly drew on the skills of the renowned painters whose lifespans encompassed his. In his works the individual qualities of numerous different painters are drawn together. The rounded forms and luminous colours of Perugino, the lifelike portraiture of Ghirlandaio, the realism and lighting of Leonardo, and the powerful draughtsmanship of Michelangelo became unified in the paintings of Raphael. In his short life he executed a number of large altarpieces, an impressive Classical fresco of the sea nymph, Galatea, outstanding portraits with two popes and a famous writer among them, and, while Michelangelo was painting the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], a series of wall frescoes in the Vatican chambers nearby, of which ''the [[School of Athens]]'' (1509-11) in the Stanza della Segnaturais is uniquely significant.

This fresco depicts a meeting of all the most learned ancient Athenians, gathered in a grand classical setting around the central figure of [[Plato]], whom Raphael has famously modelled upon [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The brooding figure of [[Heraclitus]] who sits by a large block of stone, is a portrait of [[Michelangelo]], and is a reference to the latter's painting of the Prophet [[Jeremiah]] in the Sistine Chapel. His own portrait is to the right, beside his teacher, Perugino.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources identify this figure as [[Il Sodoma]], but it is an older, grey-haired man, while Sodoma was in his 30s. Moreover, it strongly resembles several self-portraits of Perugino, who would have been about 60 at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the main source of Raphael's popularity was not his major works, but his small Florentine pictures of the Madonna and Christ Child. Over and over he painted, in slightly different poses, a similar plump, calm-faced blonde woman and her chubby babies the most famous probably being ''La Belle Jardinière'' ("The Madonna of the Beautiful Garden"), now in the [[Louvre]]. His larger work, the ''[[Sistine Madonna]]'', used as a design for countless [[stained glass]] windows, has come, in the 21st century, to provide the iconic image of two small cherubs which has been reproduced on everything from paper table napkins to umbrellas.&lt;ref&gt;David Thompson, ''Raphael, the Life and Legacy'', (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Cuzin, ''Raphael, his Life and Works'', (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giovanni Bellini=== 
[[File:Giovanni bellini, madonna di brera, 1510, 01 adjusted.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Giovanni Bellini: ''[[Madonna and Child (Bellini, Milan, 1510)|The Brera Madonna]]'']]

A large altarpiece in which the Madonna sits on a raised throne, with four saints and an angel as described in the article.]] A leader of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]] of painting, [[Giovanni Bellini]] (1430-1516) was born within a year of his brother [[Gentile Bellini|Gentile]], his brother-in-law [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Antonello da Messina]], but lived a decade longer than the first two and almost three decades longer than the latter.  He was painting right up until his death and his works illustrate several influences. His early works show the influence of Mantegna with incisive lines and clearly delineated colours&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 120; Ruanch pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; while after Messina's stay in Venice in 1475-1476 his works adopted a Flemish-like realism and luminous colours, which shows he was highly successful at adopting the techniques of oil painting brought by Messina.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 655; Wundram pg. 120; Hartt pg. 563&lt;/ref&gt; He was first the teacher of [[Giorgione]]&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Titian]]&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; but was later influenced by Giorgione, most notably in adopting tonalism wherein paint is applied in superimposed layers creating a soft diffused effect so figures and landscapes become more unified in atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi ''One Thousand Years of Painting'', Electa, Milan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bellini became the only great 15th-century painter to cross the threshold from the Early Renaissance to the High Renaissance style with works such as ''[[Portrait of Doge Leonardo Loredan]]'' (1501),&lt;ref&gt; Wundrum Pag. 147 and Pg.121; Hartt, Pg. 645&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the Doge shows a calmness Bellini likely learned from Messina,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Baptism of Christ (Bellini)|Baptism of Christ]]'' (1500–1502). Bellini, like [[Raphael]], also produced numerous small Madonnas in rich glowing colour, usually of more intense tonality than his Florentine counterpart. 

Traditionally, in the painting of altarpieces of the ''Madonna and Child'', the enthroned figure of the Virgin is accompanied by saints, who stand in defined spaces, separated physically in the form of a polytych or defined by painted architectural boundaries. [[Piero della Francesca]] used the Classical niche as a setting for his enthroned Madonnas (with saints grouped around the throne), as [[Masaccio]] had used it as the setting for his ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. 

Bellini used this same form, known as ''Sacred Conversations'', in several of his later altarpieces [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece|such as that]] for the Venetian church of [[San Zaccaria]] (1505). It is a masterful composition which uses tonalism and extends the real architecture of the building into the illusionistic architecture of the painting, making the niche a sort of [[loggia]] opened up to the landscape and to daylight which streams across the figures of the Virgin and Child, the two female saints and the little angel who plays a [[viola]] making them brighter than [[Saint Peter|Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Jerome|Saint Jerome]] in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|title=Giovanni Bellini|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giorgione===

Despite the brevity of his career (he died in 1510 at about 35)&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 682; Hartt pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt; and the low number of works universally agreed to be totally by his hand (as low as 4 or 5),&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgione is often credited as being the founder of the Venetian High Renaissance style,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 645; Raunch pg. 388; Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; although different scholars cite different reasons for asserting this. 

One is his increasing use of gradations of colour and light (colour modulation), including sfumato, often achieved by tonalism,&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt; to define the shapes of figures and landscapes and to create an atmosphere wherein all components of the painting are unified.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Wundram pg. 165; Raunch pg.646; Hartt pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt;  Some believe he may have been taught this by Leonardo da Vinci who is said to have visited Venice in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Wundram pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'', 1505, the use of line and colour modulation are equally balanced but in ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]'', c.1510, colour modulation almost entirely replaces line creating an artistic vision in which humankind and nature are combined.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 145 and pg. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the ''Tempest'' one of the most important paintings produced in Italy as the components are held together by colour and there is a dreamy atmosphere of perfect harmony.&lt;ref&gt; Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgione was the first painter to assign a leading role to nature&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 103; Stokstad pg. 682; Raunch pg. 388)&lt;/ref&gt; and whenever his paintings feature a landscape it becomes an integral part of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388; Hartt pg. 647; Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'', when compared to Giovanni Bellini's similar The ''[[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]]'', illustrates another innovation of Giorgione - adjusting the directions and positions of the figures, such as the lance held by St. Liberale to the left and the folds in the Madonna's robe being placed in parallel, to more unify the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 648; Luffi pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, Giorgione's paintings are always ambiguous in their meaning and open to different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]'', the naked woman feeding a baby and the clothed man, and a flash of lightning, perhaps represents [[Adam and Eve]] in their post-Eden days, or perhaps it does not.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Another painting attributed to him, ''[[The Three Philosophers]]'', may represent the [[Magi]] planning their journey in search of the infant Christ, or it may not.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Raunch pg. 388)&lt;/ref&gt;  None of Giorgione's paintings has ever had a certain interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until recent years, it had appeared certain that Giorgione painted the very first female nude that stands, or rather, lies, as a subject to be portrayed and admired for beauty alone with the ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'', 1510. While it had been long accepted that Titian finished the landscape of the painting after Giorgione's death, many art scholars are increasingly questioning if Giorgione painted the entire female body.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titian===

[[Titian]] (c. 1490-1576) trained in the workshop of Giovanni Bellini alongside Giorgione and then assisted Giorgione.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392; Stokstad pg. 684; Hartt pg. 647; Zuffi pg.128&lt;/ref&gt; Following Giorgione’s death, he was the monarch of the Venetian School for over 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; His early work shows strong influences of Bellini and Giorgione,&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 684; Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; but he soon he took the principles of form and colour announced by those two&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647&lt;/ref&gt; and established colour, not line, as the major determinant in painting&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Wundram pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; thereby consummating the Venetian High Renaissance style.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by applying colours of paint paste-like in patches alongside each other with loose and sweeping brush strokes.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 393; Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; This brought out the light and colour in equal measure at the same time;&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 396&lt;/ref&gt; he was famous in his own day as the master of light and colour.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 684&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strength of Titian was the composition of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;(Wundram  pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pesaro Madonna]], 1519-1526, he moves the Madonna from the centre instead placing her at the upper vertex of a powerful diagonal line (as opposed to the usual vertical or horizontal) which still focuses the attention on the Madonna.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 393; Stokstad 684&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first works to group figures in an circular, ascending  structure.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]], 1516-1518, also features diagonal lines (shaped by the cherubs located around the Virgin) which carries the triumphant message of the painting upward into the upper levels of the Church of Frari in Venice on whose altar it stands.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg.649&lt;/ref&gt; This work was the first to have visual suggestion of movement;&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt; all of Titian’s works have a new dynamism in the movements of people compared to the static elements of other High Renaissance painters.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 176; Raunch pg. 393&lt;/ref&gt; The Assumption of the Virgin also features, like all of his paintings, glowing, deep, rich colours due to Titian’s applying layer after layer of paint, sometimes of different colours.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 649; Stokstad pg. 685&lt;/ref&gt;  

Titian was also the most sought after portraitist of his time and brought portraiture to the same level of esteem as narrative painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Highly notable are the ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles V]]'',1548, an equestrian picture in a symphony of purples, and the portrait of Doge [[Andrea Gritti]], ruler of Venice, perhaps Titian's most powerful portrait.  

As Titian aged, he maintained a generally High Renaissance style until his last years, when figure was almost completed dissolved in the movement of colour,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 650&lt;/ref&gt; so he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of Italian painting which had moved almost completely towards Mannerism by 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, Titian can be considered the founder of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correggio===

[[File:Cathedral (Parma) - Assumption by Correggio.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Correggio:  ''[[Assumption of the Virgin]]]]

[[Correggio]] (1489-1534), who never visited Rome, but must have seen the works of the Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian, worked in a personal High Renaissance style in Parma in Northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 638; Raunch pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; He invented the open heaven filled with floating figures church dome which became a hallmark of the 17th Century Baroque period with his [[Vision of St. John on Patmos|''Vision of St. John the Evangelist'']], 1520-1524, in Parma’s San Giovanni Evangelista, and the [[Assumption of the Virgin (Correggio)|''Assumption of the Virgin'']], 1526-1530, in Parma Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 639; Raunch pg. 383; Stokstad pg. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  One art scholar states that in the latter, Correggio creates a “dazzling illusion:  the architecture of the dome seems to dissolve and the form seems to explode through the building drawing the viewer up into the swirling vortex of saints and angels who rush upwards to accompany the Virgin in to heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  

In those domes and other works, his bold use of perspective, usually by setting a dark colour against light colours to enhance the illusion of depth, is described as astonishing.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 638; Zuffi pg. 132; Raunch pg.383; Janson pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt; His chief interest was painting light and he anticipates the effects to be achieved by Caravaggio at the start of the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; His mastery of foreshortening (causing objects to look shorter because they are angled to the viewer) to create perspective is described as perhaps the most skillful ever.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Hartt pg. 638&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Jupiter and Io]]'', 1531-1532, Correggio painted a strong contrast between the luminous figure of Io and the soft but dark clouds filling the sky,&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 174&lt;/ref&gt; which seem to envelop Io’s gleaming body.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio was able to execute the diffuse effect of clouds, haze or mist perfectly&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; and together with colour modulation infuses his characters with a distinct sense of weightlessness.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 174; Janson pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt;  He painted flesh in a delicate, voluptuous manner that has never been surpassed&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 639&lt;/ref&gt; and presents a new concept of feminine beauty only rediscovered during the Rococo period.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Zuffi pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio had many pupils but none carried on his style but he prefigured many components of Baroque painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Janson pg. 518&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Significant High Renaissance Painters===

[[Andrea del Sarto]] (1486-1530), a Florentine, drew upon both Michelangelo and Raphael in his work, but went far beyond them in the portrayal of facial expressions and gestures, as evidenced in ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'',1517.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; His figures show a greater individuality than earlier High Renaissance works while losing none of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s, he remained faithful to the ideals of the High Renaissance, such as in paintings’ compositions&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and with the faces of his figures usually being calm and often beautiful, showing none of the torment of his Mannerist contemporaries,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 635&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom were his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lorenzo Lotto]] (1480-1556), one of the most important High Renaissance painters in Venice,&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 724&lt;/ref&gt; also spent time in other areas of Northern Italy as, perhaps due to his greater focus on realist detail and on line than rather than colour compared to the Venetian school, he was not much appreciated in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 126; Raunch 398&lt;/ref&gt; While he painted a variety of subjects, he was an excellent portrait painter who had a superior ability to see into the soul of his subjects and to portray a depth of feeling in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch 398; Zuffi pg. 127&lt;/ref&gt; He usually included other objects in the background or foreground of the portrait to portray the subject's character.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 127; Raunch pg. 399&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Influence of Italian Renaissance painting==
The lives of both [[Michelangelo]] and [[Titian]] extended well into the second half of the 16th century. Both saw their styles and those of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Antonello da Messina]] and [[Raphael]]  adapted by later painters to form a disparate style known as [[Mannerism]], and move steadily towards the great outpouring of imagination and painterly virtuosity of the [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] period.

The artists who most extended the trends in Titian's large figurative compositions were [[Tintoretto]] and [[Veronese]], although Tintoretto is considered by many to be a Mannerist. [[Rembrandt]]'s knowledge of the works of both Titian and Raphael is apparent in his portraits. The direct influences of Leonardo and Raphael upon their own pupils was to effect generations of artists including [[Poussin]] and schools of Classical painters of the 18th and 19th centuries. Antonello da Messina's work had a direct influence on [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Martin Schongauer]] and through the latter's engravings, countless artists including the German, Dutch and English schools of [[stained glass]] makers extending into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] and later ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' had direct influence on the figurative compositions firstly of Raphael and his pupils and then almost every subsequent 16th-century painter who looked for new and interesting ways to depict the human form. It is possible to trace his style of figurative composition through [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Pontormo]], [[Bronzino]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], to [[el Greco]], [[Carracci family|Carracci]], [[Caravaggio]],  [[Rubens]], [[Poussin]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] to both the [[Classical Revival|Classical]] and the [[Romantic art|Romantic]] painters of the 19th century such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]].

Under the influence of the Italian Renaissance painting, many modern academies of art, such as the [[Royal Academy]], were founded, and it was specifically to collect the works of the Italian Renaissance that some of the world's best known art collections, such as the [[National Gallery, London]], were formed.

'''Kinetic military action''' is a [[euphemism]] for [[military]] action involving active warfare, usually including lethal force. "'''Kinetic'''" was used as a [[Retronym|retronymic]] euphemism for military action in ''Bush at War,'' a 2002 book by [[Bob Woodward]]. Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] used the words "kinetic" and "non-kinetic" often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/11/birth_of_a_washington_word.html|title=Birth of a Washington Word|last=Noah|first=Timothy|date=November 20, 2002|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=October 30, 2017|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is now also commonly used as a contrast to [[cyber warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityweek.com/cyberwar-breaching-kinetic-barrier "Cyberwar: Breaching the Kinetic Barrier"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Cyber-Warfare.htm "A Brief Summary of Cyber Warfare"]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kinetic military action" was used by White House aide [[Ben Rhodes (speechwriter)|Ben Rhodes]] on March 23, 2011 to describe U.S. military action in [[2011 military intervention in Libya|Libya]]:{{Quote|I think what we are doing is enforcing a resolution that has a very clear set of goals, which is protecting the Libyan people, averting a humanitarian crisis, and setting up a no-fly zone...

Retrieved May 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] used "kinetic operations" on a webpage about "[[Operation Inherent Resolve]]". It contained an interactive graphic titled "AIRSTRIKES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA" and captioned "... operations related to [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] since kinetic operations started on Aug. 8, 2014 ...".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2014/0814_iraq/ OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE]".

February 11, 2015 [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] used "kinetic strike" in a letter to Congress. He wanted, among other things, Congress to "authorize the use of U.S. forces [against [[ISIL]]] in ... [ground] missions to enable kinetic strikes".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/11/letter-president-authorization-use-united-states-armed-forces-connection Letter from the President -- Authorization for the Use of United States Armed Forces in connection with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]".

December 2, 2015 [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] spoke after attending a series of [[NATO]] meetings in Brussels, “There are various ways in which countries can contribute; they don’t necessarily have to be troops, engaged in kinetic action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2471">'''Leave the gate as you found it''' (or '''leave all gates as found''') is an important rule of [[courtesy]] in rural areas throughout the world. If a [[gate]] is found open, it should be left open, and if it is closed, it should be left closed. If a closed gate absolutely must be traversed, it should be closed again afterwards. It applies to visitors travelling onto or across [[farm]]s, [[ranch]]es, and [[Station (Australian agriculture)|stations]].

In low-rainfall areas, closing gates can cut [[livestock]] off from water supplies. For example, most of the land used for grazing in [[Australia]] has no natural water supplies, so drinking water for the stock must be supplied by the farmer or landowner, often by using a [[windmill]] to pump [[groundwater]]. Even visitors who know how a stock water system works may be unaware of breakdowns. During hot weather, [[cattle]] require large quantities of water to drink and can die in less than a day if they don't get it. [[Sheep]] need less water and can survive longer without it, but will die if cut off from water for several hot days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myhorse.com/training/western/an_open_and_shut_gate_on_horseback.aspx#top |title=Open and Shut a Gate Horseback |publisher=MyHorse.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all agricultural areas, farmers need to keep groups of livestock separate, for reasons including [[Selective breeding|breeding]] for disease resistance and increased production, pest control, and controlling when ewes [[lambing|deliver their lambs]]. Unwanted mingling of flocks or herds can deprive a farmer of significant income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beginnercampingtips.com/articles/hiking-and-camping-uk.html |title=Camping Information |publisher=Beginnercampingtips.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original versions of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[The Country Code|Country Code]] advised visitors to always close gates. The revised Countryside Code now suggests that gates should be left as found.

'''Linux color management''' has the same goal as the [[Color Management|color management systems]] (CMS) for other operating systems: to achieve the best possible color reproduction throughout an imaging workflow from its source (camera, video, scanner, etc.), through imaging software ([[Digikam]], [[darktable]], [[RawTherapee]], [[GIMP]], [[Krita]], [[Scribus]], etc.), and finally onto an output medium ([[Computer display|monitor]], [[video projector]], [[Computer printer|printer]], etc.). In particular, color management attempts to enable color consistency across media and throughout a color-managed workflow.

Linux color management relies on the use of accurate ICC ([[International Color Consortium]]) and DCP (DNG Color Profile) profiles describing the behavior of input and output devices, and [[color management|color-managed]] [[Application software|applications]] that are aware of these profiles. These applications perform [[gamut]] conversions between device profiles and [[color space]]s. Gamut conversions, based on accurate device profiles, are the essence of color management.

Historically, color management was not an initial design consideration of the [[X Window System]] on which much of Linux graphics support rests, and thus color-managed workflows have been somewhat more challenging to implement on Linux than on other OS's such as [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[macOS]]. This situation is now being progressively remedied, and color management under Linux, while functional, has not yet acquired mature status. Although it is now possible to obtain a consistent color-managed workflow under Linux, certain problems still remain:
* The absence of a central user control panel for color settings.
* Some hardware devices for color calibration lack Linux drivers, firmware or accessory data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=https://www.argyllcms.com/doc/instruments.html
 | title=ArgyllCMS - Operation of particular instruments
 | date=2017-11-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ICC color profiles are written to an open specification, they are compatible across operating systems. Hence, a profile produced on one OS should work on any other OS given the availability of the necessary software to read it and perform the gamut conversions. This can be used as a workaround for the lack of support for certain spectrophotometers or colorimeters under Linux: one can simply produce a profile on a different OS and then use it in a Linux workflow. Additionally, certain hardware, such as most printers and certain monitors, can be calibrated under another OS and then used in a fully color-managed workflow on Linux.

The popular [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] Linux distribution added initial color management in the 11.10 release (the "Oneiric Ocelot" release).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-p-color-management-next-steps
 | title=Color Management: Next Steps
 | date=2011-10-18
 | accessdate=2011-12-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements for a color-managed workflow ==
* Accurate device profiles obtained with source or output characterization software.
* Correctly loaded video card LUTs (or monitor profiles that do not require LUT adjustments).
* Color-managed applications that are configured to use a correct monitor profile and input/output profiles, with support for control over the rendering intent and black point compensation.

Calibration and profiling requires:
* for input devices (scanner, camera, etc.) a color target which the profiling software will compare to the manufacturer-provided color values of the target.
* or for output devices (monitor, printer, etc.) a reading with a specific device ([[spectrophotometer]], [[Tristimulus colorimeter|colorimeter]] or spectrocolorimeter) of the color patch values and comparing the measured values against the values originally sent for output.

=== Monitor calibration and profiling ===

One of the critical elements in any color-managed workflow is the monitor, because, at one step or another, handling and making color adaptation through imaging software is required for most images, thus the ability of the monitor to present accurate colors is crucial.

Monitor color management consists of calibration and profiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=https://argyllcms.com/doc/calvschar.html
 | title=Calibration vs. Characterization
 | date=2017-11-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=https://displaycal.net/#concept
 | title=Basic concept of display calibration and profiling
 | date=2017-11-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first step, calibration, is done by adjusting the monitor controls and the output of the graphics card (via calibration curves) to match user-definable characteristics, such as brightness, white point and gamma. The calibration settings are stored in a &lt;code&gt;.cal&lt;/code&gt; file. The second step, profiling (characterization), involves measuring the calibrated display's response and recording it in a color profile. The profile is stored in an &lt;code&gt;.icc&lt;/code&gt; file ("ICC file"). For convenience, the calibration settings are usually stored together with the profile in the ICC file.

Note that &lt;code&gt;.icm&lt;/code&gt; files are identical to &lt;code&gt;.icc&lt;/code&gt; files - the difference is only in the name.

Seeing correct colors requires using a monitor profile-aware application, together with the same calibration used when profiling the monitor. Calibration alone does not yield accurate colors. If a monitor was calibrated before it was profiled, the profile will only yield correct colors when used on the monitor with the same calibration (the same monitor control adjustments and the same calibration curves loaded into the video card's lookup table). [[macOS]] has built-in support for loading calibration curves and installing a system-wide color profile. Windows 7 onward allows loading calibration curves, though this functionality must be enabled manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://displaycal.net/#issue-win7-autoloadcalibration | title=MS Windows 7 or later: Calibration does not load automatically on login | date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Linux and older versions of Windows require using a standalone LUT loader.

=== Device profiles ===
ICC profiles are [[cross-platform]] and can thus be created on other operating systems and used under Linux. Monitor profiles, however, require some additional attention. Since a monitor profile depends both on the monitor itself and on the video card, a monitor profile should only be used with the same monitor and video card with which it was created. The monitor settings should not be adjusted after creating the profile. In addition, since most calibration software use LUT adjustments during calibration, the corresponding LUTs must be loaded every time the [[display server]] (X11, Wayland) is started (e.g. with every graphical login).

In the unlikely case of a colorimeter being unsupported by Linux, a profile created under Windows or macOS can be used under Linux.

=== Display-channel lookup tables ===
There are two approaches to loading display channel LUTs:

# Create a profile that does not modify video card LUTs and thus does not require LUTs be loaded later on. Ideally, this approach would rely on [[Display Data Channel|DDC]]-capable monitors—the internal monitor settings of which are set via calibration software. Unfortunately, monitors capable of making these adjustments through [[Display Data Channel|DDC]] are not common and are generally expensive. There is only one calibration software on Linux that can interact with a [[Display Data Channel|DDC]] monitor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.necdisplay.com/press-release/nec-display-solutions-introduces-spectraview-ii%E2%84%A2-a/655 NEC Display Solutions SpectraViewII support for Linux]&lt;/ref&gt; For mainstream monitors, a couple of options exist:
#* BasICColor software, which works with most colorimeters on the market, allows one to adjust display output via the monitor [[Interface (computer science)|interface]], and then to choose a "Profile, do not calibrate" option. By doing this, one can create a profile that does not require [[video card]] LUT adjustments.
#* For EyeOne devices, EyeOne Match allows the user to calibrate to "Native" gamma and white point targets, which results in the LUT adjustment curves displayed after the calibration as a simple, [[linear]] 1:1 mapping (a straight line from corner to corner). 
#* Both BasICColor and EyeOne Match do not presently run under Linux but they are capable of creating a profile that does not require LUT adjustments.
# Use an LUT loader to actually load the LUT adjustments contained within the profile prepared during calibration. According to the documentation, these loaders do not modify the video card LUT by itself, but achieve the same type of adjustment by modifying the X server gamma ramp. Loaders are available for [[Linux distribution]]s that use [[X.Org Server|X.org]] or [[XFree86]]—the two most popular X servers on Linux. Other X servers are not guaranteed to work with the currently available loaders. There are two LUT loaders available for Linux:
#* [https://archive.is/20041204191335/http://www.etg.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de/web/doe/xcalib/ Xcalib] is one such loader, and although it is a command-line utility, it is quite easy to use.
#* [http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/dispwin.html dispwin] is a part of Argyll CMS.
#* If, for any reason, the LUT cannot be loaded, it is still recommended to go through the initial stages of calibration where a user is asked by calibration software to make some manual adjustments to the monitor, as this will often improve display linearity and also provide information on its [[color temperature]]. This is especially recommended for CRT monitors.

=== Color-managed applications ===
In ICC-aware applications, it is important to make sure the correct profiles are assigned to devices, mainly to the monitor and the printer. Some Linux applications can auto-detect the monitor profile, while others requires that it is specified manually.

Although there is no designated place to store device profiles on Linux, &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/color/icc/&lt;/code&gt; has become the ''[[de facto]]'' standard.

Most applications running under [[Wine (software)|WINE]] have not been fully tested for color accuracy. While 8-[[bits per pixel|bpp]] programs can have some color resolution difficulties due to depth conversion errors, colors in higher-depth applications should be accurate, as long as those programs perform their gamut conversions based on the same monitor profile as that used for loading the LUT, granted that the corresponding LUT adjustments are loaded.

== List of software for input and output profiling ==
* [http://www.argyllcms.com/ Argyll Color Management System] (Argyll CMS) is an open-source command line only collection of tools. Argyll CMS covers a wide range of needs from source or output characterization to monitor LUT loading and more. Argyll CMS is available as a package in Ubuntu, [[Debian]], [[openSUSE]] (Build Service) and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] and as a generic x86 Linux binary installation from the web site, along with source code under the [[GPL]].
* [https://displaycal.net/ DisplayCAL] is an open-source display calibration and profiling solution with a [[GUI]] which uses ArgyllCMS at its core. It allows one to calibrate and characterize a display, generate [[ICC profile|ICC profiles]] with optional [[CIECAM02]] [[Color_management#Gamut_mapping|gamut mappings]] and [[3D lookup table|3D LUTs]], generate reports for ICC profiles, measure display device uniformity, create and edit test charts, and among other things even to create synthetic ICC profiles.
* [https://www.ludd.ltu.se/~torger/dcamprof.html DCamProf] is an open-source [[command-line]] tool for generating ICC and DCP (DNG Color Profile) camera profiles from test target measurements or camera spectral sensitivity functions. Features include giving the user control over the matrix and LUT optimizers to hand-tune the trade-off between accuracy and smoothness, profile matching, generating reports for plotting, simulating reflective spectra, analyzing camera color separation performance under different illuminants, and flat-field correction of test-chart photos.

=== Obsolete ===
* [http://lprof.sourceforge.net/ LPROF] (or LCMS Profiler) was a GUI tool for producing profiles for cameras, scanners and monitors. LPROF was originally designed to demonstrate [[LittleCMS]] (LCMS) capabilities. In 2005, LPROF development was resumed by a new team, which released the final version in 2006 when development was abandoned.

== List of LUT loaders ==
A color profile file for a monitor will typically contain two parts:&lt;ref&gt;https://encrypted.pcode.nl/blog/2012/01/29/color-management-on-linux/&lt;/ref&gt;
* The VCGT/LUT part, which does white point correction, and is applied to the screen as a whole.
* The gamma+matrix part, which does gamma/hue/saturation correction, and has to be applied by individual color-managed applications.

In a color-managed setup, the VCGT/LUT part is typically loaded on login, while the filename of the color profile is stored in the &lt;code&gt;_ICC_PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; [[X atom]] so that color managed programs can load that as a default profile for applying gamma+matrix corrections. Some programs also let you override what profile is used for gamma+matrix corrections.
* dispwin, used to load both VCGT/LUT and _ICC_PROFILE atoms at once. Part of ArgyllCMS.
* [https://archive.is/20041204191335/http://www.etg.e-technik.uni-erlangen.de/web/doe/xcalib/ xcalib], a tiny monitor calibration loader for XFree86 (or X.Org) and MS-Windows, which sets the monitor VCGT/LUT part of the color profile
* [https://github.com/agalakhov/xiccd xiccd], a daemon that interacts with [[colord]] and sets the &lt;code&gt;_ICC_PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; X atom to the path of your color profile, for program-specific gamma+matrix corrections. Note that GNOME and KDE already inform colord if you've set a profile in their settings, whereas XFCE has no built-in colord interaction.

colord is a system [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]] that makes it easy to manage, install and generate color profiles to accurately color manage input and output devices. 

colord provides a [[D-Bus]] API for system frameworks to query, e.g. "Get me the profiles for device $foo" or "Create a device and assign it profile $bar."
colord provides a persistent database backed store that is preserved across reboots, and it provides the session for a way to set system settings, for instance setting the display profile for all users and all sessions.

[[GNOME Color Manager]] and colord-kde are graphical tools for colord to be used in the GNOME and KDE desktop environments. Both act as a client to colord.

colord supports the following subsystems:
* [[XRandR]] (monitors)
* [[Scanner Access Now Easy|SANE]] (scanners)
* [[udev]] (cameras)
* [[Common Unix Printing System|CUPS]] (printers)

The '''magnetosheath''' is the region of space between the [[magnetopause]] and the [[bow shock]] of a [[planet|planet's]] [[magnetosphere]]. The regularly organized [[magnetic field]] generated by the planet becomes weak and irregular in the magnetosheath due to interaction with the incoming [[solar wind]], and is incapable of fully deflecting the highly [[charged particle]]s. The density of the particles in this region is considerably lower than what is found beyond the bow shock, but greater than within the [[magnetopause]], and can be considered a transitory state.

[[Image:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere, showing the relative position of the magnetosheath]]

Scientific research into the exact nature of the magnetosheath has been limited due to a longstanding misconception that it was a simple byproduct of the bow shock/magnetopause interaction and had no inherently important properties of its own.  Recent studies indicate, however, that the magnetosheath is a dynamic region of turbulent [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] flow that may play an important role in the structure of the bow shock and the magnetopause, and may help to dictate the flow of energetic particles across those boundaries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The [[Earth]]'s magnetosheath typically occupies the region of space approximately 10 Earth radii on the upwind ([[Sun]]-facing) side of the planet, extending significantly farther out on the downwind side due to the pressure of the solar wind.  The exact location and width of the magnetosheath does depend on variables such as [[Solar variation|solar activity]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6560">A '''modeling perspective''' in [[information system]]s is a particular way to represent pre-selected aspects of a system. Any [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] has a different focus, conceptualization, dedication and visualization of what the [[scientific modelling|model]] is representing. 

The traditional way to distinguish between modeling perspectives is structural, functional and behavioral/processual perspectives. This together with rule, object, communication and actor and role perspectives is one way of classifying modeling approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Krogstie]] (2003). [http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~krogstie/publications/2003/quality-book/b2-languages.pdf Conceptual modeling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316203713/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~krogstie/publications/2003/quality-book/b2-languages.pdf |date=2007-03-16 }}, &lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of perspectives ==
===Structural modeling perspective===
This approach concentrates on describing the static structure. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the entity, this could be an object, phenomena, concept, thing etc. 

The data modeling languages have traditionally handled this perspective, examples of such being:	
*The [[ER model|ER-language]] (Entity-Relationship)
*[[Generic Semantic Modeling language]] (GSM)
*Other approaches including:
:*The NIAM language (Binary relationship language)
:*[[Conceptual graph]]s ([[John Sowa|Sowa]])

Looking at the ER-language we have the basic components:
*Entities:	Distinctively identifiable phenomenon.
*Relationships:	An association among the entities. 
*Attributes:	Used to give value to a property of an entity/relationship.

Looking at the generic semantic modeling language we have the basic components:
*Constructed types built by abstraction: Aggregation, generalization, and association.
*Attributes.
*Primitive types: Data types in GSM are classified into printable and abstract types.
:*Printable: Used to specify visible values.
:*Abstract: Representing entities.

===Functional modeling perspective===
The [[functional model]]ing approach concentrates on describing the dynamic process. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the process, this could be a function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known example of a modeling language employing this perspective is data flow diagrams.

The perspective uses four symbols to describe a process, these being:
*Process: Illustrates transformation from input to output.
*Store:	   Data-collection or some sort of material.
*Flow:	   Movement of data or material in the process.
*External Entity: External to the modeled system, but interacts with it.

Now, with these symbols, a process can be represented as a network of these symbols.
This decomposed process is a DFD, data flow diagram.

===Behavioral perspective===
Behavioral perspective gives a description of system dynamics. The main concepts in behavioral perspective are states and transitions between states. State transitions are triggered by events. State Transition Diagrams (STD/STM), State charts and Petri-nets are some examples of well-known behaviorally oriented modeling languages. Different types of State Transition Diagrams are used particularly within [[real-time systems]] and [[telecommunications]] systems.

===Rule perspective===
Rule perspective gives a description of goals/means connections. The main concepts in rule perspective are rule, goal and constraint. A rule is something that influences the actions of a set of actors. The standard form of rule is “IF condition THEN action/expression”. Rule hierarchies (goal-oriented modeling), Tempora and Expert systems are some examples of rule oriented modeling.

===Object perspective===
The [[object-oriented]] perspective describes the world as autonomous, communicating objects. An object is an “entity” which has a unique and unchangeable identifier and a local state consisting of a collection of attributes with assignable values. The state can only be manipulated with a set of methods defined on the object. The value of the state can only be accessed by sending a message to the object to call on one of its methods. An event is when an operation is being triggered by receiving a message, and the trace of the events during the existence of the object is called the object’s life cycle or the process of an object. Several objects that share the same definitions of attributes and operations can be parts of an object class. The perspective is originally based on design and programming of object oriented systems. [[Unified Modelling Language]] (UML) is a well known language for modeling with an object perspective.

===Communication perspective===
This perspective is based on language/action theory from [[philosophical linguistics]]. The basic assumption in this perspective is that person/objects cooperate on a process/action through communication within them.

An illocutionary act consists of five elements: Speaker, hearer, time, location and circumstances. It is a reason and goal for the communication, where the participations in a communication act is oriented towards mutual agreement. In a communication act, the speaker generally can raise three claims: truth (referring an object), justice (referring a social world of the participations) and claim to sincerity (referring the subjective world of the speaker).

===Actor and role perspective===
[[Actor]] and [[role]] perspective is a description of organisational and system structure. An actor can be defined as a phenomenon that influences the history of another actor, whereas a role can be defined as the behaviour which is expected by an actor, amongst other actors, when filling the role. Modeling within these perspectives is based both on work with [[object-oriented programming language]]s and work with intelligent agents in [[artificial intelligence]]. [[I*]] is an example of an actor oriented language.

On 1 January 2016 the institute was incorporated into the [[Norwegian Institute of Public Health]].

It was established in 2001 as the result of the merger of the National Institute for Alcohol and Drug Research (SIFA) and a department within the [[Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs]]. Organizationally, it was subordinate to the [[Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services]], but claimed to be independent. It was also a part of the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]].

In addition to various aspects of drugs, alcohol and tobacco use, it researched [[gambling addiction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">An '''ordinary law''' is a normal [[law]], generally distinguished from a [[constitutional law]], [[organic law]], or other similar law. Typically, ordinary laws are subordinate to constitutional and organic laws, and are more easily changed than constitutional or organic laws, though that should not be assumed to be the case in all jurisdictions. (For example, the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] has ruled that Spain's [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Laws]] are not hierarchically superior to ordinary laws, but simply apply to different matters.&lt;ref&gt;Sentencia de 13 de febrero de 1981, Tribunal Constitucional de España&lt;/ref&gt;) Ordinary laws often govern areas beyond the scope of constitutional or organic laws.

Normally, in a democracy, an ordinary law must first obtain a [[majority|simple majority]] of a [[congress]], [[parliament]], or other legislature, and then be signed into law by the representative of [[executive power]]. The process leading to a legislative vote may vary vastly from one jurisdiction to another: the process may be initiated by either house of a [[bicameral legislature]] or from the sole house of a [[unicameral legislature]]; from the [[head of government]] or [[head of state]]; or by popular [[initiative]]. Different jurisdictions may allow ordinary laws to be proposed by one or all of these means, and may have restrictions on which body may take the initiative for certain types of laws (for example, in some bicameral systems, tax-related laws must begin in the lower chamber of the legislature). In some jurisdictions, the legislature has a means to override an executive [[veto]] by a [[supermajority]], or the voting populace have the means to override a law by a [[referendum]].

Under [[federalism|federal]] systems, ordinary laws may be created at the level of a [[sovereign state]] but also by its constituent components: for example, by [[states of the United States]] or [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Spain]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12693">The '''Planetary Collegium''' is an international research platform that promotes the integration of art, science, technology, and consciousness research, under the rubric of ''technoetic arts''.  It is currently based in [[Plymouth University]]. The Collegium's Hub is the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in Integrative Arts (CAiiA), and it has had nodes in Zurich, Milan, Lucerne, Trento, Kefalonia, and currently in Shanghai. The founding President is Professor [[Roy Ascott]].
[[File:Logo for The Planetary Collegium.jpg|thumb|Planetary Collegium logo]]

== History ==
The Planetary Collegium was  conceived and established by [[Roy Ascott]] as the ''Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts'' ('''CAiiA''')  in 1994 at what is now the [[University of Wales, Newport]] 

Three years later, Ascott established '''STAR''' (Science Technology and Art Research) in the School of Computing, University of Plymouth. '''CAiiA-STAR''' constituted a joint research platform, with access to supervisory and technical resources of both universities.

In 2003, Ascott contracted to relocate the platform to [[Plymouth University]], renaming it the '''Planetary Collegium''', where it is currently located in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. The contract with Plymouth University expires in July 2021, when Ascott plans to relocate it in China. 

Since 1997, the Collegium has given more than seventy conferences and symposia in Europe, North and South America, Japan, China and Australia.

Since its inception, first at the University of Wales, and currently at Plymouth,  over 80 doctoral candidates have graduated from the programme. 

==Aims==
The Collegium aims to produce new knowledge in the context of the arts, through transdisciplinary inquiry and critical discourse, with special reference to [[technoetic]] research and to advances in science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/artist/ascott/biography/|title=Media Art Net - Ascott, Roy: Biography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its seeks to reflect the social, technological and spiritual aspirations of an emerging planetary society, while sustaining a critical awareness of the retrograde forces and fields that inhibit social and cultural development. It combines the face-to-face association of individuals with the trans-cultural unity of telematic communities, thereby developing a network of research nodes strategically located across the planet, each with a distinctive cultural ethos. The Collegium seeks outcomes that involve new language, systems, structures, and behaviours, and insights into the nature of mind, matter and human identity. 

== Structure ==
As conceived and directed by Ascott, the Planetary Collegium consists of artists, theoreticians and scholars working within the context of [[transdisciplinarity]] and [[syncretism]] so as to develop their research in the practice and theory of [[new media art]] with a special interest in [[telematics]] and [[technoetics]]. Currently, their doctoral research leads to the award of the '''University of Plymouth PhD'''. Post-doctoral research is also pursued. It has attracted an impressive number of internationally well-established artists, musicians, performers, designers, architects, theorists and scholars involved in doctoral and post-doctoral research.

Currently, the hub of the Collegium, '''CAiiA-Hub''' (the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in Integrative Arts) is situated in the School of Art and Media, Faculty of Arts, [[Plymouth University]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated464"&gt;Kristine Stiles &amp; Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'' (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; The Collegium has a Node '''De Tao-Node''' [http://www.detao-node.com] in Shanghai. The programme, which is largely part-time, has a virtually 100% success rate, with well over 80 doctoral graduates .

In addition to doctoral candidates and graduates, supervisors and honorary members, its constituency also includes general members, who share the aims and interests of the Collegium, and are invited to participate in its development 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/20001464384/

The Planetary Collegium has a geographically dispersed membership,  and convenes the majority of its research sessions and public conferences in Asia, Australia, the Americas and Europe.

== Awards ==
The Collegium was awarded The World Universities Forum Award for Best Practice in Higher Education 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ontheuniversity.com/2011/12/31/announcing-the-winner-of-the-2011-award-for-best-practice-in-higher-education/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116065227/http://ontheuniversity.com/2011/12/31/announcing-the-winner-of-the-2011-award-for-best-practice-in-higher-education/ |date=January 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Politicards''' are a deck of [[playing cards]] produced each [[elections in the United States#Federal elections|election year]] in the [[United States]] with 54 [[caricatures]] depicting political candidates and prominent political figures. The first Politicards deck was produced in 1971 for the 1972 election by the artist Peter Green, the writer Lee Livingston, the businessman Mike Killeen and the designer Norman Friant.&lt;ref&gt;"What the Deuce?", ''Southland Sunday'' magazine, June 18, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, about 200,000 packs of cards were being sold during each election cycle.&lt;ref name="glendale"/&gt; Decks were said to have been used at the time by then New York Senator James Buckley and by the ladies of Mamie Eisenhower’s bridge club.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Stumbo, "Politicards Sweeping the Nation", ''The Los Angeles Times'', December 27, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decks of "Politicards" have been produced for election years 1971, 1980, 1984&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Krebs, "Notes on People", ''New York Times'', August 16, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Vaillancourt, "Artist is Playing With a Full Deck", ''Glendale News-Press'', October 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1996 onwards.&lt;ref name="glendale"/&gt; 

The 1980 and 1984 edition decks were produced by the [[Washington, D.C.]] [[lobbyist]] [[Victor Kamber]], who purchased the Politicards name in 1979.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In 1996, the name expired and was reclaimed by the original artist Peter Green,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; who has since produced decks for every election through to 2016.&lt;ref name="glendale"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/glendale-news-press/community/tn-gnp-cartoonist-suits-up-for-the-2016-election-with-new-deck-of-political-playing-cards-20151201-story.html | title=Cartoonist suits up for the 2016 election with new deck of political playing cards | publisher= |work=Glendale News-Press | date=December 1, 2015 | accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green's 2016 edition was titled "Politikids" and depicted political figures as children.&lt;ref name="glendale"/&gt;

The term population ecology is often used interchangeably with [[population biology]] or [[population dynamics]]. 

The development of population ecology owes much to [[demography]] and [[actuary|actuarial]] [[life table]]s. Population ecology is important in [[conservation biology]], especially in the development of [[population viability analysis]] (PVA) which makes it possible to predict the long-term probability of a species persisting in a given habitat patch. Although population ecology is a subfield of [[biology]], it provides interesting problems for [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[statistics|statisticians]] who work in [[population dynamics]].

The most fundamental law of population ecology is [[Thomas Malthus]]' exponential law of population growth.&lt;ref name="Turchin01"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Turchin  | first = P.  | title = Does Population Ecology Have General Laws?  | journal = Oikos

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Thomas Robert Malthus Wellcome L0069037 -crop.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Thomas Robert Malthus]]]]

This principle in population ecology provides the basis for formulating predictive theories and tests that follow:

Simplified population models usually start with four key variables (four '''demographic processes''') including death, birth, immigration, and emigration. Mathematical models used to calculate changes in population demographics and evolution hold the assumption (or [[null hypothesis]]) of no external influence. Models can be more mathematically complex where "...several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with the data."&lt;ref name="Johnson04"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Johnson  | first = J. B.  | last2 = Omland  | first2 = K. S.  | title = Model selection in ecology and evolution.  | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution  | volume = 19  | issue = 2  | pages = 101–108  | year = 2004  | url = http://www.usm.maine.edu/bio/courses/bio621/model_selection.pdf  | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2003.10.013  | pmid = 16701236  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a closed system where immigration and emigration does not take place, the rate of change in the number of individuals in a population can be described as:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dT} = B - D = bN - dN = (b - d)N = rN,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the total number of individuals in the population, ''B'' is the '''raw''' number of births, ''D'' is the '''raw''' number of deaths, ''b'' and ''d'' are the '''per capita''' rates of birth and death respectively, and ''r'' is the '''per capita''' average number of surviving offspring each individual has. This formula can be read as the rate of change in the population (''dN/dT'') is equal to births minus deaths (B - D).&lt;ref name="Turchin01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandermeer03"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Vandermeer  | first = J.

Using these techniques, Malthus' population principle of growth was later transformed into a mathematical model known as the [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|logistic equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dT} = aN \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the biomass density, ''a'' is the maximum per-capita rate of change, and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of the population. The formula can be read as follows: the rate of change in the population (''dN/dT'') is equal to growth (''aN'') that is limited by carrying capacity ''(1-N/K)''. From these basic mathematical principles the discipline of population ecology expands into a field of investigation that queries the [[demographics]] of real populations and tests these results against the statistical models. The field of population ecology often uses data on life history and matrix algebra to develop projection matrices on fecundity and survivorship. This information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas &lt;ref name="Vandermeer03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berryman92"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Berryman  | first = A.

A population with a size that increases geometrically is a population where generations of reproduction do '''not''' overlap.&lt;ref name="afrc.uamont.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=GEOMETRIC AND EXPONENTIAL POPULATION MODELS|url=http://www.afrc.uamont.edu/whited/Geometric%20and%20exponential%20population%20models.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each generation there is an [[effective population size]] denoted as &lt;big&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; which constitutes the number of individuals in the population that are able to reproduce ''and'' will reproduce in any reproductive generation in concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holsinger|first1=Kent|title=Effective Population Size|url=http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb348/lecture-notes/drift/node7.html|date=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the population model below it is assumed that &lt;big&gt;N&lt;/big&gt; is the effective population size.&lt;ref name="afrc.uamont.edu"/&gt;

[[File:The general difference between populations that grow exponentially and geometrically.png|400px|thumb|'''The general difference between populations that grow exponentially and geometrically.'''
 Geometric populations grow in reproductive generations between intervals of [[abstinence]] from reproduction. Exponential populations grow without designated periods for reproduction. Reproduction is a [[continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] process and generations of reproduction overlap. This graph illustrates two hypothetical populations - one population growing periodically (and therefore geometrically) and the other population growing continuously (and therefore exponentially). The populations in the graph have a doubling time of 1 year. The populations in the graph are hypothetical. In reality, the doubling times differ between populations.]]

'''Assumption 02''': There is no migration to or from the population (&lt;big&gt;N&lt;/big&gt;)

&lt;big&gt;'''I&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;  = E&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 0'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

The '''raw''' birth and death rates are related to the '''per capita''' birth and death rates:

&lt;big&gt;'''B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = b&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; × N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''b&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; / N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Assumption 03''': '''b&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''d&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' are constant (i.e. they don't change each generation).

&lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + (bN&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) - (dN&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;small&gt;''Disclaimer: Bacterial populations are exponential (or, more correctly, [[logistic function|logistic]]) instead of geometric. Nevertheless, doubling times are applicable to both types of populations.''&lt;/small&gt;
]]

The [[doubling time]] of a population is the time required for the population to grow to twice its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Doubling Time and How is it Calculated?|first=Lauren|last=Boucher|date=24 March 2015|website=Population Education|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/what-doubling-time-and-how-it-calculated}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can calculate the [[doubling time]] of a geometric population using the equation: &lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt; by exploiting our knowledge of the fact that the population (&lt;big&gt;N&lt;/big&gt;) is twice its size (&lt;big&gt;2N&lt;/big&gt;) after the doubling time.&lt;ref name="afrc.uamont.edu"/&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 2N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; /  N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;/big&gt;'''

The doubling time can be found by taking logarithms. For instance:

&lt;big&gt;'''t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; × log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2) = 1'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; × log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = 1'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(λ)&lt;/big&gt;'''

Or:

&lt;big&gt;'''t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; × ln(λ) = ln(2)'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = ln(2) / ln(λ)&lt;/big&gt;'''

'''&lt;big&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.693... / ln(λ)&lt;/big&gt;'''

Therefore:

'''&lt;big&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = 0.693... / ln(λ) &lt;/big&gt;'''

=== Half-life of geometric populations ===

The [[half-life]] of a population is the time taken for the population to decline to half its size. We can calculate the half-life of a geometric population using the equation: &lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt; by exploiting our knowledge of the fact that the population (&lt;big&gt;N&lt;/big&gt;) is half its size (&lt;big&gt;0.5N&lt;/big&gt;) after a half-life.&lt;ref name="afrc.uamont.edu"/&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''0.5N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; × N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5&lt;/big&gt;'''

The half-life can be calculated by taking logarithms (see above).

'''&lt;big&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / log&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = ln(0.5) / ln(λ) &lt;/big&gt;'''

===Mathematical relationship between geometric and exponential populations===

In geometric populations, &lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;λ&lt;/big&gt; represent growth constants (see [[Population ecology#Geometric populations|2]] and [[Population ecology#Geometric .28R.29 and finite .28.CE.BB.29 growth constants|2.3]]). In [[exponential growth|exponential]] populations however, the [[Population dynamics#Intrinsic rate of increase|intrinsic growth rate]], also known as [[Population dynamics#Intrinsic rate of increase|intrinsic rate of increase]] (&lt;big&gt;r&lt;/big&gt;) is the relevant growth constant. Since generations of reproduction in a geometric population do not overlap (e.g. reproduce once a year) but do in an exponential population, geometric and exponential populations are usually considered to be mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Growth|website=[[University of Alberta]]|url=http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/courses.hp/bio208/Lecture_Notes_files/Biol208_Lecture19_PopulationGrowth.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, geometric constants and exponential constants share the mathematical relationship below.&lt;ref name="afrc.uamont.edu"/&gt;

The growth equation for exponential populations is

&lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;rt&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

Therefore:

'''&lt;big&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;rt&lt;/sup&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

&lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt; cancels on both sides.

'''&lt;big&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;rt&lt;/sup&gt; / N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

'''&lt;big&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;rt&lt;/sup&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Take the [[natural logarithm]]s of the equation. Using natural logarithms instead of base 10 or base 2 logarithms simplifies the final equation as ln(e) = 1.
 
&lt;big&gt;'''rt × ln(e) = t × ln(λ)'''&lt;/big&gt;

An important concept in population ecology is the [[r/K selection]] theory.

Migrants moving among the patches are structured into metapopulations either as sources or sinks. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of migrants to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants. In metapopulation terminology there are emigrants (individuals that leave a patch) and immigrants (individuals that move into a patch). Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer questions about spatial and demographic ecology. An important concept in metapopulation ecology is the rescue effect, where small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. Metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks, such as dry years, and become sources when conditions are more favorable. Ecologists utilize a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.&lt;ref name="Hanski04"&gt;{{Cite book  | editor-last = Hanski  | editor-first = I.  | editor2-last = Gaggiotti  | editor2-first = O.

==History==
The older term, autecology (from Greek: αὐτο, ''auto'', "self"; οίκος, oikos, "household"; and λόγος, logos, "knowledge"), refers to roughly the same field of study as population ecology. It derives from the division of ecology into autecology—the study of individual species in relation to the environment—and [[Community ecology|synecology]]—the study of groups of organisms in relation to the environment—or community ecology. Odum (1959, p.&amp;nbsp;8) considered that synecology should be divided into population ecology, community ecology, and ecosystem ecology, defining autecology as essentially "species ecology."&lt;ref name="Odum1959"/&gt; However, for some time biologists have recognized that the more significant level of organization of a species is a population, because at this level the species gene pool is most coherent. In fact, Odum regarded "autecology" as no longer a "present tendency" in ecology (i.e., an archaic term), although included "species ecology"—studies emphasizing [[Biological life cycle|life history]] and behavior as adaptations to the environment of individual organisms or species—as one of four subdivisions of ecology.

==Journals==
The first journal publication of the Society of Population Ecology, titled ''Population Ecology'' (originally called ''Researches on Population Ecology'') was released in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.springerlink.com/content/1438-3896?sortorder=asc&amp;p=93932389f9764a2aadcbe167b466fcef&amp;o=0|title= Population Ecology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific articles on population ecology can also be found in the ''[[Journal of Animal Ecology]]'', ''[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]]'' and other journals.

The '''Program on Energy Efficiency in Artisanal Brick Kilns in Latin America to Mitigate Climate Change''' (EELA) is a program of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) which is implemented by Swiss contact in conjunction with its partners in nine countries in [[Latin America]]. The objective is to mitigate [[climate change]] through the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions in Latin America and to improve the quality of life of the population in the areas of intervention.

==The problem==
Artisanal brick producers in Latin America use fuel with high environmental impact in [[kiln]]s with low [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. Wood, tires and plastics, among other fuels, are used to fire bricks, contributing to air pollution and deforestation as well as increasing the causes of climate change. Despite their contribution to the construction industry and the generation of jobs, artisanal brick producers largely operate informally and are generally excluded from social, environmental and economic public policies.

==The approach==
The EELA program is focused on developing management models for artisanal brick producers, and includes activities that range from the adoption of more efficient production processes that require less fuel and emit less greenhouse gases, to the creation of new products that use less raw materials.

==EELA activities==
:* Innovation through the introduction of technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are financially viable for artisanal brick producers.
:* Working in coordination with public bodies to incorporate the artisanal brick production sector within the national climate change mitigation agenda.
:* Taking account of lessons learned within the countries, and promoting the exchange of experiences among them.

==Areas of operation==
EELA began its first phase working with 970 artisanal brick producers in seven areas located in San Juan (Argentina), Cochabamba (Bolivia), Serido (Brazil), Nemocon (Colombia), Cuenca (Ecuador), Leon (Mexico) and Cusco (Peru). In 2012, Nicaragua and Honduras joined the initiative. The experience gained in the pilot areas will serve as a basis to expand EELA’s intervention at a national level.

==Aims==
EELA hopes to reduce the GHG emissions of artisanal brick producers in the countries of operation by 30% and increase their income by 10%.

==Artisanal brick producers in San Jeronimo, Cusco, Peru==
In conjunction with the Ministry of Production, the Regional Directorate of Production and the Municipality of San Jeronimo, EELA works to promote good manufacturing practices to better employ heat as well as provide technical assistance in the following areas:
:* Mixers designed to optimize time and resources
:* Extrusion machinery to use less raw materials and diversify production
:* Fans to make kiln combustion more effective

EELA constructed a downdraft kiln that is more efficient than a traditional kiln and that is affordable for an artisanal brick producer. The kiln is being replicated by brick producers in San Jerónimo, Cuenca (Ecuador) and in Mexico.

==Challenges==
In a second phase, EELA will seek to improve the management models through the use of knowledge gained from its first phase. 
&lt;!--THIS NEXT SECTION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND AND CERTAINLY NOT A STYLE OF WRITING THAT IS OK IN WIKIPEDIA. SO PLEASE REWRITE IN PLAIN ENGLISH (OR DELETE!)!!.......
==EELA as a facilitator== 
The development of a market approach will be used as a strategy to incorporate artisanal brick producers in a comprehensive system and determine how to generate effective and large-scale changes on the basis of the identification of market barriers and stakeholder incentives.

EELA will try to ensure the future sustainability of its activities by adopting a facilitating role that will seek to influence the market and articulate its different stakeholders without becoming one of them. Within this context, EELA will foster the creation of conditions that will allow the artisanal brick producer access to different technological innovations while considering the dynamics of the market itself.--&gt;

==Joint effort==
EELA is supported by a group of partners that includes both public and private entities with experience in the brick sector, in each of the countries in which it operates.

'''Rare biosphere''' refers to diverse rare species of [[bacteria]], adapted to environmental conditions that are not common today.

==Microbial ecosystems==
[[File:Microbial Loop.jpg|thumb|Schematic of the microbial loop.]]
Changes in the [[biodiversity]] of an [[ecosystem]], whether [[Marine ecosystem|marine]] or [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]], may affect its efficiency and function. [[Climate change]] or other [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic perturbations]] can decrease [[productivity]] and disrupt global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s. The possible ramifications of such changes are not well characterized or understood, and up to a point redundancy in an ecosystem may protect it from disruption.&lt;ref name="Gitay"&gt;{{cite report |editor1-first=Habiba|editor1-last=Gitay  |editor2-first=Avelino|editor2-last=Suárez |editor3-first=David Jon |editor3-last=Dokken |editor4-first=Robert T.|editor4-last=Watson |date=April 2002 |title=Climate Change and Biodiversity: IPCC Technical Paper V |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/technical-papers/climate-changes-biodiversity-en.pdf |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |page= |docket= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of [[Microbial ecology|microbial ecosystems]] are tightly coupled to biogeochemical processes.&lt;ref name=Kirchman&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Kirchman| editor-first1=David L.|title=Microbial Ecology of the Oceans.|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken|isbn=0470281839|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the marine [[microbial loop]], bacteria [[decomposition|decompose]] organics and [[Nutrient cycle|recycle nutrients]] such as [[nitrogen]] for other organisms such as [[phytoplankton]] to use.&lt;ref name=Kirchman/&gt; A reduction in recycled nitrogen would limit the production rate of phytoplankton, in turn limiting the growth of [[Grazing|grazers]], with effects throughout the [[food web]] and [[nitrogen cycle]]. To gauge such effects, a base line of microbial diversity is needed.

==DNA sequencing==
Recent use of high-throughput [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] techniques, pioneered by [[Mitchell Sogin|Dr. Mitchell Sogin]] of the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], has broadened the scope of biodiversity, with the discovery of the rare biosphere.&lt;ref name=Sogin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sogin|first1=M. L.|last2=Morrison|first2=H. G.|last3=Huber|first3=J. A.|last4=Welch|first4=D. M.|last5=Huse|first5=S. M.|last6=Neal|first6=P. R.|last7=Arrieta|first7=J. M.|last8=Herndl|first8=G. J.|title=Microbial diversity in the deep sea and the underexplored "rare biosphere"|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=31 July 2006|volume=103|issue=32|pages=12115–12120|doi=10.1073/pnas.0605127103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous attempts to characterize in situ abundance have been made through pure culture and molecular techniques.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuhrman|first1=Jed A.|title=Microbial community structure and its functional implications|journal=Nature|date=14 May 2009|volume=459|issue=7244|pages=193–199|doi=10.1038/nature08058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure culture providing a very narrow picture of some of the rarer species present, &lt;1-5% of bacteria present.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman/&gt; Molecular techniques, such as Sanger sequencing, resulting in a much broader scope but highlighting the more abundant species present.&lt;ref name=Heidelberg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heidelberg|first1=Karla B.|last2=Gilbert|first2=Jack A.|last3=Joint|first3=Ian|title=Marine genomics: at the interface of marine microbial ecology and biodiscovery|journal=Microbial Biotechnology|date=September 2010|volume=3|issue=5|pages=531–543|doi=10.1111/j.1751-7915.2010.00193.x|pmc=2948669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pedros-Alío&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedros-Alío|first1=C.|title=ECOLOGY: Dipping into the Rare Biosphere|journal=Science|date=12 January 2007|volume=315|issue=5809|pages=192–193|doi=10.1126/science.1135933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither technique captures all of the diversity present. Alternatively [[high throughput sequencing]], “tag sequencing”, divides unique [[rRNA]] tag sequences into [[operational taxonomic unit]]s (OTUs) based upon similarities in [[mitochondria]]l-encoded [[cytochrome oxidase]]s.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; Both Sanger, [[shot gun sequencing]], and [[tag sequencing]] organize sequences into OTUs.&lt;ref name=Heidelberg/&gt; However, it is the resolution that tag sequencing provides that sets it apart, resulting from the increased efficiency in serial analysis.&lt;ref name=Heidelberg/&gt; This efficiency increase is made possible through the use of internal [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] sequences resulting in [[restriction digest]] overhanging sequences.&lt;ref name=Heidelberg/&gt;  Though OTUs provide a means of distinguishing the possible number of [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] groups, it is not possible to deduce phylogenetic relationships based upon OTU’s. Tags associated with OTUs must be cross-referenced with [[gene bank]]s, in order for tags to be phylotyped and relationships established.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt;

The result of tag sequencing has been to produce orders of magnitude larger estimates of OTUs present in ecosystems, producing a [[long tail]] on [[Relative abundance distribution|species abundance curves]].&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=D. J.|title=Seeing the Big Picture on Microbe Distribution|journal=Science|date=17 September 2009|volume=325|issue=5947|pages=1506–1507|doi=10.1126/science.1179690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pedros-Alío/&gt; This long tail accounts for less than .1% of the abundant species in a particular ecosystem. At the same time it represents thousands of populations accounting for most of the phylogenetic diversity in an ecosystem. This low-abundance high-diversity group is the rare biosphere. Using this method, Sogin et al.’s study of microbial diversity in [[North Atlantic]] deep water produced an estimate of 5266 different [[taxa]].&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; This is particularly dramatic considering that previous studies employing more traditional [[PCR]] [[Molecular cloning|cloning]] techniques have resulted in estimates of up to 500.&lt;ref name=Pedros-Alío/&gt;

== Ecological role ==
Considering their low abundance, members of the rare biosphere may represent ancient and persistent taxa.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; As these less abundant species are limited in number viral infection, and ultimately death by [[lysis]], is unlikely.&lt;ref name=Pedros-Alío/&gt; Viruses depend on high concentrations of hosts to persist. Additionally being less abundant implies limited growth, and on the smaller end of the cell size spectrum.&lt;ref name=Pedros-Alío/&gt; This limits the likelihood of death by ingestion, as grazers prefer larger more active microbes. As well it is important to note that just because these taxa are “rare” now does not mean that under previous conditions in our planet’s history they were “rare”.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; These taxa could be have been episodically abundant, resulting in global changes in biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; Essentially this requires microbial ecologists to change their perspective on how microbial interactions function on evolutionary time scales.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt;

On that note, rare today does not mean rare tomorrow. Given the persistence of these taxa under the right conditions they have the potential to dominate, and become the more abundant taxa.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; The occurrence of such conditions may occur on many temporal scales. It may be possible that some rare taxa dominate only during anomalous years, such as during [[El Niño]].&lt;ref name=Fuhrman/&gt; While, a four-year study by Brown et al. in species abundance in a single marine ecosystem found that some taxa were undetectable during some months and accounted for a couple percent of the total abundance other months.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Mark V.|last2=Schwalbach|first2=Michael S.|last3=Hewson|first3=Ian|last4=Fuhrman|first4=Jed A.|title=Coupling 16S-ITS rDNA clone libraries and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis to show marine microbial diversity: development and application to a time series|journal=Environmental Microbiology|date=September 2005|volume=7|issue=9|pages=1466–1479|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00835.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indicating that a change in abundance may occur on a seasonal scale. Recent global climate change may provide some of these rare taxa with the conditions necessary to increase in abundance.
Even in their low abundance taxa belonging to the rare biosphere may be affecting global biogeochemical cycles. For example, most of nitrogen fixation was attributed to Trichodesmium and abundant cyanobacterium. However, more recent evidence implicates that the rare minority may be responsible for fixing more cumulative Nitrogen than the abundant majority.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman/&gt;

A subtle and less direct manner these populations may be affecting ecosystems, in terms of biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles, is by acting as an unlimited source of genetic diversity and material.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; How microbial communities present resilience after environmental perturbation or catastrophe and how closely a closely related species may present unique and novel genetic attributes compared to near relatives, are topics of much discussion and investigation.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt;  The rare biosphere could be a seed bank, transferring genes resulting in fitter recombinants that rise to become the dominant majority.&lt;ref name=Sogin/&gt; Until now this group has been overlooked entirely, and may be the answer to many longstanding questions concerning microbial ecology and genetics.

== Biogeography and distribution ==
There is some debate concerning the distribution of taxa within the rare biosphere. Taxa within this group at a given site may be in the process of dispersal.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; Studies in the Arctic seabed identified thermophilic bacteria, arriving through mechanisms of dispersal, that could not be metabolically active.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; Once these populations, such as the thermophilic bacteria in the Arctic, reach a suitable niche they will again become metabolically active and increase in abundance. This requires that one view these populations as non-discrete, not endemic to any one particular body of water.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; Rather view populations as continuous throughout the oceans. Alternatively, studies suggest that given the biogeography of rare taxa the idea of the rare biosphere being the product of dispersal seems unlikely.&lt;ref name=Galand&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galand|first1=P. E.|last2=Casamayor|first2=E. O.|last3=Kirchman|first3=D. L.|last4=Lovejoy|first4=C.|title=Ecology of the rare microbial biosphere of the Arctic Ocean|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=17 December 2009|volume=106|issue=52|pages=22427–22432|doi=10.1073/pnas.0908284106|url=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/21166/1/0908284106.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galand et al. completed a study in the Arctic Ocean on the biogeography of the rare biosphere and found that between parcels of water within that ocean the rare biosphere presented a large amount of diversity.&lt;ref name=Galand/&gt; Suggesting that populations within the rare biosphere experience evolutionary forces specific to the location they are found such as selection, speciation, and extinction.&lt;ref name=Galand/&gt; Asserting that water masses have physical boundaries resulting in highly evolved and divergent taxa between rare biospheres from different locations.&lt;ref name=Galand/&gt; Also, given the fact that many rare taxa cannot be identified in gene banks, it seems unlikely that they abundant elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Galand/&gt; Though this statement is difficult to validate, due to the extreme under sampling of marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Heidelberg/&gt;

Because institutional subscriptions and online access serve a larger audience, its estimated readership is 570,400 people.&lt;ref&gt;AAAS, "[http://www.sciencemag.org/site/help/advertisers/2014_Media_Kit-Product_Advertising.pdf 2014 ''Science'' Media Kit]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The major focus of the journal is publishing important original scientific research and research reviews, but ''Science'' also publishes science-related news, opinions on [[science policy]] and other matters of interest to scientists and others who are concerned with the wide implications of science and technology. Unlike most [[scientific journals]], which focus on a specific field, ''Science'' and its rival ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' cover the full range of [[List of academic disciplines#Natural sciences|scientific disciplines]]. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', ''Science''{{'}}s 2015 [[impact factor]] was 34.661.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2016 |chapter=Science |title=2015 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science |series=[[Web of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is the journal of the AAAS, membership in the AAAS is not required to publish in ''Science''. Papers are accepted from authors around the world. Competition to publish in ''Science'' is very intense, as an article published in such a highly cited journal can lead to attention and career advancement for the authors. Fewer than 7% of articles submitted are accepted for publication.

''Science'' is based in Washington, D.C., United States, with a second office in [[Cambridge]], England.

''Science'' was founded by New York journalist John Michels in 1880 with financial support from [[Thomas Edison]] and later from [[Alexander Graham Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 7 February 1947 |title= Thomas A.

Science Magazine had been founded the year before with funding from Edison, but the frugal inventor soon tired of the deficits and withheld support. Bell had written for the magazine and respected its editorial quality. He felt that Science, like the British Nature, appealed to a broad audience interested in current research. In 1882, he and Gardiner Hubbard acquired the rights to Science and hired as editor a respected young entomologist and riter named Sam Scudder, who happened to be a Hubbard cousin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Edison received favorable editorial treatment in return, without disclosure of the financial relationship, at a time when his reputation was suffering due to delays producing the promised commercially viable light bulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Eclipse |author=David Baron |year=2017 |publisher=Liveright |page=224 |isbn=9781631490163}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, the journal never gained enough subscribers to succeed and ended publication in March 1882. Entomologist [[Samuel Hubbard Scudder|Samuel H. Scudder]] resurrected the journal one year later and had some success while covering the meetings of prominent American scientific societies, including the AAAS.&lt;ref&gt;AAAS, "[http://archives.aaas.org/exhibit/origins4.php 150 Years of Advancing Science: A History of AAAS. Origins: 1848–1899]", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1894, ''Science'' was again in financial difficulty and was sold to psychologist [[James McKeen Cattell]] for $500.{{fact|date=May 2018}} 

In an agreement worked out by Cattell and AAAS secretary [[Leland Ossian Howard|Leland O. Howard]], ''Science'' became the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;AAAS, "[http://archives.aaas.org/exhibit/science2.php 150 Years of Advancing Science: A History of AAAS. AAAS and Science: 1900–1940]", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of the 20th century important articles published in ''Science'' included papers on [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] [[genetics]] by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], [[gravitational lens]]ing by [[Albert Einstein]], and [[spiral nebulae]] by [[Edwin Hubble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.aaas.org/exhibit/science5.php |title=150 Years of Advancing Science: A History of AAAS.

After Cattell's death in 1944, the journal lacked a consistent editorial presence until Graham DuShane became editor in 1956. In 1958, under DuShane's leadership, ''Science'' absorbed ''[[The Scientific Monthly]]'', thus increasing the journal's circulation by over 60% from 38,000 to more than 61,000.&lt;ref name=maturing3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.aaas.org/exhibit/maturing3.php |title=150 Years of Advancing Science: A History of AAAS.

In February 2001, draft results of the [[human genome]] were simultaneously published by ''Nature'' and ''Science'' with ''Science'' publishing the [[Celera Corporation|Celera Genomics]] paper and ''Nature'' publishing the publicly funded [[Human Genome Project]]. In 2007 ''Science ''(together with [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']]) received the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for Communications and Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundacionprincipedeasturias.org/ing/04/premiados/trayectorias/trayectoria820.html Journal Science].

==Family of journals==
The Science family of journals includes ''Science'', ''[[Science Translational Medicine]]'', ''[[Science Signaling]]'', and ''[[Science Advances]]''. In 2015, Holt announced another expansion: ''Science Robotics'' and ''Science Immunology'' would begin publication in mid-2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=AAAS to Expand the Science Family of Journals by Launching Two New Journals: Science Robotics and Science Immunology |author=Pinholster, Ginger |date=October 20, 2015 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/aaas-expand-science-family-journals-launching-two-new-journals-science-robotics-and-science |accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
The latest editions of the journal are available online, through the main journal website, only to subscribers, AAAS members, and for delivery to [[IP address]]es at institutions that subscribe; students, K–12 teachers, and some others can subscribe at a reduced fee. However, research articles published after 1997 are available for free (with online registration) one year after they are published i.e. [[delayed open access]].&lt;ref name=delayed_oa/&gt; Significant public-health related articles are also available for free, sometimes immediately after publication. AAAS members may also access the pre-1997 Science archives at the ''Science'' website, where it is called "Science Classic". Institutions can opt to add Science Classic to their subscriptions for an additional fee. Some older articles can also be accessed via [[JSTOR]] and [[ProQuest]].

The journal also participates in initiatives that provide free or low-cost access to readers in developing countries, including [[HINARI]], [[OARE]], [[AGORA]], and [[Scidev.net]].

Other features of the ''Science'' website include the free "ScienceNow" section with "up to the minute news from science",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/ |title=ScienceNow |accessdate=September 1, 2011 |work=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "ScienceCareers", which provides free career resources for scientists and engineers.

The term '''serious play''' refers to an array of [[Play (activity)|playful]] inquiry and innovation methods that serve as vehicles for complex [[problem solving|problem-solving]], typically in work-related contexts.  [[Lego Serious Play]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/seriousplay|title=Lego Official Serious Play Site|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the best known examples; however, serious play methods also include [[Improvisational theatre|improv theater]], [[Roleplay simulation|role play exercise]]s, low fidelity prototyping, as well as certain simulations and [[gamification]] interventions, etc.

In recent years, an increasing body of academic and popular literature have argued that being in a playful mode (engaging in playful processes and applying a playful, open mindset) can foster creativity and innovation as it emphasizes possibilities, freedom, and process versus outcome, [[self-consciousness]], responsibility and shame. According to Gauntlett (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Gauntlett|title=Creative explorations: new approaches to identities and audiences|year=2007|isbn=978-0415396592|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The non-judgmental environment of play, it is claimed, is more likely to foster surprising and innovative ideas" (see Stephenson (1998);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Stephenson|title=Play Theory of Mass Communication|isbn=9780887387050|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1988|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terr (2000);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lenore|last=Terr|title=Beyond Love and Work: why adults need to play|year=2000|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=978-0684863160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gee (2004);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Paul Gee|title=[[What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kane (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Patrick|last=Kane|title=The Play Ethic: a manifesto for a different way of living|year=2005|isbn=9780330489300|publisher=Pan}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The term "serious play" was popularized with the publication of Michael Schrage's book ''Serious Play: How the World's Best Companies Simulate to Innovate'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Schrage|title=Serious Play: How the World's Best Companies Simulate to Innovate|year=2000|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|isbn=9780875848143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious play methods can be used as vehicles for engaging teams in the five stages of the [[design thinking]] process: empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dschool.stanford.edu/redesigningtheater/the-design-thinking-process/ | title=The Design Thinking Process | work=ReDesigning Theater | accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods are designed to create a safe environment for exploring and sharing ideas and help engage teams in behaviors and mindsets that integrate disparate knowledge and align team efforts towards problem-solving and organizational change. Serious play methods are most often used in creative industries (e.g. product and service design), yet also hold a promise to foster creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship in general management practices as well. While much of the serious play literature focuses on [[business]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristiansen|author2=Rasmussen|title=Building A Better Business: Using The Lego Serious Play Method|year=2014|isbn=978-1118832455|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Burgi|author2=Victor|author3=Lentz|title=Modeling how their business really works prepares managers for sudden change|year=2004|doi=10.1108/10878570410525106|journal=Strategy &amp; Leadership|volume=32|issue=2|pages=28–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sorensen|author2=Spoelstra|title=Play at Work: continuation, intervention, and usurpation|year=2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258174266_Play_at_Work_Continuation_Intervention_and_Usurpation|doi=10.1177/1350508411407369|journal=Organization|volume=19|issue=1|pages=81–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; its benefits are applied in numerous fields, including [[military]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check out the US military's sandbox of silly-putty that predicts disasters and war|author=Aliya Sternstein|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/06/check-out-us-militarys-sandbox-silly-putty-predicts-disasters-and-war/129509/?oref=defenseone_today_nl|date=June 29, 2016|work=Defense One}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[education]],&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|last2=Palmer|title=Intergroup Encounters of a Different Kind: the experiential research model|year=1989|doi=10.1080/03075078912331377683|journal=Studies in Higher Education|volume=14|issue=3|pages=297–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Mann: Serious Play (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Montesa-Andres|author2=Garrigos-Simon|author3=Narangajavana|chapter=A Proposal for Using Lego Serious Play in Education|year=2011|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-04825-3_10|isbn=978-3-319-04824-6|title=Innovation and Teaching Technologies|publisher=Springer International Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[healthcare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Katie Watson|title=Teaching Medical Skills with Improvisation Techniques|year=2011|journal=Acad.

Because serious play is still an emergent field and used in various contexts, it is sometimes branded as or referred to by other names. For instance, the University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, utilizes an array of serious play methods when dealing with complex problems, which they refer to as liberating structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/ufmcs-red-teaming | title=University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies / Red Teaming | publisher=University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies | accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to serious play is the concept of strategic play, which was the subject of a facilitator's guide book written by Jacqueline Lloyd Smith &amp; Denise Meyerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Strategic Play: The Creative Facilitator's Guide | publisher=Wordzworth Publishing | author=Jacqueline Lloyd Smith | year=2015 | isbn=978-1783240258 | author2=Denise Meyerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

While the concept of "serious play" may sound like an [[oxymoron]], it is the dual nature of the concept that makes it powerful. It is play with a purpose and intentionality that goes beyond simply having fun.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Statler|last2=Heracleous|last3=Jacobs|title=Serious Play as a Practice of Paradox|year=2011|doi=10.1177/0021886311398453|journal=Journal of Applied Behavioral Science|volume=47|issue=2|pages=236–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roos|last2=Victor|title=Towards a New Model of Strategy-making as Serious Play|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S0263-2373(99)00015-8|journal=European Management Journal|volume=17|issue=4|pages=348–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rieber|last2=Smith|last3=Noah|title=The Value of Serious Play|year=1998|journal=Educational Technology|volume=38|issue=6|pages=29–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serious aspect requires a degree of focus on a task or challenge, while the play aspect emphasizes imagination and toying with boundaries. Together, these seemingly juxtapose components are able to foster a deeper engagement – also known as a state of flow&lt;ref name=Csikszentmyhalyi&gt;{{cite book|author=Csikszentmyhalyi, M.|title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|location=New York|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1990|isbn=9780060162535}}&lt;/ref&gt; where participants lose track of time and their inner critique. Being playful also enables us to better tolerate the ambiguity and uncertainty that characterizes many of the problems modern organizations face.

Using play as a way to develop adaptive human potential is not new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutton-Smith, B.|title=The ambiguity of play|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1997|isbn=9780674017337}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Product Design and Intentional Emergence facilitated by Serious Play", Mabogunje et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.designsociety.org/publication/27350/product_design_and_intentional_emergencefacilitated_by_serious_play | title=Product Design and Intentional Emergence facilitated by Serious Play | author=Mabogunje | year=2008 | editor=L. Roosimölder|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The tendency to lose sense of time and engrossment resulting in increased involvement"&lt;ref name=Csikszentmyhalyi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mainemelis, C.|title=When the Muse takes it All: A model for the Experience of Timeliness in Organizations|journal=Academy of Management Review|year=2001|volume=26|issue=4|pages=548–565|doi=10.5465/amr.2001.5393891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through their non-judgmental and cross sector/hierarchy communicative approaches, serious play methods allow for solutions and connections to emerge that more rigid traditional methods had missed.

There exists an array of serious play methods – from "energizers" to prototyping methods and from open-ended, emergence-oriented interventions to goal-achievement-oriented interventions (e.g. gamification) – all of which offer different affordances in terms of knowledge creation, sharing, and conversion.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt;

== Characterizing different methods ==

Table 1 below characterizes five types of serious play methods, that are reoccurring in the academic literature, according to the following five parameters:

[[File:Wheel of Knowledge.png|thumb|Wheel of Knowledge]]

'''Purpose/rational:''' What is the purpose of applying the method?

'''Role(s) of the participant(s):''' Do the participants work individually or in teams? Which types of roles/activities do they engage in?

'''Level of Materiality:''' Does the method typically involve physical artifacts? Are the meaning or these literal or metaphorical? Or, in contrast, is the intervention typically delivered through a digital/virtual game or an incentive structure?

'''Degree of structure:''' Is the method explorative/open-ended? Does it allow for emergence? Or is there a "one best way" of doing the activity? Is there a quantifiable output?

'''Phase applicability:'''  In which of the phase(s) mentioned in the Wheel of Knowledge&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite journal|first=Camilla|last=Jensen|title=Play is the Proper Prescription for Entrepreneurship|year=2016|url=http://www.pubpub.org/pub/play-is-the-proper-prescription-for-entrepreneurship|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; is this method applicable? (Socialization, Externalization, Internalization, and/or Combination).

| '''LEGO® Serious Play®''' || To access and make knowledge, wisdom, and perspectives shared through model construction and storytelling. To facilitate a constructive dialogue (ideate, reflect, and strategize) about a given topic/ issue. || Participants take on roles as: individual builder, storyteller, active listener, co-constructor of physical models and metaphorical meaning. Non-competitive. The physical constraints of the building system puts emphasis on metaphors and meaning-making and takes pressure off making something that resembles. || Material and metaphorical || Semi structured: Facilitated, structured process and turn taking. Process does allow for pursuing new directions as new knowledge emerge. Participants build and tell in response to prompt, there is however no right or wrong answer – the model is their interpretation. || Exploration, socialization, ideation, innovation || (Roos &amp; Victor, 1999) (Mabogunje et al., 2008) (Gauntlett &amp; Holzwarth, 2006)
|-
| '''Low Fidelity Prototyping''' || To engage participants in generating, sharing, and maturing ideas through constructing, explaining, and refining low fidelity prototypes. || Participants take on roles as: individual builder, storyteller, active listener. Non-competitive, though participants may feel self-conscious about their drawing or building skills. || Highly material and literal || Semi structured: Facilitated, structured process and turn taking. However, the process allows for pursuing new directions as new knowledge emerge. || Exploration, socialization, ideation, innovation || (Schulz et al., 2015) (Sanders &amp; Stappers, 2008) (Von Hippel, 2006)
|-
| '''Role-play / Improv''' || To practice thinking and (inter)acting improvisational, understanding visceral reactions, suspending judgment, and going with a situation as it develops through unrehearsed open-ended scenarios. || Participants are impromptu storytellers as they act out their interpretation of the prompt, through using their body-language, mimic, voice, humor, gesticulation, etc. Audience when other participants are performing. Non-competitive, though participants often feel self-conscious when pushing their comfort zone. || Generally immaterial, but can include props || Low degree of imposed structure, Explorative in nature, Open-ended within the contextual prompt given and adhering to the rules of improv: say "yes and...", make statements, agree to the premise proposed, blurt out what comes to mind, whatever happens is right (Robson, 2015) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tina Fey|title=[[Bossypants]]|isbn=9781609419691|location=New York|publisher=Little, Brown and Co.|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Putting the rules of improv to work|date=June 30, 2014|work=MPD Adventures|accessdate=June 21, 2016|url=http://www.mpdventures.com/putting-the-rules-of-improv-to-work/}}&lt;/ref&gt; || Exploration, socialization || (Boess, 2006) (Thoring &amp; Mueller, 2012) (Lloyd-Smith &amp; Meyerson, 2015)
|-
| '''Simulations''' || To practice task-specific interactions with people and/or technologies by simulating scenarios in risk-free educational environments (physical or virtual). || Participants are the main character of their own mission. Can be individual or collaborative (team based). Performance may be rated comparatively to personal best or that of other individuals. || Virtual (e.g. virtual reality) or material (taking place in the physical world) || Structured: goals and desired outcomes are predefined. Room to experiment with ways of doing the task. Learning by doing. || Internalization (learning), socialization (if done in groups) || (Colella, 2000) (Rieber, 1996) (Aldrich, 2005)
|-
| '''[[Gamification]]''' || To incentivize productivity and/or behavior change through competition and/or a game-like reward- structure || Participants strive to achieve the goals outlined to obtain rewards and reinforcing, positive feedback. This can be individually or collaboratively. Typically competitive (against personal best or other participants/teams) || Immaterial (e.g. company incentive structure) or virtual (e.g. game or app) || Highly structured: "one best way", desired goals and outcomes are predefined. May appear open-ended to the participant, however, structure is imposed through the underlying game algorithms or company policies (incentives).|| Optimization, exploitation || (Jagoda, 2013) (Millen, DiMicco, &amp; Street, 2012) (Muntean, 2011)

Workshops will often use multiple serious play methods to compliment each other and allow participants to explore different applicability phases of the challenges they face.

'''Teachers Without Borders''' (''TWB'') is an international organization launched in 2000, with a mission to connect teachers to information and each other in order to close the education divide and based  upon the premise that teachers are community change agents and key catalysts of global development priorities. The organization was founded by [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/founder/ Dr. Fred Mednick]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} 

Teachers Without Borders received the '''[https://luxembourgpeaceprize.org/laureates/outstanding-peace-education/2018-teachers-without-borders/ 2018 Luxembourg Peace Prize]''' for Outstanding Peace Education, recognized for a free Peace Education program involving teachers from regions in conflict, for having embedded peace education into all TWB courses (see below), and its Voice of Teachers Radio Show in Nigeria. 

Teachers Without Borders received the [https://www.changemakers.com/champions-quality-education-africa '''Champions of African Education Award'''] (2010) for its use of radio and local educational capacity building to disseminate information about the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In 2018, TWB's membership has reached 177 countries. Teachers Without Borders membership is free and enables local educators the opportunity to connect with colleagues globally.

Teachers Without Borders also received the '''[http://peacesymposium.org.uk/the-ahmadiyya-muslim-peace-prize Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize]''' for "outstanding work in the promotion of peace through efforts to convene teachers from regions in conflict, provide unfettered access to courses and networks devoted to teacher professional development, and to ensure that peace education is integrated into all initiatives. The formal announcement can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viaSBMQxcAk&amp;t=9s '''here'''].

==Approach==
Teachers Without Borders claims that teachers represent the largest professional community in the world (over 65 million); that teachers are uniquely suited as local leaders to recognize and help address development needs; that professional isolation and inconsequential or missing teacher professional development undermines social change; and that the transformation of pre-service and in-service teacher development can bring about more sustainable, equitable, democratic, and economically stable societies.

==Initiatives and Courses==
Teachers Without Borders' initiatives and courses are offered in various formats and settings: online, in schools, as community workshops, in books and journals, and on the radio.

"'''Teddy'''" is a short story by [[J. D. Salinger]], completed on November 22, 1952 and originally published in the January 31, 1953
issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]'', Salinger created an engaging child character, Teddy McArdle, to introduce to his readership some of the basic concepts of [[Zen]] enlightenment and [[Vedanta]] reincarnation – a task that Salinger recognized would require overcoming some 1950s American cultural chauvinism.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236: "In 1952, most Americans thought their way of life superior to that of Eastern cultures. Salinger was well aware of this chauvinism. It was clear to him that his reading audience was not going to accept the notions of mysticism or reincarnation easily."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger wrote "Teddy" while he was arranging publication for a number of his [[Nine Stories (Salinger)|short stories]] and crafted the story to balance and contrast the collections' intended opening work "[[A Perfect Day for Bananafish]]".&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235-236&lt;/ref&gt;

In Salinger's novella, "[[Seymour: An Introduction]]", a meditation written by a member of the fictional Glass family, [[Buddy Glass]] writes about his brother, [[Seymour Glass|Seymour]], where Buddy claims authorship to "Teddy" as well as other pieces in ''Nine Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;Wenke, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The story comprises several vignettes which take place aboard a luxury liner. The events occur roughly between 10:00 and 10:30 am on October 28, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235-236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Teddy is Theodore "Teddy" McArdle, a 10-year-old mystic-savant returning home to America with his entertainer-socialite parents and his younger sister. As part of their tour of [[Great Britain]], Teddy has been interviewed as an academic curiosity by professors of religious and philosophical studies - the "Leidekker examining group" - from various European universities in order to test his claims of advanced spiritual enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first scene opens in the McArdles' stateroom. Teddy is standing on his father’s expensive suitcase, peering out of the porthole. Mr. McArdle, apparently hung-over, is attempting to verbally assert control over his son; Mrs. McArdle indulges the boy as a provocative counterpoint to her husband’s bullying: neither adult has any real impact on the child's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236: "His father, a bellicose actor and not in the best of moods, struggles to assert his authority over his child. Teddy’s mother lies under the covers in bed, taunting her husband and listlessly issuing commands to Teddy in an attempt to irritate his father."&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to his parents' outbursts impassively, he contemplates the nature of existence and physical permanence while observing fragments of orange peel that have been discarded overboard. The concepts that the preternatural child ponders are evidently derived from [[Zen]] and [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] religious philosophy, and suggest that Teddy possesses advanced enlightenment or God-consciousness. When Teddy conveys his spiritual insights to his father and mother, they interpret them merely as the products of his precociousness, eliciting annoyance or indifference from the adults.

Teddy is ordered to retrieve his six-year-old sister, Booper, who has absconded to the sport deck with her father’s expensive camera, which Teddy -  indifferent to its material value -  has bestowed upon her as a plaything. 
As he departs, Teddy delivers a short, cryptic caveat to his parents, informing them that they may never see him again outside the realm of memory.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Main Deck, Teddy has a brief encounter with one of the ship's female officers, Ensign Mathewson. Forthright and exacting,  the boy questions the officer and obtains information about a shipboard word game competition - and disabuses the bemused woman as to her misapprehensions regarding his advanced intellectual development.

Teddy proceeds to the Sport Deck and locates his little sister, Booper, at play with another young passenger. Booper is a domineering and hateful child, contrasting sharply with her older brother's equanimity. Teddy, with firmness, politely exhorts the girl to return with the camera to the cabin and report to their mother. Ignoring his sister’s verbal ripostes, he reminds her to meet him shortly for their swimming lesson at the swimming pool. She submits with bad grace as he departs.

The final scene takes place on the Sun Deck, where Teddy, reclining on one of his family's reserved deckchairs, reviews his recent diary entries. The document has been conscientiously edited and neatly written. It contains reminders to foster better relations with his father; commentary on a letter from a Professor of Literature; a list of vocabulary words to study and notes on his meditation schedule - all matters of self-improvement. While making his daily entry, he writes the following ''non sequitur'': “It will either happen today or February 14, 1958 when I am sixteen. It is ridiculous to mention it even.”

Teddy is interrupted by a passenger named Bob Nicholson, a graduate of an unnamed university, who teaches curriculum and instruction. Nicholson is on a first name basis with the Leidekker group and has listened to a taped interview with Teddy, in which he shows a lurid interest. He peppers Teddy with questions on the boy’s commitment to the precepts of Vedantic reincarnation; Teddy remains composed in the face of the young man’s veiled hostility, and provides him with a brief sketch of this discovery of God, his relationships with his parents and his views on Zen philosophy. The boy offers Nicholson an extended metaphor on the nature of logic that challenges the young man’s rational and orthodox commitment to material reality. Teddy, in explaining his position on death and reincarnation gives a hypothetical example describing a series of events at his upcoming swimming lesson in which a fatality occurs: his own.

Teddy disengages from the interview and hurries to his lesson. Nicholson pursues him through the levels of the ship's decks, and as he begins to descend the stairs to the swimming pool, he hears the scream of "a small, female child" emanating from the enclosed walls of the indoor pool. The story ends on this ambiguous note.

==Analysis==

===The porthole and the orange peel===

In the opening scene set in the Mr. and Mrs. McArdle's state room, Salinger presents two facets of Zen enlightenment: "God-consciousness", a profound awareness of "inner spirit", in contrast to material concerns, and secondly, "the notion of impermanence", based on "the Vedantic belief that separate existence is an illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Teddy, perched on a piece of luggage, pokes his head through the open porthole, penetrating figuratively into a zone of enlightenment and sublimity; his body remains in the cabin, where his parents – “materialistic and self-centered” – engage in mildly abusive repartee, issuing petulant and ineffectual commands to their son, who endures them with tolerant detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Teddy’s astonishing self-possession is a product of his adherence to Vedantic “philosophy of non-attachment”, enabling him to distinguish between “the world of illusion” – the material world – and “the world of reality”, where “only unity of God is real.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237-238&lt;/ref&gt;

The boy focuses his attention on some discarded orange peel suspended momentarily on the ocean surface; as they sink out of sight, he engages in “[[Solipsism|solipsistic]] contemplation. Teddy conveys his revelation to his parents: “After I go out this door, I may only exist in the minds of all my acquaintances…I may be an orange peel.” His mother and father, victims of their spiritual “immaturity”, are incapable of grasping his warning that they may never see him again. Salinger issues this Vedantic premonition to the reader as a clue to Teddy’s fate.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237: “It foreshadows the story’s ending…”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Booper===

The same studied disengagement that characterizes Teddy’s relationship with his parents also informs the “amazing” toleration he exhibits toward his younger sister – a child that biographer Kenneth Slawenski describes as “a cruel little girl” and “perhaps the most vicious child ever discharged by Salinger’s imagination.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

When Booper announces that she “hates everybody in the ocean”, Salinger calls attention to the setting of his story: the sea, with its infinite horizons and indefinite boundaries where his characters drift – a seascape that reflects “the Zen and Vedantic concepts of existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teddy’s tolerance of his sister is due to his understanding that few reincarnations have contributed to the six-year old’s spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237-238: “[Teddy] recognizes that  she has only just begun her spiritual journey and has many reincarnations ahead of her.”&lt;/ref&gt; Booper’s misanthropic persona make plausible her role in the sinister and unsettling denouement at the swimming  pool.

===Bob Nicholson===

The final vignette occurs on the Sun Deck. Bob Nicholson, a teacher at Trinity College, Dublin, is acquainted with some members of the Leidekker group who examined Teddy; he engages the boy in an ''ad hoc'' interview.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238: “[Nicholson] imposes himself on Teddy and begins to pepper him with philosophical questions.”&lt;/ref&gt; This serves two purposes in Salinger’s story. First, he functions as a foil to Teddy,  posing logical questions challenging the tenets of Vendantic and Zen philosophy. Salinger uses this device to respond to hostile skeptics among his readers.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p.238: “Nicholson’s character serves two purposes. Salinger uses him as a sounding board against which Teddy can express Vedantic and Zen viewpoints that Nicholson reacts to skeptically.”&lt;/ref&gt; According to Slawenski, Nicholson “embodies the logic that poisons God-consciousness, and he represents the power of the intellect to blind individuals from spiritual truth.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson additionally functions as a witness to Teddy’s final discourse on the nature of existence and death, in which the boy formulates the circumstances that might lead to his reincarnation. In a lull in their exchange, Teddy becomes momentarily distracted by an inner voice or vision, and spontaneously recites to Nicholson two haiku by the 17th Century poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Bashō]]: “Nothing in the voice of the cicada intimates how soon it will die” and “Along this road goes no one, this autumn eve.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson, pursuing Teddy to the indoor swimming pool, hears, but does not see, the event that the boy prophesied, providing the reader with tantalizing evidence that leaves the boy's ultimate fate a mystery.

===The "swimming pool ending"===

The ending of Salinger’s “Teddy” has been described as “controversial” &lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 1999,  p. 169-172&lt;/ref&gt; and “the most widely criticized ending of any story that he ever wrote.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger thrice provides the  reader with intimations of Teddy’s demise: in statements to his parents, in his diary and to Nicholson. This has led readers to interpret the final passage as confirmation of the boy’s premonition  i.e. Booper shoves her older brother into the empty concrete pool and screams when she sees the deadly consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239: “Most readers have interpreted the closing lines of “Teddy” as indicating Teddy’s death at the hand of Booper. This conclusion is derived from Teddy’s own predictions rather than the text itself.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Slawenski reports two additional interpretations that might be derived from the final passage. One option is that Teddy “recognizing the threat his sister poses” evades her thrust and pushes her to her death, as act of premeditated murder.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; A third option is that both children plunge into the empty basin when Teddy carries Booper with him off the precipice – in order to advance her into her next reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; "None of these" says Slawenski, "is very satisfying."

Critics of the story may have targeted the ending for disapproval, rather than engage in a culturally biased critique of Salinger’s foray into Zen philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 240: “[T]he story's critics – many of whom found fault with in its Eastern tenets – conveniently delivered the brunt of disapproval to the story's ambiguous ending, rather than condemn cultural philosophies they did not understand.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger himself regarded the work as “exceptionally Haunting [sic]” and “memorable” yet “unpleasantly controversial” and “thoroughly unsuccessful.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3148">'''The Global 100''' Index is a ranking of the world's most [[sustainable]] corporations. The list is compiled by Toronto-based media and investment advisory firm, [[Corporate Knights]] (CK).

Each year, the latest iteration of the index is announced at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland.

As at December 31, 2013 the Global 100 has outperformed its benchmark, the [[MSCI]] All Country World Index by 3.21%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corporateknights.com/article/corporate-knights-announces-latest-additions-its-widely-followed-global-100-index-world-econ&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global 100 was created by Corporate Knights Magazine in 2005. The goal of creating the index was to devise a methodology to quantitatively compare and rank the world’s largest public companies.

==Methodology==

The Global 100 uses a purely quantitative methodology to determine inclusion in the ranking. The Global 100 starting universe automatically considers all firms with a market capitalization of at least US$2 billion. The firms are then put through numerous screenings to test for key information, including; overall sustainability disclosure rate and sustainability disclosure rate versus [[Global Industry Classification Standard|GICS]] sector peers, a financially based Piotroski [[F-score]] to ensure financial stability, and fines, penalties or settlements paid out by the company for sustainability related violations. Companies in the GICS sub-industry categories of tobacco and those engaged primarily in defence are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://global100.org/methodology/&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial screening process culminates in the Global 100 shortlist. At this point, companies are compared on priority key performance indicators (KPIs), according to GICS sector. Priority indicators are chosen based on the percentage of firms in the sector who disclose the indicator. If less than 10% disclose, than the indicator will not be considered a priority KPI for that sector. There are a maximum of 12 KPIs used in the ranking, they are:

* Energy Productivity
* Carbon Productivity
* Water Productivity
* Waste Productivity
* Innovation Capacity
* Percentage Tax Paid
* CEO to Average Worker Pay
* Pension Fund Status
* Safety Performance
* Employee Turnover
* Leadership Diversity
* Clean Capitalism Pay Link

Each KPI is weighted equally and companies are given an overall percentage score. Failure to disclose a priority KPI will result in a zero, thus severely punishing firms for [[non-disclosure]].

==Accolades==
The Global 100 Index has been recognized as a leader in transparency and industry best practices for sustainability rankings, according to SustainAbility’s Rate the Raters project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainability.com/projects/rate-the-raters#projtab-6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Living Cosmos: Our Search for Life in the Universe''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by the [[astronomer]] [[Chris Impey]] that discusses the subject of [[astrobiology]] and efforts to discover life beyond [[Earth]]. It was published as a hardcover by [[Random House]] in 2007 and as a paperback by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2011.

==Summary==
The Living Cosmos is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[University of Arizona]] professor of [[astronomy]] [[Chris Impey]] on the status of [[astrobiology]]. It summarizes the state of research as scientists trying to address one of the most profound questions we can ask about nature: Is there [[life in the universe]] beyond the Earth? The author interviewed dozens of leading researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item5600535/?site_locale=en_US|title=Talking About Life|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he includes material from the interviews and vignettes of the researchers in the book. The companion web site to the book contains articles and video clips on astrobiology produced by the author, as well as a glossary and links to other relevant sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelivingcosmos.com|title=The Living Cosmos|author=Hardegree-Ullman, K. K.|author2=Impey, C. D.|last-author-amp=yes|date=2011|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book begins with a review of the cosmic setting for life and reviews the insights of astronomy since [[Copernicus]]. The discovery that we live in a “biological universe” would be a continuation of the progression where there is nothing exceptional about the setting of the Earth and the events that have occurred on this planet.

Subsequent chapters consider the [[origin of life on Earth]], and the physical extremes to which life as adapted. In [[astrobiology]], it pays to think “outside the box” and imagine how strange life might be or whether post-[[biological evolution]] is possible, where the basis is mechanical or computational. A chapter on evolution shows how it is affected by the cosmic environment.
 
Possibilities of life in the [[Solar System]] are considered next, with emphasis on [[Mars]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and outer [[moons]] harboring [[liquid water]]. Next is a summary of the rapidly changing state of play in the search for [[extrasolar planets]] or exoplanets. After centuries of speculation and decades of futile searching, planets around other stars were first discovered in 1995 and the number is now over 850, with several thousand more candidates from the [[Kepler mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exoplanet.eu/|title=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia (Check here for an updated catalog of exoplanets)|author=Jean Schneider|date=2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ends with the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ([[SETI]]) and the use of the [[Drake equation]] to frame discussions of cosmic companionship.

The web site for the book features images of a set of seven mixed media, boxed construction art pieces by Heather Green, commissioned specially for the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio5.org/about/experience-bio5|title=Experience BIO5|publisher=[[Arizona Board of Regents]]|date=2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art is on permanent display in the BIO5 Institute at the University of Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartagrafia.com|title=cartagrafia - projects|author=Heather Green|date=2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article on the collaboration between Heather Green and Chris Impey and the artistic and scientific themes of the work was published in the [[Leonardo Journal]] online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardo.info/isast/journal/toc435.html|title=Leonardo Journal|issue=5|volume=43|author=Ellen K. Levy|date=2010|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Living Cosmos was generally very well received. It received a starred review from [[Kirkus Reviews]], referring to the book as a “Lively, clear, and up-to-date overview of [[astronomy]], [[cosmology]], [[biology]], and [[evolution]], specifically as related to the search for [[extraterrestrial life]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/chris-impey/the-living-cosmos/|title=The Living Cosmos by Chris Impey, Kirkus|author=Kirkus Review|date=2010|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular magazine [[Entertainment Weekly]] gave the book a grade of B+, saying it was “not an easy read” but calling it a “live, elegant overview”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20163350,00.html|title=The Living Cosmos Review|author=Wook Kim|date=2007|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reviewed by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Physics Today]]'', and ''[[New Scientist]]'', with the latter commenting on occasional digressions, but declaring the book “beautifully written”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626353.300-review-ithe-living-cosmos-by-chris-impey.html|title=Review: The Living Cosmos by Chris Impey|author=Lewis Dartnell|date=2007|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reader reviews are 85% five stars on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and over 90% like the book on [[Goodreads]]. The 2011 paperback edition has updates to help keep up with the accelerating pace of [[exoplanet]] discovery.

The '''University of New Brunswick''' ('''UNB''') is a [[public university]] with two primary campuses in [[Fredericton]] and [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]]. It is the oldest English-language university in Canada, and among the oldest public universities in North America.&lt;ref name = facts&gt;University of New Brunswick [https://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/quickfacts.html]. Retrieved on: August 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; UNB was founded by a group of seven [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who left the United States after the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Happy Birthday to the University of New Brunswick"&gt;[http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2010/09/23/canadas-oldest-english-university/ Happy Birthday to the University of New Brunswick]. ''MacLeans''. By [[Julia Belluz]]. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

UNB has two main campuses: the original campus, founded in 1785 in [[Fredericton]], and a smaller campus which opened in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] in 1964. In addition, there are two small satellite health sciences campuses located in [[Moncton]] and [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], and two offices in the [[Caribbean]] and in [[Beijing]]. UNB offers over 75 degrees in fourteen faculties at the [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate student|graduate]] levels with a total student enrollment of approximately 11,400 between the two principal campuses.&lt;ref name="UNB Quick Facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNB Quick Facts|url=https://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/quickfacts.html|publisher=University of New Brunswick|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNB was named the most entrepreneurial university in Canada at the 2014 Startup Canada Awards.&lt;ref name="UNB Newsroom"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.unb.ca/newsroom/2014/06/12/unb-named-most-entrepreneurial-university-in-canada/|title=UNB Newsroom|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding and charters===
In 1783, [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] settlers began to build upon the ruins of a former [[Acadian]] village called Ste-Anne-des-Pays-Bas. The new settlement was named Frederick's Town in honour of [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Prince Frederick]], son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and uncle of [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name="Fredericton"&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/literary-tour/027020-2020-e.html "Fredericton"]. ''Collections Canada''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially modelled on the [[Anglican]] ideals of older, European institutions, the University of New Brunswick was founded in 1785 as the Academy of Liberal Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref name="CanEncyc"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kernaghan| first = Lois| title = University of New Brunswick| work = The Canadian Encyclopedia| accessdate = 2014-10-05| date = 2013-12-16| url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/university-of-new-brunswick/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150911115746/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/university-of-new-brunswick/| archivedate = 2015-09-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition requesting the establishment of the school, titled "The Founders' Petition of 1785," was addressed to Governor [[Thomas Carleton]] and was signed by seven [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] men: [[William Paine (physician)|William Paine]], [[William Wanton]], [[George Sproule]], [[Zephaniah Kingsley Sr.|Zephaniah Kingsley, Sr.]], [[John Coffin (judge)|John Coffin]], [[Ward Chipman]], and [[Adino Paddock]].&lt;ref name="The Founders' Petition of 1785"&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/225/petition.html "The Founders' Petition of 1785"].

[[File:UNB Old Arts Building.jpg|left|thumb|319x319px|The Old Arts Building on the Fredericton campus is the oldest university building in the country that is still in regular use for school operations.]]

By an 1800 provincial charter, signed by [[Jonathan Odell]], the Academy of Liberal Arts and Sciences became the College of New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="Historical Sketch of UNB"&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/history/historicalsketch.html "Historical Sketch of UNB"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414183443/http://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/history/historicalsketch.html |date=2015-04-14 }}. ''About UNB''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The College was succeeded by King's College, which was granted by royal charter in December 1827. King's College operated under the control of the [[Church of England]] until 1859, when it was made non-sectarian by an act of the provincial legislature that transformed the College into the University of New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="UNB's Heraldic Tapestries"&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/225/tapestries.html "UNB's Heraldic Tapestries"]. ''UNB Libraries''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, Mary Kingsley Tibbits became the first regularly admitted female student of UNB.

===20th/21st centuries===
In 1906, UNB established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors exercising exclusive control over financial policy and other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to provide institutional leadership. By 1867, the University of New Brunswick had two faculties: Arts and Applied Science. It awarded the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Science]]. The latter was awarded only in the fields of [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[forestry]]. At this time, the university had 156 male students, 21 female students, and only eleven academic staff, who were all male.&lt;ref&gt;Dominion Bureau of Statistics, ''Canada Year Book 1921'', Ottawa, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, University policies changed in response to social pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. In 1964, a second, smaller campus was established in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. The growth of the UNBSJ campus is particularly notable, for the campus began with only 96 students spread throughout various buildings in Saint John's central business district. In 1968, UNBSJ moved to its new home at Tucker Park.

The [[Association of University of New Brunswick Teachers]] (AUNBT) was established in 1954; in 1979, this association became the bargaining agent for all full-time academic staff, and in 2008, it achieved certification for contract academic staff.

====Relocation of the Faculty of Law====
[[File:UNBSJ.jpg|thumb|311x311px|View from the UNB Saint John campus]]
{{Main|University of New Brunswick Faculty of Law}}
In 1959, the Faculty of Law moved from Saint John to Fredericton following a report on the status of legal education in Canada by Professor Maxwell Cohen from [[McGill University]]. In his report, Cohen stated that the Saint John Law School was only "nominally a faculty of UNB". This prompted [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], as Chancellor, and UNB President [[Colin B. Mackay]], to permanently move the Saint John Law School to the UNB Fredericton campus, despite the Dean's objections.

====Polytechnic controversy====
In the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended that UNBSJ and the [[New Brunswick Community College]] be reformed and consolidated into a new [[institute of technology|polytechnic]] post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the several organized protests. Under heavy fire from the public, the [[Shawn Graham|Graham government]] eventually announced that it would set aside the possibility of UNB Saint John losing its status as a university and would refer the report to a working group for further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2007/10/17/university-report.html | work=CBC News | title=UNB Saint John will remain a university, says minister | date=October 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government would go on to announce in January that UNBSJ would retain its liberal arts program and its association with UNB&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/news/pre/2008e0119pr.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the working group reported back to government in May, with its findings and government's response being made public in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2008/06/13/nb-post-sec-report.html | work=CBC News | title=Post-secondary education report will be released within days: minister | date=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
Currently UNBF has approximately 9,000 students while UNBSJ has 3,000. Though UNBF has more students at the moment, UNSBT is growing at a faster rate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Both campuses have undergone significant expansion over the years, and many University buildings have received funding from Lord Beaverbrook and other prominent industrialists and philanthropists. UNB's largest expansion coincided with the [[Post–World War II baby boom|baby boom]], when its Fredericton campus tripled in size.

[[File:Sir Max Aitken.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] served as Chancellor of the University of New Brunswick and became the university's greatest benefactor.]]

===Fredericton===
The UNB Fredericton campus is located on a hill overlooking the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]]. The campus is well known for its colourful fall foliage, Georgian style red-brick buildings, and a very steep hill.{{cn|date=August 2018}} UNB Fredericton has shared the "College Hill" with [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]] (STU) since 1964, when the former St. Thomas College moved from Chatham, NB (now [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]]). While the universities share some infrastructure, they remain separate institutions.

====Architecture====
Architect [[G. Ernest Fairweather]] designed several of the campus buildings, including the Old Civil Engineering Building (1900) and the Gymnasium (1906).&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1283 Biographic Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800–1950 [[G. Ernest Fairweather]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several of the stained glass windows in the Convocation Hall were created by [[Robert McCausland Limited]].

UNBF's War Memorial Hall (usually referred to as Memorial Hall), originally built as a science building in 1924, honours the 35 UNB Alumni who died in [[World War I]].

UNBF's Brigadier Milton F. Gregg, V.C., Centre for the Study of War and Society (usually referred to as The Gregg Centre) was created in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8513{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Gregg Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

The Richard J. Currie Center, a five-storey 139,000-square-foot building, was constructed in 2013.&lt;ref name="University of New Brunswick"/&gt;

====National Historic Sites====
Two buildings on the Fredericton campus have been designated [[National Historic Sites of Canada]]: the 1827 [[Sir Howard Douglas Hall]] (the Old Arts Building), and the 1851 [[William Brydone Jack Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|7369|Arts Building|3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|9981|William Brydone Jack Observatory|3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint John===
The UNB Saint John campus (UNBSJ) is located in Tucker Park in the [[Millidgeville, New Brunswick|Millidgeville]] neighbourhood, several kilometres north of the city's central business district, and has views of the Kennebecasis River and Grand Bay. New Brunswick's largest health care facility, [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], is located adjacent to the UNBSJ campus. Since 2010, the UNBSJ campus has been home to Dalhousie Medicine New Brunswick, a medical school that operates as a partnership between the [[Government of New Brunswick]], the University of New Brunswick and [[Dalhousie University|Dalhousie]]’s Faculty of Medicine.

The Saint John campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed between the 1970s and the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students.
[[File:Commons unbsj 003.JPG|thumb|303x303px|The Hans W. Klohn Commons at UNB Saint John]]

Notable{{cn|date=August 2018}} differences from its parent campus in Fredericton lay in the campus culture. While UNB Fredericton has a substantial number of students living in its on-campus residences, this is not the case for UNBSJ. The majority of students do not live within walking distance of the campus due to its remote location, so unlike Fredericton, Saint John is predominantly a "commuter campus".

====Architecture====
April 1, 2010, the construction on the Hans W. Klohn Commons began. This building is one of the most environmentally friendly buildings in Atlantic Canada.&lt;ref name="A smarter, greener library"&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/excellence/commons.html "A smarter, greener library"]. ''UNB Excellence''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The building features an electric elevator that produces power for the commons. The building is part of the Tucker Park enhancement project, which will include the refurbishment of the Canada Games Stadium, the new Dalhousie Medicine New Brunswick facility, and the New Brunswick Community College’s Allied Health building.

===Sustainability===
The University of New Brunswick has attempted to reduce its environmental impact through installing a natural gas burning microturbine at the Central Heating Plant that produces 100&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity for the university.&lt;ref name=" Campus Sustainability Projects"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = UNB Campus Sustainability Projects
  | publisher = University of New Brunswick
  | url = https://www.unb.ca/sustainability/PhysicalPlantProjects.htm
  | accessdate = 2009-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heat energy, a result of this process, is used to contribute to the overall heating of the campus to increase its overall energy efficiency.  In addition, all produce and dairy products used within its dining services are obtained from local farmers and local producers; the campus offers grass-fed beef, [[fair trade coffee]], and dining locations offer biodegradable to-go containers. UNB recycles electronics in addition to traditional materials and operates a move-out materials collection program. The university adheres to a green purchasing policy and has reduced greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent since 1990; they have also decreased water consumption since 2005 through the adoption of new technologies. With these efforts to create a more sustainable campus, the University of New Brunswick received an overall "B+" grade in the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card put out by the Sustainable Endowment’s Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Report Card 2011|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/university-of-new-brunswick|publisher= Sustainable Endowments Institute|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
There are over 75 undergraduate programs, the school of Graduate Studies offers course and research-based programs in over 30 fields and UNB has a 16:1 student-to-faculty ratio.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Research and academics==
UNB is the seat of 11 Canada Research Chairs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Research Chairs|url=http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is home to more than 60 research centres and institutes.

In 2014, UNB was awarded the most entrepreneurial university in Canada by Startup Canada.&lt;ref name="UNB Newsroom"/&gt; The university has also supported in launching 23 new startup companies as of 2015.

In 2019, ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine ranked UNB 8th out of 15 universities placed in the publication's "comprehensive university" category.&lt;ref name="Macdocc"/&gt; For several years running, UNB's libraries have been ranked in the top spot nationally in terms of the percentage of the overall budget devoted to libraries and in terms of holdings per student.

In 2012, UNB's law school was ranked 2nd nationally in elite firm hiring by ''Maclean's''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranking Canada's Law Schools|url=http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2012/09/07/the-2012-macleans-law-school-rankings/|publisher=Rogers Digital Media|accessdate=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Canadian Lawyer Magazine, the law school ranks among the top five in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good University Ranking Guide|url=http://whichuniversitybest.blogspot.com/2010/05/university-of-new-brunswick-rankings.html|publisher=Good University Ranking Guide|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poets' Corner====
Because so many of UNB's students, alumni, and professors have produced celebrated poetry, the city of Fredericton has earned the nickname "Poets' Corner." Two of Canada's four [[Confederation Poets]] – [[Charles G. D. Roberts|Sir Charles G.D. Roberts]] and [[Bliss Carman]] – were educated at UNB, as was [[Francis Joseph Sherman]], along with a number of notable 20th- and 21st-century Canadian writers. In 1947, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada unveiled a "Poet's Corner" monument in honour of Carman, Roberts, and Sherman.&lt;ref name="Poets' Corner of Canada"&gt;[http://lib.unb.ca/225/poetscorner.html "Poets' Corner"].

''Collections Canada''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute of Biomedical Engineering===
The Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBME) on the Fredericton campus is one of the research institutes in biomedical engineering in Canada. It was founded in 1965 as the Bio-Engineering Institute, making it one of the oldest research institutes to be solely dedicated to the field of biomedical engineering. The institute is also the region's prosthetic fitting centre where amputees are fitted with "intelligent" artificial limbs. The institute also carries out research in the field of myoelectric signal processing, biomedical instrumentation and human [[motion analysis]]. The IBME also developed the UNB Test of Prosthetic Function which is used by researchers all over the world. Although the institute does not offer degrees in biomedical engineering, students at UNB usually enroll in one of the other faculties of engineering such as electrical or mechanical and pursue their research in biomedical engineering at the IBME.

===Canadian Rivers Institute===
{{Main|Canadian Rivers Institute}}
The Canadian Rivers Institute was founded in 2000 and is a site of [[river]] sciences research. The mandate of the CRI is to conduct both multi-disciplinary basic and applied research focusing on rivers from their [[headwaters]] to their [[estuaries]], to promote the conservation, protection and sustainable use of water, and to educate professionals, graduate students and the public on water sciences.  Members of the CRI conduct research on regional, national and international issues related to rivers and their land-water linkages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.unb.ca/cri/documents/CRI_Annual_Report_2005.pdf | title=CRI Annual Report | date=2007-08-01 | accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With researchers from both UNB campuses, the CRI develops the aquatic science needed to understand, protect and sustain water resources. Since 2013, the CRI and its partners have been working with NB Power to research the potential environmental impacts of the future options being considered for the Mactaquac Generating Station. The Mactaquac Dam on the Saint John River will reach the end of its lifespan by 2030, and CRI has been evaluating key environmental challenges such as river health, fish passage and flow management. In 2015, CRI was given an additional $2.8 million from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to conduct an aquatic ecosystem study on the Saint John River.

===Mi'kmaq-Maliseet Institute===
UNB created its BEd program for [[First Nations]] students in 1977 in an effort to help First Nations communities take control of their own schools. In 1981, the Mi'kmaq-Maliseet Institute opened its doors with an expanded mandate to train professionals and improve First Nations access to First Nations education. The Institute provides a variety of services, including research, curriculum development, language education, policy development, children's literacy, and more. In addition, the Institute funds the Mi'kmaq-Maliseet Resource Collection, which contains materials that are immensely valuable to knowledge of First Nations culture, history, and perspective in the region.

===Canadian Research Institute for Social Policy===
The Canadian Research Institute for Social Policy was founded in 1996 as the Atlantic Centre for Policy Research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unb.ca/research/institutes/crisp/aboutus/index.html|title=UNB {{!}} Canadian Research Institute for Social Policy {{!}} About Us {{!}} UNB|website=www.unb.ca|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research.

==Student life==
UNB has approximately 10,000 students from over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/quickfacts.html|title=Quick Facts {{!}} About UNB {{!}} UNB|website=www.unb.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small class sizes and low student-to-professor ratio (16:1) mean professors get to know their students by name. Students have over 125 clubs and societies to choose from between the Fredericton and Saint John campuses and there are 13 residences available to students in Fredericton and two in Saint John. Students on both campuses have access to UNB's facilities, fitness classes and outdoor activities such as snowshoeing and kayaking.  There are exchanges available in more than 35 countries around the world with over 89 university partners.

==Athletics==
{{Main|UNB Varsity Reds}}

[[File:UNB Varsity Reds logo.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Varsity Reds logo]]

UNB Fredericton is represented in [[U Sports]] by the [[UNB Varsity Reds]] while UNBSJ is represented by the [[UNBSJ Seawolves]].&lt;ref name="University of New Brunswick"/&gt; The Varsity Reds compete in the following sports: men's and women's [[basketball]], men's [[hockey]], men's and women's [[soccer]], men's and women's [[volleyball]], and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]. Men's and women's track &amp; field and cross country were added as a varsity sport for 2010/2011; this is a joint Fredericton/Saint John Campus program.

In the past, UNBF used different names for each individual sport's team; for instance, the men's swim team was the Beavers, and the hockey team was the Red Devils. The university club teams, which are supported financially by the Student Union as well as by individual members of the teams, do not use the Varsity Reds name and thus continue the tradition of using different nicknames for each sport.

===Songs===
Traditional among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various times such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic events are "Carmina Universitatis Novi Brunsvici", "Alma Mater" (1904), and "UNB Anthem", with words by A.G. Bailey and music by D.V. Start.&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/college-songs-and-songbooks-emc/ College Songbooks and Songs – University of New Brunswick]. Encyclopedia of Music in Canada. Historia. Retrieved on: August 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Colloquial songs included "Bombers Away" to celebrate the football team:{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
Bombers away, my boys&lt;br /&gt;
Bombers away,&lt;br /&gt;
'Cause when you fight red bombers.&lt;br /&gt;

Fight, Fight, Fight.

'''Variantology''' has been conceived as an international research project with the aim of developing a critical appraisal of the established concepts of “[[Mass media|media]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://variantology.com/|title=Vilém Flusser Archiv|website=Variantology.com|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a medium is thus opened up to approaches and disciplines that up to now have remained outside the contemporary discourse on media, such as [[theology]], various [[musicology]], aspects of [[natural sciences]], [[fine arts]] or [[classical philology]]. Furthermore, it is opened up to cultures of knowledge that have long been excluded from the western discourse, like the oriental and Arabic-Islamic culture. Variantology also attempts to explore how reciprocally these disciplines then become open to thinking in categories and terms of media and [[communication]]. Consequently, the network of research that constitutes the Variantology project involves scholars based in academic institutions as well as artists, musicians and authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entropie.digital.udk-berlin.de/wiki/Variantology]  {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711031153/http://entropie.digital.udk-berlin.de/wiki/Variantology |date=2012-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical basis ==
To come to a different understanding of media, a central part of research is the development of a network of scientists, artists and scholars who are engaged with the "deep time relations“ between arts, sciences, and technologies. The term "deep time relations“ refers to the notion of being a plurality of traversals through the genealogy of what we call media today.&lt;ref&gt;"Deep Time" is a term coined in palaeontological studies, especially by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[John McPhee]].&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying theoretical center is [[Michel Foucault]]’s concept of genealogy,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Nietzsche, Genealogy, History.” in: Paul Rabinow (Editor). The Foucault Reader. Vintage. 1984. {{ISBN|0-394-71340-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he developed from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]’s thinking about morality as a historical- and social-generated construction.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. On the Genealogy of Morals. Oxford University Press. 2009. {{ISBN|0-19-953708-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault's approach in this connection was to comprehend history as a constitution of knowledge, of discourses, of objectification and so on, detached from an idea of historical subjects and previously unquestioned categories of western (Eurocentric) culture and power.

== Workshops and publications ==
An integral part of the project is the annual international workshop. The first three Variantology workshops were held at [[Academy of Media Arts Cologne]], the fourth one at [[UdK]] in Berlin, and the 5th at [[Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III]] in Naples, Italy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3611">[[File:Goemnigk field2.JPG|thumb|Woodland edge in [[Brandenburg]]]]
A '''woodland edge''' or '''forest edge''' is the transition zone ([[ecotone]]) from an area of woodland or forest to fields or other open spaces. Certain species of plants and animals are adapted to the forest edge, and these species are often more familiar to humans than species only found deeper within forests. A classic example of a forest edge species is the [[white-tailed deer]] in North America.

== The woodland edge on maps ==
On [[topographic map]]s woods and forests are generally depicted in a soft green colour. Their edges are - like other features - usually determined from [[aerial photograph]]s, but sometimes also by [[land|terrestrial]] [[survey (geography)|survey]]. However, they only represent a snapshot in time because almost all woods have a tendency to spread or to gradually fill [[clearing (wood)|clearing]]s. In addition, working out the exact edge of the wood or forest may be difficult where it transitions into [[scrubland|scrub]] or [[shrub|bush]]es or the trees thin out slowly. Differences of opinion here often involved several tens of metres. In addition, many [[cartographer]]s prefer to show even small islands of trees, while others – depending on the [[scale (map)|scale]] of the map – prefer [[cartographic generalization|more general]], continuous lines to demarcate the forest or woodland edges.

For specialised work, aerial photographs or [[satellite imagery]] are frequently utilised without having to revise the maps. [[Cadastral map]]s cannot show the current situation because for reasons of cost they can only be updated at fairly long intervals and [[cultural boundary|cultural boundaries]] are not legally binding.

== Woodland edges and biology ==
[[File:Waldrandentwicklung.JPG|thumb|Natural woodland edge development through [[succession (biology)|succession]] of an abandoned meadow]]
On the woodland edge – however it is defined – not only does the [[flora]] change, but also the [[fauna]] and the [[soil type]]. These [[edge effects]] mean that many species of animal prefer woodland edges to the heart of the forest, because they have both protection and light - for example [[tree pipit]]s and [[dunnock]]s. At the woodland edge trees are often different from those inside the wood, as well as [[hedge]] vegetation, [[bramble]]s and low-growing plants.
The more gradual the transition from open country to woodland (for example through intermediate young trees or bushes), the less risk there is that, in stormy weather, wind will blow under the canopy and uproot the outer rows of trees. The structure of the woodland edge and its maintenance is viewed as important in [[forest management]] especially during [[reforestation]].

[[Hunter]]s also use the forest edge for the observation and hunting of [[wildlife]], for example, by using [[tree stand]]s or [[hunting blind|hides]].

The '''World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)''' is a [[CEO]]-led organization of over 200 [[multinational company|international companies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/About-us|title=About us|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Council is also connected to 60 national and regional buisness councils and partner organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geneve-int.ch/world-business-council-sustainable-development-wbcsd-0|title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development - WBCSD {{!}} Genève Internationale|website=www.geneve-int.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Its origins date back to the Rio de Janeiro [[Earth Summit]] of 1992,&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt; when [[Stephan Schmidheiny]], a Swiss business entrepreneur, was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memo to Rio+20: 'green economy' doesn't mean monetising nature|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/29/rio-20-green-economy-monetising-nature|website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created a forum called "Business Council for Sustainable Development", which went on to become ''Changing Course'', a book that coined the concept of [[eco-efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eco-Efficiency|url=http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/business/ecoeffic.shtml|website=www.smartcommunities.ncat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBCSD was created in 1995 in a merger of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Industry Council for the Environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= THE ICC &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT|url=http://archive.corporateeurope.org/icc/icc_environment.html|website=archive.corporateeurope.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based at the [[Maison de la paix]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/globalwarming/n721.xml|website=knowledge.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offices in New York and New Delhi.

==Operations==
The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are Circular Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Circular-Economy|title=Circular Economy - World business council for sustainable development|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cities and Mobility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Cities-and-Mobility|title=Cities and Mobility|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Climate and Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy|title=Energy &amp; Circular Economy|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Food, Land and Water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Food-Land-Water|title=Food, Land &amp; Water|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/People|title=People|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Redefining Value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Redefining-Value|title=Redefining Value|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.wbcsd.org/2018/11/Value.Impact.Voice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Impact and influence==
A 2003 [[World Bank]]/[[International Finance Corporation|IFC]] commissioned study  identified the WBCSD as one of the "most influential forums" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcesaver.org/file/toolmanager/CustomO16C45F49313.pdf Race to the Top: Attracting and Enabling Global Sustainable Business]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 [[Globescan]] survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surveys.globescan.com/sdroleaders/sose04-2_resorg.pdf 2004 Globescan Survey of Sustainability Experts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a "major role" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpi.cam.ac.uk/PDF/Aug%202006.pdf Cambridge Sustainability Research Digest]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007's [[Ethisphere Institute]] list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked 9th, which made him the 2nd most influential NGO leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethisphere.com/influential/ 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210162230/http://ethisphere.com/influential/ |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to [[sustainable development]]. Among its over 180 members&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members&lt;/ref&gt; are well-known companies such as [[DuPont]], [[3M]], [[Nestlé]], [[BP]], [[Danone]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. WBCSD provides its members with the '''value, impact and voice''' to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members|title=Our members|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental.

A key element is the personal commitment of the [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officers]] (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD’s policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD’s work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies.

===Forética===
Forética claims to be global network of [[Spanish language|Spanish speaking]] businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestación ética para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to [[ISO 26000]] and supported by [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csr-supplychain.org/ CSR Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/eNews/eNewsDetails.aspx?ID=16293&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true Leading Spanish think-tank Forética joins WBCSD’s Global Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The WBCSD is a member-led organization governed by a Council composed of the Council Members of its member companies. The Council elects the Executive Committee, including the Chairman and four Vice Chairmen. Past chairmen include:

* Rodney F. Chase - [[BP]] (1995)
* [[Livio D. DeSimone]] - [[3M]] (1996/97)
* [[Egil Myklebust]] - [[Norsk Hydro]] (1998/99)
* [[Charles O. Holliday]], Jr. - [[DuPont]] (2000/01)

* [[Paul Polman]] - [[Unilever]] (2012-17)
*Sunny Verghese - [[Olam International|Olam]] (2018-2020)

==Geographic balance==
Most of WBCSD's member companies are headquartered in Europe (47%). 22% member companies are headquartered in Asia, 22% in North America and 5% in Latin America. The geographically least represented regions are Africa, Australasia and the Middle East with 1% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members|title=Our members|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

According to Greenpeace the ''World Business Council for Sustainable Development '' is among the key players responsible for holding the world societies from tackling the [[climate change]] and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest nonrenewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a ‘Who’s Who’ of the world’s largest carbon-intensive companies.&lt;ref name=GP2010&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/391%20-%20WhosHoldingUsBack.pdf Who's holding us back?Full report] November 23, 2011 page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sierra Club]] has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/rocky-mountain-chapter/calendar-2 |title=Calendar &amp;#124; Sierra Club |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austineconetwork.com/content/austin-sierra-club-monthly-meeting |title=Austin Sierra Club monthly meeting &amp;#124; Austin EcoNetwork |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental Defense Fund]] recommends the World Business Council's auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/GHG_roadmap_Final.pdf |title=www.edf.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/biofuels-sustainability-certification-report.pdf |title=Biofuel Sustainability Performance Guidelines |accessdate=2015-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WBCSC's Vision 2020 report was highlighted by [[The Guardian]] as "the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-world-business-council |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development: Vision 2050 &amp;#124; Guardian Sustainable Business &amp;#124; The Guardian |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
