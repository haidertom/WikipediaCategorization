'''Accidental Adversaries''' is one of the ten [[system archetype]]s used in [[system dynamics]] modelling, or [[systems thinking]]. This archetype describes the degenerative pattern that develops when two subjects cooperating for a common goal, accidentally take actions that undermine each other's success. It is similar to the [[System archetype#Escalation|escalation system archetype]] in terms of pattern behaviour that develops over time.&lt;ref name="fieldbook"&gt;Senge, P. et al. (1994). The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook. New York: Doubleday Currency.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archetype description==

The archetype describes a pattern where two subjects have decided to work together because they will benefit from the alliance.&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;Braun B. (2002) [http://www.albany.edu/faculty/gpr/PAD724/724WebArticles/sys_archetypes.pdf The System Archetypes]&lt;/ref&gt; Each take actions believing that it will bring benefit to the other and if the cooperation works, they will both benefit from it. Problems start arising when one or both of the subjects need to fix a local gap in performance, maybe due to external pressure. They initiate action to fix the gap and accidentally undermine each other's success. The result of these activities may produce a sense of resentment or frustration between the subjects or it may even turn the subjects into adversaries (hence the archetype name), thereby destroying the alliance.

===History===

The original set of system archetypes were published in [[The Fifth Discipline]] by [[Peter Senge]].  The exact source of these generic structures is not known.  However "Accidental Adversaries"  has a clear origin.  It is derived from observations made by Jennifer Kemeny, a colleague of Senge's and a contributor to the original archetype descriptions. In her consulting work in the late 1980s she was intrigued at how often potential strategic alliances were unsuccessful, or devolved into outright hostility. Such a recurring phenomenon suggested a structural cause.  The essential elements of the archetype were first described during a session Kemeny facilitated.  It was the first meeting of the first ever alliance between Walmart and Procter and Gamble.  Employees diagrammed how their protective business policies caused unintentional damage to the other company – which responded with similarly defensive actions.  The net effect of these "back and forth" behaviors was lower profit and less goodwill –  which for a long period of time had overshadowed the possibility of mutual benefit between the organizations. An early description of "Accidental Adversaries" is in The Fifth Discipline: Fieldbook, by Senge, ''et al.''

===Description of the model===
Let's consider two parties A and B. They have realised that by uniting forces, they can increase their success, whatever that may be. At a certain point in time, say B, takes corrective actions in order to counteract a decrease in performance due to external pressure. Although B's actions are important for B, their impact on A are not understood or not considered. The result is that now A feels that he is being betrayed and reacts to diminish the negative effects of B's actions. Ironically, A's new actions now obstruct B's success. If this situation persists and the results worsen, the alliance breaks down. A [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle#Vicious circle|vicious circle]] is created and each partner has now even forgotten the original purpose of the alliance. A and B's actions now only focus on counteracting the hostile actions taken by the other. A and B thus 'accidentally' become adversaries.&lt;ref name="systemswiki"&gt;Accidental Adversaries Systems Archetype at SystemsWiki.org. {{cite web|url=http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title%3DAccidental_Adversaries_Systems_Archetype |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920154719/http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Accidental_Adversaries_Systems_Archetype |archivedate=2011-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causal Loop diagram==
The [[causal loop diagram]] in Figure 1 shows the pattern dynamics of the system.&lt;ref name="systemsthinking"&gt;Accidental Adversaries at Systems-Thinking.org. http://www.systems-thinking.org/theWay/saa/aa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Accidental Adversaries Causal Loop original.svg|thumb|center|350px|alt=Causal loop diagram|Figure 1. Causal loop diagram]]
The pattern of behaviour begins with the outer [[Positive feedback|reinforcing loop]] R1 where A and B have formed a synergistic alliance that benefits both. An action taken by A in favour of B increases B's success and vice versa. At some point in time, though, say B, initiates a series of corrective actions in order to adjust its performance. The actions taken increase performance, whose effects balance the number of corrective actions required. This results in the creation of a [[Negative feedback|balancing loop]], B2. These actions also unintentionally obstruct the other party's success, and result in the formation of the negative reinforcing loop R2 that undermines the [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle#Virtuous circle|virtuous]] reinforcing loop R1. Now each corrective action taken by B causes A to start taking corrective measures as well, thus activating its own balancing loop B1. The formation of R2 is the critical point at which the dynamics of the system go out of control, resembling the [[System archetype#Escalation|Escalation]] archetype.

==Stock and flow diagram==
Figure 2 shows the [[stock and flow|stock and flow diagram]] for this archetype.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Accidental Adversaries Stock and flow.svg|thumb|center|350px|alt=Stock&amp;Flow diagram|Figure 2. Stock and Flow diagram]]

==Alternative model==
An alternative form of the model is shown in Figure 3. The differences are in the two reinforcing loops R3 and R4. Here, A and B specifically take actions to improve their growth, not, as before, to adjust their performance to a pre-determined target. By seeking improvement through R3 and R4, A and B suppress the effects of R1 and establish the negative-effect reinforcing loop R2, that in turn, completely takes over B5 and B6. The two balancing loops B5 and B6 are formed by, respectively,&lt;br/&gt;
:''B's success-&gt;B's actions in A's favour-&gt;A's success-&gt;A's actions to improve A's success-&gt;A's unintended obstruction of B's success'' and
:''A's success-&gt;A's actions in B's favour-&gt;B's success-&gt;B's actions to improve B's success-&gt;B's unintended obstruction of A's success''.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Accidental Adversaries Causal Loop Alternative model.svg|thumb|350px|center|Figure 3. Alternative Causal Loop diagram]].

==Model behaviour==

The archetype behaviour over time is shown in Figure 4.[[File:Accidental Adversaries TimeBehaviour.png|thumb|center|400px|Figure 4. Behaviour over time]]&lt;br/&gt;Both parties show a similar trend in direction and rate of change of success, with one trailing behind the other one due to system delays. Even though the pattern shows stable periods, the overall trend follows a downward direction.&lt;ref name="Braun" /&gt; The above simulation can be run from [[InsightMaker]].&lt;ref name="Insight Maker"&gt;{{cite web | title=Clone of Accidental Adversaries | website=Insight Maker | url=http://insightmaker.com/insight/678 | access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible leverage points==

It is possible to achieve leverage by introducing or re-emphasising a link between each party's success,&lt;ref name="wolstenholme"&gt;Wolstenholme E. F. (2003)
[http://www.symmetricsd.co.uk/files/Towards_definition_of_a_core_set_of_archetypal_structures.pdf Towards the definition and use of a core set of archetypal structures in system dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt; thus re-establishing the outer virtuous reinforcing loop shown in Figure 3. Kemeny proposes a list of seven action steps to deal with the unintended consequences of each party's actions, given their [[mental model]]s:&lt;ref name="kemeny"&gt;Kemeny J (1994) "Accidental Adversaries": When Friends Become Foes, ''The Systems Thinker'', Vol. 5, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

* Reconstruct the conditions that were the catalyst for collaboration.
* Review the original understandings and expected mutual benefits.
* Identify conflicting incentives that may be driving adversarial behaviour.
* Map the unintended side effects of each party’s actions.
* Develop overarching goals that align the efforts of the parties.
* Establish metrics to monitor collaborative behaviour.
* Establish routine communication

==Example==

A classic example of the Accidental Adversaries system archetype is that of [[Procter &amp; Gamble|Procter and Gamble]] supplying [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]]. When Procter and Gamble's profits decline, they introduce promotions. This results in extra costs and decreasing profitability for Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's responds by stocking-up – buying large quantities of products during the discount period – and then selling them at regular prices when promotions end, thereby increasing its margins. Procter and Gamble's production now faces great swings in volume because Wal-Mart does not need to order products for months, which adds to P and G's costs. To improve their situation, Procter and Gamble pushes even more on promotions, blaming at the same time Wal-Mart for their problems. Wal-Mart reacts by stocking-up even more. Eventually, Procter and Gamble finds itself putting a lot of effort into promotions, at the expense of new product development, while Wal-Mart concentrates solely on buying and storing promoted products rather than improving their operations. The situation is described by the causal loop diagram in Figure 5.
In the Procter and Gamble/Wal-Mart case, leverage was achieved by bringing both parties together to understand the structure they had unintentionally created, even though each party 's action was completely rational and understandable from their local perspective.&lt;ref name="kemeny" /&gt;

{{classic element}}

'''Akasha''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|ākāśa}}'' {{lang|sa|आकाश}}) is a term for either [[space]] or [[Aether (classical element)|æther]] in traditional Indian cosmology, depending on the religion. The term has also been adopted in Western [[Occult|occultism]] and spiritualism in the late 19th century. In [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] it means "sky". In many modern [[Indo-Aryan languages]] and [[Dravidian languages]] the corresponding word (often rendered ''Akash'') retains a generic meaning of "sky".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of World Philosophy'' by A. Pablo Iannone, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;30. {{ISBN|0-415-17995-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian cosmology==
The word in [[Sanskrit]] is derived from a root ''kāś'' meaning "to be visible". It appears as a masculine noun in [[Vedic Sanskrit]] with a generic meaning of "open space, vacuity". In Classical Sanskrit, the noun acquires the neuter gender and may express the concept of "sky; atmosphere" ([[Manusmrti]], [[Shatapathabrahmana]]).
In [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] philosophy, the word acquires its technical meaning of "an ethereal fluid imagined as pervading the cosmos".

===Hinduism===
In [[Vedantic Hinduism]], Akasha means the basis and essence of all things in the material world; the first element created.  A Vedic mantra “pṛthivyāpastejovāyurākāśāt” indicates the sequence of initial appearance of the five basic gross elements. Thus, first appeared the space, from which appeared air, from that fire or energy, from which the water, and therefrom the earth. It is one of the ''[[Classical element#Classical elements in Hinduism|Panchamahabhuta]],'' or "five gross elements"; its main characteristic is ''[[Shabda]]'' (sound). The direct translation of Akasha is the word meaning "upper sky" or 'space' in Hinduism.

The [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools of Hindu philosophy state that Akasha or aether is the fifth physical substance, which is the substratum of the quality of sound.  It is the ''One'', ''Eternal'', and ''All Pervading'' physical substance, which is imperceptible.&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Metaphysics and Epistemology'' by Karl H. Potter, Usharbudh Arya, Motilal Banarsidass Publications, 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;71. {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Samkhya]] school, Akasha is one of the five [[Mahābhūta]]s (grand physical elements) having the specific property of sound.&lt;ref&gt;''Six Systems of Indian Philosophy; Samkhya and Yoga; Naya and Vaiseshika'' by F. Max Muller, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;40. {{ISBN|0-7661-4296-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of the heterodox [[Cārvāka]] or Lokāyata philosophy held that this world is made of four elements only. They exclude the fifth, Akasha, because its existence cannot be perceived.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tale of Carvaka'' by Manga Randreas, Mangalakshmi Ravindram, iUniverse, 2005, {{ISBN|0-595-34955-2}}, pg, 270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
{{Main|Ākāśa (Jainism)}}
Akasha is space in the [[Jainism|Jain]] conception of the cosmos. Akasha is one of the six ''dravyas'' (substances) and it  accommodates the other five, namely sentient beings or souls (''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jīva]]''), non-sentient substance or matter (''[[pudgala]]''), principle of motion (''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''), the principle of rest (''[[adharma]]'') and time (''[[kāla (time)|kāla]]'')

It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points.&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

It falls into the ''[[Ajiva]]'' category, divided into two parts:  ''Loakasa'' (the part occupied by the material world) and ''Aloakasa'' (the space beyond it which is absolutely void and empty). In ''Loakasa'' the universe forms only a part. Akasha is that which gives space and makes room for the existence of all extended substances.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Jainism'' by Narendra Singh, Anmol Publications PVT. LTD., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1623. {{ISBN|81-261-0691-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the summit of the ''lokākāśa'' is the ''[[Siddhashila]]'' (abode of the liberated souls).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] Akasha is divided into limited space (ākāsa-dhātu) and endless space (ajatākasā).&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Dictionary'' by Nyanatiloka, Buddhist Publication Society, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;24-35. {{ISBN|955-24-0019-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vaibhashika]], an early school of Buddhist philosophy, hold Akasha's existence to be real.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy'' By Oliver Leaman, Contributor Oliver Leaman, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-17281-0}}, pg. 476&lt;/ref&gt;

Ākāsa is identified as the first [[arūpajhāna|arūpa jhāna]], but usually translates as "infinite space."&lt;ref&gt;''The Ideas and Meditative Practices of Early Buddhism'' By Tilmann Vetter, Brill: Leiden, 1988.  pg. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern reception==
{{see|Akashic records}}
The Western mystic-religious philosophy called [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]] has popularized the word Akasha as an adjective, through the use of the term "Akashic records" or "Akashic library", referring to an etheric compendium of all knowledge and history.

[[Scott Cunningham]] (1995) uses the term Akasha to refer to "the spiritual force that Earth, Air, Fire, and Water descend from".&lt;ref&gt;''Earth, Air, Fire &amp; Water'', Scott Cunningham (Llewellyn, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ervin László]] in ''Science and the Akashic Field: An Integral Theory of Everything'' (2004), based on ideas by [[Rudolf Steiner]], posits "a field of information" as the substance of the cosmos, which he calls  "Akashic field" or "A-field".&lt;ref&gt;[http://integral-review.org/documents/Gidley,%20Evolution%20of%20Consciousness%20as%20Planetary%20Imperative%205,%202007.pdf Gidley, J.

'''Anti-art''' is a loosely used term applied to an array of concepts and attitudes that reject prior definitions of art and question art in general. Somewhat paradoxically, anti-art tends to conduct this questioning and rejection from the vantage point of art.&lt;ref&gt;David Graver. ''The aesthetics of disturbance: anti-art in avant-garde drama''. University of Michigan Press, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is associated with the [[Dada]] movement and is generally accepted as attributable to [[Marcel Duchamp]] pre-[[World War I]] around 1914, when he began to use [[found object]]s as art. It was used to describe revolutionary forms of art. The term was used later by the Conceptual artists of the 1960s to describe the work of those who claimed to have retired altogether from the practice of art, from the production of works which could be sold.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"&gt;{{cite book |last=...|first=contributors Rachel Barnes|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|page=505|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An expression of anti-art may or may not take traditional form or meet the criteria for being defined as a work of art according to conventional standards.&lt;ref name="Anti-Art_and_the_Concept_of_Art" &gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory".

"Poetry of the revolution: Marx, manifestos, and the avant-gardes". Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, works of anti-art may express an outright rejection of having conventionally defined criteria as a means of defining what art is, and what it is not. Anti-artworks may reject conventional artistic standards altogether,&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Atwood. "The Triumph of Anti-Art: Conceptual and Performance Art in the Formation of Post-Modernism". Afterimage, Sep 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; or focus criticism only on certain aspects of art, such as the art market and [[high culture#High art|high art]].

Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-artworks may also reject art based upon a consideration of art as being oppressive of a segment of the population.&lt;ref name="Art_Is_Like_Cancer"&gt;Interview of Roger Taylor by Stewart Home.

Anti-art artworks may articulate a disagreement with the generally supposed notion of there being a separation between art and life. Indeed, anti-art artworks may voice a question as to whether "art" really exists or not.&lt;ref&gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley-Blackwell, 2002. Page 244&lt;/ref&gt; "Anti-art" has been referred to as a "paradoxical neologism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aristos.org/whatart/lights.htm|title=The Lights Go On and Off - WHAT ART IS Online, February 2002|website=www.aristos.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that its obvious opposition to art has been observed concurring with staples of twentieth-century art or "modern art", in particular [[art movement]]s that have self-consciously sought to transgress traditions or institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Ernst Van Alphen, a Clark scholar from the Netherlands, suggested that Modernism itself can be characterized as anti-art in that since the earliest gestures of Dada and Futurism, art is seen as transformative and productive, breaking with institutions rather than destructive of images." Source: http://www.berkshirefinearts.com/?page=article&amp;article_id=128&amp;catID=3&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-art itself is not a distinct art movement, however. This would tend to be indicated by the time it spans—longer than that usually spanned by art movements. Some art movements though, are labeled "anti-art". The [[Dada]] movement is generally considered the first anti-art movement; the term anti-art itself is said to have been coined by Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]] around 1914, and his [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]]s have been cited as early examples of anti-art objects.&lt;ref&gt;This is one dictionary definition of anti-art: ''"A loosely used term that has been applied to works or attitudes that debunk traditional concepts of art. The term is said to have been coined by Marcel Duchamp in about 1914, and his ready-mades can be cited as early examples of the genre. Dada was the first anti-art movement, and subsequently the denunciation of art became commonplace—almost de rigueur—among the avant-garde."'' Note the emphasis on the fact that most art adopts the same principles attributed to the concept of "anti-art". Source: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O5-antiart.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor W. Adorno]] in ''Aesthetic Theory'' (1970) stated that "...even the abolition of art is respectful of art because it takes the truth claim of art seriously".&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Adorno. "Aesthetic Theory". 1970, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-art has become generally accepted by the artworld to be art, although some people still reject Duchamp's readymades as art, for instance the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists,&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/anti-art "Glossary: Anti-art"], [[Tate]].

Anti-art can take the form of art or not.&lt;ref name="Anti-Art_and_the_Concept_of_Art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; It is posited that anti-art need not even take the form of art, in order to embody its function as anti-art. This point is disputed. Some of the forms of anti-art which are art strive to reveal the conventional limits of art by expanding its properties.&lt;ref name="What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde1" &gt;Hal Foster. "What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde?". October, Vol. 70, "The Duchamp Effect", Autumn, 1994. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some instances of anti-art are suggestive of a reduction to what might seem to be fundamental elements or building blocks of art. Examples of this sort of phenomenon might include [[monochrome painting]]s, empty frames, [[list of silent musical compositions|silence as music]], [[aleatoricism|chance art]]. Anti-art is also often seen to make use of highly innovative materials and techniques, and well beyond—to include hitherto unheard of elements in visual art. These types of anti-art can be [[readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]], [[found object]] art, [[détournement]], [[combine painting]]s, [[appropriation (art)]], [[happening]]s, [[performance art]], and [[body art]].&lt;ref name="What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde1"/&gt;

Anti-art can involve the renouncement of making art entirely.&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; This can be accomplished through an art strike and this can also be accomplished through [[revolution]]ary [[activism]].&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; An aim of anti-art can be to undermine or understate individual creativity. This may be accomplished through the utilization of [[found art|readymades]].&lt;ref name="Theory of the Avant-Garde1"/&gt; Individual creativity can be further downplayed by the use of [[industrial process]]es in the making of art. ''Anti-artists'' may seek to undermine individual creativity by producing their artworks anonymously.&lt;ref name="Pop art1" &gt;Tilman Osterwold. "Pop art". Taschen, 2003, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; They may refuse to show their artworks. They may refuse public recognition.&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"/&gt; Anti-artists may choose to work collectively, in order to place less emphasis on individual identity and individual creativity. This can be seen in the instance of [[happening]]s. This is sometimes the case with "supertemporal" artworks, which are by design impermanent. Anti-artists will sometimes destroy their works of art.&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Towards an Acognitive Culture1" &gt;[[Henry Flynt]] interviewed by [[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/interviews/flynt.htm "Towards an Acognitive Culture".] New York 8 March 1989. Smile 11, London Summer 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Some artworks made by anti-artists are purposely created to be destroyed. This can be seen in [[auto-destructive art]].

[[André Malraux]] has developed a concept of anti-art quite different from that outlined above. For Malraux, anti-art began with the 'Salon' or 'Academic' art of the nineteenth century which rejected the basic ambition of art in favour of a semi-photographic illusionism (often prettified). Of Academic painting, Malraux writes, 'All true painters, all those for whom painting is a value, were nauseated by these pictures – "Portrait of a Great Surgeon Operating" and the like – because they saw in them not a form of painting, but the negation of painting'. For Malraux, anti-art is still very much with us, though in a different form. Its descendants are commercial cinema and television, and popular music and fiction. The 'Salon', Malraux writes, 'has been expelled from painting, but elsewhere it reigns supreme'.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure. André Malraux's Theory of Art''. Amsterdam, Rodopi, 2009. pp.275-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Anti-art is also a tendency in the theoretical understanding of art and [[fine art]].

The philosopher Roger Taylor puts forward that art is a bourgeois ideology that has its origins with capitalism in "Art, an Enemy of the People". Holding a strong anti-essentialist position he states also that art has not always existed and is not universal but peculiar to Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/pol/taylor.htm|title=philosopher Roger Taylor on why art is an enemy of the people|website=www.stewarthomesociety.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that is factually inaccurate as proven by many substantial archaeological findings on the Asian and African continents.

''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' by Larry Shiner is an art history book which fundamentally questions our understanding of art.
"The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old." (Shiner 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;3)
Shiner presents (fine) art as a social construction that has not always existed throughout human history and could also disappear in its turn.

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the separation between performer and spectator, life and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;North West Arts Association (Great Britain), Alexander Schouvaloff. "Place for the arts". Seel House Press, 1970, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] posited that art was a consequence of the [[social class|class system]] and therefore concluded that, in a [[communism|communist]] society, there would only be people who engage in the making of art and no "artists".&lt;ref&gt;Larry Shiner. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''. University of Chicago Press, 2003, pp. 234, 236, 245,&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sapeck-La Joconde fumant la pipe.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''Le rire'' (1887). First shown 1883 at an "Incohérents" exhibition by Arthur Sapeck (Eugène Bataille).|200px]]
Arguably the first movement that deliberately set itself in opposition to established art were the [[Incoherents]] in late 19th. century Paris. Founded by [[Jules Lévy]] in 1882, the Incoherents organized charitable art exhibitions intended to be satirical and humoristic, they presented "...drawings by people who can't draw..."&lt;ref&gt;"''...dessins exécutés par des gens qui ne savent pas dessiner...''"&lt;/ref&gt; and held masked balls with artistic themes, all in the greater tradition of [[Montmartre]] cabaret culture. While short lived – the last Incoherent show took place in 1896 – the movement was popular for its entertainment value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsincoherents.info/|title=Les arts Incohérents|language=French|accessdate=2009-05-06 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501185839/http://www.artsincoherents.info/ |archivedate= 1 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their commitment to satire, irreverence and ridicule they produced a number of works that show remarkable formal similarities to creations of the avant-garde of the 20th century: ready-mades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/things/readymade/index.html|title=Les Expositions des Arts Incohérents |work=Readymades (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; monochromes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/nothing/monochrome/Incoherents/index.html|title=Early monochrome painting: Les Incohérents. |work=Monochromes (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; empty frames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/nothing/space/frames/index.html|title=Mey-Sonier: Tableau d'à Venir, 1883|work=Empty frames (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and silence as music.&lt;ref&gt;Alphonse Allais: Marche Funèbre Composée pour les Funérailles d'un Grand Homme Sourd, 1884.

===Dada and constructivism===

Beginning in Switzerland, during [[World War I]], much of [[Dada]], and some aspects of the art movements it inspired, such as [[Neo-Dada]], [[Nouveau réalisme]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Tinguely]]: Art is revolution. National-Zeitung, Basle, 13 October 1967. "All machines are art. Even old, abandoned, rusty machines for sifting stones. (...) A beautiful oil refinery or your Johanniterbrücke, which are supposed to be solely functional, are important additions to modern art. So, art is also: the achievements of engineers and technicians, even if they express themselves unconsciously or purely functionally. Art is everything. (Do you think art ought to be made only by 'artists'?) And: art is everywhere – at my grandmother's – in the most incredible kitsch or under a rotten plank."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fluxus]], is considered anti-art.&lt;ref&gt;"Art is dead. Long live Dada."—[[Walter Serner]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Dada is like your hopes: nothing, like your paradise: nothing, like your idols: nothing; like your heroes: nothing, like your artists: nothing, like your religions: nothing' -[[Francis Picabia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dadaists rejected cultural and intellectual conformity in art and more broadly in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richter |first=Hans |year=1965 |title=Dada: Art and Anti-art |location= New York and Toronto |publisher= Oxford University Press |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For everything that art stood for, Dada was to represent the opposite.

Where art was concerned with traditional [[aesthetics]], Dada ignored aesthetics completely. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend. Through their rejection of traditional culture and aesthetics the Dadaists hoped to destroy traditional culture and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;"We had lost confidence in our culture. Everything had to be demolished. We would begin again after the "[[tabula rasa]]". At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense, public opinion, education, institutions, museums, good taste, in short, the whole prevailing order." — [[Marcel Janco]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were more politicized, the Berlin dadas were the most radically anti-art within Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Shiner. "[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]". University of Chicago Press, 2003, p. 254. "the Berlin [[dada]]s were more radical (compared to the other dadas), believing that the only way to reintegrate art and life was to place both at the service of the socialist revolution."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, in the Berlin group, [[The Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution|the Dadaist revolutionary central council]] outlined the Dadaist ideals of radical [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution|The Dadaist revolutionary central council]]. [http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/DadaSurrealism/DadaSurrReadings/DadaGrmny.pdf "What is Dadaism and what does it want in Germany?".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913093050/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/DadaSurrealism/DadaSurrReadings/DadaGrmny.pdf |date=2008-09-13 }} Tract, 1919. "Dadaism demands: 1) The international revolutionary union of all creative and intellectual men and women on the basis of radical Communism; (...) The immediate expropriation of property (socialization) and the communal feeding of all (...) Introduction of the simultaneist poem as a Communist state prayer."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1913 [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] challenged individual creativity and redefined art as a nominal rather than an intrinsic object.&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp quoted by Arturo Schwarz."The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp'. London, Thames and Hudson, 1969, p.33."For me there is something else in addition to yes, no or indifferent – that is, for instance – the absence of investigations of that type. ... I am against the word 'anti' because it's a bit like atheist, as compared to believer. And the atheist is just as much of a religious man as the believer is, and an anti-artist is just as much of an artist as the other artist. Anartist would be much better, if I could change it, instead of anti-artist. Anartist, meaning no artist at all. That would be my conception. I don't mind being an anartist ... What I have in mind is that art may be bad, good or indifferent, but, whatever adjective is used, we must call it art, and bad art is still art in the same way as a bad emotion is still an emotion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp quoted by [[Dalia Judovitz]]. "Unpacking Duchamp: Art in Transit". Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1995. "No, no the word 'anti' annoys me a little, because whether you are anti or for, it's two sides of the same thing. And I would like to be completely – I don't know what you say – nonexistent, instead of being for or against... The idea of the artist as a sort of superman is comparatively recent. This I was going against. In fact, since I've stopped my artistic activity, I feel that I'm against this attitude of reverence the world has. Art, etymologically speaking, means to 'make.' Everybody is making, not only artists, and maybe in coming centuries there will be a making without the noticing"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tristan Tzara]] indicated: "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none."&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"&gt;{{fr icon}} Jacques-Yves Conrad, [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm ''Promenade surréaliste sur la colline de Montmartre''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915053946/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm |date=2008-09-15 }}, at the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle]] [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ Center for the Study of Surrealism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327041319/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ |date=2008-03-27 }}; retrieved April 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Tristan Tzara|Tzara]], who once stated that "[[logic]] is always false",&lt;ref name="ipuranus"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Pop, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf "Un urmuzian: Ionathan X.

Originating in [[Russia]] in 1919, [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]] rejected art in its entirety and as a specific activity creating a universal aesthetic&lt;ref&gt;Varvara Stepanova: Lecture on Constructivism, 22 December 1921. In: Peter Noever: Aleksandr M. Rodchenko - Varvara F. Stepanova. The Future Is Our Only Goal. Munich: Prestel, 1991, pp. 174-178. "From here, Constructivism proceeds to the negation of all art in its entirety, and calls into question the necessity of a specific activity of art as creator of a universal aesthetic."&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of practices directed towards social purposes, "useful" to everyday life, such as graphic design, advertising and photography. In 1921, exhibiting at the [[5x5=25|5x5=25 exhibition]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]] created monochromes and proclaimed the end of painting.&lt;ref&gt;"I reduced painting to its logical conclusion and exhibited three canvases: red, blue, and yellow. I affirmed: this is the end of painting." — [[Alexander Rodchenko]].&lt;/ref&gt; For artists of the Russian Revolution, Rodchenko's radical action was full of utopian possibility. It marked the end of art along with the end of bourgeois norms and practices. It cleared the way for the beginning of a new Russian life, a new mode of production, a new culture.&lt;ref&gt;Rodchenko, A. and V. Stepanova (1975) [1920] 'The Programme of the Productivist Group', in Benton and Benton (eds), pp. 91-2. "1. Down with art, long live technical science. 2. Religion is a lie. Art is a lie. 3. Destroy the last remaining attachment of human thought to art. ... 6. The collective art of today is constructive life."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrealism===
Beginning in the early 1920s, many [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. [[Surrealism]] as a political force developed unevenly around the world, in some places more emphasis being put on artistic practices, while in others political practises outweighed. In other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to overshadow both the arts and politics. Politically, [[Surrealism]] was ultra-leftist, [[communist]], or [[anarchist]]. The split from Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] as communist. In 1925, the [[Bureau of Surrealist Research]] declared their affinity for revolutionary politics.&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of January 27, 1925". [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1925Surrealism.html Modern History Sourcebook: A Surrealist Manifesto, 1925]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism.&lt;ref&gt;"Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcSurrealism1.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; Breton and his comrades supported [[Leon Trotsky]] and his [[International Left Opposition]] for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II.

Leader [[André Breton]] was explicit in his assertion that [[Surrealism]] was above all a revolutionary movement. [[André Breton|Breton]] believed the tenets of [[Surrealism]] could be applied in any circumstance of life, and is not merely restricted to the artistic realm.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Breton]]. "The [[Surrealist Manifesto|first manifesto]]". 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Breton|Breton]]'s followers, along with the [[Communist Party]], were working for the "liberation of man." However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the [[proletarian]] struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with [[André Breton|Breton]], notably [[Louis Aragon]], left his group to work more closely with the Communists. In 1929, [[André Breton|Breton]] asked Surrealists to assess their "degree of moral competence", and theoretical refinements included in the second ''[[Surrealist Manifesto|manifeste du surréalisme]]'' excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action&lt;ref name="pompidou"&gt;[http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm Surrealist Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918070327/http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm |date=September 18, 2012 }} from [[Centre Pompidou]]. Accessed March 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of World War II the surrealist group led by André Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote "It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself."&lt;ref name="anarchosurrealism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/history/1919-1950-the-politics-of-surrealism |title=1919–1950: The politics of Surrealism by Nick Heath |publisher=Libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letterism and the Situationist International===
{{Situationists |expanded=Concepts}}

Founded in the mid-1940s in France by [[Isidore Isou]], the [[Lettrism|Letterists]] utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of '[[détournement]]') in [[Situationist International|Situationist]] films. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience. The most radical of the [[Lettrism|Letterist]] films, Wolman's ''The Anticoncept'' and [[Guy Debord|Debord]]'s ''Howls for Sade'' abandoned images altogether.

In 1956, recalling the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Related to this, and arising out of it, is excoördism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1960, [[Isidore Isou]] created supertemporal art: a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions.

In Japan in the late 1950s, [[Group Kyushu]] was an edgy, experimental and rambunctious art group. They ripped and burned canvasses, stapled corrugated cardboard, nails, nuts, springs, metal drill shavings, and burlap to their works, assembled all kinds of unwieldy junk assemblages, and were best known for covering much of their work in tar. They also occasionally covered their work in urine and excrement. They tried to bring art closer to everyday life, by incorporating objects from daily life into their work, and also by exhibiting and performing their work outside on the street for everyone to see.

Other similar anti-art groups included [http://www.artfact.com/features/viewStyle.cfm?genreRef=K714FO8OVR Neo-Dada] (Neo-Dadaizumu Oganaizazu), [http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/g/gutai Gutai] ([[Gutai]] Bijutsu Kyokai), and Hi-Red-Center. Influenced in various ways by [[L'Art Informel]], these groups and their members worked to foreground material in their work: rather than seeing the art work as representing some remote referent, the material itself and the artists' interaction with it became the main point. The freeing up of gesture was another legacy of L'Art Informel, and the members of Group Kyushu took to it with great verve, throwing, dripping, and breaking material, sometimes destroying the work in the process.

Beginning in the 1950s in France, the [[Letterist International]] and after the [[Situationist International]] developed a [[dialectic]]al viewpoint, seeing their task as ''superseding'' art, abolishing the notion of art as a separate, specialized activity and transforming it so it became part of the fabric of everyday life. From the Situationist's viewpoint, art is [[revolution]]ary or it is nothing. In this way, the Situationists saw their efforts as completing the work of both Dada and [[surrealism]] while abolishing both.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord. [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/debord/8.htm " The Society of the Spectacle"]. Thesis 187 and 191. 1967. Translation by [[Ken Knabb]] in 2002."The ''positive'' significance of the modern decomposition and destruction of all art is that the language of communication has been lost. The ''negative'' implication of this development is that a common language can no longer take the form of the unilateral conclusions that characterized the art of historical societies — ''belated'' portrayals of ''someone else's'' dialogueless life which accepted this lack as inevitable — but must now be found in a praxis that unifies direct activity with its own appropriate language.
The point is to actually participate in the community of dialogue and the game with time that up till now have merely been ''represented'' by poetic and artistic works." "Dadaism and surrealism were the two currents that marked the end of modern art. Though they were only partially conscious of it, they were contemporaries of the last great offensive of the revolutionary proletarian movement, and the defeat of that movement, which left them trapped within the very artistic sphere whose decrepitude they had denounced, was the fundamental reason for their immobilization. Dadaism and surrealism were historically linked yet also opposed to each other. This opposition involved the most important and radical contributions of the two movements, but it also revealed the internal inadequacy of their one-sided critiques. Dadaism sought to ''abolish art without realizing it''; surrealism sought to ''realize art without abolishing it''. The critical position since developed by the ''situationists'' has shown that the abolition and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single ''transcendence of art''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Internationale Situationist (no. 1, Paris, June 1958) "Art need no longer be an account of past sensations. It can become the direct organization of more highly evolved sensations. It is a question of producing ourselves, not things that enslave us."&lt;/ref&gt;
The situationists renounced the making of art entirely.&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;

The members of the [[Situationist International]] liked to think they were probably the most radical,&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Kaufman. "The Columbia history of twentieth-century French thought". Editor: Lawrence D. Kritzman, Columbia University Press, 2007, p. 104. "In the view of some (including the principal protagonists of the movement themselves), Situationism was the century's finest and most radical form of subversion. It is claimed to have been at the heart of the events of May 1968, whose spirit it embodied, with its radical critique of all forms of alienation imposed by capitalist society (renamed the "society of spectacle" by the Situationists)".&lt;/ref&gt; politicized,&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; well organized, and theoretically productive anti-art movement, reaching their apex with the student protests and [[general strike]] of [[May 1968 in France]], a view endorsed by others including the academic [[Martin Puchner]].&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;

In 1959 [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]] proposed [[Industrial Painting]] as an "industrial-inflationist art"&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]]. [http://www.notbored.org/gallizio.html Manifesto of Industrial Painting: For a unitary applied art]. ''[[Notizie Arti Figurative]]'' No. 9 (1959). In French: ''[[Situationist International|Internationale Situationniste]]'' no.3 (1959). In English: [[Molly Klein]] translated the [[original]] Italian version into English (1997). "The machine may very well be the appropriate instrument for the creation of an industrial-inflationist art, based on the Anti-Patent; the new industrial culture will be strictly "Made Amongst People" or not at all! The time of the Scribes is over."(...) "When thousands of painters who today labor at the non-sense of detail will have the possibilities which machines offer, there will be no more giant stamps, called paintings to satisfy the investment of value, but thousands of kilometers of fabric offered in the streets, in markets, for barter, allowing millions of people to enjoy them and exciting the experience of arrangement."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Dada and later===
{{Main|Neo-Dada}}
Similar to Dada, in the 1960s, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to blur the distinction between life and art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolf Vostell]], 1972 (Postcard). "[[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]] has qualified the object into art. I have qualified life into art."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Vautier]]. [http://radicalart.info/concept/ArtAgainstArt/Ben/index.html "Pas d'Art" (No art).] 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 [[Henry Flynt]] began to campaign for an anti-art position.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Oren (1993) Anti-Art as the End of Cultural History, [[Performing Arts Journal]], volume 15, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Flynt wanted [[avant-garde]] [[art]] to become superseded by the terms of ''veramusement'' and ''brend'' – [[neologism]]s meaning approximately pure [[recreation]].

In 1963 [[George Maciunas]] advocated revolution, "living art, anti-art" and "non art reality to be grasped by all peoples".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Maciunas]]. [http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/gmaciunas-manifesto.html Fluxus Manifesto], 1963. "Purge the world of bourgeois sickness, "intellectual", professional and commercialized culture, purge the world of dead art, imitation, artificial art, abstract art, illusionistic art, mathematical art, – purge the world of "Europanism"! [...] PROMOTE A REVOLUTIONARY FLOOD AND TIDE IN ART, [...] promote NON ART REALITY to be grasped by all peoples, not only critics, dilettantes and professionals ... FUSE the cadres of cultural, social &amp; political revolutionaries into united front &amp; action."&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Maciunas|Maciunas]] strived to uphold his stated aims of demonstrating the artist's 'non-professional status...his dispensability and inclusiveness' and that 'anything can be art and anyone can do it.'&lt;ref&gt;A 1965 Inventory list by Maciunas, quoted in Mr Fluxus, p88&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the Dada-influenced [[art group]] [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] declared that revolutionary art should be "an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth".&lt;ref name="Ben Morea: art and anarchism"&gt;Hinderer, Eve. [http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html Ben Morea: art and anarchism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425191200/http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html |date=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Mask disrupted cultural events in New York by giving made up flyers of art events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"&gt;[[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/sp/assault.htm "The Assault on Culture: Utopian currents from Lettrisme to Class War"]. Introduction to the Lithuanian edition. (Ist edition Aporia Press and Unpopular Books, London 1988.) {{ISBN|0-948518-88-X}}. "In the sixties Black Mask disrupted reified cultural events in New York by making up flyers giving the dates, times and location of art events and giving these out to the homeless with the lure of the free drink that was on offer to the bourgeoisie rather than the lumpen proletariat; I reused the ruse just as effectively in London in the 1990s to disrupt literary events."&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers|Motherfuckers]] were to grow out of a combination of Black Mask and another group called Angry Arts.

The BBC aired an interview with Duchamp conducted by Joan Bakewell in 1966 which expressed some of Duchamps more explicit Anti-Art ideas.
Duchamp compared art with religion, whereby he stated that he wished to do away with art the same way many have done away with religion. Duchamp goes on to explain to the interviewer that "the word art etymologically means to do", that art means activity of any kind, and that it is our society that creates "purely artificial" distinctions of being an artist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hn5f4u3PUVoC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=bbc+1966+interview+duchamp+joan+bakewell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H3EwaV7Wt5&amp;sig=btLMQ2GJA3YOwZIPQNU-Oe0KFRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9bjcUJiqJaKN0wXCk4DAAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marcel Duchamp: Artist of the Century] edited by Rudolf E.

During the 1970s, [[King Mob]] was responsible for various attacks on art galleries. According to the philosopher Roger Taylor the concept of art is not universal but is an invention of bourgeois ideology helping to promote this social order. He compares it to a cancer that colonises other forms of life so that it becomes difficult to distinguish one from the other.&lt;ref name=Art_Is_Like_Cancer/&gt;

[[Stewart Home]] called for an Art Strike between 1990 and 1993. Unlike earlier art-strike proposals such as that of [[Gustav Metzger]] in the 1970s, it was not intended as an opportunity for artists to seize control of the means of distributing their own work, but rather as an exercise in propaganda and psychic warfare aimed at smashing the entire art world rather than just the gallery system. As [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] had done in the 1960s, [[Stewart Home]] disrupted cultural events in London in the 1990s by giving made up flyers of literary events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"/&gt;

The [[K Foundation]] was an art foundation that published a series of [[Situationist International|Situationist]]-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world. Most notoriously, when their plans to use [[banknotes]] as part of a work of art fell through, they burnt a million [[pound sterling|pounds]] in cash.

[[Punk visual art|Punk]] has developed anti-art positions. Some "industrial music" bands describe their work as a form of "cultural terrorism" or as a form of "anti-art". The term is also used to describe other intentionally provocative art forms, such as [[nonsense verse]].

==As art==

Paradoxically, most forms of anti-art have gradually been completely accepted by the art establishment as normal and conventional forms of art.&lt;ref&gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 246. "the readymade has been appropriated as a theoretical paradigm in much contemporary art-school theory."&lt;/ref&gt; Even the movements which rejected art with the most virulence are now collected by the most prestigious cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gallix. [http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20090416120529166 "The resurrection of Guy Debord".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704124307/http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20090416120529166 |date=2009-07-04 }} ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 March 2009. "Guy-Ernest Debord would be spinning in his grave – had he not been cremated following his suicide in 1994. The arch-rebel who prided himself on fully deserving society's "universal hatred" has now officially been recognised as a "national treasure" in his homeland. The French government has duly stepped in to prevent Yale University from acquiring his personal archives (...) It's difficult to convey how bizarre it is to hear Christine Albanel – Sarkozy's minister of culture – describing the revolutionary Debord as 'one of the last great French intellectuals' of the second half of the 20th century."&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp's readymades are still regarded as anti-art by the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]],&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; who also say that anti-art has become conformist, and describe themselves as [[anti-anti-art]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuck on the Turner Prize"/&gt;

'''Ārjava''' (Sanskrit: आर्जव) literally means sincerity, straightness and non-hypocrisy.&lt;ref name=jsinha&gt;J Sinha, {{Google books|VCwmmWXJBqEC|Indian Psychology|page=142}}, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidas, {{oclc|1211693}}, page 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+arjava&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Arjava] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the ten [[Yamas]] in ancient Hindu and Jaina texts.&lt;ref name="KN Aiyar 1914 pages 173-176"&gt;KN Aiyar (1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1164026419}}, Chapter 22, pages 173-176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
''Ārjava'' means straightness, sincerity and harmony in one’s thought, words and actions towards oneself and towards others.&lt;ref name=jsinha/&gt; [[Pandurang Vaman Kane|Kane]] translates ''arjava'' as straightforwardness.&lt;ref&gt;PV Kane (1974), History of Dharmaśāstra: (ancient and Mediæval Religious and Civil Law in India), Vol 2, Issue 1, {{oclc|134943}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is explained in ancient Indian texts as “self-restraint from hypocrisy", and "the absence of hypocrisy”. It is included as one of several ethical virtuous restraints in an individual's path to spirituality. The Maharashtrian poet Vāmana in Avigita, at xvi.1, posits ''arjava'' is a form of honesty and purity in a person, and an essential virtue so that one may treat everyone equally, whether that other is one’s child, wife, relative, friend, a stranger, someone hostile or oneself without any discrimination.&lt;ref name=jsinha/&gt;

The ethical concept of ''Arjava'' is synonymously referred to as ''Adambha'' (अदम्भ, composite word from अ+दम्भ). Adambha also means&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=adambha+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Adambha] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; non-deceitful, straightforwardness and sincerity. It is listed as a virtue in the Indian Epics.&lt;ref name=ianp/&gt;

==Literature==
Arjava is one of the ten yamas listed by [[Shandilya Upanishad|Śāṇḍilya Upanishad]],&lt;ref name="KN Aiyar 1914 pages 173-176"/&gt; as well as by Svātmārāma.&lt;ref name=svatmaram&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hatha Yoga Pradipika|author=Svātmārāma|author2=Pancham Sinh |publisher = Forgotten Books|edition= 5|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sBFttVx6ukC|ISBN= 9781605066370|page=14|quote=&lt;br&gt;Quote - अथ यम-नियमाः&lt;br&gt; अहिंसा सत्यमस्तेयं बरह्यछर्यम कश्हमा धृतिः &lt;br&gt; दयार्जवं मिताहारः शौछम छैव यमा दश}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorenzen|first1=David|title=The Kāpālikas and Kālāmukhas|date=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520018426|pages=186–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merging with Śiva: Hinduism's contemporary metaphysics |last= Subramuniya |publisher= Himalayan Academy Publications|year= 2003|location= |isbn= 9780945497998 |page=155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JupkNVxfwHgC |accessdate=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the virtuous restraints (yamas) taught in ancient Indian texts. The other nine [[yamas]] are [[Ahiṃsā]] (अहिंसा): Nonviolence, [[Satya]] (सत्य): truthfulness, [[Asteya]] (अस्तेय): not stealing, [[Brahmacharya]] (ब्रह्मचर्य): celibacy and not cheating on one’s spouse, [[Forgiveness#Hinduism|Kṣamā]] (क्षमा): forgiveness,&lt;ref name=ss&gt;Stuart Sovatsky (1998), Words from the Soul: Time East/West Spirituality and Psychotherapeutic Narrative, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0791439494}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhrti|Dhṛti]] (धृति): fortitude, [[Compassion#Hinduism|Dayā]] (दया): compassion,&lt;ref name=ss/&gt; [[Mitahara|Mitāhāra]] (मितहार): measured diet, and [[Shaucha|Śauca]] (शौच): purity, cleanliness.

In some texts, such as by [[Adi Sankara]], this virtue is called as ''bhavasamsuddhi'', and explained as purity of motive and freedom of mind from hypocrisy, both in one’s social conduct, as well as within oneself where one’s thoughts, words and actions resonate.&lt;ref name=jsinha/&gt; It is considered as a virtue that empowers one to act and live without anxiety, anger, prejudice, inner conflict or confusion. It is also discussed in [[Bhagwad Gita]] in verse 17.16.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple (2009), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, page 649&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahabharata, in Book 12 Chapter 60, lists ''Adambha'' (non-hypocrisy) as a virtue along with ''Akrodha'' (non-anger), ''Kshama'' (forgiveness) and others.&lt;ref name=ianp&gt;Ian Proudfoot, Ahiṃsā and a Mahābhārata Story, Faculty of Asian Studies, Australian National University, {{ISBN|978-0731501434}}, page 185&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, in Chapter 278, the Epic explains how and why hypocrisy arises, suggesting that it is a derivative of the sin of covetousness, greed and attachment to superficial possessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b100.htm Shanti Parva] The Mahabharata, Section CCLXXIII, KM Ganguli (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali's treatise on Yoga lists only five [[yamas]], which includes non-covetousness and non-possessiveness (''Asteya'' and ''Aparigraha'' respectively), but does not include ''Arjava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Woods | first =James Haughton (translator) | year =2003 | title = The yoga-system of Patañjali; or, The ancient Hindu doctrine of concentration of mind | url=https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft|publisher =Courier Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-43200-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral ethics in different fields ==

=== Behavioral ethics and education ===
In ethics teaching and research, ethics is arguably the "next big thing" because its �investigation agenda has generated many knowledge on why and how people choose and act when being confronted with ethical subject, which was unknown previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Teaching-Behavioral-Ethics-by-Robert-A.-Prentice.pdf|title = Teaching behavioral ethics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Robert|first = Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Ethics and Rational Actor Model ===
Philosophical views about morality has been supported traditionally by theoretical reasoning and introspection, with at best passing reference to actual human behavior. Models of human morality advanced by behavioral ethics based on the fact that morality is a new and still developing quality of the evolutionary dynamic that leads to our species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/BehavioralEthics.pdf|title = Behavioral Ethics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Herbert|first = Gintis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Ethics Meets Behavioral Law and Economics ===
Clarifying the difference between behavioral law and economics(BEL) and behavioral ethics(BE) is of importance. Compared to BLE, BE has reduced its ability of influencing broad legal academic circles. In addition, unlike BLE, BE was advanced as piece of the management literature, which is less related to legal scholarship than BLE is, and thus less likely to have impact on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Behavioral Ethics Meets Behavioral Law and Economics|ssrn = 2226711|date = 2013-10-03|location = Rochester, NY|first = Yuval|last = Feldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Ethics and Justice ===
Behavioral ethics researchers have found the relationship between employees' justice perceptions and also, ethical and unethical behavior. In the 1990s, organizational justice became one of the most studied organizational themes. The term organizational justice is created by Greenberg(1987) to involve employee's perception of organizational events, policies, and practices as being fair or not fair. Classic work on distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice has been built. This research has focused on theoretical advance and empirical testing about the formation of justice judgements as well as the result of these justice evaluation. Justice and injustice perception have been related to an extensive variety of employee attitudes and behaviors consisted of trust, satisfaction, turnover and plenty of opposite formal negative behaviors such as theft and unethical behaviors which are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nipc.ir/uploads/m099_12051.pdf|title = Behavioral Ethics in Organizations: A Review|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
There are experiments that can be linked to behavioral ethics. The [[Trolley problem]] and the [[Prisoner's dilemma]] both place individuals in decision-making situations that carry ethical questions. In each, an individual is asked to make a decision that affects another person. In the [[prisoner's dilemma]], the principles of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)]] and [[Cooperation]] come into play, but not all who participate behave in the same manner. In the [[Trolley problem]] an individual has to choose which group of people to save. Both of these experiments shed light on how people behave when confronted with ethical dilemmas.

== The impact of behavioral ethics ==
If firms are able to utilize the principles of behavioral psychology to alter consumer's behavior and thus increase sales and governments can change people's behavior and hence promote policy target using those same principles, then individuals and their employers can apply related principles of behavioral ethics to promote ethical behavior in the company and in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Behavioral Ethics: Can It Help Lawyers (and Others) Be Their Best Selves?|ssrn = 2424249|date = 2014-04-12|location = Rochester, NY|first = Robert A.|last = Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of Unethical behavior in Business ==
According to an article in the Chron.com, examples of unethical behavior in business an environment can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-unethical-behavior-workplace-10092.html|title=Examples of Unethical Behavior in the Workplace|last=|first=|date=January 31, 2018|work=Chron.com|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Deliberate Deception
# Violation of Conscience
# Failure to Honor Commitments
# Unlawful Conduct
# Disregard of Company Policy

These behaviors are mostly based on different rights that we all have in society and therefore have in work environments as well. Usually each company have its own set of policy but there are some common ones as well. 

== Examples of Ethical Behavior in Business Meetings ==
At most business conference, employees are required to report on the progress of their missions. It can lead to an ethical dilemma because they may report their performance better than it is due to external pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Examples of Ethical Behavior in Business Meetings|url = http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-ethical-behavior-business-meetings-21680.html|website = Small Business - Chron.com|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unethical behavior ==
Unethical behavior is an action that falls outside of what is thought morally appropriate for a person, a job or a company. Individuals can act unethically, as can businesses, professionals and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Examples of Unethical Behavior|url = http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-unethical-behavior.html|website = YourDictionary|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unethical behavior in business ===
Ethics can be defined as going beyond what is legal and doing right things, even no one is paying attention to. So unethical behavior in business is about actions that don't obey the acceptable criterion of business operations, failing to do right things in each condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unethical Behavior in Business: Definition &amp; Examples - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|url = http://study.com/academy/lesson/unethical-behavior-in-business-definition-examples.html|website = Study.com|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deconstruction (Dallas).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Deconstruction of a building.]]

In the context of physical [[construction]], '''deconstruction''' is the selective dismantlement of building components, specifically for [[re-use]], [[Repurposed building stone|repurposing]], [[recycling]], and [[waste management]]. It differs from [[demolition]] where a site is cleared of its building by the most expedient means. Deconstruction has also been defined as “construction in reverse”.  The process of dismantling structures is an ancient activity that has been revived by the growing field of [[sustainable]], [[green building|green method of building]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/15/japan-eco-demolition Taisei Corporation's Tecorep reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 85%]&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings, like everything, have a life-cycle. Deconstruction focuses on giving the materials within a building a new life once the building as a whole can no longer continue.

When buildings reach the end of their useful life, they are typically demolished and hauled to [[landfill]]s. [[Building implosion]]s or ‘wrecking-ball’ style [[demolition]]s are relatively inexpensive and offer a quick method of clearing sites for new structures.  On the other hand, these methods create substantial amounts of waste. Components within old buildings may still be valuable, sometimes more valuable than at the time the building was constructed.  Deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered “[[waste]]” and reclaiming it into useful building material.

== Contribution to sustainability ==
Deconstruction has strong ties to environmental [[sustainability]]. In addition to giving materials a new life cycle, deconstructing buildings helps to lower the need for virgin resources. This in turn leads to [[energy]] and [[Air pollution|emissions]] reductions from the [[refining]] and [[manufacture]] of new materials. As deconstruction is often done on a local level, many times on-site, energy and emissions are also saved in the [[transportation]] of materials. Deconstruction can potentially support communities by providing local jobs and renovated structures.  Deconstruction work typically employs 3-6 workers for every one employed in a comparable demolition job.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  In addition, [[solid waste]] from conventional demolition is diverted from landfills.  This is a major benefit because [[construction and demolition waste]] accounts for approximately 20% of the solid waste stream.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Mark, and Dennis Livingston. ''Building A Deconstruction Company: A Training Guide For Facilitators and Entrepreneurs.'' Washington, DC: Institute For Local Self-Reliance, 2001. A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of avoiding wood waste==
In Canada, the CO2 Neutral Alliance has created a website&lt;ref&gt;[http://dontwastewood.com CO2 Neutral Alliance Don’t Waste Wood website]&lt;/ref&gt; with resources for regulators and municipalities, developers and contractors, business owners and operators, and individuals and households. Benefits for municipalities include:&lt;ref name="dontwastewood"/&gt;
* Reducing disposal costs where waste collection, hauling or disposal is supported by the tax base
* Establishing additional revenue streams
* Making existing landfills last longer
* Reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by the decomposition of wood waste into methane from landfills
* Stimulating local economies with new industries and employment
Improving the local environment and overall sustainability of your community 
For every three square feet of deconstruction, enough lumber can be salvaged to build one square foot of new construction. At this rate, if deconstruction replaced residential demolition, the United States could generate enough recovered wood to construct 120,000 new affordable homes each year. The deconstruction of a typical {{convert|2,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} wood frame home can yield 6,000 board feet of reusable lumber.&lt;ref name="dontwastewood"&gt;[http://dontwastewood.com/regulators-and-municipalities.asp CO2 Neutral Alliance Don’t Waste Wood website]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Every year the United States buries about 33 million tons of wood-related construction and demolition debris in landfills. As anaerobic microorganisms decompose this wood, it will release about five million tons of carbon equivalent in the form of methane gas.&lt;ref name="dontwastewood" /&gt;

== Typical methods of deconstruction ==
Deconstruction is commonly separated into two categories; [[structural]] and non-structural.  Non-structural deconstruction, also known as “soft-stripping”, consists of reclaiming non-structural components, [[home appliances|appliances]], [[door]]s, [[window]]s, and finish materials.  The reuse of these types of materials is commonplace and considered to be a mature market in many locales.

Structural deconstruction involves dismantling the structural components of a building. Traditionally this had only been performed to reclaim expensive or rare materials such as used [[brick]], [[dimension stone]], and extinct [[wood]]. In antiquity, it was common to raze stone buildings and reuse the stone; it was also common to steal stones from a building that was not being totally demolished: this is the literal meaning of the word ''[[wikt:dilapidated|dilapidated]].'' Used brick and dimension limestone in particular have a long tradition of reuse due to their durability and color changes over time. Recently, the rise of environmental awareness and sustainable building has made a much wider range of materials worthy of structural deconstruction.  Low-end, commonplace materials such as dimensional [[lumber]] have become part of this newly emerging market.

The [[United States military]] has utilized structural deconstruction in many of its bases. The construction methods of [[barracks]], among other base structures, are usually relatively simple.  They typically contained large amounts of lumber and used minimal [[adhesives]] and finish-work.  In addition, the buildings are often identical, making the process of deconstructing multiple buildings much easier.  Many barracks were built during the era prior to [[World War II|WWII]], and have aged to the point where they now need to be torn down. Deconstruction was deemed very practical due to the abundance of labor the military has access to and the value of the materials themselves.

[[Natural disasters]], such as [[hurricanes]], [[floods]], [[tsunamis]], and [[earthquakes]] often leave a vast amount of usable building materials in their wake. Structures that remain standing are often deconstructed to provide materials for rebuilding the [[region]].

== Economic potential ==
Deconstruction’s economic viability varies from project to project. The amount of time and cost of labor are the main drawbacks. Harvesting materials from a structure can take weeks, whereas demolition may be completed in roughly a day. However, some of the costs, if not all, can be recovered. Reusing the materials in a new on-site structure, selling reclaimed materials, donating materials for [[income tax]] write-offs, and avoiding landfill “tipping fees” are all ways in which the cost of deconstruction can be made comparable to demolition.

Reclaiming the materials for a new on-site structure is the most economically and environmentally efficient option. Tipping fees and the costs of new materials are avoided; in addition, the transportation of the materials is non-existent. Selling the used materials or donating them to [[non-profit organization]]s are another effective way of gaining capital. Donations to NPO’s such as [[Habitat for Humanity]]’s ReStore are tax deductible.  Many times it is possible to claim the value to be half of what that particular material would cost new.  When donating rare or [[antique]] components it is sometimes possible to claim a higher value than a comparable, brand-new material.

Value can also be added to new structures that are built by implementing reused materials.  The [[United States Green Building Council]]'s program entitled [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] ('''LEED''') offers seven credits relating to reusing materials.  (This accounts for seven out of a maximum sixty-nine credits)  These include credits for building-shell reuse, material reuse, and diverting waste from landfills.  Building shell-reuse is particularly appropriate for shells made of [[dimension stone]].

Deconstruction is well suited to job training for the construction trades. Taking down a building is an excellent way for a worker to learn how to put a building up. This is vital for the economic recovery of inner-city communities. Unskilled and low-skilled workers can receive on-the-job training in use of basic carpentry tools and techniques, as well as learning teamwork, problem-solving, critical thinking and good work habits.&lt;ref&gt;Seldman, Neil, and Kivi Leroux. ''Deconstruction: Salvaging Yesterday's Buildings for Tomorrow's Sustainable Communities.'' Washington, DC: Institute for Local Self-Reliance, 2000. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[Image:DBNYDemolition108.jpg|thumb|right|Dismantling the [[Deutsche Bank Building]] in January 2008.]]

When choosing to deconstruct a building there are some important aspects that need to be taken into consideration. Developing a list of local contacts that are able to take used materials is an essential first step. These might include commercial architectural salvage businesses, reclamation yards, not-for-profit and social enterprise salvage warehouses, and dismantling contractors. Materials that cannot be salvaged may be recycled on-site or off-site, or taken to landfills. The next step involves identifying which, if any, are [[hazardous material]]s. [[Lead paint]] and [[asbestos]] are two substances in particular that need to be handled extremely cautiously and disposed of properly.

It is common practice, and common sense, to “soft-strip” the structure first; remove all appliances, windows, doors, and other finishing materials. These will account for a large percentage of the marketable components. After the non-structural deconstruction, structural is the next step. It is best to start at the [[roof]] and work down to the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]].

Building components that are dismantled will need to be stored in a secure, dry location. This will protect them from [[water damage]] and theft. Once separated from the structure, materials can also be cleaned and/or refinished to increase value. Building an inventory list of the materials at hand will help determine where each item will be sent.

== Designing for deconstruction (DfD) ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
{{Tone|date=August 2008}}

"The end of the building’s useful life generates a stream of used materials that can be reprocessed for new construction. The selection of materials for reuse or recycling should not start at the end of the building’s life cycle, it should start at the design stage. Architects and engineers should keep the whole life cycle of the building in mind and select construction materials based on their capacity to be reused or recycled after the building has served its purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Abdol Chini, University of Florida, M.E. Rinker Sr. School of Building Construction&lt;/ref&gt;

An upstream approach to deconstruction can be implemented into buildings during their design process.  This is a current trend in sustainable [[architecture]]. Often, simple construction methods combined with high-grade, durable materials work best for DfD structures. Separating layers of a building’s infrastructure and making them visible can significantly simplify its deconstruction. Making components within systems separable also assists in being able to dismantle materials quickly and efficiently.  This can be achieved by using mechanical fasteners such as bolts to connect parts.  Allowing physical access to the fasteners is another needed aspect of this design. Also, it is important to use standardized materials and assemble them in a consistent manner throughout the project.

Some conventional construction methods and materials are difficult or impossible to deconstruct and should be avoided when designing for deconstruction. The use of nails and adhesives significantly slows down the deconstruction process and has a tendency to ruin otherwise reusable materials. Avoid hazardous materials altogether as they are detrimental to the natural environment and are non-reusable. Using mixed material grades makes the process of identifying pieces for resale difficult.

Deconstruction is important for more than just the end of a building’s life-cycle. Buildings that have been designed with deconstruction in mind are often easier to maintain and adapt to new uses.  Saving the shell of a building or adapting interior spaces to meet new needs ensures that new structures have a small environmental impact.

An alternative worth considering is [[modular building]], like the [[Habitat 67]] project in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. This was a residential structure consisting of separate, functional apartments that could be put together in a variety of ways. As people moved in or out, the units could be reconfigured as desired.

'''Elizabeth F. Schwartz''' is an American attorney, author and advocate for the legal rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.

== Life and career == 
Schwartz served as co-counsel on the case challenging Florida's [[same-sex marriage]] ban brought by the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]] ([[National Center for Lesbian Rights|NCLR]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sageusa.org/newsevents/release.cfm?ID=109|title=SAGE – SAGE Welcomes Two New Members to its Board of Directors|first=|last=SAGEusa.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of six [[same-sex couple]]s seeking the [[Rights|right]] to marry ([[Same-sex marriage in Florida|Pareto v. Ruvin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/09/21/442148968/gay-parents-face-issues-with-birth-certificates-in-some-states|title=Gay Parents Face Issues With Birth Certificates in Some States|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/bay-area-prepares-to-issue-same-sex-marriage-licenses/2208997|title=Tampa Bay area prepares to issue same-sex marriage licenses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[lawsuit]] resulted in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] Circuit Judge Sarah Zabel's finding that [[Same-sex marriage in Florida|Florida's same-sex marriage ban]] deprived [[same-sex couple]]s [[due process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] under the law, and in the ordering of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] to issue marriage licenses to [[same-sex couple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Miami-Dade-Judge-Rules-in-Favor-of-Gay-Marriage-268659482.html|title=Miami-Dade Judge Strikes Down Gay Marriage Ban|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz has also filed suit in Florida for fair issuance of [[birth certificate]]s to same-sex married couples&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclrights.org/cases-and-policy/cases-and-advocacy/chin-v-armstrong/|title=Case: Chin v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="740">In algebra, an '''elliptic algebra''' is a certain [[regular algebra]] of a [[Gelfand–Kirillov dimension]] three ([[quantum polynomial ring]] in three variables) that corresponds to a cubic divisor in the projective space '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5631">In [[mathematics]], '''essential dimension''' is an invariant defined for certain [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[algebraic group]]s and [[quadratic form]]s. It was introduced by [[Joe P. Buhler|J. Buhler]] and [[Zinovy Reichstein|Z. Reichstein]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the essential dimension of a finite group|journal=Compositio Mathematica|year=1997|first=J.|last=Buhler|author2=Reichstein, Z. |volume=106|issue=2|pages=159–179|id= |url=|format=|doi=10.1023/A:1000144403695 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-04-15--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
and in its most generality defined by [[Alexander Merkurjev|A. Merkurjev]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Essential Dimension: a Functorial Point of View (after A. Merkurjev)|journal=Documenta Mathematica|year=2003|first=G.|last=Berhuy|author2=Favi, G. |volume=8|issue=|pages=279–330 (electronic)|id= |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically, essential dimension measures the complexity of algebraic structures via their [[field (mathematics)|field]]s of definition. For example, a [[quadratic form]] q : V → K over a field K, where V is a K-[[vector space]], is said to be defined over a subfield L of K if there exists a K-[[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of V such that q can be expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;q(\sum x_i e_i) = \sum a_{ij} x_ix_j&lt;/math&gt; with all coefficients a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; belonging to L. If K has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] different from 2, every quadratic form is [[quadratic form#Equivalence of Quadratic Forms|diagonalizable]]. Therefore, q has a field of definition generated by n elements. Technically, one always works over a (fixed) base field k and the fields K and L in consideration are supposed to contain k. The essential dimension of q is then defined as the least [[transcendence degree]] over k of a subfield L of K over which q is defined.

==Formal definition==
Fix an arbitrary field k and let ''Fields/k'' denote the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of finitely generated [[field extension]]s of k with inclusions as [[morphism]]s. Consider a (covariant) [[functor]] F : Fields/k → [[category of sets|Set]].
For a field extension K/k and an element ''a'' of F(K/k) a ''field of definition of a'' is an [[intermediate field]] K/L/k such that ''a'' is contained in the image of the map F(L/k) → F(K/k) induced by the inclusion of L in K.

The ''essential dimension of a'', denoted by ''ed(a)'', is the least transcendence degree (over k) of a field of definition for ''a''. The '''essential dimension of the functor F''', denoted by ''ed(F)'', is the supremum of ''ed(a)'' taken over all elements ''a'' of F(K/k) and objects K/k of Fields/k.

==Examples==
* Essential dimension of [[quadratic form]]s: For a natural number ''n'' consider the functor Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; : Fields/k → Set taking a field extension K/k to the set of [[isomorphism class]]es of non-degenerate n-dimensional quadratic forms over K and taking a morphism L/k → K/k (given by the inclusion of L in K) to the map sending the isomorphism class of a quadratic form q : V → L to the isomorphism class of the quadratic form &lt;math&gt; q_K : V\otimes_L K \to K &lt;/math&gt;.
* Essential dimension of [[algebraic group]]s: For an algebraic group G over k denote by H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(-,G) : Fields/k → Set the functor taking a field extension K/k to the set of isomorphism classes of G-[[torsor]]s over K (in the [[flat topology|fppf]]-topology). The essential dimension of this functor is called the ''essential dimension of the algebraic group G'', denoted by ed(G).
* Essential dimension of a [[fibered category]]: Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a category fibered over the category &lt;math&gt;Aff/k &lt;/math&gt; of affine k-schemes, given by a functor &lt;math&gt; p : \mathcal{F} \to Aff/k. &lt;/math&gt; For example, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F} &lt;/math&gt; may be the [[Moduli of algebraic curves|moduli stack]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M}_g &lt;/math&gt; of genus g curves or the classifying stack &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{BG}&lt;/math&gt; of an algebraic group. Assume that for each &lt;math&gt; A \in Aff/k &lt;/math&gt; the isomorphism classes of objects in the fiber p&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(A) form a set. Then we get a functor F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; : Fields/k → Set taking a field extension K/k to the set of isomorphism classes in the fiber &lt;math&gt;p^{-1}(Spec(K))&lt;/math&gt;. The essential dimension of the fibered category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the essential dimension of the corresponding functor F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. In case of the classifying stack &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{BG}&lt;/math&gt; of an algebraic group G the value coincides with the previously defined essential dimension of G.

==Known results==

* The essential dimension of a linear algebraic group G is always finite and bounded by the minimal dimension of a generically free [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]] minus the dimension of G.
* The essential dimension of a finite algebraic [[p-group]] over k equals the minimal dimension of a faithful representation, provided that the base field k contains a primitive p-th root of unity.
* The essential dimension of the symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (viewed as algebraic group over k) is known for n≤5 (for every base field k), for n=6 (for k of characteristic not 2) and for n=7 (in characteristic 0).
* Let T be an [[algebraic torus]] admitting a [[Galois field|Galois splitting field]] L/k of degree a power of a prime p. Then the essential dimension of T equals the least rank of the kernel of a homomorphism of Gal(L/k)-[[lattice (group)|lattice]]s P → X(T) with [[cokernel]] finite and of order prime to p, where P is a permutation lattice.

{{distinguish|Financial intelligence (business)}}
{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}
'''Financial intelligence''' ('''FININT''') is the gathering of information about the financial affairs of entities of interest, to understand their nature and capabilities, and predict their intentions.  Generally the term applies in the context of  law enforcement  and related activities.

One of the main purposes of financial intelligence is to identify [[financial transaction]]s that may involve [[tax evasion]], [[money laundering]] or some other criminal activity. FININT may also be involved in identifying financing of criminal and terrorist organisations.

Financial intelligence can be broken down into two main areas, collection and analysis.   Collection is normally done by a government agency, known as a financial intelligence organisation or Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).  The agency will collect raw transactional information and [[Suspicious activity report]]s (SAR) usually provided by banks and other entities as part of regulatory requirements.  Data may be shared with other countries through intergovernmental networks.  

Analysis, may consist of scrutinizing a large volume of transactional data using [[data mining]] or data-matching techniques to identify persons potentially engaged in a particular activity.  SARs can also be scrutinized and linked with other data to try and identify specific activity.

==Collection==
FININT involves scrutinizing a large volume of transactional data, usually provided by banks and other entities as part of regulatory requirements. Alternatively, [[data mining]] or data-matching techniques may be employed to identify persons potentially engaged in a particular activity.

Many industrialized countries have regulatory reporting requirements for its financial organisations. 

It may be possible for the FININT organization to obtain access to raw data at a financial organization. From a legal standpoint, this type of collection can be quite complex. For example, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] obtained access to the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT) data streams through the [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]], but this violated Belgian privacy law.  

Reporting requirements may not affect [[Informal value transfer system]]s (IVTS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fincen.gov/advis33.pdf |author=United States Department of the Treasury, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network |title=Informal Value Transfer Systems, FinCEN Advisory Issue 33 |date=March 2003 |id=FinCEN-2003-33 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121142607/http://www.fincen.gov/advis33.pdf |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of which may simply be customary in a culture, and of amounts that would not require reporting if in a conventional financial institution. IVTS also can be used for criminal purposes of avoiding oversight.

==Analysis==
Examples of financial intelligence analysis could include:
* Identifying high-[[risk]] housing tenants on the basis of past rental histories.
* Detecting tax payers trying to avoid their fiduciary obligations by moving wealth surreptitiously out of a tax-levying jurisdiction.
* Discovering [[tax haven|safe havens]] where criminals park the proceeds of [[crime]].
* Accounting for how a large sum of money handed to a targeted individual disappears
* Checking to see if a corrupt individual has had any sudden and unexplained windfalls.
* Detecting relationships between [[terrorist]] cells through remittances.

==Financial intelligence organizations==
According to the [[Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units]], financial intelligence organizations (FIUs) are national centres which collect information on suspicious or unusual financial activity from the financial industry and other entities or professions required to report transactions suspicious of being money laundering or terrorism financing. FIUs are normally not law enforcement agencies; their mission being to process and analyze the information received. If sufficient evidence of unlawful activity is found, the matter is passed to the public prosecution.&lt;ref name=Egmont&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an FIU?|url=http://www.egmontgroup.org/|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government organizations may simply receive and process raw financial reports, and forward them, as appropriate, to law enforcement or intelligence agencies, include the multinational Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, and national organizations, including:

* [[Argentina]] – [[Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera]] 
* [[Australia]] – [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre]] (AUSTRAC)
* [[Brazil]] – [[Council for Financial Activities Control|COAF]] Conselho de Controle de Atividade Financeira
* [[Canada]] – [[Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada]] (FINTRAC)
* [[France]] – [[Tracfin]]
* [[Germany]] – [[Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen]]
* [[India]] – [[Financial Intelligence Unit]] (FIU-IND)&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiuindia.gov.in/index.htm FIUindia.gov.in]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ireland]] – [[National Economic Crime Bureau|Garda Financial Intelligence Unit]] (GNECB FIU)
* [[United Kingdom]] – [[National Crime Agency]]
* [[United States]] – [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN)

== United States examples ==
The United States has different organizations focused on domestic and international financial activity.
The United States has several laws requiring the reporting to the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FinCEN]]. These include the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]] (RFPA) of 1978, the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] of 1970 (and other names of revisions), and the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999 (GLBA). Some reports also need to go to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].

For example, the reports
{| class="wikitable"
&lt;Caption&gt;Representative Reports required from US financial institutions&lt;/caption&gt;
|-
! Report and definition
! Authority
! Receiving Agency
|-
| '''Currency Transaction Report (CTR)'''. Cash transactions in excess of $10,000 during the same business day. The amount over $10,000 can be either from one transaction or a combination of cash transactions.
| Bank Secrecy Act
| Internal Revenue Service
|-
| '''Negotiable Instrument Log (NIL)'''.	Cash purchases of negotiable instruments (e.g., money orders, cashiers checks, travelers cheques) having a face value of $3,000, or more.
| Bank Secrecy Act
| Internal Revenue Service
|-
|'''Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)'''.	Any cash transaction where the customer seems to be trying to avoid BSA reporting requirements (e.g., CTR, NIL). A SAR must also be filed if the customer's actions indicate that s/he is laundering money or otherwise violating federal criminal law. The customer must not know that a SAR is being filed.
| Bank Secrecy Act
| Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
|}

Actions that can trigger an SAR being filed include:
:#Any kind of insider abuse of a financial institution, involving any amount;
:#Federal crimes against, or involving transactions conducted through, a financial institution that the financial institution detects and that involve at least $5,000 if  a suspect can be identified, or at least $25,000 regardless of whether a suspect can be identified;
:#Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect involve funds from illegal activities or are structured to attempt to hide those funds;
:#Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect are designed to evade any regulations promulgated under the Bankruptcy Secrecy Act; or
:#Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect have no business or apparent lawful purpose or are not the sort  in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage and for which the institution knows of no reasonable explanation after due investigation.  The language of the RFPA indicates that a SAR filed under this rule comes from an individual transaction, not a profile of activities that make the transaction stand out.

===International===
International financial activity comes primarily from the Department of the Treasury and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. See [[CIA activities in Russia and Europe#Belgium 2006|CIA access]] to the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT).

===US domestic FININT===
At the highest level, US domestic FININT, and also some international work, comes under the [[Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence]], heading the Office of Terrorism and Financial Analysis, including:
*[[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]]: tracks domestic transactions
*[[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]: focused on foreign assets in the US
*Office of Intelligence and Analysis

Information developed by these units, when related to domestic security and especially when state and local law enforcement, is disseminated by the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) in the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], under the [[Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis]]. This Office is not restricted to FININT, but handles collection, analysis and fusion of intelligence throughout the entire Department. It disseminates intelligence throughout the Department, to the other members of the [[United States Intelligence Community]], and to affected [[first responder]]s at the state and local level.

Depending on the specific Federal violation, law enforcement investigation may be under agencies including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[United States Secret Service]], or the [[Internal Revenue Service]].

==Terrorist financing scenarios==

===Gems as an untraceable currency and source of income for terrorists===
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] an allegation was made in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that [[tanzanite]] stones were being used as an untraceable currency and source of income for terrorists.  This has not since been firmly established.  See [[CIA Activities by Transnational Topic: Crime and Illicit Drug Trade#Conflict diamonds and militant financing|possible examples]].&lt;ref name=Farah2003&gt;{{cite web
| title = The Role of Conflict Diamonds and Failed States in the Terrorist Financial Structure
| author = Farah, Douglas
| publisher = The Watson Institute, Brown University
| date = 2003-10-24
| url = http://www.douglasfarah.com/articles/conflict-diamonds.shtml
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom common in Africa, uncut diamonds tend to be the de facto standard currency of the illicit small arms trade.  Diamonds may be easily counted with a uniform valuation per carat to people in places of the world where there are no automated teller machines.  An entire briefcase filled with uncut diamonds without the serial numbers found on refined precious metals can be used to make large illicit value transfers.  The practice coexists with human trafficking, narcotics, weapons dealing, terrorism, and the evasion of economic sanctions and embargoes.

However, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has since instituted new [[anti-money laundering]] regulations to control the gem trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=154465,00.html "New Requirement for the Precious Metal, Precious Stone, and Jewel Industries"], irs.gov.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213202653/https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0%2C%2Cid%3D154465%2C00.html |date=December 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Front-running the market in a terrorist attack===
Another intriguing possibility is that a terrorist might buy stocks which are likely to appreciate in the event of a terrorist attack, such as defense industry stocks, or sell short stocks which are likely to depreciate, such as airlines.  This possibility led to many investigations of the financial markets subsequent to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-0109190296sep19,0,3496437.story "Terrorist trade probe widens: Options buying rose in firms that attack affected", by Robert Manor and Melissa Allison, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'',  September 19, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Financial Intelligence Unit Network ==
The Financial Intelligence Unit Network (FIU.NET) is a decentralized computer network that provides an information exchange between the financial intelligence units of the European Union.&lt;ref name="Van Duynen"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georgios A. Antonopoulos |author2=Marc Groenhuijsen |author3=Jackie Harvey |author4=Tijs Kooijmans |author5=Almir Maljevic |author6=Klaus Von Lampe |title=Usual and Unusual Organising Criminals in Europe and Beyond: Profitable Crimes, from Underworld to Upper World: Liber Amicorum Petrus Van Duyne|year=2011|publisher=Maklu|location=Netherlands |isbn=978-90-466-0429-8 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M7oV39ilah0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIU.NET is a decentralized system with no central database where the information is collected. All the connected FIUs have their FIU.NET equipment within their own premises and manage their own information. Through FIU.NET the connected FIUs create bilateral or multilateral cases. Ma&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;tch (autonomous, anonymous, analysis) is a matching tool within FIU.NET. Ma&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;tch makes it possible for FIUs to match names in order to find relevant data that is possessed by other connected FIUs. As the data is anonymized, there is no breaching of privacy and data protection rules.

===Connected FIUs===
FIU.NET is funded by the European Commission and participating FIUs.&lt;ref name="DG HOME"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundings|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/projects/stories/fiu_net_en.htm|work=European Commission|publisher=European Commission - DG Home Affairs (HOME)|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the connected EU Member State FIUs are:&lt;ref name="FIU.NET website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parties involved|url=http://www.fiu.net/home/parties-involved|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

===Governing body===
FIU.NET is governed by a Board of Partners (BoP) formed by connected FIUs that have volunteered for a seat. The Board of Partners is chaired by an independent Director.&lt;ref name="House of Lords"&gt;{{cite book|title=Money laundering and the financing of terrorism: 19th report of session 2008-09, Vol. 2: Evidence|year=2009|publisher=UK- Parliament; House of Lords - The Stationery Office|location=United Kingdom|pages=254–255|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_DV2BA5jzksC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780108444692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project management===
Daily operation of the system is managed by the FIU.NET Bureau, a project bureau of the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice, which is housed in the [[Europol International]] Headquarters in [[The Hague]].

==Origin==
Flower Power originated in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], as a symbolic action of protest against the Vietnam War. In a November 1965 essay titled ''How to Make a March/Spectacle'', Ginsberg advocated that protesters should be provided with "masses of flowers" to hand out to policemen, press, politicians and spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Allen, "Demonstration or Spectacle as Example, As Communication, or How to Make a March/Spectacle", ''Berkeley Barb'', November 19, 1965, republished in ''The Portable Sixties Reader'', Ann Charles (Ed.), Penguin Classic, 2002, p.208-212 {{ISBN|978-0-14-200194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of props like flowers, toys, flags, candy and music were meant to turn anti-war rallies into a form of [[street theater]] thereby reducing the fear, anger and threat that is inherent within protests.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Shepard,[http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org/1/BenShepard/shepard2.html "Absurd Responses vs. Earnest Politics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703163847/http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org/1/BenShepard/shepard2.html |date=2008-07-03 }}, ''Journal of Aesthetics and Protest'', Volume 1, Issue 2, January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Ginsberg wanted to counter the "specter" of the [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle gang who supported the war, equated war protesters with communists and had threatened to violently disrupt planned anti-war demonstrations at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Lewis |last=Hyde | title=On the poetry of Allen Ginsberg | publisher=University of Michigan Press | date=January 1, 1985 | page=264 | ISBN=0-472-06353-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Allen | last=Ginsberg | title=Family Business: Selected Letters Between a Father and Son | chapter= |page=241 | publisher=Bloomsbury | date=September 7, 2002 | ISBN=1-58234-216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Barry | last=Miles | title=Hippie | page=50 | publisher=Sterling  | date=August 28, 2005 | ISBN=1-4027-2873-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Ginsberg's methods, the protest received positive attention and the use of "flower power" became an integral symbol in the counterculture movement.&lt;ref&gt;William Lawlor, ''Beat culture: lifestyles, icons, and impact'', ABC-CLIO (2005), p.126  {{ISBN|1-85109-400-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1966, the Flower Power method of [[guerilla theater]] had spread from California to other parts of the United States. The [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] in New York City staged numerous protests which included handing out balloons and flowers with their anti-war literature.&lt;ref name="Jezer"&gt;{{cite book | first=Marty | last=Jezer | title=Abbie Hoffman: American Rebel | publisher=Rutgers University Press | ISBN=978-0813520179 | page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Workshop in Nonviolence'' (WIN), a magazine published by New York activists, encouraged the use of Flower Power. In May 1967, [[Abbie Hoffman]] organized the Flower Brigade as an official contingent of a New York City parade honoring the soldiers in Vietnam. News coverage captured Flower Brigade participants, who carried flowers, flags and pink posters imprinted with LOVE, being attacked and beaten by bystanders.&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt; In response to the violence, Hoffman wrote in WIN magazine, "Plans are being made to mine the East River with daffodils. Dandelion chains are being wrapped around induction centers.... The cry of 'Flower Power' echoes through the land. We shall not wilt."&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt;

On the following Sunday in May 1967, WIN activists declared the [[Armed Forces Day]] as "Flower Power Day" and held a rally in [[Central Park]] to counter the traditional parade. Turnout was low and, according to Hoffman, the rally was ineffective because guerilla theater needed to be more confrontational.&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Freid, ''The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!: Pageantry and Patriotism in Cold-War America'', Oxford University Press, (1999), p. 141, {{ISBN|0-19-513417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1967, Hoffman and [[Jerry Rubin]] helped organize the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|March on the Pentagon]] using Flower Power concepts to create a theatrical spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Farrell, ''The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism'', Routledge, 1997, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; The idea included a call for marchers to attempt to levitate the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. When the marchers faced off against more than 2500 Army national guard troops forming a human barricade in front of the Pentagon, demonstrators held flowers and some placed flowers in the soldier's [[rifle barrel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carlito Rivera, "The 1967 March on the Pentagon and lessons for today" , ''Socialism and Liberation Magazine'', March 2007, retrieved 26-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographs of flower-wielding protesters at the Pentagon March became seminal images of the 1960s anti-war protests. [[The Ultimate Confrontation: The Flower and the Bayonet|An image]] by French photojournalist [[Marc Riboud]] that was printed throughout the world was of seventeen-year-old high school student [[Jan Rose Kasmir]] clasping a daisy and gazing at bayonet-wielding soldiers.

During the 1967 [[Summer of Love]], thousands of hippies gathered there, popularized by [[chart hit|hit]] songs such as "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]". A July 7, 1967, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story on "The Hippies: Philosophy of a Subculture" and an August [[CBS News]] television report on "The Hippie Temptation",&lt;ref&gt;Harry Reasoner, [http://www.sfsu.edu/~avitv/avcatalog/88444.htm "The Hippie Temptation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319070344/http://www.sfsu.edu/~avitv/avcatalog/88444.htm |date=2006-03-19 }}, ''CBS News'', August 22, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other major media interest, exposed the hippie subculture to national attention and popularized the Flower Power movement across the country and around the world.

The [[avant-garde]] art of [[Milton Glaser]], [[Heinz Edelmann]], and [[Peter Max]] became synonymous with the flower power generation. Edelman's illustration style was best known in his art designs for the Beatles' 1968 animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]''.

{{Jainism}}
{{God|by religion}}
In [[Jainism]], godliness is said to be the inherent quality of every [[jiva|soul]]. This quality, however, is subdued by the soul's association with karmic matter. All souls who have achieved the natural state of infinite bliss, infinite knowledge (''[[kevala jnana]]''), infinite power and infinite perception are regarded as '''God in Jainism'''. Jainism rejects the idea of a [[creator deity]] responsible for the manifestation, creation, or maintenance of this universe. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have [[Jainism and non-creationism|always existed]]. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws and perfect soul, an [[wikt:immaterial|immaterial entity]] cannot create or affect a material entity like the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jainworld.com/scriptures/niyamsara.asp ''The Perfect Law''] Jainworld.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
From the essential perspective, the soul of every living organism is perfect in every way, is independent of any actions of the organism, and is considered God or to have godliness. But the epithet of God is given to the soul in whom its properties manifest in accordance with its inherent nature. There are [[Jain philosophy#Infinity|countably infinite]] souls in the universe.

According to ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]'' (a major Jain text):&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=The Ratna Karanda Sravakachara | publisher=The Central Jaina Publishing House|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ratna_karanda_sravakachara.html?id=kLAlAQAAIAAJ | archive-url=https://archive.org/details/TheRatnaKarandaSravakachara | archive-date=2015 | date=1917 | author=Jain, Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:आप्तेनो च्छिनदोषेण सर्वज्ञेनागमेशिना।
:भवितव्यं नियोगेन नान्यथा ह्याप्तता भवेत्।।५।

:In the nature of things the true God should be free from the faults and weaknesses of the lower nature; [he should be] the knower of all things and the revealer of dharma; in no other way can divinity be constituted.

:क्षुत्पिपासाजराजरातक्ड जन्मान्तकभयस्मयाः।
:न रागद्वेषमोहाश्च यस्याप्तः स प्रकीर्त्यते ।।६।।
:He alone who is free from hunger, thirst, senility, disease, birth, death, fear, pride, attachment, aversion, infatuation, worry, conceit, hatred, uneasiness, sweat, sleep and surprise is called a God.

== Godliness ==
In Jainism, godliness is said to be the inherent quality of every soul (or every living organism) characterizing infinite bliss, infinite power, ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (pure infinite knowledge),{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=164}} infinite perception, and perfect manifestations of (countably) infinite other attributes. There are two possible views after this point. One is to look at the soul from the perspective of the soul itself. This entails explanations of the properties of the soul, its exact structure, composition and nature, the nature of various states that arise from it and their source attributes as is done in the deep and arcane texts of [[Samayasāra]], [[Niyamasara]] and [[Pravachanasara]]. Another view is to consider things apart from the soul and its relationships with the soul. According to this view, the qualities of a soul are subdued due to [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] of the soul. ''Karmas'' are the fundamental particles of nature in Jainism. One who achieves this state of soul through [[Ratnatraya|right belief, right knowledge and right conduct]] can be termed a god. This perfection of soul is called ''Kevalin''. A god thus becomes a liberated soul – liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, ''karmas'' and finally liberated of body as well. This is called ''nirvana'' or ''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]''.

Jainism does not teach the dependency on any [[God|supreme being]] for enlightenment. The Tirthankara is a guide and teacher who points the way to enlightenment, but the struggle for enlightenment is one's own. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.

Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation from all karmic bonding, one must practice the ethical principles not only in thought, but also in words (speech) and action. Such a practice through lifelong work towards oneself is regarded as observing the ''[[Mahavrata]]'' ("Great Vows").

Gods can be thus categorized into embodied gods also known as ''arihantas'' and non-embodied formless gods who are called ''Siddhas''. Jainism considers the ''devīs'' and ''devas'' to be souls who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. These souls are in heavens for a fixed lifespan and even they have to undergo reincarnation as humans to achieve ''moksha''.

Thus, there are infinite gods in Jainism, all equivalent, liberated, and infinite in the manifestation of all attributes. The Self and karmas are separate substances in Jainism, the former living and the latter non-living. The attainment of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and the one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods. Therefore, beings ([[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]) who've attained omniscience (''kevala jnana'') are worshipped as gods. The quality of godliness is one and the same in all of them. Jainism is sometimes regarded as a [[Transtheism|transtheistic]] religion,{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=182}} though it can be [[atheistic]] or [[polytheistic]] based on the way one defines "God".

== Five supreme beings ==
{{Main|Pañca-Parameṣṭhi}}
[[File:पंच परमेष्ठी.jpg|thumb|Stella depicting ''Pañca-Parameṣṭhi'' (five supreme beings) worthy of veneration as per Jainism]]
In Jainism, the ''Pañca-Parameṣṭhi'' (Sanskrit for "five supreme beings") are a fivefold hierarchy of religious authorities worthy of veneration. The five supreme beings are:
# ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]''
# ''[[Siddha#Jainism|Siddha]]''
# ''[[Acharya (Jainism)|Acharya]]'' (Head of the monastic order)
# ''[[Upajjhaya|Upadhyaya]]'' ("Preceptor of less advanced ascetics")
# ''Muni'' or ''[[Jain monasticism|Jain monks]]''

== Arihant ==
{{Main|Arihant (Jainism)}}
A human being who conquers all inner passions and possesses infinite right knowledge (''[[Kevala Jnana]]'') is revered as an ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' in [[Jainism]].{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=15}} They are also called ''Jinas'' (conquerors) or ''Kevalin'' (omniscient beings). An arihant is a soul who has destroyed all passions, is totally unattached and without any desire and hence is able to destroy the four ''[[Karma in Jainism#Ghatiya karmas|ghātiyā karmas]]'' and attain ''kevala jñāna'', or omniscience. Such a soul still has a body and four ''[[Karma in Jainism#Aghatiya karmas|aghātiyā karmas]]''. ''Arihantas'', at the end of their human life-span, destroy all remaining ''aghātiyā karmas'' and attain Siddhahood. There are two kinds of ''kevalin'' or  ''arihant'':{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}
* ''Sāmānya Kevalin''–Ordinary victors, who are concerned with their own salvation.
* ''Tirthankara Kevalin''–Twenty-four human spiritual guides (teaching gods), who show the true path to salvation.{{sfn|Rankin|2013|p=40}}

The word ''Tīrthaṅkara'' signifies the founder of a ''tirtha'' which means a fordable passage across a sea. The ''Tirthankara'' show the 'fordable path' across the sea of interminable births and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jain|first=Champat Rai|title=Jainism, Christianity and Science|publisher=The Indian Press, Allahabad|date=1930|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=emsrAAAAIAAJ|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/JainismChristianityAndScience|archive-date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jain philosophy]] divides the wheel of time in two halves, ''Utsarpiṇī'' or ascending time cycle and ''[[avasarpiṇī]]'', the descending time cycle. Exactly 24 ''Tirthankara'' are said to grace each half of the cosmic time cycle.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16-17}} '' ''[[Rishabhanatha]]'' was the first ''Tirthankara'' and [[Mahavira]] was the last ''Tirthankara'' of ''avasarpiṇī''.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16-17}}

[[Tirthankara]]'' can be called teaching gods who teach the [[Jain philosophy]]. However it would be a mistake to regard the ''tirthankara'' as gods analogous to the gods of the [[Hindu]] pantheon despite the superficial resemblances between Jain and Hindu ways of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Thrower (1980), p.93&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tirthankara'', being liberated, are beyond any kind of transactions with the rest of the universe. They are ''not'' the beings who exercise any sort of creative activity or who have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers.

''Tirthamkara-nama-karma'' is a special type of ''karma'', bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a ''tirthankara''.{{sfn|Jain|1917|p=48}}

== Siddhas ==
{{Main|Siddha}}
[[File:Siddha idol.jpg|thumb|left|Although the ''siddhas'' (the liberated beings) are formless and without a body, this is how the [[Jain temple]]s often depict them.]]
Ultimately all ''arihantas'' become ''siddhas'', or liberated souls, at the time of their [[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]]. A ''siddha'' is a soul who is permanently liberated from the [[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|transmigratory cycle of birth and death]]. Such a soul, having realized its true self, is free from all the ''Karmas'' and embodiment. They are formless and dwell in ''[[Siddhashila]]'' (the realm of the liberated beings) at the apex of the universe in infinite bliss, infinite perception, infinite knowledge and infinite energy.

The [[Acharanga Sutra]] 1.197 describes ''siddhas'' in this way:
{{quote|The liberated soul is not long nor small nor round nor triangular nor quadrangular nor circular; it is not black nor blue nor red nor green nor white; neither of good nor bad smell; not bitter nor pungent nor astringent nor sweet; neither rough nor soft; neither heavy nor light; neither cold nor hot; neither harsh nor smooth; it is without body, without resurrection, without contact (of matter), it is not feminine nor masculine nor neuter. The siddha perceives and knows all, yet is beyond comparison. Its essence is without form; there is no condition of the unconditioned. It is not sound, not colour, not smell, not taste, not touch or anything of that kind. Thus I say.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi (1884) Retrieved on : 25 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/cite&gt;}}

[[File:Siddha Shila.svg|400px|thumb|Siddhashila as per the [[Jain cosmology]]]]
Siddhahood is the ultimate goal of all souls. There are infinite souls who have become ''siddhas'' and infinite more who will attain this state of liberation.{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} According to Jainism, Godhood is not a monopoly of some omnipotent and powerful being(s). All souls, with right perception, knowledge and conduct can achieve self-realisation and attain this state. Once achieving this state of infinite bliss and having destroyed all desires, the soul is not concerned with worldly matters and does not interfere in the working of the universe, as any activity or desire to interfere will once again result in influx of karmas and thus loss of liberation.

Jains pray to these passionless Gods not for any favors or rewards but rather pray to the qualities of the God with the objective of destroying the ''karmas'' and achieving the Godhood. This is best understood by the term ''vandetadgunalabhdhaye'' – i.e. "we pray to the attributes of such Gods to acquire such attributes" {{Ref_label|F|f|none}}&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p.35 Gāthā 1.29&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Anne Vallely:
{{quote|Jainism is not a religion of coming down. In Jainism it is we who must go up. We only have to help ourselves. In Jainism we have to become God. That is the only thing.&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;Vallely, Anne (1980).  In: ''Guardians of the Transcendent: An Ethnology of a Jain Ascetic Community''. University of Toronto Press: Toronto .p.182&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Heavenly beings ==
{{main|Deva (Jainism)}}
[[File:Padmavati.JPG|thumb|Idol of [[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmāvatī]] devī, śāsanadevī of Lord [[Parshvanatha]] at Walkeshwar Temple. She is one of the most popular demi-goddess amongst the Jains. According to Digambar Terapanth, worship of such deities is considered as ''mithyātva'' or wrong belief. However, in the Bispanthi Digambar tradition and the Shwetambar tradition, Padmavati is a popular Jain goddess.]]
[[Jain cosmology]] offers an elaborate description of heavenly beings (''devas''), but these beings are neither viewed as creators nor as Gods; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Jainism describes existence of ''śāsanadevatās'' and ''śāsanadevīs'', the attendants of a ''Tirthankara'', who create the ''[[samavasarana]]'' or the divine preaching assembly of a ''Tirthankara''. Such heavenly beings are classified as:-
* ''Bhavanapatis'' – Deva dwelling in abodes
* ''Vyantaras'' – Intermediary devas
* ''Jyotiṣkas'' – Luminaries
* ''Vaimānikas'' – Astral devas

The souls on account of accumulation of meritorious ''karmas'' reincarnate in heavens as devas. Although their life span is quite long, after their merit ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' are exhausted, they once again have to reincarnate back into the realms of humans, animals or [[Naraka (Jainism)|hells]] depending on their karmas. As these devas themselves are not liberated, they have attachments and passions and hence not worthy of worship.

Ācārya [[Hemachandra]] decries the worship of such devas:
{{quote|These heavenly beings (devas above) tainted with attachment and passion; having women and weapons by their side, favour some and disfavour some; Such heavenly beings (devas) should not be worshipped by those who desire emancipation&lt;ref&gt;Gopani (1989), emended&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;}}
Worship of such devas is considered as ''[[mithyatva]]'' or wrong belief leading to bondage of karmas.

==Jain opposition to creationism==
{{main|Jainism and non-creationism}}
Jain scriptures reject God as the creator of the universe. Further, it asserts that no God is responsible or causal for actions in the life of any living organism. Ācārya Hemacandra in the 12th century put forth the Jain view of the universe in the ''[[Yogaśāstra]]'':&lt;ref&gt;http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002500819&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This universe is not created nor sustained by anyone;
It is self-sustaining, without any base or support}}

Besides scriptural authority, Jains also resorted to [[syllogism]] and [[deductive reasoning]] to refute the creationist theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedics]], [[samkhya]]s, [[mīmāṃsā]]s, [[Buddhists]] and other schools of thought were analyzed, debated and repudiated by various Jain Ācāryas. However, the most eloquent refutation of this view is provided by Ācārya [[Jinasena]] in [[Adipurana|Mahāpurāna]],&lt;ref&gt;''Afterword on Jinasena'', D. Lakey, ''[[The Philosophical Forum]]'', Volume 33 Issue 3 Page 343-344 - Fall 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Primal Myths: Creating the World'', Barbara Sproul, http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/isbn/0060675004/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PDF of the text - http://www.jaina.org/?page=jainbooks&lt;/ref&gt; which was quoted by [[Carl Sagan]] in his book ''[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/blog2/endovelico/CarlSagan-Cosmos.pdf on page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Some foolish men declare that creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected.
If God created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now?
How could God have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression.

If you declare that this raw material arose naturally you fall into another fallacy, for the whole universe might thus have been its own creator, and have arisen quite naturally.

If God created the world by an act of his own will, without any raw material, then it is just his will and nothing else — and who will believe this silly nonsense?

If he is ever perfect and complete, how could the will to create have arisen in him? If, on the other hand, he is not perfect, he could no more create the universe than a potter could.

If he is form-less, action-less and all-embracing, how could he have created the world? Such a soul, devoid of all modality, would have no desire to create anything.

If he is perfect, he does not strive for the three aims of man, so what advantage would he gain by creating the universe?

If you say that he created to no purpose because it was his nature to do so, then God is pointless. If he created in some kind of sport, it was the sport of a foolish child, leading to trouble.

If he created because of the karma of embodied beings (acquired in a previous creation), then he is not the Almighty Lord, but subordinate to something else.

If out of love for living beings and need of them he made the world, why did he not make creation wholly blissful free from misfortune?

If he were transcendent he would not create, for he would be free: Nor if involved in transmigration, for then he would not be almighty. Thus the doctrine that the world was created by God makes no sense at all.

And God commits great sin in slaying the children whom he himself created. If you say that he slays only to destroy evil beings, why did he create such beings in the first place?

Good men should combat the believer in divine creation, maddened by an evil doctrine. Know that the world is uncreated, as time itself is, without beginning or end, and is based on the principles, life and rest. Uncreated and indestructible, it endures under the compulsion of its own nature.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5140">'''Hierarchy of death''' is a phrase used by journalists, social scientists, and academics to describe disproportionate amounts of media attention paid to various incidents of death around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keating |first=Joshua |date=2013-04-22 |title=Is it wrong to care more about 4 deaths in Boston than 80 in Syria? |publisher=Ideas.foreignpolicy.com |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/22/is-it-wrong-to-care-more-about-4-deaths-in-boston-than-80-in-syria/ |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Definitions of the hierarchy of death vary, but several themes remain consistent in terms of media coverage: domestic deaths trump foreign deaths, deaths in the [[developed world]] trump deaths in the [[developing world]], deaths of whites trump deaths of darker skinned people, and deaths in ongoing conflicts garner relatively little media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenslade |first=Roy |date=2007-04-19 |title=A hierarchy of death |publisher=Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/19/thirtytwodieinamericanuniv |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karpf |first=Anne |date=2001-11-28 |title=Anne Karpf: The hierarchy of death |publisher=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/28/september11.usa |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldberg |first=Jeffrey |date=July 23, 2014 |title=Obsessing About Gaza, Ignoring Syria (And Most Everything Else) |publisher=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/obsessing-about-gaza-ignoring-syria-and-most-everything-else/374898/ |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=R.

==Commentary==
British media commentator [[Roy Greenslade]] has been credited with coining the term while writing on the newsworthiness of those who died during [[The Troubles]]. Greenslade continues to critique the phenomenon, including media reactions to the [[Boston Marathon bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 30, 2011 |title=Sian murder says a lot about media's values |publisher=London Evening Standard |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/sian-murder-says-a-lot-about-medias-values-6386595.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bostonbombings&gt;{{cite web |date=April 24, 2013 |title=The hierarchy of death: Boston's bombings shock us more than the silent drone war in Pakistan.

[[NPR]] discussed the disparity in media coverage between the [[2015 Beirut bombings]] and the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], which happened with a day of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/paris-beirut-media-coverage/416457/|title=Paris, Beirut, and the Language Used to Describe Terrorism|last=Ajaka|first=Nadine|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/11/17/456317759/is-there-a-hierarchy-of-the-importance-of-death-in-the-news-business|title=Is There A Hierarchy Of The Importance Of Death In The News Business?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish journalist [[Allan Massie]] has also written on the topic.&lt;ref name=bostonbombings /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Massie |first=Allan |authorlink=Allan Massie |date=16 April 2013 |title=Allan Massie: Keep Boston bombings in perspective |publisher=The Scotsman |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/allan-massie-keep-boston-bombings-in-perspective-1-2898057 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar phenomenon==

[[File:ISO 7010 E001 new.svg|thumb|right|100px|The ISO symbol for "Exit".]]
'''ISO 7010''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization]] [[technical standard]] for graphical [[symbol]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s on [[Warning sign|hazard and warning signs]], including those indicating [[emergency exit]]s and safety signs. It uses colours and principles set out in [[ISO 3864]] for these symbols, and is intended to provide "safety information that relies as little as possible on the use of words to achieve understanding."&lt;ref name="ISO 7010:2011"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:7010:ed-2:v1:en|title=ISO 7010:2011 — Graphical symbols — Safety colours and safety signs — Registered safety signs|last=|first=|date=|website=ISO Online Browsing Platform (OBP)|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] specified by the [[United Nations]] to standardise [[Dangerous goods|hazardous material]] classification and labelling.

{{as of|2018|July}}, the latest version is ISO 7010:2011. This is under review to be replaced with new standard ISO/DIS 7010, which also incorporates water safety signs and beach safety flags previously specified in ISO 20712.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/72424.html|title=ISO/DIS 7010 — Graphical symbols — Safety colours and safety signs — Registered safety signs|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iso.org|publisher=International Organization for Standization|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[space exploration]], '''in situ resource utilization''' ('''ISRU''') is defined as ''"the collection, processing, storing and use of materials encountered in the course of human or robotic space exploration that replace materials that would otherwise be brought from Earth."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sacksteder|first1=Kurt R.|last2=Sanders|first2=Gerald B.|title=In-situ resource utilization for lunar and mars exploration|journal=AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit|date=January 2007|volume=AIAA 2007-345|doi=10.2514/6.2007-345|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2007-345|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ISRU is the practice of leveraging resources found or manufactured on other [[astronomical object]]s (the Moon, Mars, asteroids, etc.) to fulfill or enhance the requirements and capabilities of a [[space mission]].

ISRU can provide materials for [[life support system|life support]], [[propellant]]s, [[construction material]]s, and energy to a spacecraft [[payload]]s or space exploration crews.
It is now very common for [[spacecraft]] and robotic planetary surface mission to harness the [[solar radiation]] found ''[[in situ]]'' in the form of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]]. The use of ISRU for material production has not yet been implemented in a space mission, though several field tests in the late 2000s demonstrated various lunar ISRU techniques in a relevant environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Integration of In-Situ Resource Utilization into lunar/Mars exploration through field analogs|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117710005788|journal = Advances in Space Research|date = 2011-01-04|pages = 20–29|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.asr.2010.08.020|first = Gerald B.|last = Sanders|first2 = William E.|last2 = Larson|bibcode = 2011AdSpR..47...20S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISRU has long been considered as a possible avenue for reducing the mass and cost of space exploration architectures, in that it may be a way to drastically reduce the amount of payload that must be launched from Earth in order to explore a given [[planetary body]].
According to [[NASA]], "in-situ resource utilisation will enable the affordable establishment of [[extraterrestrial exploration]] and operations by minimizing the materials carried from Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

=== Water ===
In the context of ISRU water is most often sought directly as fuel or as feedstock for fuel production. Applications include its use in life support either directly by drinking, for [[Space farming|growing food]], [[Electrolysis of water|producing oxygen]], or numerous other industrial processes. All of which require a ready supply of water in the environment and the equipment to extract it. Such [[extraterrestrial water]] has been discovered in a variety of forms throughout the solar system, and a number of potential water extraction technologies have been investigated. For water that is chemically bound to [[regolith]], solid ice, or some manner of permafrost, sufficient heating can recover the water. However this is not as easy as it appears because ice and permafrost can often be harder than plain rock, necessitating laborious mining operations. Where there is some level of atmosphere, such as on Mars, water can be extracted directly from the air using a simple process such as [[WAVAR]]. Another possible source of water is deep aquifers kept warm by Mars's latent geological heat, which can be tapped to provide both water and geothermal power.

=== Rocket propellant ===
Rocket propellant from [[water]] [[ice]] has also been proposed for the [[Moon]], mainly from [[lunar ice|ice that has been found at the poles]]. The likely difficulties include working at extremely low temperatures and extraction from the [[regolith]]. Most schemes [[Electrolysis of water|electrolyse the water]] and form [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and liquify and [[cryogenic]]ally store them. This requires large amounts of equipment and power to achieve. Alternatively it is possible to simply heat the water in a nuclear or solar [[thermal rocket]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neofuel.com/space98/ LSP water truck]. Neofuel.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to give very much more [[mass]] delivered to [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) in spite of the much lower [[specific impulse]], for a given amount of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neofuel.com/moonice1000/ steam rocket factor 1000]. Neofuel.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[monopropellant]] [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be made from water on [[Mars]] and the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/Chapter%206.pdf|title=Chapter 6: Viking and the Resources of Mars (from a history of NASA)|publisher=NASA|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-08-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aluminum]] as well as other metals have been proposed for use as rocket propellant made using lunar resources,&lt;ref name="Hepp" /&gt; and proposals include reacting the aluminum with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/24/nasa_alice_test/|title=New NASA rocket fuel 'could be made on Moon, Mars'|last=Page|first=Lewis|date=August 24, 2009|work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Mars, methane propellant can be manufactured via the [[Sabatier reaction|Sabatier]] process.

===Solar cell production===
It has long been suggested that [[solar cell]]s could be produced from the materials present in lunar soil. Silicon, aluminium, and glass, three of the primary materials required for solar cell production, are found in high concentrations in lunar soil and can be utilised to produce solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Materials refining on the Moon|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576506004085|journal = Acta Astronautica|date = 2007-05-01|pages = 906–915|volume = 60|issue = 10–11|doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.11.004|first = Geoffrey A.|last = Landis|bibcode = 2007AcAau..60..906L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the native vacuum on the lunar surface provides an excellent environment for direct vacuum deposition of thin-film materials for solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070018263.pdf|title = Process Demonstration For Lunar In Situ Resource Utilization—Molten Oxide Electrolysis|last = Curreri|first = Peter|date = 2006|journal = MSFC Independent Research and Development Project (No. 5–81), 2.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-09-27|last2 = Ethridge|first2 = E.C.|last3 = Hudson|first3 = S.B.|last4 = Miller|first4 = T.Y.|last5 = Grugel|first5 = R.N.|last6 = Sen|first6 = S.|last7 = Sadoway|first7 = Donald R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar arrays produced on the lunar surface can be used to support lunar surface operations as well as satellites off the lunar surface. Solar arrays produced on the lunar surface may prove more cost effective than solar arrays produced and shipped from Earth, but this trade depends heavily on the location of the particular application in question.

Another potential application of lunar-derived solar arrays is providing power to Earth. In its original form, known as the [[solar power satellite]], the proposal was intended as an alternate power source for [[Earth]]. Solar cells would be shipped to Earth orbit and assembled, the power being transmitted to Earth via microwave beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite much work on the cost of such a venture, the uncertainty lay in the cost and complexity of fabrication procedures on the lunar surface.

===Metals for construction or return to Earth===
[[Asteroid mining]] could also involve extraction of metals for construction material in space, which may be more cost-effective than bringing such material up out of [[Earth]]'s deep gravity well, or that of any other large body like the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].  Metallic asteroids contain huge amounts of [[siderophile element|siderophilic metals]], including [[precious metal]]s.

===Building materials===
The colonisation of planets or moons will require obtaining local building materials, such as [[regolith]]. For example, studies employing artificial Mars soil mixed with [[epoxy resin]] and [[tetraethoxysilane]], produce high enough values of strength, resistance, and flexibility parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Polymeric composites on the basis of Martian ground for building future mars stations |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |date=April 2016 |last=Mukbaniani |first=O.

==Locations==

===Mars===
{{See also|Mars Direct}}
ISRU research for Mars is focused primarily on providing [[rocket propellant]] for a return trip to Earth&amp;nbsp;— either for a manned or a sample return mission&amp;nbsp;— or for use as fuel on Mars. Many of the proposed techniques utilise the well-characterised [[atmosphere of Mars]] as feedstock.  Since this can be easily simulated on Earth, these proposals are relatively simple to implement, though it is by no means certain that NASA or the ESA will favour this approach over a more conventional direct mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars Sample Return|url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Aurora/SEM1PM808BE_0.html|publisher=www.esa.int|accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical proposal for ISRU is the use of a [[Sabatier reaction]], {{nowrap|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}, in order to produce methane on the Martian surface, to be used as a propellant.  Oxygen is liberated from the water by [[Electrolysis of water|electrolysis]], and the hydrogen recycled back into the Sabatier reaction.  The usefulness of this reaction is that—{{asof|2008|lc=on}}, when the availability of water on Mars was less scientifically demonstrated—only the hydrogen (which is light) was thought to need to be brought from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sizing of a Combined Sabatier Reaction and Water Electrolysis Plant for Use in In Situ Resource Utilization on Mars|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/jur/200109/papers/paper_canton.html|publisher=www.clas.ufl.edu|accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, [[SpaceX]] is currently [[New product development|developing]]&lt;!-- development starts with design, as long as the project is funded; the SpaceX ITS system is a funded development project --&gt; the technology for a [[SpaceX Mars propellant plant|Mars propellant plant]] that will use a variation on what is described in the previous paragraph.  Rather than transporting hydrogen from Earth to use in making the methane and oxygen, they intend to mine the requisite water from subsurface [[ice|water ice]] that is now known to be abundant across much of the Martian surface, produce and then [[Liquefied natural gas|store]] the post-Sabatier reactants, and then use it as propellant for return flights of their ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' no earlier than 2023.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609&gt;

A similar reaction proposed for Mars is the reverse [[water gas shift reaction]],  {{nowrap|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}. This reaction takes place rapidly in the presence of an iron-chrome [[catalyst]] at 400 Celsius,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and has been implemented in an Earth-based testbed by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Again, oxygen is recycled from the water by [[Electrolysis of water|electrolysis]], and the reaction only needs a small amount of hydrogen from Earth.  The net result of this reaction is the production of oxygen, to be used as the oxidizer component of rocket fuel.

Another reaction proposed for the production of oxygen and fuel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2514/2.3739|title=Mars Rocket Vehicle Using In Situ Propellants|first1=Geoffrey A.|last1=Landis|first2=Diane L.|last2=Linne|date=1 January 2001|publisher=|volume=38|issue=5|pages=730–735|accessdate=1 December 2016|via=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|doi=10.2514/2.3739|bibcode=2001JSpRo..38..730L}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the electrolysis of the atmospheric carbon dioxide,

More recently, it has been proposed the in situ production of oxygen, hydrogen and CO  from the  martian hematite deposits via a two-step thermochemical {{CO2|link=yes}}/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O splitting process, and specifically in the magnetite/wustite redox cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco J. Arias. 2016.  On the in situ production of oxygen and hydrogen from martian hematite deposits via a two-step thermochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O splitting process. Journal of Space Colonization. Issue 5. ISSN 2053-1737&lt;/ref&gt;  Although thermolysis is the most direct, one-step process for splitting molecules, it is neither practical nor efficient in the case of either H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because the process requires a very high temperature (&gt; 2500 C) to achieve a meaningful dissociation fraction.&lt;ref&gt;Ermanoski, I., Siegel, N. P., and Stechel, E. B., A New Reactor Concept for Efficient Solar-Thermochemical Fuel Production," Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, Vol. 135, No. 3, 2013, Paper 031002&lt;/ref&gt; This poses problems in finding suitable reactor materials, losses due to vigorous product recombination, and excessive aperture radiation losses when concentrated solar heat is used. The magnetite/wustite redox cycle was first proposed for solar application on earth by Nakamura,&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, T., \Hydrogen Production from Water Utilizing Solar Heat at High Temperatures, Solar Energy, Vol. 19, No. 5, 1977, pp. 467{475.&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the first used for solar-driven two-step water splitting. In this cycle, water reacts with wustite (FeO) to form magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydrogen. The summarised reactions in this two-step splitting process are as follows:

: &lt;chem&gt;Fe3O4 -&gt;[energy] {3FeO} + \overbrace{1/2O2}^{\underset{(\operatorname{by-product})}{oxygen}}&lt;/chem&gt;.

and the obtained FeO is used for  the thermal splitting of water or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; :

: {{nowrap|3FeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
: {{nowrap|3FeO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CO}}

This process is repeated cyclically. The above process results in a substantial reduction in the thermal input of energy if compared with the most direct, one-step process for splitting molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Roeb, M., Neises, M., Monnerie, N., Call, F., Simon, H., Sattler, C., Schmucker, M., and Pitz-Paal, R.,  Materials-Related Aspects of Thermochemical Water and Carbon Dioxide Splitting: A Review," Materials, Vol. 5, 2012, pp. 2015 2054.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the process needs wustite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to start the cycle, but on Mars there is no wustite or at least not in significant amounts. Nevertheless,  wustite can be  easily obtained by reduction of hematite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)  which is an abundant material on Mars, being specially conspicuous the  strong hematite  deposits located at Terra Meridiani.&lt;ref&gt;William K. Hartmann. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars: The Mysterious Landscapes of the Red Planet. Workman Pub., 2003-Science&lt;/ref&gt;
The intention of wustite from the hematite -abundantly available on Mars, is an industrial  process well-known on earth, and us performed   by the following two main reduction reactions, namely:   
  
: {{nowrap|3Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}
: {{nowrap|3Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

===Moon===
[[Image:Footprint.gif|thumb|left|250px|Footprint in lunar [[regolith]].]]
The Moon possesses abundant raw materials that are potentially relevant to a hierarchy of future applications, beginning with the use of lunar materials to facilitate human activities on the [[Moon]] itself and progressing to the use of lunar resources to underpin a future industrial capability within the Earth-Moon system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Ian|date=2015|title=Lunar Resources: A Review|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|volume=39|pages=137–167|doi=10.1177/0309133314567585|arxiv = 1410.6865 |bibcode = 2015PrPG...39..137C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lunar highland material [[anorthite]] can be used as [[aluminium]] [[ore]]. Smelters can produce pure aluminium, calcium metal, oxygen and silica glass from anorthite. Raw anorthite is also good for making fiberglass and other glass and ceramic products.&lt;ref name="mining"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxygen is often found in iron rich lunar minerals and glasses as [[iron oxide]]. The oxygen can be extracted by heating the material to temperatures above 900&amp;nbsp;°C and exposing it to hydrogen gas. The basic equation is: FeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This process has recently been made much more practical by the discovery of significant amounts of [[hydrogen]]-containing [[regolith]] near the [[Moon#Presence of water|Moon's poles]] by the [[Clementine spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Cast basalt is used on Earth for construction of, for example, pipes where a high resistance to abrasion is required. Cast basalt has a very high [[hardness]] of 8 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]] ([[diamond]] is 10 Mohs) but is also susceptible to mechanical impact and [[thermal shock]]&lt;ref&gt;

===Martian moons, Ceres, asteroids===
Other proposals&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Zuppero and Geoffrey A. Landis, "Mass budget for mining the moons of Mars," ''Resources of Near-Earth Space,'' University of Arizona, 1991 (abstract here [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=49095&amp;id=2&amp;as=false&amp;or=false&amp;qs=Ntt%3Dzuppero%26Ntk%3Dall%26Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall%26Ns%3DArchiveName%257c1%26N%3D4294808501] or here [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991rnes.nasa...24Z])&lt;/ref&gt; are based on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. These moons are in reasonably high orbits above Mars, have very low escape velocities, and unlike Mars have return [[delta-v budget|delta-v]]'s from their surfaces to [[Low Earth Orbit|LEO]] which are less than the return from the Moon.

[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is further out than Mars, with a higher delta-v, but launch windows and travel times are better, and the surface gravity is just 0.028 g, with a very low escape velocity of 510&amp;nbsp;m/s. Researchers have speculated that the interior configuration of Ceres includes a water-ice-rich mantle over a rocky core.&lt;ref name="Thomas2005"&gt;

[[Near Earth Asteroids]] and bodies in the [[asteroid]] belt could also be sources of raw materials for ISRU.

===Planetary atmospheres===
Proposals have been made for "mining" for [[rocket propulsion]], using what is called a [[Propulsive Fluid Accumulator]]. [[Atmospheric gas]]es like oxygen and [[argon]] could be extracted from the atmosphere of planets like the Earth, Mars, and the outer [[Gas Giants]] by [[Propulsive Fluid Accumulator]] satellites in low orbit.&lt;ref name=Jones2010&gt;

==ISRU capability classification (NASA)==
In October 2004, NASA’s Advanced Planning and Integration Office commissioned an ISRU capability roadmap team.
The team's report, along with those of 14 other capability roadmap teams, were published May 22, 2005.&lt;ref name=NCRES2005&gt;

  | pages = 264-291}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The report identifies seven ISRU capabilities:&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|278}}
(i) resource extraction, (ii) material handling and transport, (iii) resource processing, (iv) surface manufacturing with ''in situ'' resources, (v) surface construction, (vi) surface ISRU product and consumable storage and distribution, and (vii) ISRU unique development and certification capabilities. 

The report focuses on lunar and martian environments. It offers a detailed timeline&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|274}} and capability roadmap to 2040&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|280-281}} but it assumes lunar landers in 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|280}}

==ISRU technology demonstrators and prototypes==
The [[Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander]] was intended to carry to Mars a test payload, MIP (Mars ISPP Precursor), that was to demonstrate manufacture of [[oxygen]] from the atmosphere of Mars,&lt;ref name=Kaplan2001&gt;D.

The [[Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment]] (MOXIE) is a 1% scale prototype model aboard the planned [[Mars 2020]] rover that will produce [[oxygen]] from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide ([[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) in a process called [[Solid oxide electrolyser cell|solid oxide electrolysis]].&lt;ref name=techport&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA TechPort -- Mars OXygen ISRU Experiment Project|url=https://techport.nasa.gov/view/33080|website=NASA TechPort|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wall 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wall |first=Mike |url=http://www.space.com/26705-nasa-2020-rover-mars-colony-tech.html |title=Oxygen-Generating Mars Rover to Bring Colonization Closer |work=Space.com |date=August 1, 2014 |accessdate=2014-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GFSC&gt;[https://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/IPM/Final/PDF/ThursPM.pdf The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE)] PDF.

'''Inequity aversion''' ('''IA''') is the [[social preference|preference]] for fairness and resistance to incidental inequalities.&lt;ref name="Fehr"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fehr |first=E. |author2=Schmidt, K.M. |authorlink=Ernst Fehr |year= 1999 |title=A theory of fairness, competition, and cooperation |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=817–68 |doi=10.1162/003355399556151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social sciences that study inequity aversion include [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[ethology]].

==Human studies==
Inequity aversion research on humans mostly occurs in the discipline of [[economics]] though it is also studied in [[sociology]].

Research on inequity aversion began in 1978 when studies suggested that humans are sensitive to inequities in favor of as well as those against them, and that some people attempt overcompensation when they feel "guilty" or unhappy to have received an undeserved reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1978 |last=Walster |author2=Berscheid |authorlink2=Ellen S.

A more recent definition of inequity aversion (resistance to inequitable outcomes) was developed in 1999 by Fehr and Schmidt.&lt;ref name="Fehr"/&gt; They postulated that people make decisions so as to minimize inequity in outcomes. Specifically, consider a setting with individuals {1,2,...,''n''} who receive pecuniary outcomes ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the utility to person ''i'' would be given by 
:&lt;math&gt;U_i(\{x_i, x_j\}) = x_i - \frac{\alpha_i}{n-1} \times \sum{\max(x_j - x_i,0)} - \frac{\beta_i}{n-1} \times \sum{\max(x_i - x_j,0)},&lt;/math&gt;

where α parametrizes the distaste of person ''i'' for disadvantageous inequality in the first nonstandard term, and β parametrizes the distaste of person ''i'' for advantageous inequality in the final term.

===Punishing unjust success and game theory===
Fehr and Schmidt showed that disadvantageous inequity aversion manifests itself in humans as the "willingness to sacrifice potential gain to block another individual from receiving a superior reward". They argue that this apparently self-destructive response is essential in creating an environment in which bilateral bargaining can thrive. Without inequity aversion's rejection of injustice, stable cooperation would be harder to maintain (for instance, there would be more opportunities for successful [[free rider problem|free riders]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/726/1/Fehr-Schmidt_Handbook_2005-Munichecon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James H. Fowler]] and his colleagues also argue that inequity aversion is essential for cooperation in multilateral settings.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler JH, Johnson T, Smirnov O. "Egalitarian Motive and Altruistic Punishment," ''Nature'' 433: {{doi|10.1038/nature03256}} (6 January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they show that subjects in ''random income'' games (closely related to public goods games) are willing to spend their own money to reduce the income of wealthier group members and increase the income of poorer group members even when there is no cooperation at stake.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes CT, Fowler JH, Johnson T, McElreath R, Smirnov O. "Egalitarian Motives in Humans," ''Nature'' 446: 794–96, {{doi|10.1038/nature05651}} (12 April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, individuals who free ride on the contributions of fellow group members are likely to be punished because they earn more, creating a decentralized incentive for the maintenance of cooperation.

===Experimental economics===
Inequity aversion is broadly consistent with observations of behavior in three standard [[experimental economics|economics experiments]]:
# [[Dictator game]] – The subject chooses how a reward should be split between himself and another subject. If the dictator acted self-interestedly, the split would consist of 0 for the partner and the full amount for the dictator. While the most common choice is indeed to keep everything, many dictators choose to give, with the second most common choice being the 50:50 split. 
# [[Ultimatum game]] – The dictator game is played, but the recipient is allowed to veto the entire deal, so that both subjects receive nothing. The partner typically vetos the deal when low offers are made. People consistently prefer getting nothing to receiving a small share of the pie. Rejecting the offer is in effect paying to punish the dictator (called the ''proposer'').
# [[Trust game]] – The same result as found in the dictator game shows up when the dictator's initial endowment is provided by his partner, even though this requires the first player to trust that something will be returned (reciprocity). This experiment often yields a 50:50 split of the endowment, and has been used as evidence of the inequity aversion model.

In 2005, John List modified these experiments slightly to determine if something in the construction of the experiments was prompting specific behaviors. When given a choice to steal money from the other player, even a single dollar, the observed altruism all but disappeared. In another experiment, the two players were given a sum of money and the choice to give or take any amount from the other player. In this experiment, only 10% of the participants gave the other person any money at all, and fully 40% of the players opted to take all of the other player's money.

The last such experiment was identical to the former, where 40% were turned into a gang of robbers, with one catch: the two players were forced to earn the money by stuffing envelopes. In this last experiment, more than two thirds of the players neither took nor gave a cent, while just over 20% still took some of the other player's money.

In 2011, Ert Erev and Roth&lt;ref&gt;Ert E, Erev I, Roth AE "[http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4336/2/3/257 A Choice Prediction Competition for Social Preferences in Simple Extensive Form Games: An Introduction]." Games 2.3 (2011): 257–76.&lt;/ref&gt; ran a model prediction competition on two datasets, each of which included 120 two-player games. In each game player 1 decides whether to "opt out" and determine the payoffs for both players, or to "opt in" and let player 2 decide about the payoff allocation by choosing between actions "left" or "right". The payoffs were randomly selected, so the dataset included games like the Ultimatum, Dictator, and Trust, as well as other games. The results suggested that inequity aversion could be described as one of many strategies that people might use in such games.

Other research in experimental economics addresses risk aversion in decision making&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Joyce E., and Thomas A. Rietz's [[University of Iowa]] Discussion Paper, from 1997 ''Do Unto Others: A Theory and Experimental Test of Interpersonal Factors in Decision Making Under Uncertainty'' examines the increased risk aversion from [[lottery]]-choice games to multi-party dealing. It suggests that this could be explained by altruism and a concern for an equitable distribution among all parties (fairness). This paper also used the phrase 'inequity aversion'&lt;/ref&gt; and the comparison of inequality measures to subjective judgments on perceived inequalities.&lt;ref name="AmielCowell"&gt;Yoram Amiel (author), Frank A. Cowell: ''Thinking about Inequality: Personal Judgment and Income Distributions'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies of companies===
Surveys of employee opinions within firms have shown modern [[labor economist]]s that inequity aversion is very important to them. Employees compare not only relative [[salary|salaries]] but also relative performance against that of co-workers. Where these comparisons lead to guilt or envy, inequity aversion may lower employee morale. According to Bewley (1999), the main reason that [[management|managers]] create formal pay structures is so that the inter-employee comparison is seen to be "fair", which they considered "key" for morale and [[job performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Bewley, T. (1999) ''Why wages don't fall during a Recession''. Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|0-674-95241-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is natural to think of inequity aversion leading to greater [[solidarity]] within the labor pool, to the benefit of the average employee. However, a 2008 paper by Pedro Rey-Biel shows that this assumption can be subverted, and that an employer can use inequity aversion to get higher performance for less pay than would be possible otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9442.2008.00540.x/abstract |title=Inequity Aversion and Team Incentives |journal= [[The Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] |volume=10 |issue= 2 |pages= 297–320 |first= P. |last=Rey-Biel|date=June 2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9442.2008.00540.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by moving away from formal pay structures and using off-[[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] [[Performance-related pay|bonus payments]] as incentives for extra performance. He shows that the optimal [[contract]] for inequity aversion employees is less generous at the optimal production level than contracts for "standard agents" (who don't have inequity aversion) in an otherwise identical two-employee model.

===Criticisms===
In 2005 Avner Shaked distributed a "pamphlet" entitled "The [[Rhetoric]] of Inequity Aversion" that attacked the inequity aversion papers of Fehr &amp; Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shaked|first1=Avner|title=The Rhetoric of Inequity Aversion|date=2005|SSRN=675227}} [[Bonn University]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Shaked has published an extended version of the criticism together with [[Kenneth Binmore|Ken Binmore]] in the ''Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization'' (the same issue also contains a reply by Fehr and Schmidt and a rejoinder by Binmore and Shaked).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental economics: Where next?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109002820|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2010|pages = 87–100|volume = 73|series = On the Methodology of Experimental Economics|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2008.10.019|first = Ken|last = Binmore|first2 = Avner|last2 = Shaked}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On inequity aversion: A reply to Binmore and Shaked|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109002844|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2010|pages = 101–08|volume = 73|series = On the Methodology of Experimental Economics|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2009.12.001|first = Ernst|last = Fehr|first2 = Klaus M.|last2 = Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental Economics: Where Next?

Hence, by construction inequity aversion must always be at least as good as standard theory when the inequity aversion parameters can be chosen after seeing the data. Binmore and Shaked also point out that Fehr and Schmidt (1999) pick a distribution of alpha and beta without conducting a formal estimation. The perfect correlation between the alpha and beta parameters in Fehr and Schmidt (1999) is an assumption made in the appendix of their paper that is not justified by the data that they provide. 

More recently, several papers have estimated Fehr-Schmidt inequity aversion parameters using estimation techniques such as [[maximum likelihood]]. The results are mixed. Some authors have found beta larger than alpha, which contradicts a central assumption made by Fehr and Schmidt (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Inequity Aversion in a Heterogeneous Population Using Experimental Decisions and Subjective Probabilities|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2008.00860.x/abstract|journal = Econometrica|date = 2008|issn = 1468-0262|pages = 815–39|volume = 76|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0262.2008.00860.x|language = en|first = Charles|last = Bellemare|first2 = Sabine|last2 = Kröger|first3 = Arthur|last3 = Van Soest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have found that inequity aversion with Fehr and Schmidt's (1999) distribution of alphas and betas explains data of contract-theoretic experiments not better than standard theory; they also estimate average values of alpha that are much smaller than suggested by Fehr and Schmidt (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Contracting under Incomplete Information and Social Preferences: An Experimental Study|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/80/4/1516|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 2013|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 1516–44|volume = 80|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/restud/rdt010|language = en|first = Eva I.|last = Hoppe|first2 = Patrick W.|last2 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Levitt and List (2007) have pointed out that laboratory experiments tend to exaggerate the importance of pro-social behaviors because the subjects in the laboratory know that they are being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Do Laboratory Experiments Measuring Social Preferences Reveal About the Real World?|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/jep.21.2.153|journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives|date = 2007|issn = 0895-3309|pages = 153–74|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1257/jep.21.2.153|first = Steven D|last = Levitt|first2 = John A|last2 = List}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An alternative&lt;ref name="AmielCowell"/&gt; to the concept of a general inequity aversion is the assumption, that the ''degree'' and the structure of inequality could lead either to acceptance or to aversion of inequality.

==Non-human studies==
{{see also|Inequity aversion in animals}}
An experiment on [[capuchin monkey]]s ([[Sarah Brosnan|Brosnan, S]] and [[Frans de Waal|de Waal, F]]) showed that the subjects would prefer receiving nothing to receiving a reward awarded inequitably in favor of a second monkey, and appeared to target their anger at the researchers responsible for the inequitable distribution of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brosnan |first=S.F. |last2=de Waal|first2=F.B.M. |year=2003 |title=Monkeys reject unequal pay |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=425 |pmid=13679918 |pages=297–99 |doi=10.1038/nature01963 |issue=6955}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropologist]]s suggest that this research indicates a [[biological]] and [[evolution]]ary sense of social "fair play" in [[primates]], though others believe that this is learned behavior or explained by other mechanisms.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} There is also evidence for inequity aversion in [[chimpanzee]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brosnan|first1=S.

The latest study shows that chimpanzees play the Ultimatum Game in the same way as children, preferring equitable outcomes. The authors claim that we now are near the point of no difference between humans and apes with regard to a sense of fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Proctor |first=D.|year=2013 |title=Chimpanzees play the ultimatum game.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA |volume=110 |pages=2070–75 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1220806110|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest that animals in the [[canidae]] family also recognize a basic level of fairness, stemming from living in cooperative societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dogs Understand Fairness, Get Jealous, Study Finds |date=9 December 2009 |last1=Greenfieldboyce |first1=Nell |website=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97944783}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Animal cognition]] studies in other biological [[order (biology)|orders]] have not found similar importance on ''relative'' "equity" and "justice" as opposed to ''absolute'' [[utility]].

==Social inequity aversion==
Fehr and Schmidt's model may partially explain the widespread opposition to [[economic inequality]] in [[democracy|democracies]], but a distinction should be drawn between inequity aversion's "guilt" and [[egalitarianism]]'s "[[compassion]]", which does not necessarily imply ''injustice''.

Inequity aversion should not be confused with the arguments against the ''consequences'' of inequality. For example, the pro-[[publicly funded health care]] [[slogan]] "Hospitals for the poor become poor hospitals" directly objects to a predicted decline in medical care, not the health-care [[apartheid]] that is supposed to cause it. The argument that average medical outcomes improve with reduction in [[healthcare]] inequality (at the same total spending) is separate from the case for public healthcare on the grounds of inequity aversion.

The '''infinity symbol''' {{math|∞|size=150%}} (sometimes called the [[lemniscate]]) is a [[List of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbol]] representing the concept of [[infinity]].

==History==
[[File:John Wallis by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Wallis]] introduced the infinity symbol to mathematical literature.]]

The shape of a sideways figure eight has a long pedigree; for instance, it appears in the cross of [[Saint Boniface]], wrapped around the bars of a [[Latin cross]].&lt;ref name="barrow"&gt;{{citation|title=Cosmic Imagery: Key Images in the History of Science|first=John D.|last=Barrow|authorlink=John D.

Wallis did not explain his choice of this symbol, but it has been conjectured to be a variant form of a [[Roman numeral#Large numbers|Roman numeral]] for 1,000 (originally CIƆ, also CƆ), which was sometimes used to mean "many", or of the Greek letter&amp;nbsp;ω ([[omega]]), the last letter in the [[Greek alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A brief history of infinity: the quest to think the unthinkable|first=Brian|last=Clegg|publisher=Robinson|year=2003|isbn=9781841196503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Euler's infinity sign.svg|thumb|Symbol used by Euler to denote infinity]]
[[Leonhard Euler]] used an open variant of the symbol&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Cor. 1 p. 174 in:  Leonhard Euler.  Variae observationes circa series infinitas. Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 9, 1744, pp. 160-188. [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/docs/originals/E072.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to denote "absolutus infinitus". Euler freely performed various operations on infinity, such as taking its logarithm. This symbol is not used anymore, and is not encoded as a separate character in Unicode.

==Usage==
In mathematics, the infinity symbol is used more often to represent a [[potential infinity]],&lt;ref name="barrow"/&gt; rather than to represent an actually infinite quantity such as the [[ordinal number]]s and [[cardinal number]]s (which use other notations). For instance, in the mathematical notation for [[summation]]s and [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]s such as
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2^x-1}{2^{x-1}} = 2,&lt;/math&gt;
the infinity sign is conventionally interpreted as meaning that the variable grows arbitrarily large (towards infinity) rather than actually taking an infinite value.

The infinity symbol may also be used to represent a [[point at infinity]], especially when there is only one such point under consideration. This usage includes, for instance,
the infinite point of a [[projective line]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algebraic Geometry: An Introduction|first=Daniel|last=Perrin|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=9781848000568|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vn1yR9qPvlMC&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the point added to a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to form its [[Alexandroff extension|one-point compactification]] &lt;math&gt;T_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Infinite Dimensional Analysis: A Hitchhiker's Guide|first1=Charalambos D.|last1=Aliprantis|first2=Kim C.|last2=Border|edition=3rd|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=9783540295877|pages=56–57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vyXtR3vUhoC&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas other than mathematics, the infinity symbol may take on other related meanings; for instance, it has been used in [[bookbinding]] to indicate that a book is printed on [[acid-free paper]] and will therefore be long-lasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A handbook for the study of book history in the United States|first1=Ronald J.|last1=Zboray|first2=Mary Saracino|last2=Zboray|publisher=Center for the Book, Library of Congress|year=2000|isbn=9780844410159|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern symbolism==
[[File:RWS Tarot 08 Strength.jpg|thumb|The infinity symbol appears on several cards of the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck|Rider–Waite]] [[tarot]] deck]]

In modern mysticism, the infinity symbol has become identified with a variation of the [[ouroboros]], an ancient image of a snake eating its own tail that has also come to symbolize the infinite, and the ouroboros is sometimes drawn in figure-eight form to reflect this identification, rather than in its more traditional circular form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities|first=Wendy Doniger|last=O'Flaherty|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1986|isbn=9780226618555|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhNNrX3bmo4C&amp;pg=PA243}}. The book also features this image on its cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the works of [[Vladimir Nabokov]], including ''[[The Gift (Nabokov novel)|The Gift]]'' and ''[[Pale Fire]]'', the figure-eight shape is used symbolically to refer to the [[Möbius strip]] and the infinite, for instance in these books' descriptions of the shapes of bicycle tire tracks and of the outlines of half-remembered people. The poem after which ''Pale Fire'' is entitled explicitly refers to "the miracle of the lemniscate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nabokov: The Mystery of Literary Structures|first=Leona|last=Toker|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780801422119|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jud1q_NrqpcC&amp;pg=PA159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphic design==
The well known shape and meaning of the infinity symbol have made it a common [[typography|typographic]] element of [[graphic design]]. For instance, the [[Métis flag]], used by the Canadian [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis people]] in the early 19th century, is based around this symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Native American Flags|first1=Donald T.|last1=Healy|first2=Peter J.|last2=Orenski|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2003|isbn=9780806135564|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern commerce, corporate logos featuring this symbol have been used by, among others, [[Room for PlayStation Portable]], [[Microsoft Visual Studio]], [[Fujitsu]], and [[CoorsTek]].

==Encoding==
The symbol is encoded in [[Unicode]] at {{unichar|221E|infinity}} and in [[LaTeX]] as &lt;code&gt;\infty&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''Is Google Making Us Stupid? What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains''''' (alternatively '''''Is Google Making Us Stoopid?''''') is a magazine article by technology writer [[Nicholas G. Carr]], and is highly critical of the Internet's effect on [[cognition]]. It was published in the July/August 2008 edition of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly|The Atlantic]]'' magazine as a six-page cover story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pages and "pages" |author=Nicholas Carr |date=2008-06-12 |publisher=Rough Type |url=http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/06/pages_and_pages.php |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at [[Google]], but more at the cognitive impact of the [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson1/&gt; Carr expanded his argument in ''[[The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains]]'', a book published by [[W. W. Norton]] in June 2010.

The essay was extensively discussed in the media and the [[blogosphere]], with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica Blog]], a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The internet shrinks your brain? What rubbish |author=David Aaronovitch |date=2008-08-13 |work=[[The Times]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article4517674.ece |accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine ''[[Edge - the third culture|Edge]]'', several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.

While long-term psychological and neurological studies have yet to yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, a few studies have provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users.&lt;ref name=Claburn/&gt; A [[UCLA]] study led some to wonder whether a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's [[functional MRI]] scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.

==Background==
Prior to the publication of Carr's ''Atlantic'' essay, critics had long been concerned about the potential for electronic media to supplant literary reading.&lt;ref name=lit-debate&gt;{{cite news |title=Literacy Debate: Online, R U Really Reading? |author=Motoko Rich |date=2008-07-27 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/books/27reading.html |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, American academic [[Sven Birkerts]] published a book titled ''The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age'', consisting of a collection of essays that declaimed against the declining influence of [[literary culture]]—the tastes in literature that are favored by a social group—with a central premise among the essays asserting that alternative delivery formats for the book are inferior to the paper incarnation.&lt;ref name=fate-of-book/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharratt&gt;{{cite news |title=Are There Books in Our Future |author=Bernard Sharratt |date=1994-12-18 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DF1239F93BA25751C1A962958260 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Naughton/&gt; Birkerts was spurred to write the book after his experience with a class he taught in the fall of 1992, where the students had little appreciation for the literature he had assigned them, stemming from, in his opinion, their inaptitude for the variety of skills involved in [[deep reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Birkerts|1994|pp=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deepreading/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Can intelligent literature survive in the digital age? |author=John Walsh and Kate Burt |date=2008-09-14 |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/books-special-can-intelligent-literature-survive-in-the-digital-age-926545.html |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Perseus Unbound", an essay from the book, Birkerts presented several reservations toward the application of interactive technologies to educational instruction, cautioning that the "long-term cognitive effects of these new processes of data absorption" were unknown and that they could yield "an expansion of the short-term memory banks and a correlative atrophying of long-term memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Birkerts|1994|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, developmental psychologist [[Maryanne Wolf]] took up the cause of defending reading and print culture in her book ''[[Proust and the Squid|Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain]]'', approaching the subject matter from a scientific angle in contrast to Birkerts' cultural-historical angle.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharratt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We were never meant to read |author=William Leith |date=2008-03-28 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/23/bowol123.xml |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few reviewers were critical of Wolf for only touching upon the Internet's potential impact on reading in her book;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stumbling over books |author=Guy Dammann |date=2008-03-28 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/29/bowol129.xml |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reading is hard work for the brain, as this book proves. |author=[[Michael Dirda]] |date=2007-09-02 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/30/AR2007083001664.html |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We're on a scroll |author=Guy Dammann |date=2008-04-05 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/05/wereonascroll |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in essays published concurrent with the book's release she elaborated upon her worries. In an essay in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Wolf expressed her grave concern that the development of knowledge in children who are heavy users of the Internet could produce mere "decoders of information who have neither the time nor the motivation to think beneath or beyond their googled universes", and cautioned that the web's "immediacy and volume of information should not be confused with true knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Learning to think in a digital world |author=[[Maryanne Wolf]] |date=2007-09-05 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/09/05/learning_to_think_in_a_digital_world/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay published by [[Powell's Books]], Wolf contended that some of the reading brain's strengths could be lost in future generations "if children are not taught first to read, and to think deeply about their reading, and only then to e-read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reading Worrier |author=[[Maryanne Wolf]] |year=2007 |publisher=[[Powell's Books]] |url=http://www.powells.com/essays/wolf.html |accessdate=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferring to maintain an academic perspective, Wolf firmly asserted that her speculations have not yet been scientifically verified but deserved serious study.&lt;ref name=podcast1&gt;{{cite podcast |title=Does spending time online change the way we think?

==Synopsis==
At the start of the essay, Carr says that his recent difficulties with concentrating while reading books and long articles may be due to spending a lot of time on the Internet. He posits that regular Internet usage may have the effect of diminishing the capacity for concentration and contemplation. He prefaces his argument with a couple of anecdotes from bloggers on their changing reading habits, as well as the findings of a 2008 [[University College London]] study titled "Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future" which suggests the emergence of new types of reading. He cites Maryanne Wolf, an expert on reading, for her expertise on the role of media and technology in learning written languages. Carr raises the point that unlike 'speech, which is an [[Innatism|innate ability]]'{{fact|date=January 2018}} hardwired into the human brain, the ability to read has to be taught in order for the brain to rearrange its original parts for the task of interpreting symbols into words. He acknowledges that his argument does not yet have the backing of long-term neurological and psychological studies. Carr further draws on Wolf's work, particularly her 2007 book ''Proust and the Squid'', to relate his argument to the way in which neural circuits in the reading brain are specifically shaped by the demands particular to each written language, such as Chinese, Japanese, and alphabet-based scripts.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes&gt;{{cite news |title='Is Google Making Us Stupid?': sources and notes |author=[[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] |date=2008-08-07 |publisher=Rough Type |url=http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/08/is_google_makin.php |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|2007|pp=60–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Carr purports that the neural circuitry shaped by regular Internet usage can also be expected to be different from that shaped by the reading of books and other page-based written material.

Carr begins his argument by reasoning how the capacity to concentrate may be weakened by regular Internet usage. He mentions a historical example involving [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s usage of a typewriter, a fairly new technology in the 1880s. According to German scholar [[Friedrich A. Kittler]], Nietzsche's prose style changed when he started using a typewriter, which he had adopted because of his developing difficulty with writing by hand due to failing eyesight. Carr proceeds to explain that scientific research in the field of [[neuroplasticity]] as of 2008 has demonstrated that the brain's neural circuitry can in fact be rewired. In the humanities, sociologist [[Daniel Bell]] coined the term "intellectual technologies" to describe those technologies that extend the brain's cognitive faculties, and Carr states that he believes that the human brain adopts the qualities of these intellectual technologies. In discussing the [[mechanical clock]], Carr deliberates upon the benefits and losses that are characteristic of new technologies. Then, Carr ventures that the cognitive impact of the Internet may be far more encompassing than any other previous intellectual technology because the Internet is gradually performing the services of most intellectual technologies, thus replacing them. Carr finally contends that the prevalent style of presentation for much of the Internet's content may significantly hinder the capacity to concentrate due to the many distractions that often surround the Internet's content, in the form of ads and obtrusive notifications. Additionally, he claims that these detrimental effects on concentration are compounded by traditional media because they are gradually adopting a style of presentation for their content that mimics the Internet, in order to remain competitive as consumer expectations change.

Carr also theorizes that the capacity to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain of much of the painstaking [[knowledge work]] — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere [[automaton]]s due to the systemic application of [[Taylorism]] — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.

Finally, Carr places his [[skepticism]] in a historical context, reflecting upon how previous detractors of technological advances have fared. While often correct, Carr points out that skepticisms such as [[Socrates]]' concerns about written language and the 15th-century Venetian editor [[Hieronimo Squarciafico]]'s concerns about printed works failed to anticipate the benefits that these technologies might hold for human knowledge. As an afterthought, a 2005 essay by playwright [[Richard Foreman]] is excerpted for its lament of the waning of the "highly educated and articulate personality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Pancake People, Or, 'The Gods Are Pounding My Head' |date=2005-08-03 |author=[[Richard Foreman]] |work=[[Edge - the third culture|Edge]] |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/foreman05/foreman05_index.html |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr's essay was widely discussed in the media both critically and in passing. While English technology writer [[Bill Thompson (technology writer)|Bill Thompson]] observed that Carr's argument had "succeeded in provoking a wide-ranging debate",&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite news |title=Changing the way we think |author=[[Bill Thompson (technology writer)|Bill Thompson]] |date=2008-06-17 |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ifs_news/hi/newsid_7459000/7459182.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damon Darlin of ''The New York Times'' quipped that even though "[everyone] has been talking about [the] article in ''The Atlantic'' magazine", only "[s]ome subset of that group has actually read the 4,175-word article, by Nicholas Carr."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Technology Doesn’t Dumb Us Down.

Many critics discussed the merits of Carr's essay at great length in [[Internet forum|forums]] set up formally for this purpose at online hubs such as the Britannica Blog and publisher [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman's]] online scientific magazine ''[[Edge - the third culture|Edge]]'', where the roster of names quickly took on the semblance of a [[Who's Who]] of the day's Internet critics.&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Is Google Making Us Stupid?'

Book critic Scott Esposito pointed out that [[Chinese character]]s are incorrectly described as [[ideogram]]s in Carr's essay, an error that he believed undermined the essay's argument.&lt;ref name=Esposito/&gt; The myth that Chinese script is ideographic had been effectively debunked in scholar [[John DeFrancis]]' 1984 book ''[[The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Unger|2004|pp=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeFrancis classifies Chinese as a [[logosyllabic writing]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|2007|pp=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr acknowledged that there was a debate over the terminology of 'ideogram', but in a response to Esposito he explained that he had "decided to use the common term" and quoted ''[[Oxford American Dictionary|The Oxford American Dictionary]]'' to demonstrate that they likewise define Chinese characters as instances of ideograms.&lt;ref&gt;In a [http://www.conversationalreading.com/2008/06/is-google-makin.html#comment-119640252 comment from Nicholas Carr] on Book critic Scott Esposito's column concerning his criticism of Carr's usage of the term 'ideogram', Carr said: "As to '[[ideogram]],' I agree that there's debate on terminology, but in my article I decided to use the common term. The [[Oxford American Dictionary]] defines ideogram in this way: 'a written character symbolizing the idea of a thing without indicating the sounds used to say it, e.g., numerals and Chinese characters.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer and activist [[Seth Finkelstein]] noted that predictably several critics would label Carr's argument as a [[Luddite]] one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nick Carr: 'Is Google Making Us Stupid?', and Man vs. Machine |author=Seth Finkelstein |date=2008-06-09 |publisher=Infothought |url=http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/archives/001349.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was not to be disappointed when one critic later maintained that Carr's "contrarian stance [was] slowly forcing him into a caricature of Luddism".&lt;ref name=Shirky1/&gt; Then, journalist [[David Wolman]], in a ''Wired'' magazine piece, described as "moronic" the assumption that the web "hurts us more than it helps", a statement that was preceded by an overview of the many technologies that had been historically denounced; Wolman concluded that the solution was "better schools as well as a renewed commitment to reason and scientific rigor so that people can distinguish knowledge from garbage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Critics Need a Reboot.

Several prominent scientists working in the field of [[neuroscience]] supported Carr's argument as scientifically plausible. James Olds, a professor of computational neuroscience, who directs the [[Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[George Mason University]], was quoted in Carr's essay for his expertise, and upon the essay's publication Olds wrote a letter to the editor of ''The Atlantic'' in which he reiterated that the brain was "very plastic" — referring to the changes that occur in the organization of the brain as a result of experience. It was Olds' opinion that given the brain's plasticity it was "not such a long stretch to Carr's meme".&lt;ref name=Olds&gt;{{cite news |title=Not So Google Stoopid, Ctd. |author=Andrew Sullivan |date=2008-06-20 |publisher=The Daily Dish |url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/06/not-so-google-1.html |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the pioneers in neuroplasticity research, [[Michael Merzenich]], later added his own comment to the discussion, stating that he had given a talk at Google in 2008 in which he had asked the audience the same question that Carr asked in his essay.

In the [[Mass media|media]], there were many testimonials and refutations given by journalists for the first part of Carr's argument regarding the capacity for concentration; treatments of the second part of Carr's argument regarding the capacity for contemplation, were, however, far rarer.&lt;ref name=Compilation/&gt; Although columnist [[Andrew Sullivan]] noted that he had little leisure time at his disposal for contemplation compared with when he grew up,&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite news |title=Google is giving us pond-skater minds |author=[[Andrew Sullivan]] |date=2008-06-15 |work=[[The Times]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article4136782.ece |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anecdotes provided by journalists that indicated a deficiency in the capacity to contemplate were described only in the context of third parties, such as columnist [[Margaret Wente]]'s anecdote about how one consultant had found a growing tendency in her clients to provide ill-considered descriptions for their technical problems.&lt;ref name=Compilation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wente&gt;{{cite news |title=How Google ate my brain |date=2008-06-17 |author=[[Margaret Wente]] |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080617.COWENT17/TPStory/National/columnists |accessdate=2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columnist [[Leonard Pitts]] of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' described his difficulty sitting down to read a book, in which he felt like he "was getting away with something, like when you slip out of the office to catch a matinee".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reader finds satisfaction in a good read |author=[[Leonard Pitts|Leonard Pitts, Jr.]] |date=2008-06-15 |work=[[Miami Herald]] |url=http://sapper.blogspot.com/2008/06/google-me-stupid-me.html |accessdate=2009-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology evangelist [[Jon Udell]] admitted that, in his "retreats" from the Internet, he sometimes struggled to settle into "books, particularly fiction, and particularly in printed form".&lt;ref name=udell/&gt; He found portable long-form audio to be "transformative", however, because he can easily achieve "sustained attention", which makes him optimistic about the potential to "reactivate ancient traditions, like oral storytelling, and rediscover their powerful neural effects".&lt;ref name=Naughton&gt;{{cite news |title=I Google, therefore I am losing the ability to think |author=[[John Naughton]] |date=2008-06-22 |work=[[The Observer]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/22/googlethemedia.internet |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=udell&gt;{{cite news |title=A quiet retreat from the busy information commons |author=[[Jon Udell]] |date=2008-06-10 |publisher=Strategies for Internet citizens |url=http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/06/10/a-quiet-retreat-from-the-busy-information-commons/ |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also writing in ''The Atlantic'', a year after Carr, the futurist [[Jamais Cascio]] argued that human cognition has always evolved to meet environmental challenges, and that those posed by the internet are no different. He described the 'skimming' referred to by Carr as a form of attention deficit caused by the immaturity of filter algorithms: "The trouble isn’t that we have too much information at our fingertips, but that our tools for managing it are still in their infancy... many of the technologies that Carr worries about were developed precisely to help us get some control over a flood of data and ideas. Google isn’t the problem; it’s the beginning of a solution."&lt;ref name="ref_GetSmarter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/get-smarter/307548/ |title=Get Smarter |last=Cascio |first=Jamais |date=July 2009  |website= |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly |access-date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cascio and Carr's articles have been discussed together in several places. [[Pew Research]] used them to form a tension-pair question survey that was distributed to noted academics. Most responded in detail; concurring with the proposition "Carr was wrong: Google does not make us stupid".&lt;ref name="ref_Pew2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2010/02/19/part-1-a-review-of-responses-to-a-tension-pair-about-whether-google-will-make-people-stupid/ |title=Future of the Internet IV.

However, he thought both arguments relied too much on determinism: Carr in thinking that an over-reliance on internet tools will inevitably cause the brain to atrophy, and Cascio in thinking that getting smarter is the necessary outcome of the evolutionary pressures he describes.&lt;ref name="Vaidhyanathan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Siva Vaidhyanathan|title=The Googlization of Everything: (And Why We Should Worry)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyH6f_qjLwEC&amp;pg=PA181|date=13 March 2012|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95245-4|pages=181–  |access-date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg'' Naughton noted that, while many agreed Carr had hit on an important subject, his conclusions were not widely supported.&lt;ref name="ref_Naughton2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Naughton|title=From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg: What You Really Need to Know About the Internet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0tCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26|date=22 December 2011|publisher=Quercus Publishing|isbn=978-0-85738-547-5|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firmly contesting Carr's argument, journalist [[John Battelle]] praised the virtues of the web: "[W]hen I am deep in search for knowledge on the web, jumping from link to link, reading deeply in one moment, skimming hundreds of links the next, when I am pulling back to formulate and reformulate queries and devouring new connections as quickly as Google and the Web can serve them up, when I am performing [[bricolage]] in real time over the course of hours, I am 'feeling' my brain light up, I and {{sic}} 'feeling' like I'm getting smarter".&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google: Making Nick Carr Stupid, But It's Made This Guy Smarter |author=[[John Battelle]] |date=2008-06-10 |publisher=Searchblog |url=http://battellemedia.com/archives/004494.php |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web journalist [[Scott Rosenberg (journalist)|Scott Rosenberg]] reported that his reading habits are the same as they were when he "was a teenager plowing [his] way through a shelf of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nick Carr’s new knock on the Web: does it change how we read? |author=[[Scott Rosenberg (journalist)|Scott Rosenberg]] |date=2008-06-11 |publisher=Wordyard |url=http://www.wordyard.com/2008/06/11/nick-carrs-new-knock-on-the-web-does-it-change-how-we-read/ |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In book critic Scott Esposito's view, "responsible adults" have always had to deal with distractions, and, in his own case, he claimed to remain "fully able to turn down the noise" and read deeply.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite news |title=Friday Column: Is Google Making Us Read Worse? |author=Scott Esposito |date=2008-06-20 |publisher=Conversational Reading |url=http://www.conversationalreading.com/2008/06/is-google-makin.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Compilation/&gt;

==Analysis==
In critiquing the rise of Internet-based computing, the philosophical question of whether or not a society can control technological progress was raised. At the online scientific magazine ''[[Edge - the third culture|Edge]]'', Wikipedia co-founder [[Larry Sanger]] argued that individual will was all that was necessary to maintain the cognitive capacity to read a book all the way through, and computer scientist and writer [[Jaron Lanier]] rebuked the idea that technological progress is an "autonomous process that will proceed in its chosen direction independently of us".&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt; Lanier echoed a view stated by American historian [[Lewis Mumford]] in his 1970 book ''[[The Myth of the Machine|The Pentagon of Power]]'', in which Mumford suggested that the technological advances that shape a society could be controlled if the full might of a society's free will were employed.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carr|2008|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanier believed that technology was significantly hindered by the idea that "there is only one axis of choice" which is either pro- or anti- when it comes to technology adoption.&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt; Yet Carr had stated in ''The Big Switch'' that he believed an individual's personal choice toward a technology had little effect on technological progress.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes/&gt;&lt;ref name=BigSwitch-2/&gt; According to Carr, the view expressed by Mumford about technological progress was incorrect because it regarded technology solely as advances in science and engineering rather than as an influence on the costs of production and consumption. Economics were a more significant consideration in Carr's opinion because in a competitive marketplace the most efficient methods of providing an important resource will prevail. As technological advances shape society, an individual might be able to resist the effects but his lifestyle will "always be lonely and in the end futile"; despite a few holdouts, technology will nevertheless shape economics which, in turn, will shape society.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes/&gt;&lt;ref name=BigSwitch-2&gt;{{Harvnb|Carr|2008|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A focus on literary reading===
The selection of one particular quote in Carr's essay from pathologist Bruce Friedman, a member of the faculty of the [[University of Michigan Medical School]], who commented on a developing difficulty reading books and long essays and specifically the novel ''[[War and Peace]]'', was criticized for having a bias toward narrative literature. The quote failed to represent other types of literature, such as technical and scientific literature, which had, in contrast, become much more accessible and widely read with the advent of the Internet.&lt;ref name=coverstory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shirky2/&gt; At the Britannica Blog, writer [[Clay Shirky]] pugnaciously observed that ''War and Peace'' was "too long, and not so interesting", further stating that "it would be hard to argue that the last ten years have seen a decrease in either the availability or comprehension of material on scientific or technical subjects".&lt;ref name=Shirky1&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Abundance is Good: A Reply to Nick Carr |author=[[Clay Shirky]] |date=2008-07-17 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica Blog]] |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/why-abundance-is-good-a-reply-to-nick-carr/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirky's comments on ''War and Peace'' were derided by several of his peers as verging on [[philistinism]].&lt;ref name=Carr1&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Skepticism is Good: My Reply to Clay Shirky |author=Nicholas Carr |date=2008-07-17 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/why-skepticism-is-good-my-reply-to-clay-shirky/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanger1&gt;{{cite news |title=A Defense of Tolstoy &amp; the Individual Thinker: A Reply to Clay Shirky |author=[[Larry Sanger]] |date=2008-07-18 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/a-defense-of-tolstoy-the-individual-thinker-a-reply-to-clay-shirky/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanger2&gt;{{cite news |title=The Internet and the Future of Civilization |author=Larry Sanger |date=2008-07-30 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/the-internet-and-the-future-of-civilization/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Shirky's defense, inventor [[W. Daniel Hillis]] asserted that, although books "were created to serve a purpose", that "same purpose can often be served by better means". While Hillis considered the book to be "a fine and admirable device", he imagined that [[clay tablet]]s and [[scroll|scrolls of papyrus]], in their time, "had charms of their own".&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt; ''Wired'' magazine editor [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] believed that the idea that "the book is the apex of human culture" should be resisted.&lt;ref name=fate-of-book&gt;{{cite news |title=The Fate of the Book (and a Question for Sven Birkerts) |author=[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] |date=2008-07-25 |publisher=Britannica Blog (originally posted at Kelly's blog The Technium)|url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/fate-of-the-book/}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Birkerts differentiated online reading from literary reading, stating that in the latter the reader is directed within themselves and enters "an environment that is nothing at all like the open-ended information zone that is cyberspace" in which he feels psychologically fragmented.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite news |title=Are you losing your memory thanks to the Internet? |author=Evan Ratliff |date=2008-08-14 |publisher=Salon.com |url=http://www.salon.com/2008/08/14/memory_3/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Birkerts2&gt;{{cite news |title=Reading in the Open-ended Information Zone Called Cyberspace: My Reply to Kevin Kelly |author=[[Sven Birkerts]] |date=2008-07-25 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/reading-in-the-open-ended-information-zone-called-cyberspacemy-reply-to-kevin-kelly/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics theorized about the effects of the shift from [[scarcity]] to [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]] of written material in the media as a result of the technologies introduced by the Internet. This shift was examined for its potential to lead individuals to a superficial comprehension of many subjects rather than a deep comprehension of just a few subjects. According to Shirky, an individual's ability to concentrate had been facilitated by the "relatively empty environment" which had ceased to exist when the wide availability of the web proliferated new media. Although Shirky acknowledged that the unprecedented quantity of written material available on the web might occasion a sacrifice of the cultural importance of many works, he believed that the solution was "to help make the sacrifice worth it".&lt;ref name=Shirky1/&gt; In direct contrast, [[Sven Birkerts]] argued that "some deep comprehension of our inheritance [was] essential", and called for "some consensus vision among those shapers of what our society and culture might be shaped toward", warning against allowing the commercial marketplace to dictate the future standing of traditionally important cultural works.&lt;ref name=Birkerts1&gt;{{cite news |title=A Know-Nothing’s Defense of Serious Reading &amp; Culture: A Reply to Clay Shirky |author=[[Sven Birkerts]] |date=2008-07-18 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/a-know-nothings-defense-of-serious-culture-and-reading-a-reply-to-clay-shirky/}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Carr found solace in Shirky's conceit that "new forms of expression" might emerge to suit the Internet, he considered this conceit to be one of faith rather than reason.&lt;ref name=Carr1/&gt; In a later response, Shirky continued to expound upon his theme that "technologies that make writing abundant always require new social structures to accompany them", explaining that [[Printing press#Gutenberg.27s press|Gutenberg's printing press]] led to an abundance of cheap books which were met by "a host of inventions large and small", such as the separation of fiction from non-fiction, the recognition of talents, the listing of concepts by indexes, and the practice of noting editions.&lt;ref name=Shirky2&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Abundance Should Breed Optimism: A Second Reply to Nick Carr |author=[[Clay Shirky]] |date=2008-07-21 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/why-abundance-should-breed-optimism-a-second-reply-to-nick-carr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of the web on memory retention===
As a result of the vast stores of information made accessible on the web, one hundred critics pointed to a decrease in the desire to recall certain types of information, indicating, they believed, a change in the process of recalling information, as well as the types of information that are recalled. According to Ben Worthen, a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' business technology blogger, the growing importance placed on the ability to access information instead of the capacity to recall information straight from memory would, in the long term, change the type of job skills that companies who are hiring new employees would find valuable. Due to an increased reliance on the Internet, Worthen speculated that before long "the guy who remembers every fact about a topic may not be as valuable as the guy who knows how to find all of these facts and many others".&lt;ref name=Compilation&gt;Compiled (with help from Google) by Evan R.

Drawing parallels with [[transactive memory]] — a process whereby people remember things in relationships and groups — Ratliff mused that perhaps the web was "like a spouse who is around all the time, with a particular knack for factual memory of all varieties".&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt; Far from conclusive, these ruminations left the web's impact on memory retention an open question.&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt;

===Effect of technology on the brain's neural circuitry===

In the essay, Carr introduces the discussion of the scientific support for the idea that the brain's neural circuitry can be rewired with an example in which philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is said to have been influenced by technology. According to German scholar [[Friedrich A. Kittler]] in his book ''Gramophone, Film, Typewriter'', Nietzsche's writing style became more aphoristic after he started using a typewriter. Nietzsche began using a [[Hansen Writing Ball|Malling-Hansen Writing Ball]] because of his failing eyesight which had disabled his ability to write by hand.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kittler|1999|pp=203, 206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that Nietzsche's writing style had changed for better or worse when he adopted the typewriter was disputed by several critics. Kevin Kelly and Scott Esposito each offered alternate explanations for the apparent changes.&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Esposito/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will We Let Google Make Us Smarter? |author=[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] |date=2008-06-11 |publisher=The Technium |url=http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/will_we_let_goo.php |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito believed that "the brain is so huge and amazing and enormously complex that it's far, far off base to think that a few years of Internet media or the acquisition of a typewriter can fundamentally rewire it."&lt;ref name=Esposito/&gt; In a response to Esposito's point, neuroscientist James Olds stated that recent brain research demonstrated that it was "pretty clear that the adult brain can re-wire on the fly". In ''The New York Times'' it was reported that several scientists believed that it was certainly plausible that the brain's neural circuitry may be shaped differently by regular Internet usage compared with the reading of printed works.&lt;ref name=lit-debate/&gt;

Although there was a consensus in the scientific community about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown.&lt;ref name=Olds/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merzenich/&gt; On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at [[Georgetown University]], remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain in a way that was beneficial to an individual.&lt;ref name=lit-debate/&gt; Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets [[learning disabilities]], stating that among some neuroscientists there was a belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving [[language disorder|receptive language disorders]].&lt;ref name=Olds/&gt; Olds mentioned neuroscientist [[Michael Merzenich]], who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly.&lt;ref name=Olds/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doidge|2007|pp=45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called ''[[Fast ForWord]]'' that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doidge|2007|pp=70–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feedback on ''Fast ForWord'' showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of ''Fast ForWord'' specifically designed for autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doidge|2007|pp=74–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, ''Fast ForWord''-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doidge|2007|pp=84–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HAL in ''2001: A Space Odyssey''===
In [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1968 science fiction film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', astronaut [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]] slowly disassembles the mind of an [[artificial intelligence]] named [[HAL 9000|HAL]] by sequentially unplugging its memory banks. Carr likened the emotions of despair expressed by HAL as its mind is disassembled to his own, at the time, cognitive difficulties in engaging with long texts.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; He felt as if someone was "tinkering with [his] brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory".&lt;ref name=coverstory/&gt; HAL had also been used as a metaphor for the "ultimate search engine" in a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] interview with Google co-founder [[Sergey Brin]] as noted in Carr's book ''The Big Switch'', and also Brin's [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk. Brin was comparing Google's ambitions of building an artificial intelligence to HAL, while dismissing the possibility that a bug like the one that led HAL to murder the occupants of the fictional spacecraft ''[[Discovery One]]'' could occur in a Google-based artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carr|2008|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Michaels, "[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec02/google_11-29.html The Search Engine that Could]", [[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]], November 29, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Carr observed in his essay that throughout history technological advances have often necessitated new metaphors, such as the [[mechanical clock]] engendering the simile "like clockwork" and the age of the computer engendering the simile "like computers". Carr concluded his essay with an explanation as to why he believed HAL was an appropriate metaphor for his essay's argument. He observed that HAL showed genuine emotion as his mind was disassembled while, throughout the film, the humans onboard the space station appeared to be automatons, thinking and acting as if they were following the steps of an algorithm. Carr believed that the film's prophetic message was that as individuals increasingly rely on computers for an understanding of their world their intelligence may become more machinelike than human.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=coverstory/&gt;

After the publication of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Time to Prove the Carr Thesis: Where’s the Science? |author=Kevin Kelly |date=2008-07-25 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/time-to-prove-the-carr-thesis-wheres-the-science/|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted,&lt;ref name=Carr1/&gt; he cautioned in both his essay and his book ''The Big Switch'' that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops under the influence of the Internet.&lt;ref name=Johnson1/&gt;&lt;ref name=coverstory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carr|2008|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars at [[University College London]] conducted a study titled "Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future", the results of which suggested that students' research habits tended towards [[Skimming (reading)|skimming]] and scanning rather than in-depth reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017205523/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/research/ciber/downloads/ggexecutive.pdf#page=31|title=Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future : A Ciber Briefing Paper|date=January 11, 2008|publisher=[[University College London]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017205523/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/research/ciber/downloads/ggexecutive.pdf|archivedate=October 17, 2012|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study provoked serious reflection among educators about the implications for educational instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rethinking research in the Google era: Educators ponder how the internet has changed students' reading habits |author=Meris Stansbury |date=2008-10-15 |work=eSchool News |url=http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/top-news/index.cfm?i=55598 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, new insights into the effect of Internet usage on cognition were gleaned from the results, reported in a [[press release]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=UCLA study finds that searching the Internet increases brain function |author=Rachel Champeau |date=2008-10-14 |publisher=UCLA Newsroom |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-study-finds-that-searching-64348.aspx |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a study conducted by [[UCLA]]'s Memory and Aging Research Center that had tested two groups of people between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had read books or performed assigned search tasks their brain activity had been monitored with [[functional MRI]] scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Internet search results: Increased brain activity |author=Mary Brophy Marcus |date=2008-10-15 |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-10-14-ibrain-internet-reading_N.htm |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study: Google does a brain good |author=Madison Park |date=2008-10-14 |work=[[CNN]] |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/10/14/google.brain/index.html |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reading This Will Change Your Brain |author=Jeneen Interlandi |date=2008-10-14 |work=[[Newsweek]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/163924 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Internet use 'good for the brain' |date=2008-10-14 |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7667610.stm |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book ''iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind'', co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the press release.

While one set of critics and bloggers used the UCLA study to dismiss the argument raised in Carr's essay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Makes You Smarter?

'''Kurt Walter Bachstitz''' (4 October 1882 – 1949 in [[The Hague]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[art dealer]]. He died shortly before his naturalization to the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="libmma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Bachstitz_records_b18041048.pdf|title=Bachstitz, Inc. records, 1923-1937|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Archives|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.2|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Information==

===Until Emigration 1938===
Bachstitz was born as the child of the Jewish couple Liber Jacob Bachstitz and Mathilde Markowitz. His place of birth is arguable. All contemporary sources mention the formerly German [[Breslau]] (the present-day Polish [[Wrocław]]) as his place of birth.&lt;ref&gt;NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189; Central Bureau for Genealogy, The Hague, Calmery archive, Bachstitz file&lt;/ref&gt; But Bachstitz requested for himself the Austrian village Raipoltenbach as his place of birth when he claimed at the U.S. Department of Labor for an extension of his temporary stay in 1931.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt; He studied architecture in [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Vienna]] where he finished his studies with a diploma. On the outbreak of the [[First World War]] he was called up for military service and served between 1914 and 1918 as an officer, lastly in the rank of a troop captain. He served actively in the field until 1916, when he was severely wounded.&lt;ref&gt;NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189&lt;/ref&gt; He married Elfriede Pesé (died in 1918) with whom he had two children – a son Walter Werner Michael who died in 1943 by tuberculosis in [[Switzerland]] and a daughter, Margit Martha&lt;ref&gt;File RC 1.78, estate inventory (via Ministry of Finance, inheritance tax returns)&lt;/ref&gt; who died in [[South Africa]] in 1982. On 19 December 1918 he married his second wife Elisa ("Lilly") Emma Hofer. Lilly was a [[Protestant]]. Because of her Bachstitz converted to the evangelic faith.&lt;ref&gt;NA, SNK 178, Bachstitz file, draft letter from Bogisch to Weyma, undated&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he apparently lived and traded in Munich. In his diary [[Thomas Mann]] wrote about a meeting in Bachstitz' Munich apartment, where Mann bought a work from Bachstitz. He described him quite prerogatively as a "blond-Jewish" example of an "international culture-capitalistic profiteer".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mann Tagebücher, 1918–1921, herausgegeben von Peter de Mendelssohn, Frankfurt/M. 1979, {{ISBN|978-3-10-048192-4}}, S. 143 – 145 '"Der Mensch, blond-jüdisch und elegant, Mitte dreißig, mit Monokel und fetten, weißen, manikürten Händen, in gesteppter Hausjacke und Lackhausschuhen, wunderbar als Typus des international-kultur-kapitalistischen Schiebertums."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he established an art dealership in the Hague named Kunsthandel K.W. Bachstitz (Bachstitz Gallery N.V.). Surinamestraat 11, He lived in Vienna and in [[Berlin]] and he created an internationally known company with art galleries in The Hague, [[New York City]] and Berlin. Lilly was the sister of art dealer [[Walter Hofer|Walter Andreas Hofer]] who had managed the Gallery in The Hague for a while and subsequently became an art buyer for [[Hermann Göring]].

In 1937 Bachstitz waived his Austrian citizenship. In 1938 the couple moved to The Hague.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;

===World War II===

Between the beginning of the German occupation in 1940 and 1941 Bachstitz sold a number of paintings to the "[[:de:Sonderauftrag Linz|Sondernauftrag Linz]]" that was run by [[Hitler]]'s Special Representative of the planned '[[Führermuseum]]' in Linz,&lt;ref&gt;Looted Art Commission.

In February 1941 Bachstitz officially resigned as supervisory director of the Bachstitz Gallery and his wife became the managing director. Together with his wife, he continued to provide a clandestine management role. In this way, they avoided having the Gallery placed under the forced administration for the duration of the war. According to the documents in the file concerning his successful application to become a Dutchman after the war&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA, ministerie van justitie (1915–1955), inv. No. 13533 (1646)&lt;/ref&gt; the couple provided undercover protection for Jews trying to escape the authorities.

In 1942 Bachstitz was summoned by the occupation authority (the "Wirtschaftsamt") as he had failed to register the gallery as "non-Aryan property". Proceedings were commenced against him and he was arrested by the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) in July 1943 and imprisoned in the Scheveningen prison in The Hague. Due to an intervention of Göring initiated by Bachstitz' brother-in-law Hofer, he was released from prison. He was then also exempted from wearing the Star of David. Furthermore, the couple had their marriage dissolved in September 1943 to prevent the confiscation of the gallery by the occupying authority.

Between 1942 und 1944 Bachstitz sold a number of works to the museums that were run by [[Kurt Martin]], the head of the Museums of the Upper Rhine (Alsace and Baden) under [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostart.de/Webs/DE/Datenbank/SucheMeldungDetail.html?resourceId=4348&amp;input_=4340&amp;pageLocale=de&amp;person=&amp;titelbesch=&amp;datierung=&amp;objektart=-1&amp;objektart.GROUP=1&amp;mattech=&amp;provsamml=kurt+martin&amp;institution=&amp;ort=&amp;id=&amp;type=DetailVerlust&amp;type.GROUP=1&amp;suche_typ=MeldungDetail&amp;suche_typ.HASH=01c6e21bb090266af660&amp;suchen=Suchen  10 Search Requests at www.lostart.de, latest view June 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 Bachstitz managed to obtain permission to leave the Netherlands and he emigrated to Switzerland, again with the help of Andreas Hofer.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.6|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a bribe for the exit visa Bachstitz had to hand over art to Hermann Göring, namely a painting with the Samson and Delilah motive by [[Jan Steen]],&lt;ref&gt;US-NARA, RG 260, M1946. Roll 127. Restitution Research Records. Göring, Hermann: Notes on Purchases.

===After The War - Successful and Unsuccessful Restitution Efforts===

After the war the Allies returned most of the art that the gallery had sold to German authorities to the Netherlands. The Netherlands restituted the painting by Jan Steen&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA, Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK), 2.08.42.&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected an application for the restitution of the other works. They became part of the Collection of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK). Kurt Walter Bachsitz and Lilly Bachstitz-Hofer were again registered as officially married. Kurt Walter Bachstitz died in 1949. In 1951 his widow liquidated the Bachstitz Gallery N.V. with a high deficit.&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA 2.09.16, Nederlands Beheers Instituut NBI, inv.no. 2168, Note Kesselaar NBI 16 December 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery's art library was auctioned off.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/artlibrary00inte|title=Art library of the late K.W.

In 2009 the Dutch government restituted the painting "Roman Capriccio" by [[Pietro Capelli]] from the stock of the SNK to Kurt Walter Bachstitz' grandchildren.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.18|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Restitution Committee of the Netherlands denied though a restitution claim concerning a number of other works, among them the works sold to Hitler (Sonderauftrag Linz). In view of most of these works the Committee argued that these sales had not been made under duress because Kurt Walter Bachstitz had been left "undisturbed" in 1940 and 1941.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.5|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grandchildren applied in 2013 for the re-opening of the case in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Act RC 4.138&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the Prussian Heritage Foundation restituted a Tyrolean gothic wall-mounted writing slate (c. 1500) and a large 16th-century Italian bronze mortar.&lt;ref name="preussischer-kulturbesitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preussischer-kulturbesitz.de/pressemitteilung/news/2013/07/09/berliner-kunstgewerbemuseum-restituiert-zwei-werke-an-die-erben-des-kunsthaendlers-bachstitz.html|title=Berliner Kunstgewerbemuseum restituiert zwei Werke an die Erben des Kunsthändlers Bachstitz - Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz|publisher=preussischer-kulturbesitz.de|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2582">In [[mathematics]], '''Laplace's principle''' is a basic [[theorem]] in [[large deviations theory]] which is similar to [[Varadhan's lemma]]. It gives an [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic expression]] for the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]] of exp(&amp;minus;''&amp;theta;&amp;phi;''(''x'')) over a fixed set ''A'' as ''&amp;theta;'' becomes large. Such expressions can be used, for example, in [[statistical mechanics]] to determining the limiting behaviour of a system as the temperature tends to [[absolute zero]].

==Statement of the result==

Let ''A'' be a [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue-measurable]] [[subset]] of ''d''-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; and let ''&amp;phi;''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be a [[measurable function]] with

:&lt;math&gt;\int_A e^{-\varphi(x)} \,dx &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\theta \to \infty} \frac1{\theta} \log \int_A e^{-\theta \varphi(x)} \, dx = - \mathop{\mathrm{ess \, inf}}_{x \in A} \varphi(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where ess&amp;nbsp;inf denotes the [[essential infimum]]. Heuristically, this may be read as saying that for large ''&amp;theta;'',

:&lt;math&gt;\int_A e^{-\theta \varphi(x)} \, dx \approx \exp \left(-\theta \mathop{\mathrm{ess \, inf}}_{x \in A} \varphi(x) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Application==

The Laplace principle can be applied to the family of [[probability measure]]s '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;theta;''&lt;/sub&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}_\theta (A) = \left( \int_A e^{-\theta \varphi(x)} \, dx \right) \bigg/ \left( \int_{\mathbf{R}^{d}} e^{-\theta \varphi(y)} \, dy \right)&lt;/math&gt;

to give an asymptotic expression for the probability of some event ''A'' as ''&amp;theta;'' becomes large. For example, if ''X'' is a standard [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]] on '''R''', then

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\varepsilon \downarrow 0} \varepsilon \log \mathbf{P} \big[ \sqrt{\varepsilon} X \in A \big] = - \mathop{\mathrm{ess \, inf}}_{x \in A} \frac{x^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for every measurable set ''A''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">The Swedish psychologist and university professor [[Heinz Leymann]] developed the '''LIPT''' questionnaire. LIPT stands for ''Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror''.

== Structure ==
The '''LIPT''' questionnaire lists 45 [[mobbing]] actions at the workplace. A person is regarded as being [[Workplace bullying|bullied]] if one or more of the 45 actions happen at least once per week over a period of at least one year. Alternative mobbing definitions require a shorter period of at least 3–6 months and the frequent occurrence of more than one action.

The effects of the actions on the mobbing victim are divided into five categories:

# Effects on self-expression and communication, e.g., the mobbing victim is constantly interrupted, criticized, or yelled at.
# Effects on social contacts, e.g., colleagues and coworkers are forbidden to talk with the victim.
# Effects on personal reputation, e.g., unfounded rumors about the mobbing victim are circulated.
# Effects on occupational situation and quality of life, e.g., the victim is given meaningless jobs or tasks that affect the self-esteem.
# Effects on physical health, e.g., threats of physical violence, damage to the workplace, or outright sexual harassment.

== Completeness ==
The 45 mobbing actions are derived by Leymann from 300 individual interviews in the years of 1981 to 1984. After 1984 the interviews did not find further actions and ended.

{{General geometry |0d/1d}}

The notion of '''line''' or '''straight line''' was introduced by ancient mathematicians to represent straight objects (i.e., having no [[curvature]]) with negligible width and depth. Lines are an idealization of such objects. Until the 17th century, lines were defined in this manner: "The [straight or curved] line is the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width. […] The straight line is that which is equally extended between its points."&lt;ref&gt;In (rather old) French: "La ligne est la première espece de quantité, laquelle a tant seulement une dimension à sçavoir longitude, sans aucune latitude ni profondité, &amp; n'est autre chose que le flux ou coulement du poinct, lequel […] laissera de son mouvement imaginaire quelque vestige en long, exempt de toute latitude. […] La ligne droicte est celle qui est également estenduë entre ses poincts." Pages 7 and 8 of ''Les quinze livres des éléments géométriques d'Euclide Megarien, traduits de Grec en François, &amp; augmentez de plusieurs figures &amp; demonstrations, avec la corrections des erreurs commises és autres traductions'', by Pierre Mardele, Lyon, MDCXLV (1645).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euclid]] described a line as "breadthless length" which "lies equally with respect to the points on itself"; he introduced several [[postulate]]s as basic unprovable properties from which he constructed all of geometry, which is now called [[Euclidean geometry]] to avoid confusion with other geometries which have been introduced since the end of the 19th century (such as [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], [[Projective geometry|projective]] and [[affine geometry]]).

In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in [[analytic geometry]], a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given [[linear equation]], but in a more abstract setting, such as [[incidence geometry]], a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.

When a geometry is described by a set of [[axiom]]s, the notion of a line is usually left undefined (a so-called [[primitive notion|primitive]] object). The properties of lines are then determined by the axioms which refer to them. One advantage to this approach is the flexibility it gives to users of the geometry.  Thus in [[differential geometry]] a line may be interpreted as a [[geodesic]] (shortest path between points), while in some [[Projective geometry|projective geometries]] a line is a 2-dimensional vector space (all linear combinations of two independent vectors). This flexibility also extends beyond mathematics and, for example, permits physicists to think of the path of a light ray as being a line.

==Definitions versus descriptions==
All definitions are ultimately [[Circular definition|circular]] in nature since they depend on concepts which must themselves have definitions, a dependence which cannot be continued indefinitely without returning to the starting point. To avoid this vicious circle certain concepts must be taken as [[primitive notion|primitive]] concepts; terms which are given no definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|loc=pg. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In geometry, it is frequently the case that the concept of line is taken as a primitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=pg. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those situations where a line is a defined concept, as in [[coordinate geometry]], some other fundamental ideas are taken as primitives. When the line concept is a primitive, the behaviour and properties of lines are dictated by the [[axiom]]s which they must satisfy.

In a non-axiomatic or simplified axiomatic treatment of geometry, the concept of a primitive notion may be too abstract to be dealt with. In this circumstance it is possible that a ''description'' or ''mental image'' of a primitive notion is provided to give a foundation to build the notion on which would formally be based on the (unstated) axioms. Descriptions of this type may be referred to, by some authors, as definitions in this informal style of presentation. These are not true definitions and could not be used in formal proofs of statements. The "definition" of line in [[Euclid's Elements]] falls into this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=pg. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the case where a specific geometry is being considered (for example, [[Euclidean geometry]]), there is no generally accepted agreement among authors as to what an informal description of a line should be when the subject is not being treated formally.

==In Euclidean geometry==
{{see also|Euclidean geometry}}
When geometry was first formalised by [[Euclid]] in the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', he defined a general line (straight or curved) to be "breadthless length" with a straight line being a line "which lies evenly with the points on itself".&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Appendix A, p.&amp;nbsp;291.&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions serve little purpose since they use terms which are not, themselves, defined. In fact, Euclid did not use these definitions in this work and probably included them just to make it clear to the reader what was being discussed. In modern geometry, a line is simply taken as an undefined object with properties given by [[axiom]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Part III, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; but is sometimes defined as a set of points obeying a linear relationship when some other fundamental concept is left undefined.

In an [[axiom]]atic formulation of Euclidean geometry, such as that of [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert]] (Euclid's original axioms contained various flaws which have been corrected by modern mathematicians),&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Part III, p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt; a line is stated to have certain properties which relate it to other lines and [[point (geometry)|points]]. For example, for any two distinct points, there is a unique line containing them, and any two distinct lines intersect in at most one point.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Appendix B, p.&amp;nbsp;300.&lt;/ref&gt; In two [[dimension]]s, i.e., the Euclidean [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], two lines which do not intersect are called [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]]. In higher dimensions, two lines that do not intersect are parallel if they are contained in a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], or [[Skew lines|skew]] if they are not.

Any collection of finitely many lines partitions the plane into [[convex polygon]]s (possibly unbounded); this partition is known as an [[arrangement of lines]].

===On the Cartesian plane===

Lines in a [[Cartesian plane]] or, more generally, in [[affine coordinates]], can be described algebraically by [[linear equation]]s. 

In [[Two-dimensional space|two dimensions]], the equation for non-vertical lines is often given in the ''[[slope-intercept form]]'':
:&lt;math&gt; y = mx + b &lt;/math&gt;
where:
: ''m'' is the [[slope]] or [[slope|gradient]] of the line.
: ''b'' is the [[y-intercept]] of the line.
: ''x'' is the [[independent variable]] of the function ''y'' = ''f''(''x'').

The slope of the line through points &lt;math&gt;A(x_a, y_a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(x_b, y_b)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;x_a \neq x_b&lt;/math&gt;, is given by &lt;math&gt;m = (y_b - y_a)/(x_b - x_a)&lt;/math&gt; and the equation of this line can be written &lt;math&gt;y = m (x - x_a) + y_a&lt;/math&gt;.

In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R^2}&lt;/math&gt;, every line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (including vertical lines) is described by a linear equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;L=\{(x,y)\mid ax+by=c\} &lt;/math&gt;

with fixed real [[coefficient]]s ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' such that ''a'' and ''b'' are not both zero. Using this form, vertical lines correspond to the equations with ''b'' = 0.

There are many variant ways to write the equation of a line which can all be converted from one to another by algebraic manipulation. These forms (see [[Linear equation]] for other forms) are generally named by the type of information (data) about the line that is needed to write down the form. Some of the important data of a line is its slope, [[root of a function|x-intercept]], known points on the line and y-intercept.

The equation of the line passing through two different points &lt;math&gt;P_0( x_0, y_0 )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_1(x_1, y_1)&lt;/math&gt; may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;(y - y_0)(x_1 - x_0) = (y_1 - y_0)(x - x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.
If ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', this equation may be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;y=(x-x_0)\,\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}+y_0&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;y=x\,\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}+\frac{x_1y_0-x_0y_1}{x_1-x_0}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], lines can ''not'' be described by a single linear equation, so they are frequently described by [[parametric equation]]s:
:&lt;math&gt; x = x_0 + at &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = y_0 + bt &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z = z_0 + ct &lt;/math&gt;
where:
: ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are all functions of the independent variable ''t'' which ranges over the real numbers.
: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is any point on the line.
: ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are related to the slope of the line, such that the [[vector (geometric)|vector]] (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') is parallel to the line.

They may also be described as the simultaneous solutions of two [[linear equation]]s
:&lt;math&gt; a_1x+b_1y+c_1z-d_1=0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a_2x+b_2y+c_2z-d_2=0 &lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt; (a_1,b_1,c_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (a_2,b_2,c_2)&lt;/math&gt; are not proportional (the relations &lt;math&gt; a_1=ta_2, b_1=tb_2, c_1=tc_2 &lt;/math&gt; imply &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;). This follows since in three dimensions a single linear equation typically describes a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] and a line is what is common to two distinct intersecting planes.

====In normal form====
{{main|Hesse normal form}}
The ''normal form'' (also called the ''Hesse normal form'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Plane Analytic Geometry: With Introductory Chapters on the Differential Calculus|first=Maxime|last=Bôcher|publisher=H. Holt|year=1915|authorlink=Maxime Bôcher|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYkLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513124511/https://books.google.com/books?id=bYkLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44|archivedate=2016-05-13|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; after the German mathematician [[Otto Hesse|Ludwig Otto Hesse]]), is based on the ''[[normal (geometry)|normal]] segment'' for a given line, which is defined to be the line segment drawn from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] perpendicular to the line. This segment joins the origin with the closest point on the line to the origin.  The normal form of the equation of a straight line on the plane is given by:
:: &lt;math&gt; y \sin \theta + x \cos \theta - p = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''θ'' is the angle of inclination of the normal segment (the oriented angle from the unit vector of the ''x'' axis to this segment), and ''p'' is the (positive) length of the normal segment. The normal form can be derived from the general form &lt;math&gt;ax+by=c&lt;/math&gt; by dividing all of the coefficients by

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{|c|}\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the slope-intercept and intercept forms, this form can represent any line but also requires only two finite parameters, ''θ'' and ''p'', to be specified. If ''p'' &gt; 0, then ''θ'' is uniquely defined modulo 2{{pi}}. On the other hand, if the line is through the origin (''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), one drops the {{math|''c''/{{!}}''c''{{!}}}} term to compute sin''θ'' and cos''θ'', and ''θ'' is only defined modulo {{pi}}.

===In polar coordinates===
In [[polar coordinates]] on the Euclidean plane the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is expressed as:
::&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{mr\cos\theta+b}{\sin\theta},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the slope of the line and b is the ''y''-intercept.  When ''θ'' = 0 the graph will be undefined. The equation can be rewritten to eliminate discontinuities in this manner:
::&lt;math&gt;r\sin\theta=mr\cos\theta+b.&lt;/math&gt;
In polar coordinates on the Euclidean plane, the intercept form of the equation of a line that is non-horizontal, non-vertical, and does not pass through pole may be expressed as,
::&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{1}{\frac{\cos\theta}{x_o}+\frac{\sin\theta}{y_o}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_o&lt;/math&gt; represent the ''x'' and ''y'' intercepts respectively.
The above equation is not applicable for vertical and horizontal lines because in these cases one of the intercepts does not exist. Moreover, it is not applicable on lines passing through the pole since in this case, both ''x'' and ''y'' intercepts are zero (which is not allowed here since &lt;math&gt;x_o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_o&lt;/math&gt; are denominators).
A vertical line that doesn't pass through the pole is given by the equation
::&lt;math&gt;r\cos\theta=x_o.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, a horizontal line that doesn't pass through the pole is given by the equation
::&lt;math&gt;r\sin\theta=y_o.&lt;/math&gt;
The equation of a line which passes through the pole is simply given as:
::&lt;math&gt;\tan\theta=m&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the slope of the line.

===As a vector equation===
The vector equation of the line through points A and B is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{OA} + \lambda\, \mathbf{AB}&lt;/math&gt; (where λ is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]).

If '''a''' is vector '''OA''' and '''b''' is vector '''OB''', then the equation of the line can be written: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{a} + \lambda (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})&lt;/math&gt;.

A ray starting at point ''A'' is described by limiting λ. One ray is obtained if λ ≥ 0, and the opposite ray comes from λ ≤ 0.

===In Euclidean space===

In [[three-dimensional space]], a [[first degree equation]] in the variables ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' defines a plane, so two such equations, provided the planes they give rise to are not parallel, define a line which is the intersection of the planes. More generally, in ''n''-dimensional space ''n''-1 first-degree equations in the ''n'' [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinate]] variables define a line under suitable conditions.

In more general [[Euclidean space]], '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (and analogously in every other [[affine space]]), the line ''L'' passing through two different points ''a'' and ''b'' (considered as vectors) is the subset
:&lt;math&gt;L = \{(1-t)\,a+t\,b\mid t\in\mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt;
The direction of the line is from ''a'' (''t'' = 0) to ''b'' (''t'' = 1), or in other words, in the direction of the vector ''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''. Different choices of ''a'' and ''b'' can yield the same line.

====Collinear points====
{{Main|Collinearity}}
Three points are said to be ''collinear'' if they lie on the same line. Three points ''[[general position|usually]]'' determine a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], but in the case of three collinear points this does ''not'' happen.

In [[affine coordinates]], in ''n''-dimensional space the points ''X''=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), ''Y''=(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''Z''=(''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are collinear if the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; \dots &amp; x_n  \\
 1 &amp; y_1 &amp; y_2 &amp; \dots &amp; y_n \\
 1 &amp; z_1 &amp; z_2 &amp; \dots &amp; z_n
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
has a [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] less than 3. In particular, for three points in the plane (''n'' = 2), the above matrix is square and the points are collinear if and only if its [[determinant]] is zero.

Equivalently for three points in a plane, the points are collinear if and only if the slope between one pair of points equals the slope between any other pair of points (in which case the slope between the remaining pair of points will equal the other slopes). By extension, ''k'' points in a plane are collinear if and only if  any (''k''–1) pairs of points have the same pairwise slopes.

In [[Euclidean geometry]], the [[Euclidean distance]] ''d''(''a'',''b'') between two points ''a'' and ''b'' may be used to express the collinearity between three points by:&lt;ref&gt;[[Alessandro Padoa]], Un nouveau système de définitions pour la géométrie euclidienne, [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], 1900&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]], [[The Principles of Mathematics]], p.410&lt;/ref&gt;
:The points ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are collinear if and only if ''d''(''x'',''a'') = ''d''(''c'',''a'') and ''d''(''x'',''b'') = ''d''(''c'',''b'') implies ''x''=''c''.
However, there are other notions of distance (such as the [[Manhattan distance]]) for which this property is not true.

In the geometries where the concept of a line is a [[primitive notion]], as may be the case in some [[synthetic geometry|synthetic geometries]], other methods of determining collinearity are needed.

=== Types of lines ===
In a sense,&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the [[collineation group]] acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on the set of lines.&lt;/ref&gt; all lines in Euclidean geometry are equal, in that, without coordinates, one can not tell them apart from one another. However, lines may play special roles with respect to other objects in the geometry and be divided into types according to that relationship. For instance, with respect to a [[Conic section|conic]] (a [[circle]], [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], or [[hyperbola]]), lines can be:
* [[tangent line]]s, which touch the conic at a single point;
* [[secant line]]s, which intersect the conic at two points and pass through its interior;
* exterior lines, which do not meet the conic at any point of the Euclidean plane; or
*a  [[Directrix of a conic section|directrix]], whose distance from a point helps to establish whether the point is on the conic.

In the context of determining [[parallel (geometry)|parallelism]] in Euclidean geometry, a [[transversal (geometry)|transversal]] is a line that intersects two other lines that may or not be parallel to each other.

For more general [[algebraic curve]]s, lines could also be:
* ''i''-secant lines, meeting the curve in ''i'' points counted without multiplicity, or
* [[asymptote]]s, which a curve approaches arbitrarily closely without touching it.
With respect to [[Euclidean triangle|triangle]]s we have:
* the [[Euler line]],
* the [[Simson line]]s, and
* [[central line (geometry)|central lines]].

For a [[convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] with at most two parallel sides, the [[Newton line]] is the line that connects the midpoints of the two [[diagonal]]s.

For a [[hexagon]] with vertices lying on a conic we have the [[Pascal line]] and, in the special case where the conic is a pair of lines, we have the [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|Pappus line]].

[[Parallel (geometry)|Parallel lines]] are lines in the same plane that never cross. [[Line-line intersection|Intersecting lines]] share a single point in common. Coincidental lines coincide with each other&amp;mdash;every point that is on either one of them is also on the other.

[[Perpendicular lines]] are lines that intersect at [[right angle]]s.

In [[three-dimensional space]], [[skew lines]] are lines that are not in the same plane and thus do not intersect each other.

==In projective geometry==
{{further|Projective geometry}}
In many models of [[projective geometry]], the representation of a line rarely conforms to the notion of the "straight curve" as it is visualised in Euclidean geometry.  In [[elliptic geometry]] we see a typical example of this.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Part III, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spherical representation of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by [[great circle]]s of a sphere with diametrically opposite points identified. In a different model of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by Euclidean [[plane (geometry)|planes]] passing through the origin. Even though these representations are visually distinct, they satisfy all the properties (such as, two points determining a unique line) that make them suitable representations for lines in this geometry.

==Extensions==

=== Ray ===&lt;!-- This section is linked (older copy) from: [[Tangent]], [[Ray (mathematics)]],  --&gt;
Given a line and any point ''A'' on it, we may consider ''A'' as decomposing this line into two parts.
Each such part is called a '''ray''' (or '''half-line''') and the point ''A'' is called its ''initial point''. The point A is considered to be a member of the ray.&lt;ref&gt;On occasion we may consider a ray without its initial point. Such rays are called ''open'' rays, in contrast to the typical ray which would be said to be ''closed''.&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, a ray consists of those points on a line passing through ''A'' and proceeding indefinitely, starting at ''A'', in one direction only along the line.  However, in order to use this concept of a ray in proofs a more precise definition is required.

Given distinct points ''A'' and ''B'', they determine a unique ray with initial point ''A''.  As two points define a unique line, this ray consists of all the points between ''A'' and ''B'' (including ''A'' and ''B'') and all the points ''C'' on the line through ''A'' and ''B'' such that ''B'' is between ''A'' and ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wylie, Jr.|1964|loc=pg. 59, Definition 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is, at times, also expressed as the set of all points ''C'' such that ''A'' is not between ''B'' and ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=pg. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A point ''D'', on the line determined by ''A'' and ''B'' but not in the ray with initial point ''A'' determined by ''B'', will determine another ray with initial point ''A''. With respect to the ''AB'' ray, the ''AD'' ray is called the ''opposite ray''.
[[File:Ray (A, B, C).svg|500px|center|Ray]]

Thus, we would say that two different points, ''A'' and ''B'', define a line and a decomposition of this line into the [[disjoint union]] of an open segment {{open-open|''A'', ''B''}} and two rays, ''BC'' and ''AD'' (the point ''D'' is not drawn in the diagram, but is to the left of ''A'' on the line ''AB''). These are not opposite rays since they have different initial points.

In Euclidean geometry two rays with a common endpoint form an [[angle]].

The definition of a ray depends upon the notion of betweenness for points on a line. It follows that rays exist only for geometries for which this notion exists, typically [[Euclidean geometry]] or [[affine geometry]] over an [[ordered field]]. On the other hand, rays do not exist in [[projective geometry]] nor in a geometry over a non-ordered field, like the [[complex number]]s or any [[finite field]].

In [[topology]], a ray in a space ''X'' is a continuous embedding '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → ''X''. It is used to define the important concept of [[end (topology)|end]] of the space.

===Line segment===
{{main|Line segment}}

A [[line segment]] is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points and contains every point on the line between its end points.  Depending on how the line segment is defined, either of the two end points may or may not be part of the line segment.  Two or more line segments may have some of the same relationships as lines, such as being parallel, intersecting, or skew, but unlike lines they may be none of these, if they are [[coplanar]] and either do not intersect or are [[collinearity|collinear]].

===Geodesics===
{{main|Geodesics}}

The "shortness" and "straightness" of a line, interpreted as the property that the [[distance]] along the line between any two of its points is minimized (see [[triangle inequality]]), can be generalized and leads to the concept of [[geodesic]]s in [[metric space]]s.

[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|Legal systems of the world]]
The contemporary '''legal systems of the world''' are generally based on one of four basic [[systems]]: [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[common law]], [[statutory law]], [[religious law]] or combinations of these. However, the legal system of each country is shaped by its unique history and so incorporates individual variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://saint-claire.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Legal-Systems-of-the-World.pdf|title=Legal Systems of the World|last=|first=|date= |website= |access-date=|publisher = Saint: Security Sector Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The science that studies Law at the level of legal systems is called [[Comparative Law]].

Both ''civil'' (also known as ''Roman'') and ''common'' law systems can be considered the most widespread in the world: civil law because it is the most widespread by landmass, and common law because it is employed by the greatest number of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Principles of International Insolvency''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;lpg=PT454&amp;ots=D-khdgPbR4&amp;dq=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;pg=PT454#v=onepage&amp;q=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;f=false|date=2007|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Maps of World Financial Law:Law and practice of international finance series''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Maps_of_World_Financial_Law.html?id=Z5vKGAAACAAJ|date=2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''English Common Law is the most widespread legal system in the world''|url=https://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/061108.pdf|date=November 2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}
[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Shamash]] (the [[Babylonia]]n sun god) hands King [[Hammurabi]] a [[Code of Hammurabi|code of law]]]]

The central source of law that is recognized as authoritative is [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in a constitution or [[statute]] passed by [[legislature]], to amend a code.
While the concept of codification dates back to the [[Code of Hammurabi]] in [[Babylon]] ca. 1790 BC, civil law systems derive from the [[Roman Empire]] and, more particularly, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' issued by the Emperor [[Justinian]] ca. AD 529. This was an extensive reform of the law in the [[Byzantine Empire]], bringing it together into codified documents. Civil law was also partly influenced by [[religious law]]s such as [[Canon law]] and [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Badr&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 [Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977]|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi /&gt; Civil law today, in theory, is interpreted rather than developed or made by judges. Only [[legislature|legislative]] enactments (rather than legal [[precedent]]s, as in common law) are considered legally binding.

Scholars of [[comparative law]] and economists promoting the [[legal origins theory]] usually subdivide civil law into four distinct groups:
* '''French civil law''': in France, the [[Benelux]] countries, Italy, Romania, Spain and former colonies of those countries;
* '''[[Law of Germany#Civil law|German civil law]]''': in Germany, Austria, Russia, Switzerland, Estonia, Latvia,  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo*, Macedonia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, [[Portugal]] and [[Portuguese Empire|its former colonies]], Turkey, and East Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (Republic of China);
* '''[[Scandinavian law|Scandinavian civil law]]''': in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. As historically integrated in the Scandinavian cultural sphere, Finland and Iceland also inherited the system.
* '''[[Chinese law]]''': a mixture of civil law and [[socialist law]] in use in the People's Republic of China.

However, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:
*'''Napoleonic to Germanistic influence ([[Italian law|Italian civil law]]) '''
The [[Italy|Italian]] civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing germanistic elements due to the geopolitical alliances of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.teoriaestoriadeldirittoprivato.com/index.php?com=statics&amp;option=index&amp;cID=132 |title = Towards a Civil Code: The Italian Experience|last = Triggiano|first = Annalisa|website = Teoria e Storia del Diritto Privato}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian approach has been imitated by other countries including the [[Netherlands]] (1992), [[Argentina]] (2014), [[Brazil]] (2002) and [[Portugal]] (1966). Most of them have innovations introduced  by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the [[civil code|civil]] and [[Commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol16/iss2/8/ |title = On the Legal Method of the Uniform Commercial Code|journal = Law and Contemporary Problems|volume = 16|number = 2|first= Mitchell|last= Franklin|date = Spring 1951|pages = 330-343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Germanistic to Napoleonic influence ([[Swiss law|Swiss civil law]])'''
The [[Swiss civil code]] is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code.  The civil code of the [[Republic of Turkey]] is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s presidency as part of the government's progressive reforms and secularization.

A comprehensive list of countries that base their legal system on a [[Codification (law)|codified]] civil law follows:

|The Spanish legal tradition had a great influence on the [[Civil Code of Argentina]], basically a work of the Argentine [[jurist]] [[Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield]], who dedicated five years of his life on this task. The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1871. Beyond the influence of the Spanish legal tradition, the Argentinian Civil Code was also inspired by the Draft of the Brazilian Civil Code, the [[wikt:Draft|Draft]] of the Spanish Civil Code of 1851, the [[Napoleonic code]] and the [[Civil Code (Chile)|Chilean Civil Code]]. The sources of this Civil Code also include various theoretical legal works, mainly of the great French jurists of the 19th century. It was the first Civil Law that consciously adopted as its cornerstone the distinction between i. rights from obligations and ii. real property rights, thus distancing itself from the French model.

The Argentinian Civil Code was also in effect in Paraguay, as per a [[Paraguayan]] law of 1880, until the new Civil Code went in force in 1987.

In Argentina, this 1871 Civil Code remained in force until August 2015, when it was replaced by the new ''Código Civil y Comercial de la Nación''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm |title=Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas Públicas - Argentina |publisher=InfoLEG |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial |title=Comienza a regir el nuevo Código Civil y Comercial |publisher=Jornadaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{flagicon|Chile}} [[Law of Chile|Chile]]
|Based on the Chilean Civil Law inspired by the Napoleonic Civil Law. The Spanish legal tradition exercised an especially great influence on the civil code of Chile. On its turn, the Chilean civil code influenced to a large degree the drafting of the civil codes of other [[Latin-American]] states. For instance, the codes of Ecuador (1861) and Colombia (1873) constituted faithful reproductions of the Chilean code, but for very few exceptions. The compiler of the [[Civil Code of Chile]], Venezuelan [[Andrés Bello]], worked for its completion for almost 30 years, using elements, of the Spanish law on the one hand, and of other [[Western law]]s, especially of the French one, on the other. Indeed, it is noted that he consulted and used all of the codes that had been issued till then, starting from the era of [[Justinian]].

The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1857. The influence of the [[Napoleonic code]] and the Law of Castile of the Spanish colonial period (especially the ''[[Siete Partidas]]''), is great; it is observed however that ''e.g.'' in many provisions of [[property law|property]] or [[contract law]], the solutions of the French ''code civil'' were put aside in favor of pure [[Roman law]] or Castilian law.

The present Civil Code went into effect 1 January 1888, and was influenced by the [[Napoleonic Code]] and the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 (from its 1851 draft version).
|-
|{{flagicon|Croatia}} [[Law of Croatia|Croatia]]
|Based on the Germanic Civil Law. Croatian Law system is largely influenced by German and  Austrian law systems. It is significantly influenced by the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Civil Code of the Austrian Empire]] from 1811, known in Croatia as ''"General Civil Law"'' ''("Opći građanski zakon")''. OGZ was in force from 1853&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=45220 |title=Opći građanski zakonik &amp;#124; Hrvatska enciklopedija |publisher=Enciklopedija.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1946. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-controlled [[puppet state]] that was established in 1941 during [[World War II]], used the OGZ as a basis for the 1943 ''"Base of the Civil Code for the Independent State of Croatia"'' ''("Osnova građanskoga zakona za Nezavisnu Državu Hrvatsku")''. After the War, Croatia become a member of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Federation]] which enacted in 1946 the ''"Law on immediate voiding of regulations passed before April 6, 1941 and during the enemy occupation"'' ''("Zakon o nevaženju pravnih propisa donesenih prije 6. travnja 1941. i za vrijeme neprijateljske okupacije")''. By this law OGZ was declared invalid as a whole, but implementation of some of its legal rules was approved. During the post-War era, the Croatian legal system become influenced by elements of the [[socialist law]]. Croatian civil law was pushed aside, and it took norms of public law and legal regulation of the [[Socialization (economics)|social ownership]]. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on June 25, 1991, the previous legal system was used as a base for writing new laws.  ''"The Law on Obligations"'' ''("Zakon o obveznim odnosima")'' was enacted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Croatian legal history in the European context, Dalibor Čepulo, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Croatia as a [[European union]] member state implements elements of the [[Acquis communautaire|EU acquis]] into its legal system.

|{{flagicon|Guatemala}} [[Law of Guatemala|Guatemala]]
|Based on Napoleonic civil law. Guatemala has had three Civil Codes: the first one from 1877, a new one introduced in 1933, and the one currently in force, which was passed in 1963. This Civil Code has suffered some reforms throughout the years, as well as a few derogations relating to areas which have subsequently been regulated by newer laws, such as the Code of Commerce and the Law of the National Registry of Persons. In general, it follows the tradition of the Roman-French system of civil codification.

Regarding the theory of 'sources of law' in the Guatemalan legal system, the 'Ley del Organismo Judicial' recognizes 'the law' as the main legal source (in the sense of legislative texts), although it also establishes 'jurisprudence' as a complementary source. Although jurisprudence technically refers to judicial decisions in general, in practice it tends to be confused and identified with the concept of 'legal doctrine', which is a qualified series of identical resolutions in similar cases pronounced by higher courts (the Constitutional Court acting as a 'Tribunal de [[Amparo (law)|Amparo]]', and the Supreme Court acting as a 'Tribunal de Casación') whose theses become binding for lower courts.

==Common law==
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King John of England signs [[Magna Carta]]]]
Common law and [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]] (legal concept) are systems of law whose sources are the decisions in cases by judges. In addition, every system will have a legislature that passes new laws and statutes. The relationships between statutes and judicial decisions can be complex. In some jurisdictions, such statutes may overrule judicial decisions or codify the topic covered by several contradictory or ambiguous decisions. In some jurisdictions, judicial decisions may decide whether the jurisdiction's constitution allowed a particular statute or statutory provision to be made or what meaning is contained within the statutory provisions. Statutes were allowed to be made by the government. Common law developed in England, influenced by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] law and to a much lesser extent by the [[Norman conquest of England]], which introduced legal concepts from [[Norman law]], which, in turn, had its origins in [[Salic law]]. Common law was later inherited by the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and almost every former colony of the [[British Empire]] has adopted it ([[Malta]] being an exception). The doctrine of ''stare decisis'', also known as ''case law'' or ''[[precedent]] by courts'', is the major difference to codified civil law systems.

Common law is currently in practice in [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], most of the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] ([[English law|England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]]), [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Law of India|India]] (excluding [[Goa civil code|Goa]]),{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed because the Supreme Court of India's decisions override many lower courts|date=June 2014}} [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Law of Canada|Canada]] (excluding [[Quebec law|Quebec]]), [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], the [[Law of the United States|United States]] (on a state level excluding [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]]), and many other places. In addition to these countries, several others have adapted the common law system into a mixed system. For example, Nigeria operates largely on a common law system, but incorporates religious law.

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] takes an approach mixing civil law (based on the treaties) with an attachment to the importance of case law. One of the most fundamental documents to shape common law is the English [[Magna Carta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html|accessdate=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which placed limits on the power of the English Kings. It served as a kind of medieval bill of rights for the aristocracy and the judiciary who developed the law.

==Religious law==
{{main|Religious law}}

Religious law refers to the notion of a religious system or document being used as a legal source, though the methodology used varies. For example, the use of Jewish and [[Halakha]] for public law has a static and unalterable quality, precluding amendment through legislative acts of government or development through judicial precedent; Christian [[Canon law]] is more similar to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in its use of [[code (law)|codes]]; and Islamic [[Sharia]] law (and [[Fiqh]] jurisprudence) is based on legal [[precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]''), and is thus considered similar to [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice|first=Mahmoud A.|last=El-Gamal|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-86414-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main kinds of religious law are [[Sharia]] in Islam, [[Halakha]] in Judaism, and [[canon law]] in some Christian groups. In some cases these are intended purely as individual moral guidance, whereas in other cases they are intended and may be used as the basis for a country's legal system. The latter was particularly common during the [[Middle Ages]].

[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Aleppo Codex: 10th century Hebrew Bible with Masoretic pointing]]
The Halakha is followed by [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|conservative]] Jews in both ecclesiastical and civil relations. No country is fully governed by Halakha, but two Jewish people may decide, because of personal belief, to have a dispute heard by a Jewish court, and be bound by its rulings.

The Islamic legal system of [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) and [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) is the most widely used [[religious law]], and one of the three most common legal systems in the world alongside common law and civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on both [[divine law]], derived from the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]], and the rulings of [[Ulema]] (jurists), who used the methods of ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus), ''[[Qiyas]]'' (analogical deduction), ''[[Ijtihad]]'' (research) and ''[[Urf]]'' (common practice) to derive ''[[Fatwā]]'' (legal opinions). An Ulema was required to qualify for an ''[[Ijazah]]'' ([[Law degree|legal]] [[doctorate]]) at a ''[[Madrasa]]'' ([[law school]]/[[college]]) before they could issue ''Fatwā''.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]|doi=10.2307/604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], classical Islamic law may have had an [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|influence]] on the development of common law&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several civil law institutions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharia law governs a number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, though most countries use Sharia law only as a supplement to national law. It can relate to all aspects of civil law, including property rights, contracts or public law.

===Civil law and canon law===
{{main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
[[Canon law]] is not divine law, properly speaking, because it is not found in revelation. Instead, it is seen as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. [[Canon law]] regulates the internal ordering of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]]. Canon law is amended and adapted by the legislative authority of the church, such as [[episcopal conference|councils of bishops]], individual bishops for their respective sees, the [[Pope]] for the entire Catholic Church, and the British Parliament for the [[Church of England]].

|The most prominent example of a hybrid legal system is the [[India]]n legal system. India follows a mixture of civil, common law and customary or religious law. Separate personal law codes apply to Muslims, Christians, and [[Hindus]]. Decisions by the [[Supreme Court of India]] and [[High Court]]s are binding on the lower courts. Further, most of the laws are statutory and it also has a [[Constitution of India|constitution]] which signifies the Civil nature of law in India. Ethiopia also follows this system.

Despite the usefulness of different classifications, every legal system has its own individual identity. Below are groups of legal systems, categorised by their [[geography]]. Click the "expand" buttons on the right for the lists of countries.

Below are listed various examples of words and phrases that have been identified as [[shibboleth]]s,  a word or custom whose variations in pronunciation or style can be used to differentiate members of ingroups from those of outgroups.
{{Dynamic list}}

==Shibboleths used in war and persecution==

===Dutch–French===
* ''Schild en vriend'': On 18 May 1302, the people of [[Bruges]] killed the [[France|French]] occupiers of the city during a nocturnal surprise attack. According to a famous legend, they stormed into the houses where they knew the tenants were forced to board and lodge French troops serving as city guards, roused every male person from his bed and forced them to repeat the challenge ''schild en vriend'' (shield and friend). The [[Flemings]] pronounced {{Wikt-lang|nl|schild}} with a separate "s" {{IPA|/s/}} and "ch" {{IPA|/x/}}". Flemings would pronounce {{Wikt-lang|nl|vriend}} with a [[Dutch phonology#Consonants|voiced ''v'']] whereas French would render those as a [[French phonology#ref 2|voiceless ''f'']].
Every Frenchman who failed the test was stabbed on the spot, still in his nightgown. Because the signal for the uprising was the [[matins]] bells of the city's churches and monasteries, this became known as the [[Bruges Matins (history)|Bruges Matins]] or ''Brugse Metten''. Like the name of the massacre, the story may have been influenced by the Sicilian uprising mentioned below.
* The problem with this legend is that in Medieval manuscripts of that time, a shield is referred to as "''skilde''" as in Norse and Norse-influenced English words. Therefore, it is sometimes said that the words must have been "'s gilden vriend" meaning "friend of the guilds." The combination of the 's and the g in "'s gilden" would be pronounced {{IPA|/sx/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=iO_qLu8JossC |pages=22–3 |title=The rough guide to Bruges &amp; Ghent |author=Phil Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian/Sicilian–French===
* ''Ciciri'' ([[chickpea]]s): This was used by native [[Sicily|Sicilians]] to ferret out [[Anjou|Angevin]] [[France|French]] soldiers in the late 13th century during the [[Sicilian Vespers]], the uprising which freed the island from [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] rule. Both the Italian soft c {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and the Italian r, were (and are still) difficult for the French to pronounce as that sequence of sounds seldom appears in French; also, in French, words are primarily stressed on the final syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Language testing: the social dimension | last=McNamara | first=Timothy |author2=Carsten Roever  | year=2006 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-1-4051-5543-4 | page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frisian–Dutch===
[[File:Nl-Schibbolet-fries.oga|thumb|right|''Bûter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries'']]
* ''Bûter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries'' ({{audio|Nl-Schibbolet-fries.oga|example}}) means "Butter, rye bread and green cheese, whoever cannot say that is not a genuine Frisian" was used by the [[Frisians|Frisian]] [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] during a [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian rebellion]] (1515–1523). Ships whose crew could not pronounce this properly were usually plundered and soldiers who could not were beheaded by Donia himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunseradiel.nl/index.php?simaction=content&amp;pagid=289&amp;mediumid=1|publisher=Gemeente Wûnseradiel|title=Greate Pier fan Wûnseradiel|language=Western Frisian|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castilian Spanish–Latin-American Spanish===
* During the [[Latin American wars of independence]], the name {{lang|es|[[Francisco]]}} was used by [[Colombia]]n rebels to tell locals from Spaniards. Whoever pronounced it as {{IPA|/fɾanˈθisko/}} (as in European Spanish) as opposed to {{IPA|/fɾanˈsisko/}} would have been thrown into the [[Magdalena River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congresosdelalengua.es/rosario/ponencias/internacional/avila_r.htm|title=III Congreso Internacional de la Lengua Española. Paneles y ponencias. Raúl Ávila|author=Centro Virtual Cervantes|work=congresosdelalengua.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English–Dutch===
* The [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 (also Tyler’s Rebellion, or the Great Rising) was used by the merchants of London in an attempt to get a competitive edge in the trade with the Low Countries by reducing the number of competitors. A massacre among the [[Flemish people|Flemings]] in London&amp;nbsp;– not just the Flemish merchants&amp;nbsp;– ensued. "And many fflemmynges loste hir heedes at that tyme and namely they that koude nat say Breede and Chese, but Case and Brode."&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicles of London''; Oxford University Press, 1905; ed. C. L. Kingsford; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish–Russian===
* {{lang|fi|Yksi}}: [[Finnish language|Finnish]] for "[[one]]", used by the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]] to separate Russians from Finns in the [[Finnish Civil War]] during the invasion of [[Tampere]]. Many of the Russians caught had changed to civilian clothing, so suspected people were rounded up, even from hospitals, and asked to say ''{{lang|fi|yksi}}.'' If the prisoner pronounced it {{IPA-fi|juksi|}}, mistaking the front vowel 'y' for an [[iotation|iotated]] 'u', he was considered a Russian foreign fighter and was shot on the spot. Any Slav or Balt, Communist or not, was killed, including some members of the White Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Heikki Ylikangas, Tie Tampereelle, ref. at http://www.uta.fi/koskivoimaa/valta/1918-40/venalai1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|fi|Höyryjyrä}}: [[Finnish language|Finnish]] for "[[steam roller]]", used by the Finnish Army in the [[Second World War]]. This word is almost impossible to pronounce for anyone not skilled in Finnish, withe frontal 'ö' and 'y' and rolled 'r' {{IPA-fi|höyryjyrä|}}.&lt;ref&gt;https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0ibbolet&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish–French and Haitian Creole===
* [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] conducted a brutal massacre of undocumented [[Haiti]]an settlers along the Dominican-Haitian border. The action is known as the [[Parsley Massacre]]. Suspects not fluent in Spanish either did not know or could not properly pronounce the Spanish word 'perejil' (parsley). The pronunciation of the word by Haitian citizens tended to be with a [[Alveolar trill|trilled r]] and without the 'l' at the end of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/shibboleth.html|title=Untitled Document|work=upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azeri–Armenian===
* The [[Azerbaijani Language|Azeri]] word for Hazelnut, ''[[Azerbaijani alphabet|fındıq]]'', which Armenians typically pronounce with a {{IPA|[p]}} instead of an {{IPA|[f]}}.&lt;ref&gt;
Shahmuratian. Sumgait Tragedy, Interview with Vanya Bazyan, p. 159; also: Vahagn Martirosyan, interview (Alexandre Billette, Hervé Dez (2014) - Transkraïna, online, retrieved 2014.02.13, http://transkraina.webdoc.4th-line.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polish–German===
* ''Soczewica, koło, miele, młyn'' ([[Old Polish]] pronunciation: {{IPA|[ˈs̪ɔt͡ʃɛvit͡sʲa ˈkɔɫɔ ˈmʲɛlʲɛ ˈmɫɪn̪]}}), meaning "lentil, wheel, grinds [verb], mill": In 1312, the Polish Prince [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Ladislaus the Elbow-high]] quelled the [[Rebellion of wójt Albert]] in [[Kraków]], populated mostly by [[Silesians|Silesian]], German and Czech citizens. Anyone over the age of 7 who could not pronounce these [[Polish language|Polish]] words was put to death, ejected from the city or had his property confiscated. 'Ł' (then pronounced as a [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant]], aka [[dark l]]) and dental [s̪] are both unlikely to be pronounced properly by Germans since they cannot make out the difference from their own sounds [l] and [s]. (The former was approximated by Germans as ''l'', and has evolved now into a sound similar to English ''w'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historia.focus.pl/polska/soczewica-kolo-miele-mlyn-z-albertem-1091|title=Soczewica, Koło, Miele Młyn z Albertem|last=Węgłowski|first=Adam|date=21 June 2012|publisher=[[Focus (Polish magazine)|Focus.pl]]|language=Polish|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture, religion and language-specific shibboleths===
* English-speaking [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel in Europe, during the [[Second World War]], frequently made use of passwords in which [[labio-velar approximant]]s (w-sounds) were prominent, as these are unusual in spoken [[German language|German]], and the letter w is normally pronounced "v" by native speakers of German. For instance:
** following [[Operation Overlord|D-Day]] (1944) US forces used the challenge-response "Flash" – "Thunder" – "''Welcome''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambrose|first=Stephen E.|title=D-Day|year=1994|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|isbn=0-684-80137-X|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli forces]] during the [[1948 Palestine war]] used passwords chosen to contain [[voiceless bilabial stop]]s (p-sounds), which are not found in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and which native speakers of Arabic often replace with a [[voiced bilabial stop]] (b-sounds).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* In the [[Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975, Christian [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] soldiers targeted suspected [[Palestine (region)|Palestinians]] at checkpoints by asking how they pronounced the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for "tomato", which is pronounced "banadoura" in [[Lebanese Arabic]] and "bandoura" in [[Palestinian Arabic]]. If they said the former, they were let through; if they said the latter, they were shot on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Stuart|title=Teach Yourself - The Middle East Since 1945|publisher=Hodder Education|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist]] group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]]'s [[Westgate shopping mall shooting|2013 shooting and hostage siege attack]] on the [[Westgate (Kenyan shopping mall)|Westgate shopping mall]] in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], the attackers asked for [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]'s mother [[Aminah bint Wahb]]'s name and the ''[[shahada]]'' as religious shibboleths to determine Muslims and non-Muslims. Muslims were freed, while non-Muslims were targeted. An Indian man who could not name Aminah was shot dead.&lt;ref name="Westgate BBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nairobi siege: What we know |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24189116 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=22 September 2013 |quote=An Indian man who was standing next to him was asked for the name of the Prophet's mother and when he was unable to answer, he was shot dead, the witness told him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Westgate NZH"&gt;{{cite news |title=Explosions inside mall as stand-off nears end |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11129542 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=26 September 2013 |agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mostly [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christian]] [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Filipino ground troops]] fighting in the 2013 [[Zamboanga City crisis]] used the [[Lord's Prayer]] as a way to identify [[Moro insurgency in the Philippines|Moro insurgents]]. Those who could not recite the Lord's Prayer in any [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]], including [[Philippine English|English]], were immediately suspected of being part of the armed [[Moro National Liberation Front]] and detained, leading to deeper inter-religious divisions as all non-Christians, including non-combatant Muslims, would also fail the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism|title=Peace groups warn of empty victory in Zambo siege|url=http://pcij.org/blog/2013/09/27/peace-groups-warn-of-empty-victory-in-zambo-siege|website=The PCIJ Blog|publisher=The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism|accessdate=31 March 2015|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English shibboleths for native speakers or local natives==

{{See also|Regional accents of English|Regional vocabularies of American English}}
* ''[[Fish and chips]]'': The accents of [[Australia]]ns and [[New Zealand]]ers seem very similar, and the term ''fish and chips'' is sometimes evoked to illustrate a major difference between the two. In [[New Zealand English#Vowels|New Zealand pronunciation]] short ''i'' is a central vowel, {{IPA|[ɘ]}}. This vowel sound is sometimes caricatured as "fush and chups" by Australians. The [[Australian English phonology|Australian pronunciation]] has the front vowel {{IPA|[ɪ]}} (which is more common in most [[varieties of English]]) which, due to an overall [[vowel shift]] in New Zealand, sounds like "feesh and cheeps" to the ears of a New Zealander,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/985 |title=Identification of New Zealand English and Australian English based on stereotypical accent markers |author=Ilka Ludwig |year=2007|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=New Zealand English: phonology |author=Laurie Bauer, Paul Warren |isbn=978-3-11-019637-5 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; sounding like an instance of the "[[Fill–feel merger]]".
* Pronunciation of letters of the [[alphabet]]:
** ''[[H]]'': in [[Northern Ireland]] pronounced 'aitch' by [[Protestant]]s, 'haitch' by [[Catholic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnFz_ZIfBgsC&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;ots=D4eCjJRrFG&amp;dq='aitch'%20by%20Protestants%2C%20'haitch'%20by%20Catholics%2C&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q='aitch'%20by%20Protestants,%20'haitch'%20by%20Catholics,&amp;f=false|title=Cities on the Margin, on the Margin of Cities: Representations of Urban Space in Contemporary Irish and British Fiction|author=Philippe Laplace|publisher=Presses Univ.

** ''[[Z]]'': in North America pronounced ''zee'' in the [[United States]]; typically ''zed'' in the rest of the world. Known in [[American history]] and [[popular culture]] for distinguishing American males who fled to Canada from the US to escape the [[draft dodger|military draft]] in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcUOAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=american+draft+dodgers+in+canada+zed&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=draft+dodgers|title=''Think''|publisher=International Business Machines Corporation|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbgPAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=american+draft+dodgers+in+canada+zed&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=zed|title=''Science Digest''|year=1958|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian pronunciation was featured in the [[Molson]] [[Molson Canadian|Canadian]] ''[[I Am Canadian]]'' advertisement in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adage.com/article/news/blame-canada-molson-brilliant-rant-states/15731/ Blame Canada and Molson for brilliant 'Rant' at States], ''[[Advertising Age]]'', May 08, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Highland Dress]], for anyone who has served in a [[Scottish Regiment]] or played in a [[pipe band]], or whenever said by a [[Scot]], if ‘[[Tartan|plaid]]’ ''should'' be used to refer to [[tartan]] cloth, it ''could'' be pronounced: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|æ|d}} (to rhyme with ‘had’). NB: This usage, as a synonym for ‘tartan’, is generally only ever found in North America.&lt;ref&gt;English Language &amp; Usage:"[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/217485/is-there-any-difference-between-plaid-and-tartan Is there any difference between 'plaid' and 'tartan'?]"&lt;/ref&gt; More often, however, when referring to the cape-like garment, in its various forms, worn over the left shoulder as part of the traditional or formal [[Scottish people|Scottish]] dress, the pronunciation is: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|eɪ|d}} (to rhyme with ‘made’); though the [[OED]] accepts both pronunciations in this usage. To further stress the difference in pronunciation of the garment versus the cloth, the garment has an alternative spelling ‘plaide’, though rarely used. Thus: belted-plaid, drummer's plaid, evening-plaid, fly-plaid, full-plaid, piper's plaid, et al., are pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|eɪ|d}} by those who have worn, or are familiar, with the same. [[Etymology]]: ''plaide'' ([[Scots Language|Scots]]) via [[Scottish Gaelic]] meaning ‘blanket’ or ‘cloak’, (albeit usually made of tartan; most often the same tartan as the wearer's [[kilt]] or [[trews]]).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/plaid plaid]", Collins English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Place-name pronunciations===
{{Main|List of names in English with counterintuitive pronunciations}}

====In Australia====
* [[Cairns]], Queensland: [[Australian English phonology|Pronounced]] {{IPA|[ˈkæːnz]}} or {{IPA|[ˈkeːnz]}} by Australians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition|year=2005|publisher=The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd.|location=Melbourne|isbn=1-876429-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛər|n|z}} by speakers of non-Australian dialects. Although {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛər|n|z}} is standard in the case of the English word 'cairn' referring to a stack of stones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merriam-Webster Dictionary|year=2004|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=Springfield|isbn=087779930X}}&lt;/ref&gt; most Australians consider it erroneous when referring to the city.

====In Canada====
* [[Newfoundland]]: Some outsiders pronounce the island almost as if it were three separate words, {{IPAc-en|nj|uː|ˈ|f|aʊ|n|d|l|ə|n|d}} {{respell|new|FOWND|lənd}} rather than the local pronunciation, {{IPAc-en|ˌ|nj|uː|f|ən|ˈ|l|æ|n|d}} {{respell|NEW|fən|LAND}}, rhyming with "understand".&lt;ref&gt;Story, George Morley, et. al, ''Dictionary of Newfoundland English'' (Toronto, University of Toronto Press:1982), "Newfoundland", p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], Saskatchewan: Pronounced {{IPAc-en|r|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|n|ə}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggregi01&amp;word=Regina&amp;text= |title=Regina |author=Merriam-Webster Audio File}}&lt;/ref&gt; rhyming with "[[vagina]]". Familiarity with the standard pronunciation may in some cases distinguish Canadians from Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cjme.com/story/you-heard-what-because-jon-ryan-went-university-regina/531688 |title=You heard what? Because Jon Ryan went to University of Regina |date=February 2, 2015 |newspaper=[[CJME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]: Vancouver is often pronounced by locals as {{IPAc-en|v|æ|ŋ|ˈ|k|uː|v|ər}} {{respell|vang|KOO|vər}}, with a velar {{IPA|/ŋ/}} instead of {{IPA|/n/}}.
* [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]: Toronto is often pronounced by Torontonians without the second {{IPA|/t/}} and sometimes with the first syllable elided.
* [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]]: The majority of local Calgarians will pronounce the name of their city with two syllables {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|l|ɡ|ɹ|i}}, while tourists will use three {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|l|ɡ|ə|ɹ|i}}.

====In Malaysia====
* [[Genting Highlands]]: [[Malaysians]] pronounce it as {{IPA-ms|ˈɡentiŋ|}} (with a hard {{IPA|/ɡ/}}), whereas in English tends to be {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|t|ɪ|ŋ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/business/local-business/casino-shuffles-the-pack-with-revamp-1-6275895|title=Casino shuffles the pack with revamp|work=blackpoolgazette.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the United Kingdom====
* [[Magdalen Street]], [[Oxford]]: The street is pronounced as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|ɡ|d|əl|ɪ|n}} {{respell|MAG|dəl|in}} while the name of the [[Magdalen College, Oxford|College]] is always {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔː|d|l|ɪ|n}} {{respell|MAWD|lin}}. This inconsistency prevents non-locals from the correct pronunciations, regardless of their default way of pronouncing.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Daniel, eds. P.Roach, J.Setter and J.Esling ''Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary'', 18th Edition, 2011, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Magdalen College]] and Magdalen Bridge, [[Cambridge]]: In both cases, locals pronounce Madgalen as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔː|d|l|ɪ|n}} {{respell|MAWD|lin}}.


====In the United States====
* [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|''Houston'' Street]], [[New York City]]: Locals pronounce the first syllable identically with "house" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aʊ|s|t|ən}}), while most visitors will employ the same pronunciation as in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|s|t|ən}}). Houston Street is actually a corruption of the original name of Houstoun Street, named after [[Continental Congress]] Delegate [[William Houstoun (lawyer)|William Houstoun]], who pronounced his name in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New York Bookshelf; An Oddly Named Street, A Dark Night, a Gamy Club|date=Feb 8, 2004|work=The New York Times|page=CY12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nevada]]: Nevadans say {{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|v|æ|d|ə}} {{respell|nih|VAD|ə}}. Visitors often say {{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|v|ɑː|d|ə}} {{respell|nih|VAH|də}}. Additionally, there are a number of smaller towns in other states bearing the name Nevada pronounced yet another way, such as {{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|v|eɪ|d|ə}} {{respell|nih|VAY|də}} in [[Nevada, Missouri]] and [[Nevada County, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=794|title=Nevada County - Encyclopedia of Arkansas|work=encyclopediaofarkansas.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly, in [[Colorado]]: Locals tend to render the state name as {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|r|æ|d|oʊ}}, whereas visitors are more likely to use {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|d|oʊ}}.
* The US state of Oregon is home to a county, city, river, bay, state forest, museum, Native American tribe, and dairy processing company called [[Tillamook (disambiguation)|Tillamook]]. Residents pronounce it as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|l|ə|m|ʊ|k}}, while nonresidents often mistakenly say {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|l|ə|m|uː|k}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Connelly |first=Dolly |date=Mar 1, 1970 |title=Mush!...And Then Some: A Tour Of The Great Northwest |journal=Los Angeles Times West Magazine |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Los Angeles Times |pages=20–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Portland, Oregon]]'s Couch Street is {{IPAc-en|k|uː|tʃ}}, rhyming with "pooch," unlike the identically-spelled sofa synonym pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|aʊ|tʃ}}.&lt;ref name="greiner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greiner |first=Tony |last2=Bridgewater |first2=Rachel |title=Portland: An eclectic introduction |journal=College &amp; Research Libraries News |volume=75 |issue=8 |date=2014 |pages=422–426}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Boise, Idaho]]: The city's name is commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ|z|i}} {{respell|BOY|zee}}. However, locals actually pronounce it as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ|s|i}} {{respell|BOY|see}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/idaho-pronunciation-guide/Content?oid=1749831|title=Idaho Pronunciation Guide – Say it like a local|date=Aug 25, 2010|last=Green|first=Julia|publisher=''[[Boise Weekly]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Buena Vista, Colorado]]. Unlike other places bearing this name in the United States (typical pronunciations include {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|w|ɛ|n|ə|_|ˈ|v|ɪ|s|t|ə|,_|ˌ|b|w|eɪ|-|,_|-|ˈ|v|iː|s|-}} {{respell|BWE|nə|_|VIS|tə|,_|BWAY|-,_-|VEES|-}}) the town in Colorado is called {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|j|uː|n|ə|_|ˈ|v|ɪ|s|t|ə}} {{respell|BEW|nə|_|VIS|tə}} by locals.
* [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]: The city's name is commonly pronounced by non-locals as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|n|s|i}} {{respell|KWIN|see}}. However, [[South Shore (Massachusetts)|locals]] will pronounce it {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|n|z|i}} {{respell|KWIN|zee}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quincyma.gov/Utilities/faq.cfm#15 |title=Quincy, MA - 404 |publisher=Quincyma.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Likewise, [[Hull, Massachusetts]] would seem to be pronounced {{IPAc-en|h|ʌ|l}}, as in the front of a ship, but locals will invariably render it {{IPAc-en|h|ɔː|l}} homophonous to "hall", as in a corridor.
* [[Louisville, Kentucky]]: The name is pronounced by locals as {{IPAc-en|audio=Loouhvull.ogg|ˈ|l|uː|ə|v|əl}} {{respell|LOO|ə|vəl}}. However, non-locals will usually use {{IPAc-en|audio=Looeevil.ogg|ˈ|l|uː|iː|v|ɪ|l}} {{respell|LOO|ee|vil}}.
* [[Miami, Oklahoma]]: Locals from northeastern Oklahoma pronounce the name as {{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ˈ|æ|m|ə}} {{respell|my|AM|ə}}, while others pronounce the name like the city in Florida, {{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ˈ|æ|m|i}} {{respell|my|AM|ee}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigorrin.org/miami_kids.htm |title=Facts for Kids: Miami Indians (Miamis) |publisher=Bigorrin.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hicksville-ohio.com/History/history2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamination.com/faq.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Appalachia]]: Residents of the region pronounce it as {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|æ|tʃ|ə}}, with short vowels, but non-locals rather pronounce it as {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|tʃ|ə|,_|-|ʃ|ə}}. The name was originally Native American, but came to English via Spanish as the local pronunciation is based on the Spanish equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Walls, David (2006). "Appalachia." ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press), pp. 1006–07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged'' (Springfield, Mass.: Merriam-Webster, 1993), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pierre: South Dakotans refer to the state capital as a one-syllable word ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈpɪər/]]) rhyming with “beer”not like the French two-syllable name is typically pronounced [[Help:IPA/French|[ˈpjɛʁ]]]).
*[[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Nachitoches, Louisiana]]: Locals will recognize the city and parish name as being pronounced nack-a-dish while people unfamiliar with the name may pronounce it as nat-shi-toe-shez or some variation of that.

===Place-name terms===
* Locals refer to [[San Francisco]] as "SF", or simply "the City" within the context of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Tourists may sometimes say "San Fran" or "Frisco".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Don-t-Call-It-Frisco-3043060.php|title=Don't Call It Frisco|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/3271-don-t-call-it-frisco-the-history-of-san-francisco-s-nicknames|title=Don’t Call It Frisco: The History of San Francisco’s Nicknames|work=The Bold Italic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Southern California]], locals generally use the article "the" preceding the number of a [[freeway]]. [[Northern California]] locals generally do not use "the" before a numerical freeway name. For example, Southern Californians usually refer to [[U.S. Route 101|Highway 101]] as "The 101," whereas Northern Californians will refer to it as simply "101."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanspeech.dukejournals.org/content/76/2/221.full.pdf?sid=dc6c8b23-3d37-4ebd-b28b-30ac80f124d2|title="The" Freeway in Southern California|work=American Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mr-roadshow/ci_29015047/roadshow-debate-highway-names-roars|title=Roadshow: The Debate on Highway Names Roars On|work=The San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, people in the rest of the United States more often precede a freeway's route number with its highway classification, as in "U.S. 101" for a Federal highway or "Interstate 5" or "I-5" for an interstate highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/71459/why-southern-californians-say-freeway-numbers|title=Why Southern Californians Say "The" Before Freeway Numbers|work=Mental Floss}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long-time Democratic residents of [[Washington, D.C.]], will refer to [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Reagan National Airport]] as simply as "National," while Republicans and visitors to the area are more likely to call it by the name of the former president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2015/03/31/national-reagan-dca-17-years-later-locals-still-cant-agree-on-the-name-of-the-airport-in-question/|title=National? Reagan? DCA? 17 years later, locals still can’t agree on the name of the airport in question.|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Additionally, many long-time residents of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area will refer to it as "The DMV" (the ''' District, Maryland, ''' and '''Virginia ''', specifically referencing the Fairfax, Alexandria, and Arlington Counties of Virginia; the city itself; and the Montgomery and Prince George's Counties of Maryland). This frequently leads to outsiders confusing it with the local [[Department of Motor Vehicles]], or "Delmarva", the portmanteau of [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], and [[Virginia]] (referring to the combined areas of the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland]], [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]], and [[Delaware]]), both of which can also be abbreviated to "DMV".

{{Masculism sidebar |movements}}
'''Meninism''' is term used which has been used to describe various groups, including the [[men's rights movement]], and [[Pro-feminism|male feminists]]. The term is sometimes used sincerely to challenge social issues facing men, and sometimes satirically or semi-satirically as a word-play on [[feminism]]. Members of these groups are known as '''meninists'''.

==History==
The term meninism was used in the early 2000s to describe [[Pro-feminism|male feminists]] who opposed [[sexism]] and supported women's right for equality in [[society]], [[politics]] and at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MENININST: MEN SUPPORTING THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/links/men.htm|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=feminist.com|date=8 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kay|first1=Tom Zatar|title=Out if the Box|date=2003|publisher=Xlibris|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=1-4134-1757-4|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldrick-Jones|first1=Amanda|title=Men who Believe in Feminism|date=2002|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-96822-7|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next decade, the term was used on [[social media]] to make jokes which mocked and criticised [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zand|first1=Benjamin|title=#BBCtrending: Feminism v Meninism|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25462758|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daubney|first1=Martin|title=Will 2015 be the year of meninism?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11308455/Will-2015-be-the-year-of-meninism.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[BBC]] reported that the hashtag #MeninistTwitter was being used on [[Twitter]], first to share jokes about [[feminism]], but later to share more serious difficulties facing modern men.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; In 2015, Nolan Feeney of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that those who used meninist hashtags "generally fall in two camps: people who use the term to call out ways they believe they’ve been victimised by feminism, and people who make fun of the first group for not understanding what feminism means in the first place".&lt;ref name=time /&gt; Antifeminism is also associated with terms like Meninism

==Meaning==
The term has partially evolved into a movement promoting awareness of the issues which the movement perceives as affecting men, opposition to the perceived oppression men face in the 21st century, opposition to the way some perceive that men are victimised by modern-day feminism, and occasionally violence against men.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feeney|first1=Nolan|title=This Is What Happens When You Show Off Your 'Meninist' T-Shirt|url=http://time.com/3673614/meninist-meninism-t-shirts-hashtag/|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=TIME|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women also identify as meninists.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=metro&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Alison|title=Women disillusioned with feminism are turning to meninism|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/25/women-disillusioned-with-feminism-are-turning-to-meninism-5265103/|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Metro|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Daubney]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', some meninists have used the term to discuss serious issues affecting men, such as [[domestic violence against men]]; [[fathers' rights]] and [[divorce]] issues; and disproportionate male prison sentences, [[suicide]] rates, and rates of homelessness.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; According to Radhika Sanghani of ''The Telegraph'', the hashtag is most commonly used on Twitter to mock feminism, but has also been used as a way to draw attention to men's issues, similar to "The Red Pill" forum on [[Reddit]]. Sanghani says that the movement's reaction to feminism is based more on the label than feminism's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanghani|first1=Radhika|title=Feminists v Meninists: The labels we could all afford to ditch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11380282/Feminists-v-Meninists-The-labels-we-could-all-afford-ditch.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abigail James writing for ''Catholic Online'' said that while meninism raises legitimate issues which should be taken seriously, its heart is based on a misinterpretation of the meaning of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Abigail|title=Feminism takes a sharp hit as men fight back with Meninism|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/family/story.php?id=58102|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Catholic Online|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antifeminism is also associated with the Meninist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lin|first=Jie Liang|title=Antifeminism Online: MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way)|date=2017|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv1xxrxw.9|work=Digital Environments|pages=77–96|series=Ethnographic Perspectives Across Global Online and Offline Spaces|publisher=Transcript Verlag|isbn=9783837634976|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

Mintified, an India-based media website, started the #BlameOneNotAll hashtag to discourage generalisations of men. According to Victoria Richards of ''[[The Independent]]'', the campaign was  part of the meninist movement. The campaign received backlash for shifting focus away from the victims of rape and implying that basic decency should be rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richards|first1=Victoria|title='Don't blame all men for rape' campaign backfires spectacularly|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/blameonenotall-the-meninist-rape-campaign-that-spectacularly-backfired-10278297.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=The Independent|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion piece for ''[[The Economic Times]]'' Shephali Bhatt criticised the use of the movement and [[International Men's Day]] to sell deodorant, saying "...for an initiative to become a social phenomena, it needs to be rooted in truth. And the truth is that [men are] a sufficiently privileged gender, comparatively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhatt|first1=Shephali|title=How meninism campaigns can explain gender inequality against men better|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-11-26/news/56490134_1_international-men-harsh-agarwal-feminism|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=Economic Times|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hashtags have also been used for T-shirts and similar, with self-portraits of people wearing the clothes widely shared on social media. Several outlets reported that the clothes and images were widely mocked, and often Photoshopped sarcastically.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;&lt;ref name=metro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warren|first1=Rossalyn|title=People Are Wearing Anti-Feminist "Meninist" T-Shirts And The Internet Has Responded Amusingly|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/people-are-wearing-anti-feminist-meninist-t-shirts-and-the-i|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=[[Buzzfeed]]|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Lucia|title=#Meninist T-Shirts Got a Photoshop Makeover Thanks to Twitter, and It's Glorious|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/59653-meninist-t-shirts-got-a-photoshop-makeover-thanks-to-twitter-and-its-glorious|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=[[Bustle.com]]|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5056">'''Moral intellectualism''' or '''ethical intellectualism''' is a view in [[meta-ethics]] according to which genuine moral knowledge must take the form of arriving at discursive moral judgements about what one should do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/phin.12025/asset/phin12025.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hsxv5rqy&amp;s=bcd843388a95a5c721e8ce1ddeb892786991b6d2 Against Moral Intellectualism]&lt;/ref&gt;
One way of understanding this is that if we know what is right, we will do what is right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philpapers.org/rec/BALTMI-4 The Moral Intellectualism of Plato's Socrates The Case of the Hippias Minor]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can also be interpreted as the understanding that a rationally consistent worldview and theoretical way of life, as exemplified by Socrates, is superior to the life devoted to a moral (but merely practical) life. 

==Ancient moral intellectualism&lt;!--'Socratic intellectualism' redirects here--&gt;==
{{Socrates}}
In the view of [[Socrates]] (469–399 BC), intellectualism allows that “one will do what is right or best just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best”; that [[virtue]] is a purely intellectual matter, since virtue and [[knowledge]] are cerebral relatives, which a person accrues and improves with dedication to [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} (Definition and note on Socrates)&lt;/ref&gt; So defined, '''Socratic intellectualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; became a key philosophic doctrine of [[Stoicism]]. The Stoics are well known for their teaching that the good is to be identified with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/ Ancient Ethical Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent, problematic consequences of this view are “Socratic paradoxes”, such as the view that there is no [[weakness of will]] — that no one knowingly does, or seeks to do, evil (moral wrong); that anyone who does, or seeks to do, moral wrong does so involuntarily; and that virtue is knowledge, that there are not many virtues, but that all virtues are one. The following are among the so-called Socratic Paradoxes:&lt;ref&gt;p. 14, [[Terence Irwin]], ''The Development of Ethics'', vol. 1, Oxford University Press 2007; p. 147, Gerasimos Santas, "The Socratic Paradoxes", ''Philosophical Review'' 73 (1964), pp. 147–64.&lt;/ref&gt;
* No one desires evil.
* No one errs or does wrong willingly or knowingly.
* Virtue—all virtue—is knowledge.
* Virtue is sufficient for happiness.

Contemporary philosophers dispute that Socrates’s conceptions of knowing truth, and of ethical conduct, can be equated with modern, post–[[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] conceptions of knowledge and of rational intellectualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No one errs willingly: the meaning of socratic intellectualism | author=Heda Segvic | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470996218.ch10/summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Typically, such care of the self-involved specific [[ascetic]] exercises meant to ensure that not only was knowledge of truth memorized, but learned, and then integrated to the self, in the course of transforming oneself into a [[Value (ethics)|good]] person. Therefore, to understand truth meant “intellectual knowledge” requiring one’s integration to the (universal) truth, and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentically]] living it in one’s speech, heart, and conduct. Achieving that difficult task required continual care of the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the [[Rhetoric|Classical]]-era rhetorical device of [[parrhesia]]: “to speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking”; and, by extension, practice the [[Morality|moral]] obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.&lt;ref&gt;Gros, Frederic (ed.)(2005) ''Michel Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject'', Lectures at the College de France 1981–1982. Picador: New York&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient, Socratic moral philosophic perspective contradicts the contemporary understanding of truth and knowledge as [[Reason|rational]] undertakings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21027">The '''New World Information and Communication Order''' ('''NWICO''' or '''NWIO'''), also known as the '''MacBride Commission''', is a term that was coined in a debate over [[mass media|media]] representations of the [[developing country|developing world]] in [[UNESCO]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The term was widely used by the [[MacBride Commission]], a UNESCO panel chaired by [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Sean MacBride]], which was charged with creation of a set of recommendations to make global media representation more equitable. The MacBride Commission produced a report titled [[MacBride report|"Many Voices, One World"]], which outlined the main philosophical points of the New World Information Communication Order.

==History==
The fundamental issues of imbalances in global communication had been discussed for some time. The American media scholar [[Wilbur Schramm]] noted in 1964 that the flow of news among nations is thin, that much attention is given to developed countries and little to less-developed ones, that important events are ignored and reality is distorted.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur L. Schramm, ''Mass Media and National Development: The Role of Information in the Developing Countries'', [[Stanford University Press]], 1964, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; From a more radical perspective, [[Herbert Schiller]] observed in 1969 that developing countries had little meaningful input into decisions about radio frequency allocations for [[satellites]] at a key meeting in Geneva in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert I Schiller, ''Mass Communications and American Empire'', [[Beacon Press]], 1969, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Schiller pointed out that many satellites had military applications. [[Intelsat]] which was set up for international co-operation in satellite communication, was also dominated by the United States. In the 1970s these and other issues were taken up by the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and debated within the [[United Nations]] and UNESCO.

&lt;blockquote&gt;NWICO grew out of the [[New International Economic Order]] of 1974. From 1976-1978, the New World Information and Communication Order was generally called the shorter '''New World Information Order''' or the '''New International Information Order'''.

The start of this discussion is the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) as associated with the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) starting from the early 1970s.

Mass media concerns began with the meeting of non-aligned nations in [[Algiers]], 1973; again in [[Tunis]] 1976, and later in 1976 at the [[New Delhi]] Ministerial Conference of [[Non-Aligned Nations]].

The 'new order' plan was textually formulated by Tunisia's Information Minister [[Mustapha Masmoudi]]. Masmoudi submitted working paper No. 31 to the MacBride Commission. These proposals of 1978 were titled the 'Mass Media Declaration.' The MacBride Commission at the time was a 16-member body created by UNESCO to study communication issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/nwico.html The Grenada Revolution Online: NWICO - New World Information and Communication Order]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among those involved in the movement were the Latin American [[Institute for the Study of Transnationals]] (ILET). One of its co-founders, [[Juan Somavia]] was a member of the MacBride Commission. Another important voice was [[Mustapha Masmoudi]], the Information Minister for [[Tunisia]]. In a Canadian radio program in 1983, Tom McPhail describes how the issues were pressed within UNESCO in the mid-1970s when the United States withheld funding to punish the organization for excluding Israel from a regional group of UNESCO. Some [[OPEC]] countries and a few socialist countries made up the amount of money and were able to get senior positions within UNESCO. NWICO issues were then advanced at an important meeting in 1976 held in [[Costa Rica]].

The only woman member of the Commission was [[Betty Zimmerman]], representing Canada because of the illness of [[Marshall McLuhan]], who died in 1980. The movement was kept alive through the 1980s by meetings of the MacBride Round Table on Communication, even though by then the leadership of UNESCO distanced itself from its ideas.

The UNESCO [[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions|Convention on Cultural Diversity]] of 2005 puts into effect some of the goals of NWICO, especially with regard to the unbalanced global flow of mass media. However, this convention was not supported by the United States, and it does not appear to be as robust as [[World Trade Organization]] agreements that support global trade in mass media and information.

==Issues==
A wide range of issues were raised as part of NWICO discussions. Some of these involved long-standing issues of media coverage of the developing world and unbalanced flows of media influence. But other issues involved new technologies with important military and commercial uses. The developing world was likely to be marginalized by [[satellite]] and [[computer]] technologies. The issues included:

* News reporting on the developing world that reflects the priorities of [[news agencies]] in [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]]. Reporting of natural disasters and military coups rather than the fundamental realities. At the time four major news agencies controlled over 80% of [[global news flow]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* An unbalanced flow of mass media from the developed world (especially the United States) to the underdeveloped countries. Everyone watches American movies and television shows.
* [[Advertising agencies]] in the developed world have indirect but significant effects on mass media in the developing countries. Some observers also judged the messages of these ads to be inappropriate for the Third World.
* An unfair division of the [[radio spectrum]]. A small number of developed countries controlled almost 90% of the radio spectrum. Much of this was for military use.
* There were similar concerns about the allocation of the [[geostationary orbit]] (parking spots in space) for satellites. At the time only a small number of developed countries had satellites and it was not possible for developing countries to be allocated a space that they might need ten years later. This might mean eventually getting a space that was more difficult and more expensive to operate.
* Satellite broadcasting of television signals into [[Third World]] countries without prior permission was widely perceived as a threat to national sovereignty. The UN voted in the early 1970s against such broadcasts.
* Use of satellites to collect information on crops and natural resources in the Third World at a time when most developing countries lacked the capacity to analyze this data.
* At the time most mainframe computers were located in the United States and there were concerns about the location of databases (such as airline reservations) and the difficulty of developing countries catching up with the US lead in computers.
* The protection of journalists from violence was raised as an issue for discussion. For example, journalists were targeted by various military dictatorships in Latin America in the 1970s. As part of NWICO debates there were suggestions for study on how to protect journalists and even to discipline journalists who broke "generally recognized ethical standards". However, the MacBride Commission specifically came out against the idea of licensing journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dV-oviiw7dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Many Voices, One World''], Paris 1984, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response of the United States==
The United States was hostile to NWICO. According to some analysts, the United States saw these issues simply as barriers to the free flow of communication and to the interests of American media corporations. It disagreed with the MacBride report at points where it questioned the role of the private sector in communications. It viewed the NWICO as dangerous to freedom of the press by ultimately putting an organization run by governments at the head of controlling global media, potentially allowing for censorship on a large scale. From another perspective, the MacBride Commission recommendations requiring the licensing of journalists amounted to prior censorship and ran directly counter to basic US law on the freedom of expression.

There were also accusations of corruption at the highest level of [[UNESCO]] leadership in Paris.  The US eventually withdrew its membership in UNESCO (as did the United Kingdom and Singapore) at the end of 1984. The matter was complicated by debates within UNESCO about [[Israel]]'s archaeological work in the city of [[Jerusalem]], and about the [[Apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The United States rejoined in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaljournalist.org/stories/2003/01/01/unesco-welcomes-back-usa/ |title=UNESCO welcomes back U.S.A. |author=Henrikas Yushkiavitshus |date=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124062617/http://globaljournalist.org/stories/2003/01/01/unesco-welcomes-back-usa/ |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
The debate on the NWICO that started in the 1970s reflected criticism about non-equitable [[access to information]] and [[media imperialism]]. The NWICO saw the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] back out of UNESCO until 1997 for the UK and 2003 for the US. In 1990-2000, a switch occurred globally, carried by the Internet that contributed to bring more equity to the available content. This was supported by the extension of media powers to [[Developing country|developing countries]] such as [[Mexico]], [[Korea]], [[Kenya]] and [[Nigeria]]; by the adoption of protectionist measures in regards to the free market by western countries like [[Canada]] and [[France]]; and with the rise of satellite broadcasting as a transnational means for non-western countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Expressing the changes.

=== Windhoek Declaration ===
{{Main|Windhoek Declaration}}
This tendency has reached its peak in the 1991 [[Windhoek Declaration]]. The Windhoek Declaration for the Development of a Free, Independent and Pluralistic Press is a statement of [[Freedom of the press|press freedom]] principles by African newspaper journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Why the World Became concerned with Journalistic Safety", The Assault on Journalism|last=Berger|first=Guy|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Assault-on-Journalism.pdf|pages=33-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; African diplomats in [[Paris]] (UNESCO), [[Geneva]] ([[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]]) and [[New York City|New York]]’s (UN General Assembly) commitment has been crucial to the success of the Windhoek process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media in Africa: 20 years after the Windhoek Declaration on Press Freedom|last=Berger|first=Guy|publisher=Windhoek: Media Institute of Southern Africa|year=2011|isbn=|location=http://genderlinks.org.za/wp-content/uploads/imported/articles/attachments/14393_mia.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO endorsed the Windhoek Declaration and United Nations General Assembly recognized the 3 May, date of the Declaration, as “[[World Press Freedom Day]]”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Windhoek Declaration has had other significant impacts in the media field. UNESCO adopted the Windhoek framework concerning [[media development]], characterizing it by freedom, [[Media pluralism|pluralism]] and [[Media Independence|independence]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B3254AA_0_403&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Windhoek Declaration is implemented through the Media Development Indicators (MDIs) framework&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media Development Indicators: Framework for Assessing Media Development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2008|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0016/001631/163102e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] Intergovernmental Council in 2006&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defining Indicators of Media Development.

Resonating with the NWICO, the MDIs help assessing the priority areas for media development that are the promotion of freedom of expression and media pluralism, the development of [[community media]] and of human resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) ===
{{Main|International Programme for the Development of Communication}}
As a result of the “[[MacBride report|Many Voices, One World]]” 1980 report UNESCO’s General Conference launched the International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) the same year in [[Belgrade]]. The Programme was adopted by 39 Member States and aimed at strengthening the development of [[mass media]] in developing countries. Its mandate since 2003 is “... to contribute to [[sustainable development]], democracy and [[good governance]] by fostering universal access to and distribution of information and knowledge by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries and countries in transition in the field of electronic media and the printed press.”&lt;ref&gt;Amendments to the Statutes of the International Programme for The Development of Communication (IPDC) Resolution 43/32, adopted on the Report of Commission V at the 18th Plenary Meeting, on 15 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Safety of journalists ===
{{Main|Safety of journalists}}
Threats on [[Journalist|journalists]] are one of the major issues blocking media development. Since 2008, UNESCO Member States submit information on the status of the judicial inquiries conducted on each of the journalists killings condemned by the Organization. This information is included in a public report submitted every two years to the IPDC Council by the Director-General and is basis to the Programme's follow-up to killings of journalists.&lt;ref&gt;The IPDC web page: https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives

The UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issues of Impunity: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Technological developments ===
{{Main|Access to information}}
Technological developments have direct effects on access to information and on [[privacy]]. Access to information is the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively. According to [[Guy Berger]], “access to digital means of communication, even within the limits established by platform owners, is unprecedented”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. There has been a signiﬁcant increase in access to the Internet, which reached just over three billion users in 2014, amounting to about 42 per cent of the world’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, issues remain such as the [[digital divide]], the gender divide and the security argument. A digital divide is an economic and social inequality with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).&lt;ref&gt;FALLING THROUGH THE NET:   A Survey of the "Have Nots" in Rural and Urban America: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html

National Telecommunications and Information Administration: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; Social barriers such as [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities between men and women in navigating the tools used for access to information: it’s the gender divide.&lt;ref&gt;Anja Kovac (2017), ‘Chupke, Chupke’: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India, Available at: https://genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/

Website: https://genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in/&lt;/ref&gt; With the evolution of the digital age, application of [[freedom of speech]] and its corollaries (freedom of information, access to information) becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human rights and encryption|last=Schultz|first=Wolfgang|last2=van Hoboken|first2=Joris|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002465/246527e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The increasing access to and reliance on [[digital media]] to receive and produce information have increased the possibilities for States and private sector companies to [[Tracking system|track]] individuals’ behaviors, opinions and networks. States have increasingly adopted laws and policies to legalize monitoring of communication, justifying these practices with the need to defend their own citizens and national interests. In parts of [[Europe]], new [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism laws]] have enabled a greater degree of [[Surveillance|government surveillance]] and an increase in the ability of intelligence authorities to access citizens’ data. While legality is a precondition for legitimate limitations of [[human rights]], the issue is also whether a given law is aligned to other criteria for justification such as necessity, proportionality and legitimate purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The third unit vector  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{w}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular momentum]] vector and is directed orthogonal to the orbital plane such that:&lt;ref&gt;2011 Mathematics Clinic. (2011). ''Optimal Collison Avoidance of Operational Spacecraft in Near-Real Time.'' Denver, Colorado: University of Colorado, Denver.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seefelder, W. (2002). ''Lunar Transfer Orbits utilizing Solar Perturbations and Ballistic Capture.'' Munich, Germany. pg 12&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{w}}  =  \mathbf{\hat{p}} \times \mathbf{\hat{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

And, since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{w}}&lt;/math&gt; is the angular momentum vector, it may also be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{w}} = \frac{\mathbf{h}}{\|\mathbf{h}\|}&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''h''' is the specific relative angular momentum.

The position and velocity vectors can be determined for any location of the orbit. The position vector, '''r''', can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \|r\| \cos \theta \mathbf{\hat{p}} + \|r\| \sin \theta \mathbf{\hat{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the true anomaly and the radius ''r'' may be calculated from the [[orbit equation]].

The velocity vector, '''v''', is found by taking the [[time derivative]] of the position vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{\dot{r}} = (\dot{r} \cos \theta - r \dot{\theta} \sin \theta)\mathbf{\hat{p}} + (\dot{r} \sin \theta + r \dot{\theta} \cos \theta)\mathbf{\hat{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

A derivation from the orbit equation can be made to show that:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{r} = \frac{\mu}{h}e \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational parameter]] of the focus, ''h'' is the specific relative angular momentum of the orbital body, ''e'' is the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the orbit, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the true anomaly. &lt;math&gt;\dot{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the radial component of the velocity vector (pointing inward toward the focus) and  &lt;math&gt;r \dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the tangential component of the velocity vector. By substituting the equations for &lt;math&gt;\dot{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r \dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; into the velocity vector equation and simplifying, the final form of the velocity vector equation is obtained as:&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, H. D. (2005). ''[[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]].'' Burlington, MA: Elsevier Buttersorth-Heinemann. pp 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \frac{\mu}{h}[-\sin \theta \mathbf{\hat{p}} + (e + \cos \theta)\mathbf{\hat{q}}]&lt;/math&gt;

==Transformation from equatorial coordinate system==
The perifocal coordinate system can also be defined using the orbital parameters [[inclination]] (''i''), [[right ascension of the ascending node]] (&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[argument of periapsis|argument of perigee]] (&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;). The following equations transform an orbit from the [[equatorial coordinate system]] to the perifocal coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, K. (1999). ''Orbits in Space.''&lt;/ref&gt;  

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
p_i &amp; = \cos \Omega \cos \omega - \sin \Omega \cos i \sin \omega \\
p_j &amp; = \sin \Omega \cos \omega + \cos \Omega \cos i \sin \omega \\
p_k &amp; = \sin i \sin \omega \\[8pt]
q_i &amp; = -\cos \Omega \sin \omega - \sin \Omega \cos i \cos \omega \\
q_j &amp; = -\sin \Omega \sin \omega + \cos \Omega \cos i \cos \omega \\
q_k &amp; = \sin i \cos \omega \\[8pt]
w_i &amp; = \sin i \sin \Omega \\
w_j &amp; = -\sin i \cos \Omega \\
w_k &amp; = \cos i
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{\hat{p}} &amp; = p_i\mathbf{\hat{I}} + p_j\mathbf{\hat{J}} + p_k\mathbf{\hat{K}} \\
\mathbf{\hat{q}} &amp; = q_i\mathbf{\hat{I}} + q_j\mathbf{\hat{J}} + q_k\mathbf{\hat{K}} \\
\mathbf{\hat{w}} &amp; = w_i\mathbf{\hat{I}} + w_j\mathbf{\hat{J}} + w_k\mathbf{\hat{K}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{I}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{J}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{K}}&lt;/math&gt; are the unit vectors of the equatorial coordinate system.

==Applications==
Perifocal reference frames are most commonly used with elliptical orbits for the reason that the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{p}}&lt;/math&gt; coordinate must be aligned with the [[eccentricity vector]]. [[Circular orbit|Circular orbits]], having no eccentricity, give no means by which to orient the coordinate system about the focus.&lt;ref&gt;Karr, C. L., &amp; Freeman, L. M. (1999). ''Industrial Applications of Genetic Algorithms.'' Danvers, MA. pg 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The perifocal coordinate system may also be used as an [[inertial frame of reference]] because the axes do not rotate relative to the fixed stars. This allows the inertia of any orbital bodies within this frame of reference to be calculated. This is useful when attempting to solve problems like the [[two-body problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Vallado, D. A. (2001). ''Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications.'' els Segundo, CA: Microcosm Press. pp 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yellow Poppy.jpg|thumb|right|Yellow or [[Eschscholzia californica|California poppy]] in [[New Delhi]], India]]

A '''poppy''' is a [[flowering plant]] in the subfamily Papaveroideae of the family [[Papaveraceae]]. Poppies are [[herbaceous plant]]s, often grown for their colourful flowers. One species of poppy, ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'', is the source of the crude drug [[opium]] which contains powerful medicinal [[alkaloid]]s such as [[morphine]] and has been used since ancient times as an [[analgesic]] and [[narcotic]] [[medicine|medicinal]] and [[recreational drug]]. It also produces [[Poppy seed|edible seeds]]. Following the [[trench warfare]] in the poppy fields of [[Flanders]] during [[World War I]], poppies have become a symbol of [[Remembrance Day|remembrance]] of soldiers who have died during wartime.

==Description==
Poppies are [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[Annual plant|annual]], [[Biennial plant|biennial]] or short-lived [[Perennial plant|perennial]] plants. Some species are [[monocarpic]], dying after flowering. Poppies can be over a metre tall with flowers up to 15 centimetres across. Flowers of species (not cultivars) have 4 to 6 petals, many [[stamen]]s forming a conspicuous whorl in the center of the flower and an ovary of from 2 to many fused carpels. The petals are showy, may be of almost any color and some have markings. The petals are crumpled in the [[bud]] and as blooming finishes, the petals often lie flat before falling away. In the temperate zones, poppies bloom from spring into early summer.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, J.E., Chadwick, A.F. and Craker L.E. (1984) Herbs: An indexed bibliography, 1971-1980: the scientific literature on selected herbs, and aromatic and medicinal plants of the Temperate Zone. Elsevier, Amsterdam and New York. {{ISBN|0444996265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most species secrete latex when injured. [[Bee]]s use poppies as a [[pollen source]]. The [[pollen]] of the oriental poppy, ''[[Papaver orientale]]'', is dark blue, that of the field or corn poppy (''[[Papaver rhoeas]]'') is grey to dark green.&lt;ref name="Hodges"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Hodges|title=The pollen loads of the honeybee|year=1952|publisher=Bee Research Association Ltd., London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opium poppy, ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'', grows wild in eastern and southern Asia, and South Eastern Europe. It is believed that it originated in the Mediterranean region.&lt;ref&gt;Kryzmanski, J. and Jonsson, R. (1999) Poppy. In: Robbelon, G., Downey, R.K., Ashri, A.(eds.), Oil Crops of the World. Their Breeding and Utilization. McGraw Hill, New York, {{ISBN|00-705-30815}}. p. 388-393.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Papaver]]'' – ''[[Papaver rhoeas]]'', ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'', ''[[Papaver orientale]]'', ''[[Papaver nudicaule]]''
*''[[Eschscholzia]]'' – ''[[Eschscholzia californica]]''
*''[[Meconopsis]]'' – ''[[Meconopsis cambrica]]'', ''[[Meconopsis napaulensis]]''
*''[[Stylophorum]]'' – celandine poppy
*''[[Argemone]]'' – prickly poppy
*''[[Romneya]]'' – matilija poppy and relatives
*''[[Canbya]]'' – pygmy poppy
*''[[Stylomecon]]'' – wind poppy
*''[[Arctomecon]]'' – desert bearpaw poppy
*''[[Hunnemannia]]'' – tulip poppy
*''[[Dendromecon]]'' – tree poppy

==Uses==
[[Image:Poppies by Benoit Aubry of Ottawa.JPG|thumb|Plastic [[Remembrance Day]] poppies in Canada]]
[[Image:Lest we forget.jpg|thumb|Poppy (Canadian version) worn on the lapel]]
The flowers of most poppy species are attractive and are widely cultivated as annual or perennial [[ornamental plant]]s. This has resulted in a number of commercially important cultivars, such as the Shirley poppy, a cultivar of ''Papaver rhoeas'' and semi-double or double (flore plena) forms of the opium poppy ''Papaver somniferum'' and oriental poppy (''Papaver orientale''). Poppies of several other genera are also cultivated in gardens. A few species have other uses, principally as sources of drugs and foods. The [[opium poppy]] is widely cultivated and its worldwide production is monitored by international agencies. It is used for production of dried latex and [[opium]], the principal precursor of narcotic and analgesic [[opiates]] such as [[morphine]], [[heroin]] and [[codeine]]. [[Poppy seeds]] are rich in oil, carbohydrates, calcium and protein. [[Poppyseed oil|Poppy oil]] is often used as cooking oil, salad dressing oil, or in products such as margarine. Poppy oil can also be added to spices for cakes, or breads. Poppy products are also used in different paints, varnishes, and some cosmetics.&lt;ref name="Kryzmanski, J 1999 p. 388-393"&gt;Kryzmanski, J. and Jonsson, R. (1999) Poppy. In: Robbelon, G., Downey, R.K., Ashri, A.(eds.), Oil Crops of the World. Their Breeding and Utilization. McGraw Hill, New York, {{ISBN|00-705-30815}}. p. 388-393&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medicine ===
Ancient Egyptian doctors would have their patients eat seeds from a poppy to relieve pain. [[Poppy seed]]s contain small quantities of both morphine and [[codeine]],&lt;ref&gt;Meadway, C., George, S. and Braithwaite, R. (1998) Opiate concentration following the ingestion of poppy seed products – evidence for 'the poppy seed defence'. Forensic Science International 96, 29–38&lt;/ref&gt; which are pain-relieving drugs that are still used today. Poppy seeds and fixed oils can also be nonnarcotic because when they are harvested about twenty days after the flower has opened, the morphine is no longer present.&lt;ref name="Kryzmanski, J 1999 p. 388-393" /&gt;

===Advertising===
In Mexico, [[Grupo Modelo]], the makers of [[Corona (beer)|Corona]] beer, used red poppy flowers in most of its advertising images until the 1960s.

Artificial poppies (called "Buddy Poppies") are used in the veterans' aid campaign by the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], which provides money to the veterans who assemble the poppies and various aid programs to veterans and their families.&lt;ref name="vfw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vfw.org/index.cfm?fa=cmty.levelc&amp;cid=127|title=Veterans of Foreign Wars Buddy Poppy Website|author=|date=|website=vfw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada issued special quarters (25-cent coins) with a red poppy on the reverse in 2004, 2008 and 2010. The 2004 Canadian "poppy" quarter was the world's first colored circulation coin.&lt;ref name="mint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mint.ca/poppy|title=Canadian Coins - Circulation, Collecting Coins &amp; Coin Sets - the Royal Canadian Mint|author=|date=|website=www.mint.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names===
The girl's given name "Poppy" is taken from the name of the flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babynames.co.uk/meaning_origin_name_Poppy.htm|title=Meaning and origin of the name Poppy|publisher=Baby Names UK|access-date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
Poppies have long been used as a symbol of sleep, peace, and death: Sleep because the opium extracted from them is a sedative, and death because of the common blood-red color of the red poppy in particular. In Greek and Roman myths, poppies were used as offerings to the dead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 173, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poppies used as emblems on [[headstone|tombstones]] symbolize eternal sleep. This symbolism was evoked in the children's novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', in which a magical poppy field threatened to make the protagonists sleep forever.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

BBC News. Retrieved 6 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
A second interpretation of poppies in [[Classical mythology]] is that the bright scarlet color signifies a promise of resurrection after death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]], ''The Greek Myths'', 24. 15 p. 96, {{ISBN|0-14-001026-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Remembrance poppy|poppy of wartime remembrance]] is ''[[Papaver rhoeas]]'', the red-flowered corn poppy. This poppy is a common [[weed]] in Europe and is found in many locations, including [[Flanders]], which is the setting of the famous poem "[[In Flanders Fields]]" by the Canadian surgeon and soldier [[John McCrae]]. In Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legion.org/troops/216371/legion-family-flower-remembrance|title=Legion Family flower of remembrance|author=|date=|website=The American Legion}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, artificial poppies (plastic in Canada, paper in the UK, Australia, South Africa, Malta and New Zealand) are worn to commemorate those who died in war. This form of commemoration is associated with Remembrance Day, which falls on November 11. In Canada, Australia and the UK, poppies are often worn from the beginning of November through to the 11th, or Remembrance Sunday if that falls on a later date. In New Zealand and Australia, soldiers are also commemorated on ANZAC day (April 25),&lt;ref name="Seal2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Seal|title=Inventing Anzac: the digger and national mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z40eykeP_IMC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=18 September 2010|year=2004|publisher=Univ. of Queensland Press|isbn=978-0-7022-3447-7|pages=105–}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the poppy is still commonly worn around Remembrance Day. Wearing of poppies has been a custom since 1924 in the United States. Miss [[Moina Michael]] of Georgia is credited as the founder of the Memorial Poppy in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Moina Michael|url=http://www.cal-mum.com/poppy.htm#Moina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BookInc2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=World Book|author2=Inc|title=The World Book dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oPW_pTjpeCQC&amp;pg=PA1622|accessdate=18 August 2010|year=2003|publisher=World Book.com|isbn=978-0-7166-0299-6|pages=1622–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United States of America Congressional Record"&gt;{{cite book|title=United States of America Congressional Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbK9zpJ1ipEC&amp;pg=PA10121|accessdate=18 August 2010|publisher=Government Printing Office|pages=10121–|id=GGKEY:8F7NFQJ525R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red-flowered poppy is unofficially considered the national flower of the Albanians in Albania, Kosovo and elsewhere. This is due to its red and black colors, the same as the colors of the flag of Albania.

The California poppy, ''[[Eschscholzia californica]]'', is the state flower of California.

The powerful symbolism of ''Papaver rhoeas'' has been borrowed by various advocacy campaigns, such as the [[White Poppy]] and [[Simon Topping]]'s black poppy.

==History and Influence==
''Papaver somniferum'' was domesticated by [[Old Europe (archaeology)|the indigenous people]] of Western and Central Europe between 6000 and 3500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Jared Diamond]] | date = 1997 | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]] | publisher = W W Norton &amp; Co | isbn = 0-393-03891-2 | page = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is believed that its origins may come from the Sumerian people, where the first use of opium was recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownstein|first=M J|date=1993-06-15|title=A brief history of opiates, opioid peptides, and opioid receptors.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC46725/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=90|issue=12|pages=5391–5393|issn=0027-8424|pmid=8390660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poppies and opium made made their way around the world along the [[Silk Road|silk road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deamuseum.org/ccp/opium/history.html|title=Opium Poppy: History|website=www.deamuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juglets resembling poppy seed pods have been discovered with trace amounts of opium and the flower appeared in jewelry and on art pieces in Egypt, dated 1550-1292 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/3198|title=Brooklyn Museum|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://melbakes.pl/baza-wiedzy/pochodzenie-i-historia-maku/|title=Pochodzenie i historia maku - Baza wiedzy - Melbake's - Najlepsze ziarna|website=melbakes.pl|language=pl-PL|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eradication of poppy cultivation came about in the early 1900's through international conferences due to safety concerns associated with the production of opium. In the 1970's the American [[war on drugs]] targeted Turkish production of the plant, leading to an more negative popular opinion of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evered|first=Kyle T.|date=7 September 2011|title=Poppies Are Democracy!” A Critical Geopolitics of Opium Eradication and Reintroduction in Turkey|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1931-0846.2011.00098.x|journal=Geographical Review|language=en|volume=101|issue=3|pages=299–315|doi=10.1111/j.1931-0846.2011.00098.x|issn=0016-7428|via=Weiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Race, Evolution, and Behavior: A Life History Perspective''''' is a book by Canadian psychologist and author [[J. Philippe Rushton]]. He served as a professor of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Western Ontario]] for many years, and he also served, until his death from cancer on October 2, 2012, as the head of the [[Pioneer Fund]]. The first unabridged edition of the book came out in 1995, and the third, latest unabridged edition came out in 2000; abridged versions were also distributed.

Rushton argues that [[Race (human categorization)|race]] is a valid [[biology|biological]] concept and that [[Human genetic variation|racial differences]] frequently arrange in a continuum across 60 different behavioral and anatomical variables, with [[Mongoloids]] ([[East Asian people|East Asians]]) at one end of the continuum, [[Negroids]] ([[Sub-Saharan Africans|Sub-Saharan Black Africans]]) at the opposite extreme, and [[Caucasoids]] ([[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]]) in the middle.&lt;ref name=reb2ndabridged&gt;{{cite book

The book was generally received negatively, its methodology and conclusions being criticized by many experts. The aggressive marketing strategy also received a lot of criticism. The book received positive reviews by some researchers, many of whom were personally associated with Rushton and with the [[Pioneer Fund]] which funded much of Rushton's research.&lt;ref name=val53&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard R.|last=Valencia|title=Dismantling contemporary deficit thinking: educational thought and practice|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2010|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been examined as an example of Pioneer's funding of "[[Scientific racism|scientific racist]]" research,&lt;ref name=val53/&gt;&lt;ref name=tucker&gt;{{cite book|author=William H.

== Summary and book contents ==
The book grew out of Rushton's 1989 paper, "Evolutionary Biology and Heritable Traits (With Reference to Oriental-White-Black Difference)".&lt;ref&gt;Presented at the Symposium on Evolutionary Theory, Economics and Political Science, AAAS Annual Meeting (San Francisco, CA, January 19, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st unabridged edition was published in 1995, the 2nd unabridged edition in 1997, and the 3rd unabridged edition in 2000.

Rushton argues that Mongoloid, Caucasoid and Negroid populations fall consistently into the same one-two-three way pattern when compared on a list of sixty distinctly different behavioral and anatomical traits and variables.&lt;ref&gt;
The terms ''Mongoloid'', ''Caucasoid'', and ''Negroid'' used by Rushton (2000) was in wide use in mainstream literature until the 1990s at least, e.g. by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza.
Since the 2000s, these terms have been deprecated in by some authorities. For example, the recommended [[Medical Subject Headings]] as of 2004 was "Oriental Continental Ancestry Group, "African Continental Ancestry Group" and "European Continental Ancestry Group" for "Mongoloid", "Caucasoid" and "Negroid", respectively. 
&lt;!--The decline in usage of these terms can be seen year by year in a [[Google Scholar]] search, and the change of terms can be seen in, for example, the US National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), which in deleted the ''-oids'' (as well as terms such as ''Black'' and ''White'') in favor of terms such as ''African Continental Ancestry Group'':--&gt; ''[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/nd03/nd03_mesh.html The MeSH descriptor Racial Stocks, and its four children (Australoid Race, Caucasoid Race, Mongoloid Race, and Negroid Race) have been deleted from MeSH in 2004 along with Blacks and Whites.] Race and ethnicity have been used as categories in biomedical research and clinical medicine. Recent genetic research indicates that the degree of genetic heterogeneity within groups and homogeneity across groups make race per se a less compelling predictor.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushton uses averages of hundreds of studies, modern and historical, to assert the existence of this pattern. Rushton's book is focused on what he considers the three broadest racial groups, and does not address other populations such as [[Southeast Asian]]s and [[Australian Aborigines|Australian aboriginals]]. The book argues that Mongoloids, on average, are at one end of a continuum, that Negroids, on average, are at the opposite end of that continuum, and that Caucasoids rank in between Mongoloids and Negroids, but closer to Mongoloids. His continuum includes both external physical characteristics and personality traits.&lt;ref name=reb2ndabridged/&gt;

Citing genetic research by the Italian geneticist [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]], the [[African Eve]] hypothesis, and the [[Single origin hypothesis|out of Africa]] theory, Rushton writes that Negroids branched off first (200,000 years ago), Caucasoids second (110,000 years ago), and Mongoloids last (41,000 years ago), arguing that throughout all of evolution, more ancient forms of life (i.e. plants, bacteria, reptiles) are less evolved than more recent forms of life (i.e. mammals, primates, humans) and that the much smaller variation in the races is consistent with this trend. "One theoretical possibility," said Rushton "is that evolution is progressive and that some populations are more advanced than others". Rushton argues that this evolutionary history correlates with, and is responsible for, a consistent global racial pattern which explains many variables such as worldwide crime statistics or the global distribution of AIDS.&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:R&amp;A.gif|left|thumb|200px|Rushton and Ankney (2000, Fig. 4) plotted the cranial capacities and approximate time of evolutionary emergence of humans' evolutionary ancestors and the three races Rushton and Ankney believe humanity can be categorized into. {{Deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 29 December 2007|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

In specific terms, Rushton argues that the three broad racial groups that he's defined have fundamental biological differences going back through evolutionary history that cause clear-cut distinctions in modern everyday life, as well stating that generalizations about these broad groups are justified given the large nature of the gaps. He generally describes the differences as largely negative in the case of "Negroids" while being neutral or positive in the case of non-"Negroids". He writes in particular, "Whites and East Asians have wider hips than Blacks... because they give birth to larger brained babies." He also argues that "hormones that give Blacks an edge at sports makes them restless in school and prone to crime".&lt;ref name=reb2ndabridged/&gt;

== Responses ==
According to Richard R. Valencia, the response to the first edition of Rushton's book was "overwhelmingly negative", with only a small number of supporters, many being, like Rushton, Pioneer Fund grantees, such as psychologists [[Arthur Jensen]], [[Michael Levin]] and [[Richard Lynn]].&lt;ref name=val&gt;Richard R. Valencia, ''Dismantling contemporary deficit thinking: educational thought and practice''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2010, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Valencia identified the main areas of criticism as focusing on Rushton's use of "race" as a biological concept, a failure to appreciate the extent of variation within populations compared with that between populations,  a false separation of genetics and environment, poor statistical methodology, a failure to consider alternative hypotheses, and the use of unreliable and inappropriate data to draw conclusions about the relationship between brain size and intelligence. According to Valencia, "experts in life history conclude that Rushton's (1995) work is pseudoscientific and racist."

A more favorable review of the book came from American psychologist [[Linda Gottfredson]], who wrote in ''[[Politics and the Life Sciences]]'' that the book "confronts us as few books have with the dilemmas wrought in a democratic society by individual and group differences in key human traits".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gottfredson |first=Linda |date=March 1996 |title=Race, Evolution and Behavior: A Life History Perspective |url=https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1996reviewRushton.pdf |journal=Politics and the Life Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another favorable review of the book appeared in the ''[[National Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/10/16/calling-all-crackpots/68f3742a-3b1e-46b5-aedf-b8c0f21a5cf4/|title=Calling All Crackpots|last=Lind|first=Michael|date=1994-10-16|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Validity of the concept of race ===
{{Main|Race (classification of human beings)|Race and genetics}}

[[Richard Lewontin]] (1996) argued that in claiming the existence of "major races", and that these categories reflected large biological differences, "Rushton moves in the opposite direction from the entire development of physical anthropology and human genetics for the last thirty years.  Anthropologists no longer regard "race" as a useful concept in understanding human evolution and variation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: Of Genes and Genitals |journal=Transition |volume=0 |issue=69 |pages=178–193 |year=1996 |jstor=2935246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[C. Loring Brace]] (1996) concurred, stating that the book was an amalgamation of bad biology and inexcusable anthropology.  It is not science but advocacy, and advocacy of '[[racialism]]'".&lt;ref name=brace&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: Racialism and Racist Agendas |journal=American Anthropologist |series=New Series |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=176–7 |date=March 1996 |jstor=682972 |doi=10.1525/aa.1996.98.1.02a00250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, anthropologist [[John Relethford]] (1995) criticized Rushton's model as "faulty at many points."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Relethford|first1=John H.|title=Race, evolution, and behavior: A life history perspective.

== Mailing controversy ==
The 1st special abridged edition published under the Transaction Press name in 1999 caused considerable controversy when 40,000 copies were "mailed, unsolicited, to psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists, many of whom were angered when they discovered that their identities and addresses had been obtained from their respective professional associations' mailing lists."&lt;ref name=weizmann&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weizmann, Fredric |title=Race, Evolution, and Behaviour: A Life History Perspective (Review) |journal=Canadian Psychology |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=November 2001 |doi= |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3711/is_200111/ai_n9007738}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The director of Transaction Press [[Irving Louis Horowitz]], although he had defended the original edition of the book, "condemned the abridged edition as a 'pamphlet' that he had never seen or approved prior to its publication."&lt;ref name=weizmann/&gt; A subsequent 2nd special abridged edition was published in 2000 with a rejoinder to Horowitz's criticisms under a new entity called ''The Charles Darwin Research Institute''.&lt;ref name=weizmann/&gt;

According to Tucker, many academics who received the book unsolicited were outraged at its content, calling it "racial pornography" and a "vile piece of work"; at least one insisting on returning it to the publisher.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; Hermann Helmuth, a professor of anthropology at Trent University, said, "It is in a way personal and political propaganda. There is no basis to his scientific research."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/2000/February/1/News3.htm UWO Gazette Volume 93, Issue 68 Tuesday, February 1, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515022349/http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/2000/February/1/News3.htm |date=May 15, 2011 }} Psych prof accused of racism&lt;/ref&gt;

== As an example of Pioneer Fund activity ==
''Race, Evolution, and Behavior'' has been cited as an example of the [[Pioneer Fund]]'s activities in promoting "[[Scientific racism]]". Valencia notes that many of the supportive comments for the book come from Pioneer grantees like Rushton himself, and that a 100,000 copy print-run of the third edition was financed by Pioneer.&lt;ref name=val/&gt; The book is cited by psychologist [[William H. Tucker]] as an example of the Pioneer Fund's continued role "to subsidize the creation and distribution of literature to support racial superiority and racial purity." The mass distribution of the abridged third edition he described as part of a "public relations effort", and "the latest attempt to convince the nation of 'the completely different nature' of blacks and whites." He notes that bulk rates were offered "for distribution to media figures, especially columnists who write on race issues".&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt;

'''Racial equality''' occurs when [[institution]]s give [[equal opportunity]] to people of all [[race (human categorization)|races]]. In other words, institutions ignore persons' racial [[phenotypic trait|physical traits]] or [[skin color]], and give everyone legally, morally, and politically equal opportunity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/racial-equality |title=Racial Equality - Dictionary definition of Racial Equality |publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Western world|Western society]] today, there is more [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] and more [[racial integration|integration]] among races. Initially, attaining equality has been difficult for [[black people|African]], [[Asian people|Asian]], and [[Latino]] people, especially in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Landauro |first=Victor |title=Racial Equality |work=Junior Scholastic |page=10-1 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] |date=26 April 2004 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[United States]], racial equality, has become a law that regardless of what race an individual is, they will receive equal treatment, opportunity, education, employment, and politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Background==

===Civil War===
Slavery was the key to the start of the bloodiest and most traumatic war in America's history. The American Civil War was fought from 1861 to 1865. By 1860 one in three persons in the Southern States belonged to another, in a population of twelve million, four million were slaves. In September 1862 Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation, which avowed the aim of freeing the slaves in the Confederacy, and made abolition one of the North's central war aims.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Civil War|last=Davies|first=Phil|publisher=Pocket Essentials|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North took the victory. Did the end of the war represent a gain or a loss for the country? The war represents a defeat for freedom simply to be let alone, for the beneficiaries of inherited wealth or those who prefer to live on the margins of society, but a victory for those, like the immigrants from Europe and the newly emancipated blacks, who needed government to provide the necessary conditions for the pursuit of happiness.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Struggle of African American society==

===Post War equality===
Four million slaves were freed by the result of the American Civil War. In a few years later the South's elite white was in control again. Economic power was the main reason. Deprived of control over the means of earning a living, the blacks were forced into dependence on white landowners.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The blacks worked as farm laborers, or as tenants under the sharecropping system. The biggest problem was the blacks were at the mercy of their white bosses, who would tell them how to vote. Segregations of schools, healthcare and housing became entrenched in the South and the black was relegated to the status of second-class citizen.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Health===
The health of many residents differed depended on areas of living. The poor inner-cities did not or lack the necessary health care that was available in outside areas. Many of the inner-city's location was the main cause for this problem. They were isolated from other parts of society which was a large contributor to the poor health of these residents. Also, the overcrowded living conditions added to the poor health of the residents by the spread of infectious diseases.

==Martin Luther King Jr.==
[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] is better known as a civil rights leader in the United States concerning racial equality. Martin Luther King Jr. became one of the greatest leaders due to his stance concerning various mistreated African-American men and women in the South.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=African American Almanac : 400 Years of Triumph, Courage and Excellence|last=Carney|first=Jessie|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2011|isbn=9781578593231|location=|pages=45–50|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he played many roles in society and won an award for the movement he conducted. Martin Luther King Jr. not only took part in the [[Montgomery bus boycott]], became a key speaker at the March on Washington, and was one of the youngest individuals to win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], but he also handled his opinion in a peaceful manner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; King kept his anger toward the idea of [[Racial segregation|segregation of race]] to himself; however, he did show his passion of equality in his speeches and [[peaceful protest]].

King displayed his very first [[civil rights movement]] by voluntarily taking a stance in the Montgomery bus boycott. The bus boycott had started by [[Rosa Parks]] refusing to give up her seat for a white male after a long and tiring day at work. Thus, after Park's arrest, King gathered the black community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in hopes for boycotting against the bus, by cutting the use of transportation. This boycott continued on for 382 days. Although, King had to overcome many attacks towards him such as arrest, and violent harassment, the result was their (African-Americans) first victory: black men and women were allowed to ride the buses in Montgomery equally as the whites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Rosa Parks==
Rosa Parks was born on February 4, 1913 in Montgomery, Alabama. She attended the all-black [[Alabama State College]], and soon worked at [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) as a secretary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rosa Parks had become an activists by an event that triggered other events to occur. On December 1, 1955&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Parks had taken the bus home from work, when all of a sudden she was being forced to give up her seat for a white male. Rosa Parks had been frustrated of the way black individuals were treated; thus, she refused and was arrested and fined $14.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Parks' refusal and arrest had caused a dilemma for white individuals, especially for the ones that owned the bus business. The Montgomery bus boycott had started to desegregate public transportation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, Martin Luther King Jr. had gotten involved to not only motivate the mistreated African-American population, but to share his passion of equality. This boycott lasted 382 days and ended on December 21, 1956.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the end of the bus boycott, both Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. had become national heroes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, the Supreme Court passed a law which declared it unconstitutional to segregate on Montgomery buses.

==Groups and organizations==

===Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)===
Martin Luther King Jr. was the founder of [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], by having summoned various numbers of black leaders in 1957.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He became the President of this activist group and decided to improve communities by managing peaceful protests and boycotts regarding the social ethics of discrimination and segregation between races.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===National Association of the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)===
First created on February 12, 1909 in Springfield, Illinois.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.naacp.org/oldest-and-boldest/|title=NAACP {{!}} Oldest and Boldest|newspaper=NAACP|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was against violence that was directed towards African Americans. There objective was to eliminate racial inequality, and guarantee the political, educational, social and economic equality for citizens. Their office was located in New York.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Moorfield Storey was named president, while, Du Bois, was the only African American Director of Publications.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Congress of Racial Equality===
There was a [[civil rights]] group called [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) that came together to fight corruption and segregation in a nonviolent manner. CORE grew profoundly after the 1950s, beginning with [[James Farmer]] who later became the leader of the group and a civil rights activist in 1941. He went back to his "Native South" and visited to a local movie theater, where he came upon the "crow's nest", an area that was reserved for blacks. He opposed the [[Jim Crow laws]]. He realized that his friends and himself supported those laws by what they did in their daily actions. He soon wrote a memo and summoned for the formation of a group of individuals that were powerful from mind and body to be able to take personal nonviolent actions to end [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor=1035898|title=The Congress of Racial Equality and Its Strategy on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CORE was established in 1942 in Chicago. It was a branch of a "Peace-Lover" organization, which was called the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (FOR). CORE used nonviolent actions procedures that involved sit-ins, which were done in lunch counters in Chicago. By 1947, CORE contributed with an interracial bus ride across the upper part of the South. They were testing state buses that the [[U.S Supreme Court]] ordered to be desegregated, which was the ''[[Morgan v. Virginia]]'' decision in 1946. This led to some success for the facilities that were testing out the orders they were given, but it didn't grab much attention especially in the national level, which was their main goal. By 1960, there was a new wave of nonviolent [[direct action]] protests that initiated through the student [[sit-in movement]]. CORE's national director James Farmer repeated the [[Journey of Reconciliation]]. Another Supreme Court ruling, ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'' (1960), ordered a stop to segregation in the interstate bus terminals. That came to be the Freedom Rides. The [[Freedom Riders]] traveled deep into the south and were attacked by segregationists along Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;KIRK, JOHN A. "Please Help Us": The Fort Smith Congress Of Racial Equality Chapter, 1962-1965." Arkansas Historical Quarterly 73.3 (2014): 293-317. Academic Search Complete. Web. 5 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

CORE began in the North and was mainly concentrated in public areas. About two decades ago, the North had segregated spots where blacks were not allowed. Those places, for example, were restaurants, bowling alleys, skating rinks, and barber shops. More successful efforts were the work settings where there were some experiments with interracial workers and in housing co-operatives. CORE's main focus was to increase public recognition in the north. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, CORE moved to the border states of Missouri, Maryland, and Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rich, Marvin. "The Congress of Racial Equality and Its Strategy". ''The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 357 (1965): 113–118. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accomplishments of CORE and NAACP=== 
In the first few weeks of April the two groups CORE and NAACP combined forces to make a change in racial equality. Both the groups protesters constructed a plan to shut down construction of the city's Municipal Services Building, by marching in front of Mayor James Tate's North Philadelphia row house.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|year=2004|title=Affirmative Action from Below: Civil Rights, the Building Trades, and the Politics of Racial Equality in the Urban North, 1945-1969|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2068/central/docview/224893942/fulltext/D9AE847082174E94PQ/1?accountid=40611|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=|pages=145-173|via=ProQuest Central}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many protesters had engaged in various fights involving police and white unionists.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Moreover, the two groups had caused many debates to open up regarding racial politics, discrimination, and employment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Technique ====
CORE's technique was always nonviolence as the method of fighting [[racial injustice]]. CORE was the first organization to use nonviolent actions in order to stop many issues that affected the black community. The student sit-ins started in February 1960. Within the year, 130 eating locations opened up in the southern communities. They were interested in how CORE approached the issue of segregation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ucf.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%253A4978|title=This is CORE. {{!}} ucf.digital.flvc.org|website=ucf.digital.flvc.org|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CORE grew in the early 1940s, but continued to be composed of small groups. They persisted in being small because of the students who were part of the organization. The students would graduate and move away. Also, others were fighting for a specific cause and once the issue has been dealt with, they disappeared. CORE was only a voluntary organization; there was no paid staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Main goals ====
In the South:
*[[Desegregation]]
*[[Voter registration]]

In the North:
*Better jobs
*Better housing
*[[School integration in the United States|School integration]]

Many outsiders started to notice the efforts of the group. They supported them and started the Freedom Rides.  CORE was more involved in the [[Black Power]] movement around the mid-1960s. Then things shifted to integration and nonviolent actions toward the organization of communities, the separation of the people, and Black Power. Also, as whites and blacks started to work together to fight over the dilemmas of segregation, white liberals weren't fond of the idea that they were working together. CORE's issues changed over time, so they worked on different actions that would come up.

==Protests==

===Sit-ins===
[[Sit-in]]s, the oldest technique, have been used by CORE the most. CORE divided people into three different groups: one with all black individuals, one with all whites, and one that was interracial. These three different groups would go to a segregated eating area before the busiest hour and wait to be attended quietly. This was used to open up restaurants, and was later used for other locations.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Standing in line===
This was used at cafeterias, ticket booths, and other places where one stands in a line in order to be served. If someone is refused, the CORE members who might be in line before him/her will also refuse to step out of line and interrupt service. CORE did this at movie theaters in Kentucky, and at a swimming pool at Palisades Amusement Park in New Jersey. This technique was also important for stopping segregation.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==In the twenty-first century==

===Attitudes===
Since 1942, two particular issues have evolved in racial equality.  One is the handling of blacks to ensure equality, which was favored by the white community, and the other is the differences between southerners and non-southerners. These two issues were observed by the [[National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC). They made questions that plotted five main topics that targeted blacks at the time. The five points that affected racial equality and tracked during the years 1965–1980 were ''year, region, cohort, and education''.&lt;ref name=Case&gt;Case, Charles E., and Andrew M. Greeley. "Attitudes Toward Racial Equality." Humboldt Journal of Social Relations 16.1 (1990): 67-94. ProQuest. Web. 1 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many educational systems in the south and non-southern areas were in favor of segregated educational institutions among blacks. They also didn't want blacks near their neighborhood or [[interracial marriage]]s to happen.&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

==Laws==

===Thirteenth Amendment===
The abolishment of slavery in all states.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Edward|year=2014|title=THE ORIGINS OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN AMERICA.|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2240/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=146eced3-29c2-4279-8bd6-dfaf5495365f%40sessionmgr4006&amp;hid=4207&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100183276&amp;db=fth|journal=Case Western Reserve Law Review|volume=64|pages=755-816|via=EBSCO host}}{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Fourteenth Amendment=== 
Allowed citizenship to individuals that were born in the United States such as Native Americans and African Americans. It also stops any other state to pass their own law which will violate this amendment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It prohibits states from opposing any person's "life, liberty or property, without law coming forward on the individual" or to "deny to any person within its authority the equal protection of the laws."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Fifteenth Amendment=== 
Allowed African Americans to vote.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Civil Rights Act 1866===
Granted citizenship to individuals without discriminating or viewing race, color, or the previous act of being a slave.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  

===Jim Crow laws=== 
In Southern States, a law that enforced a separation of blacks and whites from public facilities such as employment, housing, education, politics, military service, sports, and business.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2068/central/docview/1691151968/EDA27E55285B4979PQ/1?accountid=40611|title=SAVING THE DREAM FOR ALL|last=Higginbotham|first=Michael|date=2014|work=|access-date=9 December 2016|via=ProQuest Central}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a separate but equal rank was given to the African Americans; also, it was not violating any laws that the government had made of the United States.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''''Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. Sonny Perdue''''' (No. 4:16-cv-00041-BMM) is a case in which plaintiffs allege that checkoff dollars are being used to support Canadian and Mexican beef. [[Commodity checkoff program|Checkoffs]] are mandatory contributions, from beef producers in this case, which are used for generic industry advertising and research.&lt;ref name="Docket 47"&gt;{{cite web|title=Order|url=https://www.publicjustice.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Checkoff-2017.06.21-Dkt.-No.-47-Decision-on-FR.pdf|publisher=D. Mont.|accessdate=24 August 2017|date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This case is distinguished from '''''Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. USDA''''' (No. 2:17-cv-00223), a challenge to USDA rules that allow Mexican and Canadian beef to be labelled as domestic beef. &lt;ref name="Docket 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Complaint|url=https://www.r-calfusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/170619-COOL-Complaint.pdf|publisher=E.D. Wash.|accessdate=24 August 2017|date=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Facts and prior history==
In 2016 the United States Department of Agriculture rescinded regulations requiring Mexican and Canadian beef be marked as imported. Checkoff advertising does not distinguish between domestic and imported beef.  Plaintiff disagrees with advertising that promotes imported beef to its detriment. It claims [[compelled speech]] in violation of the First Amendment.  This matter had been addressed by the Supreme Court of the United States in ''[[Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association]]'' (2005).

== Latest developments and next steps ==

In June 2017, the court issued a preliminary injunction that stopped the Montana Beef Board from using beef producers' checkoff contributions for advertising, unless the producers approve in advance.&lt;ref name="Docket 47" /&gt;  The decision hung on the distinction between [[commercial speech]] and [[government speech]]. Compelled commercial speech is a [[First Amendment]] violation. This is in contraposition to ''[[Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association]]'' (2005).

In September, the court stayed further proceedings until the [[Ninth District Court of Appeals]] rules on the USDA appeal.&lt;ref name="Docket 52"&gt;{{cite web|title=Docket 52|url=https://ecf.mtd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11112162418|publisher=District Court for the District of Montana|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Operant conditioning diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Diagram of operant conditioning]]

In [[Behaviorism|behavioral psychology]], '''reinforcement''' is a [[Operant conditioning#Tools and procedures of operant conditioning|consequence]] applied that will strengthen an organism's future behavior whenever that behavior is preceded by a specific [[Antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedent stimulus]]. This strengthening effect may be measured as a higher frequency of behavior (e.g.,  pulling a lever more frequently), longer duration (e.g., pulling a lever for longer periods of time), greater magnitude (e.g., pulling a lever with greater force), or shorter latency (e.g., pulling a lever more quickly following the antecedent stimulus).

[[Rewarding stimuli]], which are associated with [[incentive salience|"wanting" and "liking"]] (desire and pleasure, respectively) and appetitive behavior, function as [[positive reinforcer]]s;&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; the [[Converse (logic)|converse statement]] is also true: positive reinforcers provide a desirable stimulus.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schultz W | title = Neuronal Reward and Decision Signals: From Theories to Data | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 853–951 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26109341 | pmc = 4491543 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00023.2014 | quote = Rewards in operant conditioning are positive reinforcers.&amp;nbsp;... Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&amp;nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.&amp;nbsp;... Intrinsic rewards are activities that are pleasurable on their own and are undertaken for their own sake, without being the means for getting extrinsic rewards.&amp;nbsp;... Intrinsic rewards are genuine rewards in their own right, as they induce learning, approach, and pleasure, like perfectioning, playing, and enjoying the piano. Although they can serve to condition higher order rewards, they are not conditioned, higher order rewards, as attaining their reward properties does not require pairing with an unconditioned reward. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforcement does not require an individual to consciously perceive an effect elicited by the stimulus.&lt;ref name="pmid15574667"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winkielman P, Berridge KC, Wilbarger JL | title = Unconscious affective reactions to masked happy versus angry faces influence consumption behavior and judgments of value | journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–35 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15574667 | doi = 10.1177/0146167204271309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, reinforcement occurs only if there is an observable strengthening in behavior. However, there is also negative reinforcement, which is characterized by taking away an undesirable stimulus. An ibuprofen is a negative reinforcer because it takes away pain.

In most cases, the term "reinforcement" refers to an enhancement of behavior, but this term is also sometimes used to denote an enhancement of memory; for example, "post-training reinforcement" refers to the provision of a stimulus (such as food) after a learning session in an attempt to increase the retained breadth, detail, and duration of the individual memories or overall memory just formed.&lt;ref name="pmid928533"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mondadori C, Waser PG, Huston JP | title = Time-dependent effects of post-trial reinforcement, punishment or ECS on passive avoidance learning | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 1103–9 | date = June 1977 | pmid = 928533 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The memory-enhancing stimulus can also be one whose effects are directly rather than only indirectly emotional, as with the phenomenon of "[[flashbulb memory]]," in which an emotionally highly intense stimulus can incentivize memory of a set of a situation's circumstances well beyond the subset of those circumstances that caused the emotionally significant stimulus, as when people of appropriate age are able to remember where they were and what they were doing when they learned of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] or of the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name="pmid22593908"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Gottfried JA, White NM | chapter = Chapter3: Reward: What is it?

==Terminology==
{{addiction glossary}}
:''Main section: [[Reinforcement#Operant conditioning]]''

In the behavioral sciences, the terms "positive" and "negative" refer when used in their strict technical sense to the nature of the action performed by the conditioner rather than to the responding operant's evaluation of that action and its consequence(s).  "Positive" actions are those that add a factor, be it pleasant or unpleasant, to the environment, whereas "negative" actions are those that remove or withhold from the environment a factor of either type.  In turn, the strict sense of "reinforcement" refers only to reward-based conditioning; the introduction of unpleasant factors and the removal or withholding of pleasant factors are instead referred to as "punishment," which when used in its strict sense thus stands in contradistinction to "reinforcement."  Thus, "positive reinforcement" refers to the addition of a pleasant factor, "positive punishment" refers to the addition of an unpleasant factor, "negative reinforcement" refers to the removal or withholding of an unpleasant factor, and "negative punishment" refers to the removal or withholding of a pleasant factor.

This usage is at odds with some non-technical usages of the four term combinations, especially in the case of the term "negative reinforcement," which is often used to denote what technical parlance would describe as "positive punishment" in that the non-technical usage interprets "reinforcement" as subsuming both reward and punishment and "negative" as referring to the responding operant's evaluation of the factor being introduced.  By contrast, technical parlance would use the term "negative reinforcement" to describe encouragement of a given behavior by creating a scenario in which an unpleasant factor is or will be present but engaging in the behavior results in either escaping from that factor or preventing its occurrence, as in [[Martin Seligman]]'s [[Learned helplessness#Early key experiments|experiments involving dogs' learning processes regarding the avoidance of electric shock]].

==Introduction==

[[B.F. Skinner]] was a well-known and influential researcher who articulated many of the theoretical constructs of reinforcement and [[behaviorism]]. Skinner defined reinforcers according to the change in response strength (response rate) rather than to more subjective criteria, such as what is pleasurable or valuable to someone. Accordingly, activities, foods or items considered pleasant or enjoyable may not necessarily be reinforcing (because they produce no increase in the response preceding them). Stimuli, settings, and activities only fit the definition of reinforcers if the behavior that immediately precedes the potential reinforcer increases in similar situations in the future; for example, a child who receives a cookie when he or she asks for one. If the frequency of "cookie-requesting behavior" increases, the cookie can be seen as reinforcing "cookie-requesting behavior". If however, "cookie-requesting behavior" does not increase the cookie cannot be considered reinforcing.

The sole criterion that determines if a stimulus is reinforcing is the change in probability of a behavior after administration of that potential reinforcer. Other theories may focus on additional factors such as whether the person expected a behavior to produce a given outcome, but in the behavioral theory, reinforcement is defined by an increased probability of a response.

The study of reinforcement has produced an enormous body of [[reliability (statistics)|reproducible]] experimental results. Reinforcement is the central concept and procedure in [[special education]], [[applied behavior analysis]], and the [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and is a core concept in some medical and [[psychopharmacology]] models, particularly [[addiction]], [[substance dependence|dependence]], and [[Compulsive behavior|compulsion]].

== Brief history ==

Laboratory research on reinforcement is usually dated from the work of  [[Edward Thorndike]], known for his experiments with cats escaping from puzzle boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thorndike E | title = Some Experiments on Animal Intelligence | journal = Science | volume = 7 | issue = 181 | pages = 818–24 | date = June 1898 | pmid = 17769765 | doi = 10.1126/science.7.181.818 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of others continued this research, notably B.F. Skinner, who published his seminal work on the topic in The Behavior of Organisms, in 1938, and elaborated this research in many subsequent publications.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=S9WNCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Reinforcement&amp;f=false The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis]", 1938 New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; Notably Skinner argued that positive reinforcement is superior to punishment in shaping behavior.&lt;ref name=Walden&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Skinner BF |title=Walden Two|year=1948|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though punishment may seem just the opposite of reinforcement, Skinner claimed that they differ immensely, saying that positive reinforcement results in lasting [[Behavior modification|behavioral modification]] (long-term) whereas punishment changes behavior only temporarily (short-term) and has many detrimental side-effects.
A great many researchers subsequently expanded our understanding of reinforcement and challenged some of Skinner's conclusions. For example, Azrin and Holz defined punishment as a “consequence of behavior that reduces the future probability of that behavior,”&lt;ref name=Honig&gt;{{cite book|last=Honig|first=Werner | name-list-format = vanc |title=Operant Behavior: Areas of Research and Application|year=1966|publisher=Meredith Publishing Company|location=New York|page=381|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1966-35017-000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and some studies have shown that positive reinforcement and punishment are equally effective in modifying behavior. Research on the effects of positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement and punishment continue today as those concepts are fundamental to learning theory and apply to many practical applications of that theory.

== Operant conditioning ==
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
The term ''operant conditioning'' was introduced by B. F. Skinner to indicate that in his experimental paradigm the organism is free to operate on the environment. In this paradigm the experimenter cannot trigger the desirable response; the experimenter waits for the response to occur (to be emitted by the organism) and then a potential reinforcer is delivered. In the [[classical conditioning]] paradigm the experimenter triggers (elicits) the desirable response by presenting a reflex eliciting stimulus, the ''Unconditional Stimulus'' (UCS), which he pairs (precedes) with a neutral stimulus, the ''Conditional Stimulus'' (CS).

''Reinforcement'' is a basic term in operant conditioning. For the punishment aspect of operant conditioning – see [[punishment (psychology)]].

===Positive reinforcement===
Positive reinforcement occurs when a [[reward system|desirable event or stimulus]] is presented as a consequence of a behavior and the behavior increases.&lt;ref name=Flora&gt;{{cite book|last=Flora|first=Stephen | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Power of Reinforcement|year=2004|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|253}}
* Example: Whenever a rat presses a button, it gets a treat. If the rat starts pressing the button more often, the treat serves to positively reinforce this behavior.
* Example: A father gives candy to his daughter when she picks up her toys. If the frequency of picking up the toys increases, the candy is a positive reinforcer (to reinforce the behavior of cleaning up).
* Example: A company enacts a rewards program in which employees earn prizes dependent on the number of items sold. The prizes the employees receive are the positive reinforcement if they increase sales.

===Negative reinforcement===
Negative reinforcement occurs when the rate of a behavior increases because an [[aversives|aversive event or stimulus]] is removed or prevented from happening.&lt;ref name=Flora/&gt;{{rp|253}}
* Example: A child cleans their room, and this behavior is followed by the parent stopping "nagging" or asking the child repeatedly to do so. Here, the nagging serves to negatively reinforce the behavior of cleaning because the child wants to remove that aversive stimulus of nagging.
* Example: A person puts ointment on a bug bite to soothe an itch. If the ointment works, the person will likely increase the usage of the ointment because it resulted in removing the itch, which is the negative reinforcer.
* Example: A company has a policy that if an employee completes their assigned work by Friday, they can have Saturday off. Working Saturday is the negative reinforcer, the employee's productivity will be increased as they avoid experiencing the negative reinforcer.

===Reinforcement versus punishment===
Reinforcers serve to increase behaviors whereas punishers serve to decrease behaviors; thus, positive reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to attain, and negative reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to be rid of or to end.&lt;ref name="D'Amato"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = D'Amato MR |title=Learning Processes: Instrumental Conditioning|year=1969|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=Toronto| veditors = Marx MH }}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below illustrates the adding and subtracting of stimuli (pleasant or aversive) in relation to reinforcement vs. punishment.

=== Further ideas and concepts ===
* Distinguishing between positive and negative can be difficult and may not always be necessary; focusing on ''what'' is being removed or added and ''how'' it is being removed or added will determine the nature of the reinforcement.
* Negative reinforcement is not punishment. The two, as explained above, differ in the increase (negative reinforcement) or decrease (punishment) of the future probability of a response. In negative reinforcement, the stimulus removed following a response is an aversive stimulus; if this stimulus were presented contingent on a response, it may also function as a positive punisher.
* The form of a stimulus is separate from its function in terms of whether it will reinforce or punish behavior. An event that may punish behavior for some may serve to reinforce behavior for others. Example: A child is repeatedly given detention for acting up in school, but the frequency of the bad behavior increases. Thus, the detention may be a reinforcer (could be positive or negative); perhaps the child now gets one-on-one attention from a teacher or perhaps they now avoid going home where they are often abused.
* Some reinforcement can be simultaneously positive and negative, such as a drug addict taking drugs for the added euphoria (a positive feeling) and eliminating withdrawal symptoms (which would be a negative feeling). Or, in a warm room, a current of external air serves as positive reinforcement because it is pleasantly cool and as negative reinforcement because it removes uncomfortable hot air.
* Reinforcement in the business world is essential in driving productivity. Employees are constantly motivated by the ability to receive a positive stimulus, such as a promotion or a bonus. Employees are also driven by negative reinforcement. This can be seen when employees are offered Saturdays off if they complete the weekly workload by Friday.
* Though negative reinforcement has a positive effect in the short term for a workplace (i.e. encourages a financially beneficial action), over-reliance on a negative reinforcement hinders the ability of workers to act in a creative, engaged way creating growth in the long term.&lt;ref name="Harter"&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Harter JK | title=Well-Being in the Workplace and its Relationship to Business Outcomes: A Review of the Gallup Studies|year=2002|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington D.C.| veditors = Keyes CL  | url = http://media.gallup.com/documents/whitePaper--Well-BeingInTheWorkplace.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both positive and negative reinforcement ''increase'' behavior. Most people, especially children, will learn to follow instruction by a mix of positive and negative reinforcement.&lt;ref name=Flora /&gt;

===Primary reinforcers===
A '''primary reinforcer''', sometimes called an ''unconditioned reinforcer'', is a stimulus that does not require [[associative learning|pairing with a different stimulus]] in order to function as a reinforcer and most likely has obtained this function through the evolution and its role in species' survival.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1974). About Behaviorism&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of primary reinforcers include food, water, and sex. Some primary reinforcers, such as certain drugs, may mimic the effects of other primary reinforcers. While these primary reinforcers are fairly stable through life and across individuals, the reinforcing value of different primary reinforcers varies due to multiple factors (e.g., genetics, experience). Thus, one person may prefer one type of food while another avoids it. Or one person may eat lots of food while another eats very little. So even though food is a primary reinforcer for both individuals, the value of food as a reinforcer differs between them.

===Secondary reinforcers{{anchor|Conditioned reinforcer}}===
A '''secondary reinforcer''', sometimes called a '''conditioned reinforcer'''&lt;!--Redirected here - bolded per MOS:BOLD--&gt;, is a stimulus or situation that has acquired its function as a reinforcer after [[associative learning|pairing with a stimulus]] that functions as a reinforcer. This stimulus may be a primary reinforcer or another conditioned reinforcer (such as money). An example of a secondary reinforcer would be the sound from a clicker, as used in [[clicker training]].  The sound of the clicker has been associated with praise or treats, and subsequently, the sound of the clicker may function as a reinforcer.  Another common example is the sound of people clapping – there is nothing inherently positive about hearing that sound, but we have learned that it is associated with praise and rewards.

When trying to distinguish primary and secondary reinforcers in human examples, use the "caveman test."  If the stimulus is something that a caveman would naturally find desirable (e.g., candy) then it is a primary reinforcer.  If, on the other hand, the caveman would not react to it (e.g., a dollar bill), it is a secondary reinforcer.  As with primary reinforcers, an organism can experience satiation and deprivation with secondary reinforcers.

===Other reinforcement terms===
* A generalized reinforcer is a conditioned reinforcer that has obtained the reinforcing function by pairing with many other reinforcers and functions as a reinforcer under a wide-variety of [[motivating operation]]s. (One example of this is money because it is paired with many other reinforcers).&lt;ref name=Miltenberger&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83}}
* In reinforcer sampling, a potentially reinforcing but unfamiliar stimulus is presented to an organism without regard to any prior behavior.
* Socially-mediated reinforcement (direct reinforcement) involves the delivery of reinforcement that requires the behavior of another organism.
* The [[Premack principle]] is a special case of reinforcement elaborated by [[David Premack]], which states that a highly preferred activity can be used effectively as a reinforcer for a less-preferred activity.&lt;ref name=Miltenberger/&gt;{{rp|123}}
* Reinforcement hierarchy is a list of actions, rank-ordering the most desirable to least desirable consequences that may serve as a reinforcer. A reinforcement hierarchy can be used to determine the relative frequency and desirability of different activities, and is often employed when applying the Premack principle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
* Contingent outcomes are more likely to reinforce behavior than non-contingent responses. Contingent outcomes are those directly linked to a [[causal]] behavior, such a light turning on being contingent on flipping a switch. Note that contingent outcomes are ''not'' necessary to demonstrate reinforcement, but perceived contingency may increase learning.
* Contiguous stimuli are stimuli closely associated by time and space with specific behaviors. They reduce the amount of time needed to learn a behavior while increasing its resistance to [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]]. Giving a dog a piece of food immediately after sitting is more contiguous with (and therefore more likely to reinforce) the behavior than a several minute delay in food delivery following the behavior.
* Noncontingent reinforcement refers to response-independent delivery of stimuli identified as reinforcers for some behaviors of that organism. However, this typically entails time-based delivery of stimuli identified as maintaining aberrant behavior, which decreases the rate of the target behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tucker M, Sigafoos J, Bushell H | title = Use of noncontingent reinforcement in the treatment of challenging behavior. A review and clinical guide | journal = Behavior Modification | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 529–47 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9755650 | doi = 10.1177/01454455980224005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent "reinforcement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Droleskey RE, Andrews K, Chiarantini L, DeLoach JR | title = Use of fluorescent probes for describing the process of encapsulation by hypotonic dialysis | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 326 | issue =  | pages = 73–80 | year = 1999 | pmc = 1284187 | doi = 10.1901/jaba.1999.32-237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural and artificial==
In his 1967 paper, ''Arbitrary and Natural Reinforcement'', [[Charles Ferster]] proposed classifying reinforcement into events that increase frequency of an operant as a natural consequence of the behavior itself, and events that are presumed to affect frequency by their requirement of human mediation, such as in a [[token economy]] where subjects are "rewarded" for certain behavior with an arbitrary token of a negotiable value. In 1970, Baer and Wolf created a name for the use of natural reinforcers called "behavior traps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Donald M. | last1 = Baer | first2 = Montrose M. | last2 = Wolf | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = The entry into natural communities of reinforcement | veditors = Ulrich R, Stachnik T, Mabry J | title = Control of human behavior | volume = 2 | pages = 319–24 | location = Glenview, IL | publisher = Scott Foresman }}&lt;/ref&gt; A behavior trap requires only a simple response to enter the trap, yet once entered, the trap cannot be resisted in creating general behavior change. It is the use of a behavioral trap that increases a person's repertoire, by exposing them to the naturally occurring reinforcement of that behavior.  Behavior traps have four characteristics:
* They are "baited" with virtually irresistible reinforcers that "lure" the student to the trap
* Only a low-effort response already in the repertoire is necessary to enter the trap
* Interrelated contingencies of reinforcement inside the trap motivate the person to acquire, extend, and maintain targeted academic/social skills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kohler FW, Greenwood CR | title = Toward a technology of generalization: The identification of natural contingencies of reinforcement | journal = The Behavior Analyst | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–26 | year = 1986 | pmid = 22478644 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* They can remain effective for long periods of time because the person shows few, if any, satiation effects

As can be seen from the above, artificial reinforcement is in fact created to build or develop skills, and to generalize, it is important that either a behavior trap is introduced to "capture" the skill and utilize naturally occurring reinforcement to maintain or increase it. This behavior trap may simply be a social situation that will generally result from a specific behavior once it has met a certain criterion (e.g., if you use edible reinforcers to train a person to say hello and smile at people when they meet them, after that skill has been built up, the natural reinforcer of other people smiling, and having more friendly interactions will naturally reinforce the skill and the edibles can be faded).{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== Intermittent reinforcement schedules ==
Much behavior is not reinforced every time it is emitted, and the pattern of intermittent reinforcement strongly affects how fast an operant response is learned, what its rate is at any given time, and how long it continues when reinforcement ceases.  The simplest rules controlling reinforcement are continuous reinforcement, where every response is reinforced, and extinction, where no response is reinforced. Between these extremes, more complex "schedules of reinforcement" specify the rules that determine how and when a response will be followed by a reinforcer.

Specific schedules of reinforcement reliably induce specific patterns of response, irrespective of the species being investigated (including humans in some conditions). However, the quantitative properties of behavior under a given schedule depend on the parameters of the schedule, and sometimes on other, non-schedule factors. The orderliness and predictability of behavior under schedules of reinforcement was evidence for [[B.F. Skinner]]'s claim that by using operant conditioning he could obtain "control over behavior", in a way that rendered the theoretical disputes of contemporary [[comparative psychology]] obsolete. The reliability of schedule control supported the idea that a [[radical behaviorist]] [[experimental analysis of behavior]] could be the foundation for a [[psychology]] that did not refer to mental or cognitive processes. The reliability of schedules also led to the development of [[applied behavior analysis]] as a means of controlling or altering behavior.

Many of the simpler possibilities, and some of the more complex ones, were investigated at great length by Skinner using [[Columbidae|pigeons]], but new schedules continue to be defined and investigated.

===Simple schedules===
[[File:Schedule of reinforcement.png|thumb|275px|right|A chart demonstrating the different response rate of the four simple schedules of reinforcement, each hatch mark designates a reinforcer being given]]
* '''Ratio schedule''' – the reinforcement depends only on the number of responses the organism has performed.
* '''Continuous reinforcement (CRF)''' – a schedule of reinforcement in which every occurrence of the instrumental response (desired response) is followed by the reinforcer.&lt;ref name=Miltenberger/&gt;{{rp|86}}
** Lab example: each time a rat presses a bar it gets a pellet of food.
** Real-world example: each time a dog defecates outside its owner gives it a treat; each time a person puts $1 in a candy machine and presses the buttons he receives a candy bar.

Simple schedules have a single rule to determine when a single type of reinforcer is delivered for a specific response.
* '''Fixed ratio''' (FR) – schedules deliver reinforcement after every ''n''th response.&lt;ref name=Miltenberger/&gt;{{rp|88}} An FR 1 schedule is synonymous with a CRF schedule.
** Example: FR 2 = every second desired response the subject makes is reinforced.
** Lab example: FR 5 = rat's bar-pressing behavior is reinforced with food after every 5 bar-presses in a [[Skinner box]].
** Real-world example: FR 10 = Used car dealer gets a $1000 bonus for each 10 cars sold on the lot.
* '''Variable ratio schedule''' (VR) – reinforced on average every ''n''th response, but not always on the ''n''th response.&lt;ref name=Miltenberger/&gt;{{rp|88}}
** Lab example: VR 4 = first pellet delivered on 2 bar presses, second pellet delivered on 6 bar presses, third pellet 4 bar presses (2 + 6 + 4 = 12; 12/3= 4 bar presses to receive pellet).
** Real-world example: slot machines (because, though the probability of hitting the jackpot is constant, the number of lever presses needed to hit the jackpot is variable).
* '''Fixed interval''' (FI) – reinforced after ''n'' amount of time.
** Example: FI 1-s = reinforcement provided for the first response after 1 second.
** Lab example: FI 15-s = rat's bar-pressing behavior is reinforced for the first bar press after 15 seconds passes since the last reinforcement.
** Real-world example: FI 30-min = a 30-minute washing machine cycle.
* '''Variable interval''' (VI) – reinforced on an average of ''n'' amount of time, but not always exactly ''n'' amount of time.&lt;ref name=Miltenberger/&gt;{{rp|89}}
** Example: VI 4-min = first pellet delivered after 2 minutes, second delivered after 6 minutes, third is delivered after 4 minutes (2 + 6 + 4 = 12; 12/ 3 = 4). Reinforcement is delivered on the average after 4 minutes.
** Lab example: VI 10-s = a rat's bar-pressing behavior is reinforced for the first bar press after an average of 10 seconds passes since the last reinforcement.
** Real-world example: VI 30-min = Going fishing—you might catch a fish after 10 minutes, then have to wait an hour, then have to wait 20 minutes.
* '''Fixed time''' (FT) – Provides a reinforcing stimulus at a fixed time since the last reinforcement delivery, regardless of whether the subject has responded or not. In other words, it is a non-contingent schedule.
** Lab example: FT 5-s = rat gets food every 5 seconds regardless of the behavior.
** Real-world example: FT 30-d = a person gets an annuity check every month regardless of behavior between checks
* '''Variable time''' (VT) – Provides reinforcement at an average variable time since last reinforcement, regardless of whether the subject has responded or not.

Simple schedules are utilized in many differential reinforcement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vollmer TR, Iwata BA | title = Differential reinforcement as treatment for behavior disorders: procedural and functional variations | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 393–417 | date = 1992 | pmid = 1509180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; procedures:
* '''Differential reinforcement of alternative behavior''' (DRA) - A conditioning procedure in which an undesired response is decreased by placing it on [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] or, less commonly, providing contingent punishment, while simultaneously providing reinforcement contingent on a desirable response. An example would be a teacher attending to a student only when they raise their hand, while ignoring the student when he or she calls out.
* '''Differential reinforcement of other behavior''' (DRO) – Also known as omission training procedures, an instrumental conditioning procedure in which a positive reinforcer is periodically delivered only if the participant does something other than the target response. An example would be reinforcing any hand action other than nose picking.&lt;ref name="Miltenberger" /&gt;{{rp|338}}
* '''Differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior''' (DRI) – Used to reduce a frequent behavior without [[punishment (psychology)|punishing]] it by reinforcing an incompatible response. An example would be reinforcing clapping to reduce nose picking 
* '''Differential reinforcement of low response rate''' (DRL) – Used to encourage low rates of responding. It is like an interval schedule, except that premature responses reset the time required between behavior.
** Lab example: DRL 10-s = a rat is reinforced for the first response after 10 seconds, but if the rat responds earlier than 10 seconds there is no reinforcement and the rat has to wait 10 seconds from that premature response without another response before bar pressing will lead to reinforcement.
** Real-world example: "If you ask me for a potato chip no more than once every 10 minutes, I will give it to you. If you ask more often, I will give you none."
* '''Differential reinforcement of high rate''' (DRH) – Used to increase high rates of responding. It is like an interval schedule, except that a minimum number of responses are required in the interval in order to receive reinforcement.
** Lab example: DRH 10-s/FR 15 = a rat must press a bar 15&amp;nbsp;times within a 10-second increment to get reinforced.
** Real-world example: "If [[Lance Armstrong]] is going to win the [[Tour de France]] he has to pedal ''x'' number of times during the ''y''-hour race."
*

====Effects of different types of simple schedules====
* Fixed ratio: activity slows after reinforcer is delivered, then response rates increase until the next reinforcer delivery (post-reinforcement pause).
* Variable ratio: rapid, steady rate of responding; most resistant to [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]].
* Fixed interval: responding increases towards the end of the interval; poor resistance to extinction.
* Variable interval: steady activity results, good resistance to extinction.
* Ratio schedules produce higher rates of responding than interval schedules, when the rates of reinforcement are otherwise similar.
* Variable schedules produce higher rates and greater resistance to [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]] than most fixed schedules. This is also known as the Partial Reinforcement Extinction Effect (PREE).
* The variable ratio schedule produces both the highest rate of responding and the greatest resistance to extinction (for example, the behavior of [[gambler]]s at [[slot machine]]s).
* Fixed schedules produce "post-reinforcement pauses" (PRP), where responses will briefly cease immediately following reinforcement, though the pause is a function of the upcoming response requirement rather than the prior reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Derenne A, Flannery KA | date = 2007 | title = Within Session FR Pausing. | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The PRP of a fixed interval schedule is frequently followed by a "scallop-shaped" accelerating rate of response, while fixed ratio schedules produce a more "angular" response.
*** fixed interval scallop: the pattern of responding that develops with fixed interval reinforcement schedule, performance on a fixed interval reflects subject's accuracy in telling time.
* Organisms whose schedules of reinforcement are "thinned" (that is, requiring more responses or a greater wait before reinforcement) may experience "ratio strain" if thinned too quickly. This produces behavior similar to that seen during extinction.
** Ratio strain: the disruption of responding that occurs when a fixed ratio response requirement is increased too rapidly.
** Ratio run: high and steady rate of responding that completes each ratio requirement. Usually higher ratio requirement causes longer post-reinforcement pauses to occur.
* Partial reinforcement schedules are more resistant to extinction than continuous reinforcement schedules.
** Ratio schedules are more resistant than interval schedules and variable schedules more resistant than fixed ones.
** Momentary changes in reinforcement value lead to dynamic changes in behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McSweeney |first1=Frances K. |last2=Murphy |first2=Eric S. |last3=Kowal |first3=Benjamin P. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Dynamic changes in reinforcer value: Some misconceptions and why you should care. |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |date=2001 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=341–349 |doi=10.1037/h0099952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound schedules===
&lt;!--Do these refer to the same behavior, the same reinforcers? Yes, they refer to the same behavior and same reinforcer except given at different schedules--&gt;
Compound schedules combine two or more different simple schedules in some way using the same reinforcer for the same behavior. There are many possibilities; among those most often used are:
* '''Alternative schedules''' – A type of compound schedule where two or more simple schedules are in effect and whichever schedule is completed first results in reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Iversen IH, Lattal KA | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uVYJAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Reinforcement&amp;f=false | title = Experimental Analysis of Behavior | date = 1991 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conjunctive schedules''' – A complex schedule of reinforcement where two or more simple schedules are in effect independently of each other, and requirements on all of the simple schedules must be met for reinforcement.
* '''Multiple schedules''' – Two or more schedules alternate over time, with a stimulus indicating which is in force. Reinforcement is delivered if the response requirement is met while a schedule is in effect.
** Example: FR4 when given a whistle and FI6 when given a bell ring.
* '''Mixed schedules''' – Either of two, or more, schedules may occur with no stimulus indicating which is in force. Reinforcement is delivered if the response requirement is met while a schedule is in effect.
** Example: FI6 and then VR3 without any stimulus warning of the change in schedule.
* '''Concurrent schedules''' – A complex reinforcement procedure in which the participant can choose any one of two or more simple reinforcement schedules that are available simultaneously. Organisms are free to change back and forth between the response alternatives at any time.
** Real-world example: changing channels on a television.
* '''Concurrent-chain schedule of reinforcement''' – A complex reinforcement procedure in which the participant is permitted to choose during the first link which of several simple reinforcement schedules will be in effect in the second link. Once a choice has been made, the rejected alternatives become unavailable until the start of the next trial.
* '''Interlocking schedules''' – A single schedule with two components where progress in one component affects progress in the other component. In an interlocking FR 60 FI 120-s schedule, for example, each response subtracts time from the interval component such that each response is "equal" to removing two seconds from the FI schedule.
* '''Chained schedules''' – Reinforcement occurs after two or more successive schedules have been completed, with a stimulus indicating when one schedule has been completed and the next has started
** Example: On an FR 10 schedule in the presence a red light, a pigeon pecks a green disc 10 times; then, a yellow light indicates an FR 3 schedule is active; after the pigeon pecks a yellow disc 3 times, a green light to indicates a VI 6-s schedule is in effect; if this were the final schedule in the chain, the pigeon would be reinforced for pecking a green disc on a VI 6-s schedule; however, all schedule requirements in the chain must be met before a reinforcer is provided.
* '''Tandem schedules''' – Reinforcement occurs when two or more successive schedule requirements have been completed, with no stimulus indicating when a schedule has been completed and the next has started.
** Example: VR 10, after it is completed the schedule is changed without warning to FR 10, after that it is changed without warning to FR 16, etc. At the end of the series of schedules, a reinforcer is finally given.
* '''Higher-order schedules''' – completion of one schedule is reinforced according to a second schedule; e.g. in FR2 (FI10 secs), two successive fixed interval schedules require completion before a response is reinforced.

===Superimposed schedules===
The [[psychology]] term ''superimposed schedules of reinforcement'' refers to a structure of rewards where two or more simple schedules of reinforcement operate simultaneously. Reinforcers can be positive, negative, or both. An example is a person who comes home after a long day at work. The behavior of opening the front door is rewarded by a big kiss on the lips by the person's spouse and a rip in the pants from the family dog jumping enthusiastically. Another example of superimposed schedules of reinforcement is a pigeon in an experimental cage pecking at a button. The pecks deliver a hopper of grain every 20th peck, and access to water after every 200 pecks.

Superimposed schedules of reinforcement are a type of compound schedule that evolved from the initial work on simple [[schedules of reinforcement]] by [[B.F. Skinner]] and his colleagues (Skinner and Ferster, 1957). They demonstrated that reinforcers could be delivered on schedules, and further that organisms behaved differently under different schedules. Rather than a reinforcer, such as food or water, being delivered every time as a consequence of some behavior, a reinforcer could be delivered after more than one instance of the behavior. For example, a [[pigeon]] may be required to peck a button switch ten times before food appears. This is a "ratio schedule". Also, a reinforcer could be delivered after an interval of time passed following a target behavior. An example is a [[rat]] that is given a food pellet immediately following the first response that occurs after two minutes has elapsed since the last lever press. This is called an "interval schedule".

In addition, ratio schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable number of behaviors by the individual organism. Likewise, interval schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable intervals of time following a single response by the organism. Individual behaviors tend to generate response rates that differ based upon how the reinforcement schedule is created. Much subsequent research in many labs examined the effects on behaviors of scheduling reinforcers.

If an organism is offered the opportunity to choose between or among two or more simple schedules of reinforcement at the same time, the reinforcement structure is called a "concurrent schedule of reinforcement". Brechner (1974, 1977) introduced the concept of superimposed [[schedules of reinforcement]] in an attempt to create a laboratory analogy of [[social trap]]s, such as when humans [[overharvest]] their fisheries or tear down their rainforests. Brechner created a situation where simple reinforcement schedules were superimposed upon each other. In other words, a single response or group of responses by an organism led to multiple consequences. Concurrent schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as "or" schedules, and superimposed schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as "and" schedules. Brechner and Linder (1981) and Brechner (1987) expanded the concept to describe how superimposed schedules and the [[social trap]] analogy could be used to analyze the way [[energy]] flows through [[system]]s.

Superimposed schedules of reinforcement have many real-world applications in addition to generating [[social trap]]s. Many different human individual and social situations can be created by superimposing simple reinforcement schedules. For example, a human being could have simultaneous tobacco and alcohol addictions. Even more complex situations can be created or simulated by superimposing two or more concurrent schedules. For example, a high school senior could have a choice between going to Stanford University or UCLA, and at the same time have the choice of going into the Army or the Air Force, and simultaneously the choice of taking a job with an internet company or a job with a software company. That is a reinforcement structure of three superimposed concurrent schedules of reinforcement.

Superimposed schedules of reinforcement can create the three classic conflict situations (approach–approach conflict, [[approach–avoidance conflict]], and avoidance–avoidance conflict) described by [[Kurt Lewin]] (1935) and can operationalize other Lewinian situations analyzed by his [[force field analysis]]. Other examples of the use of superimposed schedules of reinforcement as an analytical tool are its application to the contingencies of rent control (Brechner, 2003) and problem of toxic waste dumping in the Los Angeles County storm drain system (Brechner, 2010).

===Concurrent schedules===
In [[operant conditioning]], concurrent schedules of reinforcement are schedules of reinforcement that are simultaneously available to an animal subject or human participant, so that the subject or participant can respond on either schedule. For example, in a [[two-alternative forced choice]] task, a [[pigeon]] in a [[Skinner box]] is faced with two pecking keys; pecking responses can be made on either, and food reinforcement might follow a peck on either. The schedules of reinforcement arranged for pecks on the two keys can be different. They may be independent, or they may be linked so that behavior on one key affects the likelihood of reinforcement on the other.

It is not necessary for responses on the two schedules to be physically distinct. In an alternate way of arranging concurrent schedules, introduced by Findley in 1958, both schedules are arranged on a single key or other response device, and the subject can respond on a second key to change between the schedules. In such a "Findley concurrent" procedure, a stimulus (e.g., the color of the main key) signals which schedule is in effect.

Concurrent schedules often induce rapid alternation between the keys. To prevent this, a "changeover delay" is commonly introduced: each schedule is inactivated for a brief period after the subject switches to it.

When both the concurrent schedules are [[variable interval schedule of reinforcement|variable intervals]], a quantitative relationship known as the [[matching law]] is found between relative response rates in the two schedules and the relative reinforcement rates they deliver; this was first observed by [[R.J. Herrnstein]] in 1961. Matching law is a rule for instrumental behavior which states that the relative rate of responding on a particular response alternative equals the relative rate of reinforcement for that response (rate of behavior = rate of reinforcement). Animals and humans have a tendency to prefer choice in schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin TL, Yu CT, Martin GL, Fazzio D | year = 2006 | title = On Choice, Preference, and Preference For Choice. | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 234–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shaping==
{{Main|Shaping (psychology)}}
Shaping is reinforcement of successive approximations to a desired instrumental response. In training a rat to press a lever, for example, simply turning toward the lever is reinforced at first. Then, only turning and stepping toward it is reinforced. The outcomes of one set of behaviours starts the shaping process for the next set of behaviours, and the outcomes of that set prepares the shaping process for the next set, and so on. As training progresses, the response reinforced becomes progressively more like the desired behavior; each subsequent behaviour becomes a closer approximation of the final behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Schacter DL, Gilbert DT, Wegner DM | chapter = Chapter 7: Learning | title = Psychology | edition = 2nd | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York | year = 2011 | pages = 284–85 | isbn = 978-1-4292-3719-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaining==
{{Main|Chaining}}
Chaining involves linking discrete behaviors together in a series, such that each result of each behavior is both the reinforcement (or consequence) for the previous behavior, and the stimuli (or antecedent) for the next behavior. There are many ways to teach chaining, such as forward chaining (starting from the first behavior in the chain), backwards chaining (starting from the last behavior) and total task chaining (in which the entire behavior is taught from beginning to end, rather than as a series of steps). An example is opening a locked door. First the key is inserted, then turned, then the door opened.

Forward chaining would teach the subject first to insert the key. Once that task is mastered, they are told to insert the key, and taught to turn it. Once that task is mastered, they are told to perform the first two, then taught to open the door. Backwards chaining would involve the teacher first inserting and turning the key, and the subject then being taught to open the door. Once that is learned, the teacher inserts the key, and the subject is taught to turn it, then opens the door as the next step. Finally, the subject is taught to insert the key, and they turn and open the door. Once the first step is mastered, the entire task has been taught. Total task chaining would involve teaching the entire task as a single series, prompting through all steps. Prompts are faded (reduced) at each step as they are mastered.

==Persuasive communication and the reinforcement theory==
;Persuasive communication
:[[Persuasion]] [[Social influence|influences]] any person the way they think, act and feel. Persuasive skill tells about how people understand the concern, position and needs of the people. Persuasion can be classified into informal persuasion and formal persuasion.
;Informal persuasion
:This tells about the way in which a person interacts with colleagues and customers. The informal persuasion can be used in team, memos as well as e-mails.
;Formal persuasion
:This type of persuasion is used in writing customer letter, proposal and also for formal presentation to any customer or colleagues.
;Process of persuasion
:Persuasion relates how you influence people with your skills, experience, knowledge, leadership, qualities and team capabilities. Persuasion is an interactive process while getting the work done by others. Here are examples for which you can use persuasion skills in real time. Interview: you can prove your best talents, skills and expertise. Clients: to guide your clients for the achievement of the goals or targets. Memos: to express your ideas and views to coworkers for the improvement in the operations. Resistance identification and positive attitude are the vital roles of persuasion.

Persuasion is a form of human interaction. It takes place when one individual expects some particular response from one or more other individuals and deliberately sets out to secure the response through the use of communication. The communicator must realize that different groups have different values.&lt;ref name=Bettinghaus&gt;{{cite book | last = Bettinghaus | first = Erwin P. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Persuasive Communication | publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. | date = 1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24–25}}

In instrumental learning situations, which involve operant behavior, the persuasive communicator will present his message and then wait for the receiver to make a correct response. As soon as the receiver makes the response, the communicator will attempt to fix the response by some appropriate reward or reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Skinner BF | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=S9WNCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Reinforcement&amp;f=false | title = The Behavior of Organisms. An Experimental Analysis | location = New York | publisher = Appleton-Century-Crofts | year = 1938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conditional learning situations, where there is respondent behavior, the communicator presents his message so as to elicit the response he wants from the receiver, and the stimulus that originally served to elicit the response then becomes the reinforcing or rewarding element in conditioning.&lt;ref name=Bettinghaus/&gt;

==Mathematical models==
A lot of work has been done in building a mathematical model of reinforcement. This model is known as MPR, short for [[mathematical principles of reinforcement]]. Peter Killeen has made key discoveries in the field with his research on pigeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Killeen |first1=Peter R. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Mathematical principles of reinforcement |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=4 February 2010 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=105 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00033628 | url = http://cogprints.org/591/1/199802001.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The standard definition of behavioral reinforcement has been criticized as [[circular definition|circular]], since it appears to argue that response strength is increased by reinforcement, and defines reinforcement as something that increases response strength (i.e., response strength is increased by things that increase response strength). However, the correct usage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Skinner BF | veditors = Epstein R |title=Skinner for the classroom : selected papers |date=1982 |publisher=Research Press |location=Champaign, Ill. |isbn=978-0-87822-261-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; of reinforcement is that something is a reinforcer ''because'' of its effect on behavior, and not the other way around. It becomes circular if one says that a particular stimulus strengthens behavior because it is a reinforcer, and does not explain why a stimulus is producing that effect on the behavior. Other definitions have been proposed, such as F.D. Sheffield's "consummatory behavior contingent on a response", but these are not broadly used in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Franco J. | last1 = Vaccarino | first2 = Bernard B. | last2 = Schiff | first3 = Stephen E. | last3 = Glickman | editor-last1=Mowrer |editor-first1=Robert R. |editor-last2=editor-Klein |editor-first2=Stephen B. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Contemporary learning theories |date=1989 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J. |isbn=978-0-89859-915-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly understanding of the role reinforcers play is moving away from a "strengthening" effect to a "signalling" effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cowie S, Davison M, Elliffe D | title = Reinforcement: food signals the time and location of future food | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–86 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21765546 | pmc = 3136894 | doi = 10.1901/jeab.2011.96-63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the view that reinforcers increase responding because they signal the behaviours that a likely to result in reinforcement.  While in most practical applications, the effect of any given reinforcer will be the same regardless of whether the reinforcer is signalling or strengthening, this approach helps to explain a number of behavioural phenomenon including patterns of responding on intermittent reinforcement schedules (fixed interval scallops) and the [[differential outcomes effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCormack |first=Jessica |last2=Arnold-Saritepe |first2=Angela |last3=Elliffe |first3=Douglas | name-list-format = vanc |date= June 2017 | title=The differential outcomes effect in children with autism |journal=Behavioral Interventions |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=357–369 |doi=10.1002/bin.1489 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--There's more controversies that can be added here.--&gt;

===History of the terms===
In the 1920s Russian physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] may have been the first to use the word ''reinforcement'' with respect to behavior, but (according to [[James A Dinsmoor|Dinsmoor]]) he used its approximate Russian cognate sparingly, and even then it referred to strengthening an already-learned but weakening response. He did not use it, as it is today, for selecting and strengthening new behaviors. Pavlov's introduction of the word ''extinction'' (in Russian) approximates today's psychological use.

In popular use, ''positive reinforcement'' is often used as a synonym for ''[[reward system|reward]]'', with people (not behavior) thus being "reinforced", but this is contrary to the term's consistent technical usage, as it is a dimension of behavior, and not the person, which is strengthened. ''Negative reinforcement'' is often used by laypeople and even social scientists outside psychology as a synonym for ''[[punishment (psychology)|punishment]]''. This is contrary to modern technical use, but it was [[B.F. Skinner]] who first used it this way in his 1938 book. By 1953, however, he followed others in thus employing the word ''punishment'', and he re-cast ''negative reinforcement'' for the removal of aversive stimuli.

There are some within the field of behavior analysis&lt;ref name="Michael, J. 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michael J | year = 2005 | title = Positive and negative reinforcement, a distinction that is no longer necessary; or a better way to talk about bad things | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior Management | volume = 24 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 207–22 | doi = 10.1300/J075v24n01_15 | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | url = http://www.behavior.org/journals_BP/2000/JackMichael.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040609053011/http://www.behavior.org/journals_BP/2000/JackMichael.pdf | archive-date = 9 June 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who have suggested that the terms "positive" and "negative" constitute an unnecessary distinction in discussing reinforcement as it is often unclear whether stimuli are being removed or presented. For example, Iwata poses the question: "...is a change in temperature more accurately characterized by the presentation of cold (heat) or the removal of heat (cold)?"&lt;ref name="Iwata, B.A. 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwata BA | title = Negative reinforcement in applied behavior analysis: an emerging technology | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 361–78 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3323157 | pmc = 1286076 | doi = 10.1901/jaba.1987.20-361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|363}} Thus, reinforcement could be conceptualized as a pre-change condition replaced by a post-change condition that reinforces the behavior that followed the change in stimulus conditions.

== Applications ==

Reinforcement and punishment are ubiquitous in human social interactions, and a great many applications of operant principles have been suggested and implemented. Following are a few examples.

===Addiction and dependence===

Positive and negative reinforcement play central roles in the development and maintenance of [[addiction]] and [[drug dependence]]. An addictive drug is [[reward system|intrinsically rewarding]]; that is, it functions as [[#Primary reinforcers|a primary positive reinforcer]] of drug use. The brain's reward system assigns it [[incentive salience]] (i.e., it is "wanted" or "desired"),&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edwards S | title = Reinforcement principles for addiction medicine; from recreational drug use to psychiatric disorder | journal = Progress in Brain Research | volume = 223 | issue =  | pages = 63–76 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26806771 | doi = 10.1016/bs.pbr.2015.07.005 | quote = Abused substances (ranging from alcohol to psychostimulants) are initially ingested at regular occasions according to their positive reinforcing properties. Importantly, repeated exposure to rewarding substances sets off a chain of secondary reinforcing events, whereby cues and contexts associated with drug use may themselves become reinforcing and thereby contribute to the continued use and possible abuse of the substance(s) of choice.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is secondary reinforcement (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug [addiction], cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing&amp;nbsp;... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such secondary reinforcement processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Negative reinforcement is a special condition associated with a strengthening of behavioral responses that terminate some ongoing (presumably aversive) stimulus. In this case we can define a negative reinforcer as a motivational stimulus that strengthens such an “escape” response. Historically, in relation to drug addiction, this phenomenon has been consistently observed in humans whereby drugs of abuse are self-administered to quench a motivational need in the state of withdrawal (Wikler, 1952). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC | title = From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation | journal = The European Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 1124–43 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22487042 | pmc = 3325516 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.07990.x | quote = When a Pavlovian CS+ is attributed with incentive salience it not only triggers ‘wanting’ for its UCS, but often the cue itself becomes highly attractive – even to an irrational degree. This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience. The CS becomes hard not to look at (Wiers &amp; Stacy, 2006; Hickey et al., 2010a; Piech et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2011). The CS even takes on some incentive properties similar to its UCS. An attractive CS often elicits behavioral motivated approach, and sometimes an individual may even attempt to ‘consume’ the CS somewhat as its UCS (e.g., eat, drink, smoke, have sex with, take as drug). ‘Wanting’ of a CS can turn also turn the formerly neutral stimulus into an instrumental conditioned reinforcer, so that an individual will work to obtain the cue (however, there exist alternative psychological mechanisms for conditioned reinforcement too). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML | title = Pleasure systems in the brain | journal = Neuron | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 646–64 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25950633 | pmc = 4425246 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018 | quote = An important goal in future for addiction neuroscience is to understand how intense motivation becomes narrowly focused on a particular target. Addiction has been suggested to be partly due to excessive incentive salience produced by sensitized or hyper-reactive dopamine systems that produce intense ‘wanting’ (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). But why one target becomes more ‘wanted’ than all others has not been fully explained. In addicts or agonist-stimulated patients, the repetition of dopamine-stimulation of incentive salience becomes attributed to particular individualized pursuits, such as taking the addictive drug or the particular compulsions. In Pavlovian reward situations, some cues for reward become more ‘wanted’ more than others as powerful motivational magnets, in ways that differ across individuals (Robinson et al., 2014b; Saunders and Robinson, 2013).&amp;nbsp;... However, hedonic effects might well change over time. As a drug was taken repeatedly, mesolimbic dopaminergic sensitization could consequently occur in susceptible individuals to amplify ‘wanting’ (Leyton and Vezina, 2013; Lodge and Grace, 2011; Wolf and Ferrario, 2010), even if opioid hedonic mechanisms underwent down-regulation due to continual drug stimulation, producing ‘liking’ tolerance. Incentive-sensitization would produce addiction, by selectively magnifying cue-triggered ‘wanting’ to take the drug again, and so powerfully cause motivation even if the drug became less pleasant (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). }}&lt;/ref&gt; so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving.  In addition, stimuli associated with drug use&amp;nbsp;– e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use&amp;nbsp;– become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug.&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt; These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become [[#Secondary reinforcers|conditioned positive reinforcers]] of continued use.&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt; Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of [[drug paraphernalia]] as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing [[relapse]] upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.

In drug dependent individuals, negative reinforcement occurs when a drug is [[self-administration|self-administered]] in order to alleviate or "escape" the symptoms of [[physical dependence]] (e.g., [[tremor]]s and sweating) and/or [[psychological dependence]] (e.g., [[anhedonia]], restlessness, irritability, and anxiety) that arise during the state of [[drug withdrawal]].&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;

===Animal training===
{{main|Animal training}}
Animal trainers and pet owners were applying the principles and practices of operant conditioning long before these ideas were named and studied, and animal training still provides one of the clearest and most convincing examples of operant control. Of the concepts and procedures described in this article, a few of the most salient are: availability of immediate reinforcement (e.g. the ever-present bag of dog yummies); contingency, assuring that reinforcement follows the desired behavior and not something else; the use of secondary reinforcement, as in sounding a clicker immediately after a desired response; shaping,  as in gradually getting a dog to jump higher and higher;  intermittent reinforcement,  reducing the frequency of those yummies to induce persistent behavior without satiation; chaining, where a complex behavior is gradually put together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = McGreevy PD, Boakes RA  |title=Carrots and sticks: principles of animal training |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-68691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child behaviour – parent management training ===
{{Main|Parent management training}}
Providing positive reinforcement for appropriate child behaviors is a major focus of parent management training. Typically, parents learn to reward appropriate behavior through social rewards (such as praise, smiles, and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child).&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010&gt;Kazdin AE (2010). Problem-solving skills training and parent management training for oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QLzBv53CU2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Reinforcement&amp;f=false Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents (2nd ed.)],'' 211–226. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called "successive approximations").&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMTO&gt;Forgatch MS, Patterson GR (2010). Parent management training — Oregon model: An intervention for antisocial behavior in children and adolescents.

New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also use indirect rewards such through [[progress chart]]s. Providing positive reinforcement in the classroom can be beneficial to student success. When applying positive reinforcement to students, it's crucial to make it individualized to that student's needs. This way, the student understands why they are receiving the praise, they can accept it, and eventually learn to continue the action that was earned by positive reinforcement. For example, using rewards or extra recess time might apply to some students more, whereas others might accept the enforcement by receiving stickers or check marks indicating praise.

===Economics===
{{main|Behavioral economics}}
{{further|Consumer demand tests (animals)}}
Both psychologists and economists have become interested in applying operant concepts and findings to the behavior of humans in the marketplace. An example
is the analysis of consumer demand, as indexed by the amount of a commodity that is purchased. In economics, the degree to which price influences consumption is called "the price elasticity of demand." Certain commodities are more elastic than others; for example, a change in price of certain foods may have a large effect on the amount bought, while gasoline and other essentials may be less affected by price changes. In terms of operant analysis, such effects may be interpreted in terms of motivations of consumers and the relative value of the commodities as reinforcers.&lt;ref&gt;Domjan, M. (2009). The Principles of Learning and Behavior. Wadsworth Publishing Company. 6th Edition. pages 244–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gambling – variable ratio scheduling ===
As stated earlier in this article, a variable ratio schedule yields reinforcement after the emission of an unpredictable number of responses.  This schedule typically generates rapid, persistent responding. Slot machines pay off on a variable ratio schedule, and they produce just this sort of persistent lever-pulling behavior in gamblers.  Because the machines are programmed to pay out less money than they take in, the persistent slot-machine user invariably loses in the long run.  Slots machines, and thus variable ratio reinforcement, have often been blamed as a factor underlying gambling addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lozano Bleda JH, Pérez Nieto MA | title = Impulsivity, intelligence, and discriminating reinforcement contingencies in a fixed-ratio 3 schedule | journal = The Spanish Journal of Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 922–9 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23156902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nudge theory ===
{{Main|Nudge theory}}
Nudge theory (or nudge) is a concept in [[behavioural science]], [[political theory]] and [[economics]] which argues that positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions to try to achieve non-forced [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] can [[Social influence|influence]] the motives, incentives and [[decision making]] of groups and individuals, at least as effectively – if not more effectively – than direct instruction, legislation, or enforcement.

===Praise===
{{Main|Praise}}
The concept of praise as a means of behavioral reinforcement in humans is rooted in B.F. Skinner's model of operant conditioning. Through this lens, praise has been viewed as a means of positive reinforcement, wherein an observed behavior is made more likely to occur by contingently praising said behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazdin|first1=Alan|title=History of behavior modification: Experimental foundations of contemporary research|date=1978|publisher=University Park Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of praise in promoting positive behaviors, notably in the study of teacher and parent use of praise on child in promoting improved behavior and academic performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker GL, Barnes HJ | title = Superior vena cava syndrome: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment | journal = American Journal of Critical Care | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–64 | date = July 1992 | pmc = 1307879 | doi = 10.1901/jaba.1983.16-243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"/&gt; but also in the study of work performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crowell CR, Anderson DC, Abel DM, Sergio JP | title = Task clarification, performance feedback, and social praise: Procedures for improving the customer service of bank tellers | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–71 | date = 1988 | pmid = 16795713 | pmc = 1286094 | doi = 10.1901/jaba.1988.21-65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise has also been demonstrated to reinforce positive behaviors in non-praised adjacent individuals (such as a classmate of the praise recipient) through vicarious reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Kazdin, 1973"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman NC | title = Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the external auditory canal | journal = Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 214–5 | date = February 1992 | pmc = 1310808 | doi = 10.1901/jaba.1973.6-71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise may be more or less effective in changing behavior depending on its form, content and delivery. In order for praise to effect positive behavior change, it must be contingent on the positive behavior (i.e., only administered after the targeted behavior is enacted), must specify the particulars of the behavior that is to be reinforced, and must be delivered sincerely and credibly.&lt;ref name="Brophy, 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brophy|first1=Jere | name-list-format = vanc |title=On praising effectively|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=1981|volume=81|issue=5|jstor=1001606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging the effect of praise as a positive reinforcement strategy, numerous behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions have incorporated the use of praise in their protocols.&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simonsen|first1=Brandi|last2=Fairbanks|first2=Sarah|last3=Briesch|first3=Amy|last4=Myers|first4=Diane|last5=Sugai|first5=George | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evidence-based Practices in Classroom Management: Considerations for Research to Practice|journal=Education and Treatment of Children|date=2008|volume=31|issue=1|pages=351–380|doi=10.1353/etc.0.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisz &amp; Kazdin, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weisz|first1=John R.|last2=Kazdin|first2=Alan E. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents|date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLzBv53CU2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Reinforcement&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic use of praise is recognized as an evidence-based practice in both classroom management&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008" /&gt; and parenting training interventions,&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garland AF, Hawley KM, Brookman-Frazee L, Hurlburt MS | title = Identifying common elements of evidence-based psychosocial treatments for children's disruptive behavior problems | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 505–14 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18356768 | doi = 10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816765c2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though praise is often subsumed in intervention research into a larger category of positive reinforcement, which includes strategies such as strategic attention and behavioral rewards.

{{Main|Loot box}}
As part of a trend in the [[video game monetization|monetization of video games]] in the 2010s, some games offered "loot boxes" as rewards or purchasable by real-world funds that offered a random selection of in-game items, distributed by rarity. The practice has been tied to the same methods that slot machines and other gambling devices dole out rewards, as it follows a variable rate schedule. While the general perception that loot boxes are a form of gambling, the practice is only classified as such in a few countries as gambling and otherwise legal. However, methods to use those items as virtual currency for online gambling or trading for real-world money has created a [[skin gambling]] market that is under legal evaluation.&lt;ref name="eg pegi"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-11-are-loot-boxes-gambling | title = Are loot boxes gambling? | first = Vic | last = Hood | name-list-format = vanc | date = October 12, 2017 | access-date = October 12, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dzogchen A.png|thumb|Tibetan letter "A" inside a thigle. The A, which corresponds to the sound ‘ahh’,{{sfn|Norbu|2002|p=56}} represents kadag while the thigle represents lhun grub.]]
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
In [[Dzogchen]] teaching, '''rigpa''' ({{bo|t=རིག་པ་|w=rig pa}}; Skt. [[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidyā]]; "knowledge") is the knowledge of the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|ground]].{{refn|group=note|''ghzi''; Skrt. ''ālaya''{{sfn|Schaik|2004|p=5}}}} The opposite of rigpa is marigpa ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]], ignorance).

==Definition==
''Rigpa'' is the knowledge of the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|ground]].{{refn|group=note|''ghzi''; Skrt. ''ālaya''{{sfn|Schaik|2004|p=5}}}} [[Erik Pema Kunsang]] translates a text which provides basic definitions of rigpa and marigpa in a Dzogchen context:
{{quote|Unknowing (marigpa) is not knowing the nature of mind. Knowing (rigpa) is the knowing of the original wakefulness that is personal experience.{{sfn|Kunsang|2006|p=Chapter 15}}}}
In Dzogchen, a fundamental point of practice is to distinguish rigpa from sems (''[[citta]]'', (grasping) mind).{{sfn|Kunsang|2012|p=154}}

===Kadag and lhungrub===
Rigpa has two aspects, namely ''kadag'' and ''lhun grub''.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=32}} ''Kadag'' means "purity" or specifically "primordial purity".{{sfn|Rinpoche Dzogchen Ponlop|2003}}{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=30}} ''Lhun grub'' in Tibetan normally implies automatic, self-caused or spontaneous actions or processes.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=49-50}} As quality of ''rigpa'' it means "spontaneous presence"{{sfn|Rinpoche Dzogchen Ponlop|2003}}{{refn|group=note|name="lhun grub"|See also [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/lhun_grub rywiki, ''lhun grub'']}} It may also mean "having a self-contained origin", being primordially Existent, without an origin, self-existent.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=49-50}} This division is the Dzogchen-equivalent of the more common Mahayana wisdom and compassion division.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=32}}

===Full measure of rigpa===
Citing Dodrupchen Jikme Tenpe Nyima, the 14th Dalai Lama states the full measure of rigpa occurs with the [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Four_visions third vision].{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=183-4}}

==Practice==
{{See also|Dzogchen#Main practice}}

Dzogchen practices aim to attain rigpa and integrate this into everyday life:
{{quote|The practical training of the Dzogchen path is traditionally, and most simply, described in terms of View, Meditation and Action. To see directly the Absolute state, the Ground of our being is the View; the way of stabilising that view, and making it an unbroken experience is Meditation; and integrating the View into our entire reality, and life, is what is meant by Action.&lt;ref&gt;Sogyal Rinpoche (1992), ''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying'', p.151]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Menngagde]] or 'Instruction Class' of Dzogchen teachings are divided into two parts: ''Trekchö'' and ''Tögal'' (thod rgal). Ron Garry: 
{{quote|The practice is that of Cutting through Solidity (khregs chod), which is related to primordial purity (ka dag); and Direct Vision of Reality (thod rgal), which is related to spontaneous presence (Ihun grub).&lt;ref name="Dudjom Rinpoche 2005, page 296"&gt;Dudjom Rinpoche. ''Wisdom Nectar. '' Snow Lion 2005, page 296.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{About|the moral panic|abuse administered under the guise of religion|Religious abuse}}
[[File:Messenoire.jpg|Engraving by Henry de Malvost in the book ''Le Satanisme et la Magie'' by [[Jules Bois]] depicting a [[Black Mass]]|thumb |325px]]

'''Satanic ritual abuse''' ('''SRA''', sometimes known as '''ritual abuse''', '''ritualistic abuse''', '''organised abuse''', '''sadistic ritual abuse''', and other variants) was the subject of a [[moral panic]] (often referred to as the '''satanic panic''') that originated in the [[United States]] in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s. Allegations of SRA involved reports of [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]] of people in the context of [[occult]] or [[Theistic Satanism|Satanic]] rituals. In its most extreme form, allegations involve a conspiracy of a worldwide SRA organisation that includes the wealthy and powerful of the world elite in which children are abducted or bred for sacrifices, [[child pornography|pornography]] and [[prostitution]].

Nearly every aspect of SRA was controversial, including its definition, the source of the allegations and proof thereof, testimonies of alleged victims, and court cases involving the allegations and criminal investigations. The panic affected lawyers', therapists', and social workers' handling of allegations of [[child sexual abuse]]. Allegations initially brought together widely dissimilar groups, including religious fundamentalists, police investigators, child advocates, therapists, and clients in [[psychotherapy]]. The movement gradually secularized, dropping or deprecating the "satanic" aspects of the allegations in favor of names that were less overtly religious such as "sadistic" or simply "ritual abuse" and becoming more associated with [[dissociative identity disorder]] and anti-government [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].

Initial publicity came via the book ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' (1980), and was sustained and popularized throughout the decade by the [[McMartin preschool trial]]. Testimonials, symptom lists, rumors, and techniques to investigate or uncover memories of SRA were disseminated through professional, popular, and religious conferences, as well as through the attention of [[talk show]]s, sustaining and further spreading the moral panic throughout the United States and beyond. In some cases, allegations resulted in criminal trials with varying results; after seven years in court, the McMartin trial resulted in no convictions for any of the accused, while other cases resulted in lengthy sentences, some of which were later reversed. Scholarly interest in the topic slowly built, eventually resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon was a moral panic, which, as Sarah Hughes observed in 2017, "involved hundreds of accusations that devil-worshipping paedophiles were operating America's white middle-class suburban daycare centers."&lt;ref&gt;BERNIER, C., SEWELL, B., MOYNIHAN, S., &amp; WITHAM, N. (2017). Editors' Note. Journal of American Studies, 51(3), V-Vii. doi:10.1017/S0021875817000858&lt;/ref&gt;

Official investigations produced no evidence of widespread conspiracies or of the slaughter of thousands; only a small number of verified crimes have even remote similarities to tales of SRA.&lt;ref name="Goleman1994"/&gt; In the latter half of the 1990s, interest in SRA declined and skepticism became the default position, with very few researchers giving any credence to the existence of SRA.

The underpinnings for the contemporary moral panic were found in a rise of five factors in the years leading up to the 1980s: the establishment of [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christianity]] and political organization of the [[Moral Majority]]; the rise of the [[anti-cult movement]] which spread ideas of abusive [[cult]]s kidnapping and [[brainwashing]] children and teens; the appearance of the [[Church of Satan]] and other explicitly [[Satanist]] groups that added a kernel of truth to the existence of Satanic cults; the development of the [[social work]] or child protection field, and its struggle to have [[child sexual abuse]] recognized as a social problem and a serious crime; and the popularization of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[repressed memory]], and corresponding survivor movement.{{sfn|Bromley|Richardson|Best|1991 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt1uw2QOmDQC&amp;pg=PA5 5–10]}}

{{Main article |Michelle Remembers |McMartin preschool trial}}
''Michelle Remembers'', written by Michelle Smith and her husband, the psychiatrist [[Lawrence Pazder]], was published in 1980. Now [[Michelle Remembers#Criticism and debunking|discredited]], the book was written in the form of an autobiography, presenting the first modern claim that child abuse was linked to Satanic rituals.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA14 14–15]}} Pazder was also responsible for coining the term "ritual abuse."&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt; ''Michelle Remembers'' provided a model for numerous allegations of SRA that ensued later in the same decade.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA14 14–15]}}&lt;ref name=Spanos&gt;{{cite book |last=Spanos |first=NP |authorlink=Nicholas Spanos |title=Multiple Identities &amp; False Memories: A Sociocognitive Perspective |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |year=1996 |pages=269–85 |isbn=1-55798-340-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of the book's success, Pazder developed a high media profile, gave lectures and training on SRA to law enforcement, and by September 1990 had acted as a consultant on more than 1,000 SRA cases, including the McMartin preschool trial. Prosecutors used ''Michelle Remembers'' as a guide when preparing cases against alleged Satanists.&lt;ref name="Commercial Appeal"&gt;{{cite news |last=Downing |first=Shirley |last2=Charlier |first2=|title=Justice Aborted: A 1980s Witch-Hunt |publisher=[[The Commercial Appeal]] |date=January 17–23, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Michelle Remembers'', along with other accounts portrayed as survivor stories, are suspected to have influenced later allegations of SRA,{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA14 14–15]}}{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=55}} and the book has been suggested as a causal factor in the later epidemic of SRA allegations.{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA60 60–62]}}&lt;ref name="wenegrat1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Theater of Disorder: Patients, Doctors, and the Construction of Illness |last=Wenegrat |first=Brant |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2001 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=o5i5utgOjvgC&amp;pg=PA190 190–92] |isbn=0-19-514087-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Assessment and Investigation of Ritual Abuse |last=Ney |first=Tara |title=True and False Allegations of Child Sexual Abuse: Assessment and Case Management |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1995 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BggJjhbBJzwC&amp;pg=PA304 304] |isbn=0-87630-758-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 1980s, during the implementation of [[mandatory reporting]] laws, saw a large increase in child protection investigations in [[United States|America]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and other developed countries, along with a heightened public awareness of [[child abuse]]. The investigation of incest allegations in [[California]] was also changed, with cases led by [[social work]]ers who used leading and coercive interviewing techniques that had been avoided by police investigators. Such changes in the prosecution of cases of alleged incest resulted in an increase in confessions by fathers in exchange for [[plea bargain]]s.{{sfn|Nathan|Snedeker|1995|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, some children in child protection cases began making allegations of horrific physical and sexual abuse by caregivers within organized rituals, claiming sexual abuse in Satanic rituals and the use of Satanic symbols.

In 1983, charges were laid in the [[McMartin preschool trial]], a major case in California, which received attention throughout the United States and contained allegations of satanic ritual abuse. The case caused tremendous polarization in how to interpret the available evidence.{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=58}} Shortly afterward, more than 100 preschools across the country became the object of similar sensationalist allegations, which were eagerly and uncritically reported by the press.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA117 117]}} Throughout the McMartin trial, media coverage of the defendants (Peggy McMartin and Ray Buckey) was unrelentingly negative, focusing only on statements by the prosecution.{{sfn |Eberle |Eberle |1993}} Michelle Smith and other alleged survivors met with parents involved in the trial, and it is believed that they influenced testimony against the accused.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA15 15]}}{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}}{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA56 56]}}{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |p=89}}

[[Kee MacFarlane]], a social worker employed by the [[Children's Institute International]], developed a new way to interrogate children with [[anatomically correct doll]]s and used them in an effort to assist disclosures of abuse with the McMartin children. After asking the children to point to the places on the dolls where they had allegedly been touched and asking [[leading question]]s, MacFarlane diagnosed sexual abuse in virtually all the McMartin children.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=79–80}} She coerced disclosures by using lengthy interviews that rewarded discussions of abuse and punished denials. The trial testimony that resulted from such methods was often contradictory and vague on all details except for the assertion that the abuse had occurred.{{sfn |Eberle |Eberle |1993}} Although the initial charges in the McMartin case featured allegations of Satanic abuse and a vast conspiracy, these features were dropped relatively early in the trial, and prosecution continued only for non-ritual allegations of child abuse against only two defendants.&lt;ref name=Intimate&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=P |title=Intimate enemies: moral panics in contemporary Great Britain |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers|Aldine de Gruyter]] |location=New York |year=1992 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JQQWfqtES5MC&amp;pg=PA151 151–76] |isbn=0-202-30435-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of testimony, McMartin and Buckey were [[acquittal|acquitted]] on 52 of 65 counts, and the jury was deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges against Buckey, with 11 of 13 jurors choosing not guilty. Buckey was re-charged and two years later released without conviction.{{sfn |Eberle |Eberle |1993}}

===Conspiracy accusations===
In 1984 MacFarlane warned a congressional committee of [[scatological]] behavior and animals being slaughtered in bizarre rituals that children were forced to watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacFarlane |first=K |title=Child Abuse and Day Care: Joint hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Committee of Ways and Means, and Select committee on Children, Youth, and Families" (testimony by [[Kee MacFarlane]]) |date=1984-09-17 |pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the [[United States Congress]] doubled its budget for child-protection programs. Psychiatrist [[Roland Summit]] delivered conferences in the wake of the McMartin trial and depicted the phenomenon as a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] that involved anyone skeptical of the phenomenon.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=102–03}} By 1986, social worker Carol Darling argued to a [[grand jury]] that the conspiracy reached the government.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=102–03}} Her husband Brad Darling gave conference presentations about a Satanic conspiracy of great antiquity which he believed now permeated American communities.{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA60 60–62]}}

By the late 1980s, therapists or patients who believed someone had suffered from SRA could suggest solutions that included [[Christian psychology|Christian psychotherapy]], [[exorcism]], and support groups whose members self-identified as "anti-Satanic warriors."{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA69 69]}} Federal funding was increased for research on child abuse, with large portions of the funding allocated for research on child sexual abuse. Funding was also provided for conferences supporting the idea of SRA, adding a veneer of respectability to the idea as well as offering an opportunity for prosecutors to exchange advice on how to best secure convictions—with tactics including destruction of notes, refusing to tape interviews with children, and destroying or refusing to share evidence with the defense.{{sfn|Nathan|Snedeker|1995}} Had proof been found, SRA would have represented the first occasion where an organized and secret criminal activity had been discovered by mental health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=1-55798-521-9 |editor=DeRivera J |editor2=Sarbin T |title=Believed-In-Imaginings: The Narrative Construction of Reality |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |year=1998 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=203 |chapter=Construction of Satanic Ritual Abuse and the Creation of False Memories |last=Victor |first=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 [[Geraldo Rivera]] produced a national television special on the alleged secret cults, claiming "Estimates are that there are over one million Satanists in [the United States and they are] linked in a highly organized, secretive network."{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA32 32–33]}} Tapings of this and similar talk show episodes were subsequently used by [[Fundamentalism|religious fundamentalists]], [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapists]], [[social work]]ers and police to promote the idea that a conspiracy of Satanic cults existed and was committing serious crimes.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA45 45], [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA69 69], [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA166 166], [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA254 254] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA343 343]}}

In the 1990s psychologist D. Corydon Hammond publicized a detailed theory of ritual abuse drawn from [[hypnotherapy]] sessions with his patients, alleging they were victims of a worldwide conspiracy of organized, secretive [[Clandestine cell system|clandestine cells]] who used torture, [[mind control]] and ritual abuse to create [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personalities]] that could be "activated" with code words; the victims were allegedly trained as assassins, prostitutes, drug traffickers, and child sex workers (to create [[child pornography]]). Hammond claimed his patients had revealed the conspiracy was masterminded by a Jewish doctor in [[Nazi Germany]], but who now worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] with a goal of worldwide domination by a Satanic cult. The cult was allegedly composed of respectable, powerful members of society who used the funds generated to further their agenda. Missing memories among the victims and absence of evidence was cited as evidence of the power and effectiveness of this cult in furthering its agenda. Hammond's claims gained considerable attention, due in part to his prominence in the field of [[hypnosis]] and psychotherapy.{{sfn |McNally |2003 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=88Axi0huzYwC&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 235–37]}}

===Religious roots and secularization===
Satanic ritual abuse brought together several groups normally unlikely to associate, including psychotherapists, self-help groups, religious fundamentalists and law enforcement.&lt;ref name = DeYoung1994/&gt;  Initial accusations were made in the context of the rising political power of [[Christian right|conservative Christianity]] within the United States,&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt; and religious fundamentalists enthusiastically promoted rumors of SRA.&lt;ref name=Intimate/&gt; Psychotherapists who were actively Christian advocated for the diagnosis of [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID); soon after, accounts similar to ''Michelle Remembers'' began to appear, with some therapists believing the alter egos of some patients were the result of [[demonic possession]].&lt;ref name=Spanos/&gt; [[Protestantism]] was instrumental in starting, spreading, and maintaining rumors through sermons about the dangers of SRA, lectures by purported experts, and prayer sessions, including showings of the 1987 Geraldo Rivera television special.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA46 46–47] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA68 68–70]}} Secular proponents appeared,{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA2 2], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA12 12], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA18 18] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}} and child protection workers became significantly involved. Law enforcement trainers, many themselves strongly religious, became strong promoters of the claims and self-described "experts" on the topic. Their involvement in child sexual abuse cases produced more allegations of SRA, adding credibility to the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt; As the explanations for SRA were distanced from [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christianity and associated with "survivor" groups, the motivations ascribed to purported Satanists shifted from combating a religious nemesis, to mind control and abuse as an end to itself.&lt;ref name=Frankfurter2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frankfurter |first=D |year=2003 |volume=50 |journal=Numen |title=The satanic ritual abuse panic as religious-studies data |pages=108–17 |doi=10.1163/156852703321103265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinicians, psychotherapists and social workers documented clients with alleged histories of SRA,&lt;ref name = Donner/&gt;&lt;ref name=VS&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinason |first=V |title=Treating survivors of satanist abuse |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |year=1994 |isbn=0-415-10543-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonker1991&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jonker |first=F |author2=Jonker-Bakker P  |year=1991 |title=Experiences with ritualist child sexual abuse: a case study from the Netherlands |journal=Child Abuse and Neglect |volume=15 |pages=191–96 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429991 |accessdate=2007-10-20 |pmid=2043971 |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(91)90064-K |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the claims of therapists were unsubstantiated beyond the testimonies of their clients.&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA86 86–87]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA192 192–95]}}

===International spread===
In 1987 a list of "indicators" was published by Catherine Gould,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=C |title=Satanic ritual abuse: child victims, adult survivors, system response |journal=California Psychologist |year=1987 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a broad array of vague symptoms that were ultimately common, non-specific and subjective, capable of diagnosing SRA in most young children.&lt;ref name=Intimate/&gt; By the late 1980s allegations began to appear throughout the world (including [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Scandinavia]]), in part enabled by [[English language|English]] as a common international language and in the United Kingdom, assisted by Gould's list of indicators. Belief in SRA spread rapidly through the ranks of mental health professionals (despite an absence of evidence) through a variety of continuing education seminars, during which attendees were urged to believe in the reality of Satanic cults their victims, and not to question the extreme and bizarre memories uncovered. Proof was provided in the form of unconnected bits of information such as pictures drawn by patients, heavy metal album covers, historical folklore about devil worshipers, and pictures of mutilated animals. During the seminars, patients provided testimonials of their experiences and presenters stressed that recovering memories was important for healing.{{sfn |McNally |2003 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=88Axi0huzYwC&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 244]}}

Some [[Feminism|feminist]] critics of the SRA diagnoses maintained that, in the course of attempting to purge society of evil, the panic of the 1980s and 1990s obscured real child-abuse issues, a concern echoed by Gary Clapton.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |p=1}} In England, the SRA panic diverted resources and attention from proven abuse cases; this resulted in a hierarchy of abuse in which SRA was the most serious form, physical and sexual abuse being minimized and/or marginalized, and "mere" physical abuse no longer worthy of intervention.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=14–18}} In addition, as criticism of SRA investigation increased, the focus by social workers on SRA resulted in a large loss of credibility to the profession.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=23–28}} SRA, with its sensational makeup of many victims abused by many victimizers, ended up robbing the far more common and proven issue of [[incest]] of much of its societal significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armstrong |first=L |title=Rocking the Cradle of Sexual Politics |publisher=[[Addison–Wesley]] |year=1994 |location=Reading, Mass. |pages=257–59 |isbn=0-7043-4460-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Center for Abuse and Neglect devised the term "religious abuse" to describe [[exorcism]], [[poison]]ing, and drowning of children in non-satanic religious settings in order to avoid confusion with SRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodman |first=G |last2=Qin |first2=J |last3=Bottoms |first3=BL |last4=Shaver |first4=PR |title=Characteristics and Sources of Allegations of Ritualistic Child Abuse |publisher=Center for Abuse and Neglect |year=1994 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA223 223–24]}}

By the early 1990s, the phrase "Satanic ritual abuse" was featured in media coverage of ritualistic abuse but its use decreased among professionals in favour of more nuanced terms such as multi-dimensional child sex rings,&lt;ref name=Lanning&gt;{{Cite journal |format=PDF |first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |title=Investigator's Guide to Allegations of "Ritual" Childhood Abuse |year=1992 | url = http://www.pointnet.ca/media/igtaorca.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031025012607/http://www.pointnet.ca/media/igtaorca.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2003-10-25}}; &lt;/ref&gt; ritual/ritualistic abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hudson |first=PS |title=Ritual child abuse: discovery, diagnosis, and treatment |publisher=R&amp;E Publishers |location=Saratoga, Calif |year=1991 |isbn=0-88247-867-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; organised abuse{{sfn |Bibby |1996}} or [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] abuse,&lt;ref name=VS/&gt; some of which acknowledged the complexity of abuse cases with multiple perpetrators and victims without projecting a religious framework onto perpetrators. The latter in particular failed to substantively improve on or replace "Satanic" abuse as it was never used to describe any rituals except the Satanic ones that were the core of SRA allegations. Abuse within the context of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] or any other religions failed to enter the SRA discourse.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |p=25}}

===Cult-based abuse===
Allegation of cult-based abuse is the most extreme scenario of SRA.{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} During the initial period of interest starting in the early 1980s the term was used to describe a network of [[Satan]]-worshipping, secretive intergenerational cults that were supposedly part of a highly organized [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] engaged in criminal behaviors such as forced [[prostitution]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug distribution]] and [[pornography]]. These cults were also thought to sexually abuse and [[torture]] children in order to coerce them into a lifetime of [[Theistic Satanism#Preconceptions and myths|Devil worship]].{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]}} Other allegations included bizarre sexual acts such as [[necrophilia]], forced [[ingestion of semen]], [[blood]] and [[feces]], [[cannibalism]], [[orgies]], liturgical parody such as pseudosacramental use of feces and urine; [[infanticide]], sacrificial abortions to eat [[fetus]]es and [[human sacrifice]]; satanic police officers who covered up evidence of SRA crimes and desecration of Christian [[grave (burial)|graves]].{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA127 127]}} No evidence of any of these claims has ever been found;&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]}}&lt;ref name=Putnam1991&gt;{{cite journal |last=Putnam |first=F.W. |year=1991 |title=The Satanic Ritual Abuse Controversy |journal=Child Abuse and Neglect: the International Journal |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=175–79 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429989 |accessdate=2008-06-10 |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(91)90062-I}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998}} the proof presented by those who alleged the reality of cult-based abuse primarily consisted of the memories of adults recalling childhood abuse,{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=55}}{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} the testimony of young children{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=55}}{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA16 16–17]}} and extremely controversial confessions.{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} The idea of a murderous Satanic conspiracy created a controversy dividing the professional [[child abuse]] community at the time, though no evidence has been found to support allegations of a large number of children being killed or abused in Satanic rituals.&lt;ref name=Putnam1991/&gt;{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PR13 xiii]}} From a law enforcement perspective, an intergenerational conspiracy dedicated to ritual sacrifice whose members remain completely silent, make no mistakes and leave no [[physical evidence]] is unlikely; cases of what the media incorrectly perceived as actual cult sacrifices (such as the 1989 case of [[Adolfo Constanzo]]) have supported this idea.&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;

===Criminal and delusional satanism===
A third variation of ritual abuse involves non-religious ritual abuse in which the rituals were [[delusion]]al or [[obsessive compulsive disorder|obsessive]].&lt;ref name=Finkelhor/&gt; There are incidents of extreme sadistic crimes that are committed by individuals, loosely organized families and possibly in some organized cults, some of which may be connected to Satanism, though this is more likely to be related to [[sex trafficking]]; though SRA may happen in families, extended families and localized groups, it is not believed to occur in large, organized groups.{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |pp=64–65}}

===Acting out===
Investigators considered [[graffiti]] such as the [[pentagram]] to be evidence of a Satanic cult. Ambiguous crimes in which actual or erroneously believed symbols of Satanism appear have also been claimed as part of the SRA phenomenon, though in most cases the crimes cannot be linked to a specific belief system; minor crimes such as vandalism, trespassing and graffiti were often found to be the actions of teenagers who were acting out.&lt;ref name="pmid1471565"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8356163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1962303"/&gt;

===Polarization===

There was never any consensus on what actually constituted Satanic ritual abuse.&lt;ref name=deYoung2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Young |first=M |authorlink=Mary de Young |year=2007 |title=Two decades after McMartin: a follow-up of 22 convicted day care employees |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYZ/is_4_34/ai_n25466116/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925172921/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYZ/is_4_34/ai_n25466116/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2008-08-11 |journal=Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=9–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of a single definition, as well as confusion between the meanings of the term "ritual" ([[Ritual#Religious|religious]] versus [[Ritual#Psychology|psychological]]) allowed a wide range of allegations and evidence to be claimed as a demonstration of the reality of SRA claims, irrespective of which "definition" the evidence supported.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}} Acrimonious disagreements between groups who supported SRA allegations as authentic and those criticizing them as unsubstantiated resulted in an extremely polarized discussion with little middle ground.&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;{{cite book |last=Fraser |first=GA |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |year=1997 |title=The Dilemma of Ritual Abuse: Cautions and Guides for Therapists |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4CMHRXz5qsQC&amp;pg=PA105 105–17] |isbn=0-88048-478-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} The lack of credible evidence for the more extreme interpretations often being seen as evidence of an effective conspiracy rather than an indication that the allegations are unfounded. The atheistic or religious beliefs of the disputants have also resulted in different interpretations of evidence, and as well as accusations of those who reject the claims being "anti-child".{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=18–22}} Both believers and skeptics have developed networks to disseminate information on their respective positions.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=27–28}} One of the central themes of the discussion among English child abuse professionals was the assertion that people should simply "believe the children", and that the testimony of children was sufficient proof, which ignored the fact that in many cases the testimony of children was interpreted by professionals rather than the children explicitly disclosing allegations of abuse. In some cases this was simultaneously presented with the idea that it did not matter if SRA actually existed, that the [[empiricism|empirical]] truth of SRA was irrelevant, that the testimony of children was more important than that of doctors, social workers and the criminal justice system.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=18–22}}

==Evidence==
The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect conducted a study led by [[University of California, Davis|University of California]] psychologist [[Gail Goodman]], which found that among 12,000 accusations of satanic ritual abuse, there was no evidence for "a well-organized intergenerational satanic cult, who sexually molested and tortured children", although there was "convincing evidence of lone perpetrators or couples who say they are involved with Satan or use the claim to intimidate victims."&lt;ref name="Goleman1994"/&gt; One such case Goodman studied involved "grandparents [who] had black robes, candles, and Christ on an inverted crucifix--and the children had chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease, in their throats", according to the report by a [[district attorney]].&lt;ref name="Goleman1994"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/31/us/proof-lacking-for-ritual-abuse-by-satanists.html?sq=satanic+ritual+abuse&amp;scp=1&amp;st=nyt|title=Proof Lacking for Ritual Abuse by Satanists|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|year=1994|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|language=English|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for SRA was primarily in the form of testimonies from children who made allegations of SRA, and adults who claim to remember abuse during childhood,&lt;ref name=Utah&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saferchildren.net/print/utahrataskforce.pdf |date= 1992-05-01 |accessdate=2007-11-26 |title=Report of Utah State Task Force on Ritual Abuse |publisher=Utah Governor's Commission for Women and Families |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA79 79]}} that may have been forgotten and [[Recovered memory therapy|recovered during therapy]].{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=55}}{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |p=18}}{{sfn|Perrin|Miller-Perrin|2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AJgxUqce5GcC&amp;pg=PA318 318–20]}}&lt;ref name=Furies&gt;{{cite book |last=Underwager |first=Ralph C. |last2=Wakefield |first2=Hollida |title=Return of the furies: an investigation into recovered memory therapy |publisher=Open Court |location=La Salle, Ill |year=1995 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iE1-i0umaTsC&amp;pg=PA317 317–21] |isbn=0-8126-9272-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With both children and adults, no corroborating evidence has been found for anything except [[#Pseudo-satanism|pseudosatanism]] in which the satanic and ritual aspects were secondary to and used as a cover for sexual abuse.{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}} Despite this lack of objective evidence, and aided by the competing definitions of what SRA actually was, proponents claimed SRA was a real phenomenon throughout the peak and during the decline of the moral panic.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |p=18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devine |first=Susan E. |last2=Sakheim |first2=David K. |title=Out of darkness: exploring satanism and ritual abuse |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year=1992 |page=173 |isbn=0-669-26962-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite allegations appearing in the United States, Netherlands, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia, no material evidence has been found to corroborate allegations of organized cult-based abuse that practices human sacrifice and cannibalism.&lt;ref name=Furies/&gt;{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA123 123]}} Though trauma specialists frequently claimed the allegations made by children and adults were the same, in reality the statements made by adults were more elaborate, severe, and featured more bizarre abuse.

For several years, a conviction list assembled by the [[Believe the Children]] advocacy group was circulated as proof of the truth of satanic ritual abuse allegations, though the organization itself no longer exists and the list itself is "egregiously out of date".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0-7864-1830-3 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;pg=PA54 54] |title=The day care ritual abuse moral panic |last=de Young |first=M |authorlink=Mary de Young |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
Two investigations were carried out to assess the evidence for SRA. In the United States, evidence was reported but was based on a flawed methodology with an overly liberal definition of a substantiated case. In the United Kingdom, a government report produced no evidence of SRA, but several examples of false satanists faking rituals to frighten their victims.

====United States====
[[David Finkelhor]] completed an investigation of child sexual abuse in daycares in the United States, and published a report in 1988. The report found 270 cases of sexual abuse, of which 36 were classified as substantiated cases of ritual abuse.&lt;ref name=Finkelhor/&gt; [[Mary de Young]] has pointed out that the report's definition of "substantiated" was overly liberal as it required only that one agency had decided that abuse had occurred, even if no action was taken, no arrests made, no operating licenses suspended. In addition, multiple agencies may have been involved in each case (including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], local police, social services agencies and childhood protective services in many cases), with wide differences in suspicion and confirmation, often in disagreement with each other. Finkelhor, upon receiving a "confirmation", would collect information from whoever was willing or interested to provide it and did not independently investigate the cases, resulting in frequent errors in their conclusions. No data is provided beyond case studies and brief summaries.{{sfn |de Young |2004 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}} Three other cases considered corroborating by the public—the [[McMartin preschool trial]], the [[Day-care sex-abuse hysteria#Country Walk|Country Walk case]] and the murders in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], by [[Adolfo Constanzo]]—ultimately failed to support the existence of SRA. The primary witness in the Country Walk case repeatedly made, then withdrew accusations against her husband amid unusual and coercive inquiries by her lawyer and a psychologist. The Matamoros murders produced the bodies of 12 adults who were ritually sacrificed by a drug gang inspired by the film ''[[The Believers]]'', but did not involve children or sexual abuse. The McMartin case resulted in no convictions and was ultimately based on accusations by children with no proof beyond their coerced testimonies.{{sfn |Faller |2003 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FkT2wTGTUAoC&amp;pg=PA29 29–33]}} A 1996 investigation of more than 12,000 allegations of satanic, ritual and religious abuse resulted in no cases that were considered factual or corroborated.&lt;ref name=Bottoms1996&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bottoms |first=B.L. |last2=Shaver |first2=P.R. |last3=Goodman |first3=G.S. |year=1996 |title=An analysis of ritualistic and religion-related child abuse allegations |journal=Law and Human Behavior |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–34 |doi=10.1007/BF01499130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
A British study published in 1996 found 62 cases of alleged ritual abuse reported to researchers by police, social and welfare agencies from the period of 1988 to 1991, representing a tiny proportion of extremely high-profile cases compared to the total number investigated by the agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes &amp; Parker in Bibby, 1996, pp. 215–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Jean LaFontaine spent several years researching ritual abuse cases in Britain at the behest of the government, finding that all of the cases of alleged satanic ritual abuse that could be substantiated were cases where the perpetrators' goal was sexual gratification rather than religious worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/94959.article | title = Satanic Disabuser | last = Kitzinger | first = Celia | date = 1995-08-28 | accessdate = 2014-10-16 | journal = [[Times Higher Education]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing several reports and the 1998 book ''Speak of the Devil'', after reviewing cases reported to police and children's protective services throughout the country LaFontaine concluded that the only rituals she uncovered were those invented by child abusers to frighten their victims or justify the sexual abuse. In addition, the sexual abuse occurred outside of the rituals, indicating the goal of the abuser was sexual gratification rather than ritualistic or religious. In cases involving satanic abuse, the satanic allegations by younger children were influenced by adults, and the concerns over the satanic aspects were found to be compelling due to cultural attraction of the concept, but distracting from the actual harm caused to the abuse victims.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=LaFontaine |first=J S. |title=The extent and nature of organised and ritual abuse: research findings |publisher=HMSO |location=London |year=1994 |isbn=0-11-321797-8 |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=157278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient allegations===
The majority of adult testimonials occurred as a result of adults undergoing psychotherapy, in most cases therapy designed to elicit memories of SRA.&lt;ref name=Frankfurter2003/&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}} Therapists claimed the pain expressed by the patients, internal consistency of their stories and similarity of allegations by different patients was evidence for SRA, but despite this, the disclosures of patients never resulted in any corroboration;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}} Allegations of alleged victims that were obtained from mental health practitioners lacked verifiable evidence, were [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] and involved incidents that were years or decades old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Final Report of the Task Force Studying Ritual Crime |publisher=Crime Commission Task Force Studying Ritual Criminal Activity |location=Richmond, VA |year=1991}}; cited in Victor, 1993, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA263 263–64].&lt;/ref&gt; The concern for therapists revolved around the pain of their clients, which is for them more important than the truth of their patients' statements.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=27–28}} A sample of 29 patients in a medical clinic reporting SRA found no corroboration of the claims in medical records or in discussion with family members.&lt;ref name=Coons&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coons |first=PM |title=Reports of satanic ritual abuse: further implications about pseudomemories |journal=Percept Mot Skills |volume=78 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=1376–78 |date=June 1994 |pmid=7936968 |doi=10.2466/pms.1994.78.3c.1376}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a survey of 2,709 American therapists found the majority of allegations of SRA came from only sixteen therapists, suggesting that the determining factor in a patient making allegations of SRA was the therapist's predisposition.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA257 257–58]}} Further, the alleged similarities between patient accounts (particularly between adults and children) turned out to be illusory upon review, with adults describing far more elaborate, severe and bizarre abuse than children. Bette Bottoms, who reviewed hundreds of claims of adult and child abuse, described the ultimate evidence for the abuse as "astonishingly weak and ambiguous" particularly given the severity of the alleged abuse. Therapists however, were found to believe patients more as the allegations became more bizarre and severe.{{sfn |McNally |2003 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=88Axi0huzYwC&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 238]}}

In cases where patients made claims that were physically impossible, or evidence found by police was contradictory, the details reported will often change. If patients pointed to a spot where a body was buried, but no body was found and no earth was disturbed, therapists resort to [[special pleading]], saying the patient was hypnotically programmed to direct investigators to the wrong location, or that they were fooled by the cult into believing a crime was not committed. If alleged bodies were cremated and police point out ordinary fires are inadequate to completely destroy a body, stories include special industrial furnaces. The patients' allegations change and creatively find "solutions" to objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Showalter |isbn=0-231-10459-6 |year=1998 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lTL34npiiV0C&amp;pg=PA179 179–80] |title=Hystories : hysterical epidemics and modern media |first=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's allegations===
The second group to make allegations of SRA were young children. During the "satanic panic" of the 1980s, the techniques used by investigators to gather evidence from witnesses, particularly young children, evolved to become very leading, coercive and suggestive, pressuring young children to provide testimony and refusing to accept denials while offering inducements that encouraged false disclosures.&lt;ref name=Frankfurter2003/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schreiber et al."/&gt;{{sfn|Nathan|Snedeker|1995}} The interviewing techniques used were the factors believed to have led to the construction of the bizarre disclosures of SRA by the children{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA56 56ff], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA61 61–65], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA73 73f] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA192 192–95]}} and changes to forensic and interviewing techniques since that time has resulted in a disappearance of the allegations.&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt; Analysis of the techniques used in two key cases (the McMartin preschool and [[Wee Care Nursery School]] trials) concluded that the children were questioned in a highly suggestive manner.

A variety of these allegations resulted in criminal convictions; in an analysis of these cases [[Mary de Young]] found that many had had their convictions overturned. Of 22 day care employees and their sentences reviewed in 2007, three were still incarcerated, eleven had charges dismissed or overturned, and eight were released before serving their full sentences. Grounds included technical dismissals, constitutional challenges and prosecutorial misconduct.&lt;ref name=deYoung2007/&gt;

In his book ''Satanic Panic'', Jeffery Victor writes that, in the United States, the groups most likely to believe rumors of SRA are rural, poorly educated, religiously [[Christian right|conservative]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] families with an unquestioning belief in [[Culture of the United States|American values]] who feel significant anxieties over job loss, economic decline and family disintegration. Victor considers rumours of SRA a symptom of a moral crisis and a form of [[scapegoat]]ing for economic and social ills.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA55 55–56]}}

===Origins of the rumors===
Information about SRA claims spread through conferences presented to religious groups, churches and professionals such as police forces and therapists as well as parents. These conferences and presentations served to organize agencies and foster communication between groups, maintaining and spreading disproven or exaggerated stories as fact.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; Members of local police forces organized into loose networks focused on cult crimes, some of whom billed themselves as "experts" and were paid to speak at conferences throughout the United States. Religious revivalists also took advantage of the rumors and preached about the dangers of Satanism to youth and presented themselves at paid engagements as secular experts.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA22 22–23]}} At the height of the panic, the highly emotional accusations and circumstances of SRA allegations made it difficult to investigate the claims, with the accused being assumed as guilty and skeptics becoming co-accused during trials, and trials moving forward based solely on the testimony of very young children without corroborating evidence.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA16 16–17]}} No [[forensic evidence|forensic]] or corroborating evidence has ever been found for religiously based cannibalistic or murderous SRA, despite extensive investigations.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}}&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA213 213]}} The concern and reaction expressed by various groups regarding the seriousness or threat of SRA has been considered out of proportion to the actual threat by satanically motivated crimes, and the rare crime that exists that may be labeled "satanic" does not justify the existence of a conspiracy or network of religiously motivated child abusers.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins |first=T |title=Satanic Panic: The Creation of a Contemporary Legend – book reviews |journal=Sociology of Religion |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SOR/is_n3_v55/ai_15729291/pg_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924132924/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SOR/is_n3_v55/ai_15729291/pg_1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-24 |year=1994 |accessdate=2008-06-27 |doi=10.2307/3712069 |volume=55 |last2=Victor |first2=Jeffrey S. |jstor=3712069 |issue=3 |pages=373–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA20 20–21]}}

===Scholarly and law enforcement investigations===
Jeffrey Victor reviewed 67 rumors about SRA in the United States and Canada reported in newspapers or television, and found no evidence supporting the existence of murderous satanic cults.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA330 330–54]}} LaFontaine states that cases of alleged SRA investigated in the [[United Kingdom]] were reviewed in detail and the majority were unsubstantiated; three were found to involve sexual abuse of children in the context of rituals, but none involved the [[Witches' Sabbath]] or devil worship that are characteristic of allegations of SRA.{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} LaFontaine also states that no material evidence has been forthcoming in allegations of SRA; no bones, bodies or blood, in either the United States or Britain.

Kenneth Lanning, an [[FBI]] expert in the investigation of child sexual abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/heimbach050102.htm |title=Testimony of Michael J. Heimbach, Crimes Against Children Unit |last=Heimbach |first=MJ |date=2002-05-01 |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=2008-04-30 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061230100851/http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/heimbach050102.htm | archivedate = 2006-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; has stated that pseudo-Satanism may exist but there is "little or no evidence for ... large-scale baby breeding, human sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies".&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;There are many possible alternative answers to the question of why victims are alleging things that don't seem to be true....I believe that there is a middle ground—a continuum of possible activity. Some of what the victims allege may be true and accurate, some may be misperceived or distorted, some may be screened or symbolic, and some may be "contaminated" or false. The problem and challenge, especially for law enforcement, is to determine which is which. This can only be done through active investigation. I believe that the majority of victims alleging "ritual" abuse are in fact victims of some form of abuse or trauma.&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lanning produced a [[monograph]] in 1994 on SRA aimed at child protection authorities, which contained his opinion that despite hundreds of investigations no corroboration of SRA had been found. Following this report, several convictions based on SRA allegations were overturned and the defendants released.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |p=230}}

Reported cases of SRA involve bizarre activities, some of which are impossible (like people flying),&lt;ref name="Schreiber et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schreiber |first=Nadja |last2=Bellah |first2=Lisa |last3=Martinez |first3=Yolanda |last4=McLaurin |first4=Kristin |last5=, Renata Stok, Sena Garven and James Wood |title=Suggestive interviewing in the McMartin Preschool and Kelly Michaels daycare abuse cases: A case study |journal=Social Influence |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=16–46 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |url=http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=james_wood |doi=10.1080/15534510500361739}}&lt;/ref&gt; that makes the credibility of victims of child sexual abuse questionable. In cases where SRA is alleged to occur, Lanning describes common dynamics of the use of fear to control multiple young victims, the presence of multiple perpetrators and strange or ritualized behaviors, though allegations of crimes such as human sacrifice and cannibalism do not seem to be true. Lanning also suggests several reasons why adult victims may make allegations of SRA, including "pathological distortion, traumatic memory, normal childhood fears and fantasies, misperception, and confusion".&lt;ref name="Lanning2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Search/Abstracts.aspx?id=159841&amp;library=Publications_Lib&amp;query=%26lt%3BRecordset%26gt%3B%26lt%3BLibrary%20name%3D%26quot%3BPublications_Lib%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3BField%20name%3D%26quot%3BDOC_BODY%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3BQuery%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%21%5BCDATA%5BLanning%5D%5D%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Query%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Field%26gt%3B%26lt%3BField%20name%3D%26quot%3Bis_full_text%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3BQuery%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%21%5BCDATA%5BN%5D%5D%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Query%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Field%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Library%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Recordset%26gt%3B|title=Satanic Ritual Abuse of Children Is Not Widespread|last=Lanning|first=K|publisher=[[Greenhaven Press]], Inc|year=1994|editor=Bender D|series=Opposing Viewpoints Series|accessdate=2008-04-29|editor2=Leone, B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court cases==
{{Main article |List of satanic ritual abuse allegations}}
Allegations of SRA have appeared throughout the world. The failure of certain high-profile legal cases generated worldwide media attention, and came to play a central feature in the growing controversies over child abuse, memory and the law.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, DP, Scheflin, AW &amp; Hammond, DC |title=Memory, trauma treatment, and the law |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=0-393-70254-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source |date=August 2008}} The testimony of children in these cases may have led to their collapse, as juries came to believe that the sources of the allegations were the use of suggestive and manipulative interviewing techniques, rather than actual events. Research since that time has supported these concerns and without the use of these techniques it is unlikely the cases would ever have reached trial.&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt;

In one analysis of 36 court cases involving sexual abuse of children within rituals, only one quarter resulted in convictions and the convictions had little to do with ritual sex abuse.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charlier |first=T |author2=Downing S  |year=1988 |title=Allegations Rife, Evidence Slight |publisher=[[The Commercial Appeal]] |location=Memphis, TN}}; cited in Victor, 1993, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 survey of more than 11,000 psychiatric and police workers throughout the US, conducted for the [[National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect]], researchers investigated approximately 12,000 accusations of group cult sexual abuse based on satanic ritual. The survey found no substantiated reports of well-organized satanic rings of people who sexually abuse children, but did find incidents in which the ritualistic aspects were secondary to the abuse and were used to intimidate victims.&lt;ref name="NCCAN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02EEDD1E3FF932A05753C1A962958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=satanic+ritual+abuse&amp;st=nyt|title=Proof Lacking for Ritual Abuse by Satanists|last=Goleman|first=D|date=1994-10-31|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor reviewed 21 court cases alleging SRA between 1983 and 1987 in which no prosecutions were obtained for ritual abuse.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=355–61}}

During the early 1980s, some courts attempted ''[[ad hoc]]'' accommodations to address the anxieties of child witnesses in relation to testifying before defendants. Screens or [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] technology are a common feature of child sexual assault trials today; children in the early 1980s were typically forced into direct visual contact with the accused abuser while in court. SRA allegations in the courts catalyzed a broad agenda of research into the nature of children's testimony and the reliability of their oral evidence in court. Ultimately in SRA cases, the coercive techniques used by believing district attorneys, therapists and police officers were critical in establishing, and often resolving, SRA cases. In courts, when juries were able to see recordings or transcripts of interviews with children, the alleged abusers were acquitted. The reaction by successful prosecutors, spread throughout conventions and conferences on SRA, was to destroy, or fail to take notes of the interviews in the first place.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=224–27}} One group of researchers concluded that children usually lack the sufficient amount of "explicit knowledge" of satanic ritual abuse to fabricate all of the details of an SRA claim on their own.&lt;ref name=Goodman1997&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodman, G.S. |author2=Quas, J.A. |author3=Bottoms, B.L. |author4=Qin, J. |author5=Shaver, P.R. |author6=Orcutt, H. |author7= Shapiro, C.  |year=1997 |title=Children's religious knowledge: Implications for understanding satanic ritual abuse allegations |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1111–30 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(97)00070-7 |pmid=9422831}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same researchers also concluded that children usually have the sufficient amount of general knowledge of "violence and the occult" to "serve as a starting point from which ritual claims could develop."&lt;ref name=Goodman1997/&gt;

In 2006, psychologist and attorney [[Christopher Barden]] drafted an ''amicus curiae'' brief to the California Supreme Court signed by nearly 100 international experts in the field of human memory emphasizing the lack of credible scientific support for repressed and recovered memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barden|first=R.C.|title=Amicus Brief in Taus v.

Other members of the panel included psychiatrist George Ganaway, anthropologist Sherrill Mulhern, and psychologist [[Richard Noll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Braun|first=Bennett G.|title=Dissociative Disorders, 1990: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Multiple Personality/Dissociative States...November 9–11, 1990|year=1990|publisher=Dissociative Disorders Program, Dept. of Psychiatry, Rush University|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Putnam, a skeptic, was viewed by SRA advocates in attendance as using fellow skeptics such as Noll and Mulhern as allies in a disinformation campaign to split the SRA-believing community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lockwood | first = C | title = Other Alters: Roots and Realities of Cultic and Satanic Ritual Abuse and Multiple Personality Disorder | year = 1993 | publisher = CompCare Publishers | location=Minneapolis, MN | pages = 14, 17|isbn=0-89638-363-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coons also pointed out that existing injuries could have been self-inflicted, that the experiences reported were "strikingly similar" and that "many of the SRA reports developed while patients were hospitalized".&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt; The reliability of memories of DID clients who alleged SRA in treatment has been questioned and a point of contention in the popular media and with clinicians; many of the allegations made are fundamentally impossible and alleged survivors lack the physical scars that would result were their allegations true.&lt;ref name=Van1990/&gt;

Many women claiming to be SRA survivors have been diagnosed as sufferers of DID, and it is unclear if their claims of childhood abuse are accurate or a manifestation of their diagnosis.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA89 89]}} Of a sample of 29 patients who presented with SRA, 22 were diagnosed with dissociative disorders including DID. The authors noted that 58% of the SRA claims appeared in the years following the Geraldo Rivera special on SRA and a further 34% following a workshop on SRA presented in the area; in only two patients were the memories elicited without the use of "questionable therapeutic practices for memory retrieval."&lt;ref name=Coons/&gt; Claims of SRA by DID patients have been called "...often nothing more than fantastic pseudomemories implanted or reinforced in psychotherapy"&lt;ref name="pmid15503730"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Piper A |author2=Merskey H |title=The persistence of folly: a critical examination of dissociative identity disorder.

==False memories==
One explanation for the SRA allegations is that they were based upon false memories caused by the over-use of [[hypnosis]] and other suggestive techniques by therapists underestimating the suggestibility of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;Loftus &amp; Ketcham, 1996, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=13JZozT2kMYC&amp;pg=PA85 85].&lt;/ref&gt; The altered state of consciousness induced by hypnosis rendered patients an unusual ability to produce [[confabulation]]s, often with the assistance of their therapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ellis, Bill |title=Raising the devil: Satanism, new religions, and the media |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Ky |year=2000 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oLcqlypMCe8C&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 87–97] |isbn=0-8131-2170-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of [[false memory syndrome]] (FMS), a controversial term promoted by the [[False Memory Syndrome Foundation]], claim that the purported "memories" of ritual abuse are actually false memories, created [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenically]] through suggestion or coercion.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt; The FMSF has used the idea of ritual abuse as a strategy to illustrate their position that most allegations of sexual abuse uncovered by the suggestive techniques used during recovered memory therapy are false "memories" of events that never happened. According to Kathleen Faller this has contributed to the sensationalization of the ritual abuse cases in the media.{{sfn |Faller |2003 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AJgxUqce5GcC&amp;pg=PA 51]}}

[[Paul R. McHugh]], professor of psychiatry at [[Johns Hopkins University]] discusses in his book ''Try to Remember'' the developments that led to the creation of false memories in the SRA moral panic and the formation of the FMSF as an effort to bring contemporary scientific research and political action to the polarizing struggle about false memories within the mental health disciplines. According to McHugh, there is no coherent scientific basis for the core belief of one side of the struggle, that sexual abuse can cause massive systemic repression of memories that can only be accessed through hypnosis, coercive interviews and other dubious techniques. The group of psychiatrists who promoted these ideas, whom McHugh terms "[[Mannerism|Mannerist]] Freudians", consistently followed a [[deductive reasoning|deductive approach]] to diagnosis in which the theory and causal explanation of symptoms was assumed to be childhood sexual abuse leading to dissociation, followed by a set of unproven and unreliable treatments with a strong [[confirmation bias]] that inevitably produced the allegations and causes that were assumed to be there. The treatment approach involved isolation of the patient from friends and family within psychiatric wards dedicated to the treatment of dissociation, filled with other patients who were treated by the same doctors with the same flawed methods and staff members who also coherently and universally ascribed to the same set of beliefs. These methods began in the 1980s and continued for several years until a series of court cases and [[medical malpractice]] lawsuits resulted in hospitals failing to support the approach. In cases where the dissociative symptoms were ignored, the coercive treatment approach ceased and the patients were removed from dedicated wards, allegations of satanic rape and abuse normally ceased, "recovered" memories were identified as fabrications and conventional treatments for presenting symptoms were generally successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McHugh |first=PR |authorlink=Paul R.

'''Section 2''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' ("''Charter''") is the section of the [[Constitution of Canada]] that lists what the ''Charter'' calls "fundamental freedoms" theoretically applying to everyone in Canada, regardless of whether they are a Canadian citizen, or an individual or [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html#s-2. | title = Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982 | accessdate = 2014-02-15 | author = Justice Laws Website, Site Web de la législation (Justice) | date = 2014-01-30 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140119183913/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html | archivedate = 2014-01-19 | quote = Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms}}&lt;/ref&gt; These freedoms can be held against actions of all levels of government and are enforceable by the courts. The fundamental freedoms are [[freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of thought]], [[freedom of belief]], [[freedom of assembly|freedom of peaceful assembly]] and [[freedom of association]].

[[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 1]] of the ''Charter'' permits Parliament or the provincial legislatures to enact laws that place certain kinds of limited restrictions on the freedoms listed under section 2. Additionally, these freedoms can be temporarily invalidated by [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 33]], the "notwithstanding clause", of the ''Charter''.

As a part of the ''Charter'' and of the larger ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'', section 2 took legal effect on April 17, 1982. However, many of its rights have roots in Canada in the 1960 ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]'' (although this law was of limited effectiveness), and in traditions under a theorized [[Implied Bill of Rights]]. Many of these exemptions, such as freedom of expression, have also been at the centre of [[Canadian federalism|federalistic]] disputes.

==Text==
Under the heading of "Fundamental Freedoms" the section states:
{{quote|2.  Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:

(a) freedom of conscience and religion;

(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;

(c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and

(d) freedom of association.}}

==Freedom of religion==
{{see also|Freedom of religion in Canada}}

===Background===
According to [[Beverley McLachlin]], freedom of religion in Canada may have originated as early as 1759, when [[French Canadian]] [[Roman Catholic]]s were allowed rights of worship by their British conquerors; this was later reconfirmed in 1774 in the ''[[Quebec Act]]''. Later the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' provided for denominational school rights&lt;ref&gt;Beverley McLachlin, "Freedom of Religion and the Rule of Law:  A Canadian Perspective," in ''Recognizing Religion in a Secular Society: Essays in Pluralism, Religion, and Public Policy''. Ed. Douglas Farrow. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2004, pages 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; (these are reaffirmed by [[Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 29 of the ''Charter'']]). Discussions of church-state relations also took place in the [[Guibord case]] of 1874. In 1955, the Supreme Court ruled in ''Chaput v Romain'',&lt;ref&gt;[1955] SCR 834.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], that different religions have rights, based upon tradition and the [[rule of law]] (at the time no statutes formed the basis for this argument).&lt;ref&gt;McLachlin, "Freedom of Religion and the Rule of Law:  A Canadian Perspective," pages 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious freedom was later included in the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''.  However, its effectiveness was limited. When Sunday closing laws compelling respect for the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christian Sabbath]] were challenged in ''R v Robertson and Rosetanni'',&lt;ref&gt;[1963] SCR 651&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Ritchie of the Supreme Court found that non-Christians merely lost money when denied rights to work on Sunday and were otherwise free to believe in and observe their own religions.

===Definition===
Freedom of religion under section 2(a) of the ''Charter'' was first seriously considered by the Supreme Court in ''[[R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1985] 1 SCR 295.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Chief Justice Brian Dickson wrote that this freedom at least includes freedom of religious speech, including "the right to entertain such religious beliefs as a person chooses, the right to declare religious beliefs openly and without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and the right to manifest religious belief by worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination." Freedom of religion would also prohibit imposing religious requirements. The immediate consequence of section 2, in this case, was the abolishment of federal Sunday closing laws.

In ''[[Syndicat Northcrest v Amselem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2004 SCC 47.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court drew up a definition of freedom of religion under the ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]'', mindful of the overlap with section 2(a). The majority found freedom of religion encompasses a right to religious practices if the individual has a sincere belief that the practice is connected to religion.  It would not matter whether the practice was needed according to religious authority.  If courts can believe an individual is telling the truth in saying a practice is connected to religion, the courts then ask whether the infringement of freedom of religion is severe enough to trigger section 2. The Court also said religious beliefs are vacillating, so courts trying to determine an individual belief should be mindful that beliefs may change. Following this test in ''[[Multani v Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2006 SCC 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court found freedom of religion should protect a non-violent [[Sikh]] student's right to wear a ''[[kirpan]]'' (dagger) in school.

In ''R v NS'',&lt;ref&gt;2012 SCC 72.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court sought to find a middle ground on the issue of whether a witness can wear a face-covering [[niqāb]] while testifying in a criminal trial. The court found that the right to religious freedom must be balanced against the right of the accused to a fair trial.

===Freedom of conscience===
In addition to freedom of religion, section 2(a) also guarantees freedom of conscience. Professor [[Peter Hogg]] speculated this would include a right to [[atheism]], despite the [[preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which recognizes the "supremacy of God".&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W.  ''Canada Act 1982 Annotated.''  Toronto, Canada:  The Carswell Company Limited, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The right has not spawned a great deal of case law, although Justice [[Bertha Wilson]] did rely on it in her opinion in ''[[R v Morgentaler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1998] 1 SCR 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Finding laws against abortion to be a breach of the rights to [[liberty]] and [[security of the person]] under [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7 of the ''Charter'']], Wilson then argued this infringement could not be justified as being consistent with [[fundamental justice]]. The legal protections found under fundamental justice could be defined as including other rights under the ''Charter'', and in particular abortion laws breached freedom of conscience. As she wrote, the "decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is essentially a moral decision, a matter of conscience". She then said, "[C]onscientious beliefs which are not religiously motivated are equally protected by freedom of conscience in s. 2(a)." No other judges joined Wilson's opinion.

[[Jean Chrétien]], who was the [[Attorney General of Canada|attorney general]] during negotiations of the ''Charter'', later recalled in his memoirs that freedom of conscience was nearly excluded from the ''Charter''. The federal and provincial negotiators found the right too difficult to define, and Chrétien eventually agreed to remove it. A legal advisor for the federal government, Pierre Genest, then kicked Chrétien's chair, prompting Chrétien to joke, "I guess we leave it in. [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau's]] spy just kicked me in the ass."&lt;ref&gt;Chrétien, Jean. ''Straight from the Heart''. (Key Porter Books Limited, 1994), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of expression==
{{see|History of free speech in Canada}}
Freedom of expression, section 2(b), is perhaps one of the most significant ''Charter'' rights in influencing Canadian society.  The right is expressly named in the charter because although "Canadian criminal law uses the standard of the [[reasonable person]] as a&amp;nbsp;... definition for the threshold of criminality", the ''Charter'' expressly limits some forms of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Mikus, Rudolf Alexander. (1995). The reasonable person in substantive Canadian Criminal Law (T). Retrieved from https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/831/items/1.0077473&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice [[Peter Cory]] wrote that it "is difficult to imagine a guaranteed right more important to a democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edmonton Journal v Alberta (AG)]]'', [1989] 2 SCR 1326 at 1336.&lt;/ref&gt;  The section has been at the centre of a great amount of case law.

===Background===
Freedom of speech had a limited background in Canada. It has been an issue in federalism disputes, as provincial legislation infringing upon free speech has been taken as criminal legislation, which only the [[Parliament of Canada]] can validly create under section 91(27) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''.  ''[[Switzman v Elbling]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1957] SCR 285.&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a case in which this was discussed. An Implied Bill of Rights theory further stated governments were limited in their abilities to infringe upon free speech by virtue of the [[preamble]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. This preamble states Canada's constitution would be based upon Britain's, and Britain had limited free speech in 1867.  Furthermore, free speech is considered to be necessary for a parliamentary government to function.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free speech was later included in the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''.

===Definition===
The meaning of "expression" within section 2(b) has been read broadly as including any activity that conveys, or attempts to convey, meaning&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irwin Toy Ltd v Quebec (AG)]]'', [1989] 1 SCR 927 [''Irwin Toy''].&lt;/ref&gt; to the exception of acts of violence and threats of violence.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ibid'' and ''[[United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1518 v KMart Canada Ltd]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Courts have tried to maintain content neutrality by not considering the value of the expression. Instead, the content is only examined during the section 1 analysis.

Freedom of expression is primarily seen as a [[negative and positive rights|negative right]]. In ''[[Native Women's Assn of Canada v Canada|Native Women's Association of Canada v Canada]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1994] 3 SCR 627.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court considered a claim that the government had to financially support an interest group in constitutional negotiations, as it had supported others. [[Section Twenty-eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 28]] (sexual equality under the ''Charter'') was used to reinforce this argument, since the rights claimants were an interest group. Still, while the Supreme Court agreed discussions with the government is "unquestionably" a form of expression, the government did not seem to be guilty of suppressing any expression and thus the claim was dismissed.

===Limiting the right===
A law will be found to violate the freedom of expression where the law either has the purpose or effect of violating the right.

A law's purpose can limit the right either through limiting the content or form of expression. Limits on content are where the meaning of the expression is specifically forbidden by the law, such as hate-speech law, and is the most easily identifiable form of limitation.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''[[Prostitution Reference|Reference Re ss 193 &amp; 195.1(1)(c) of Criminal Code (Canada)]]'', [1990] 1 SCR 1123 [''Prostitution Reference'']; ''[[R v Keegstra]]'', [1990] 3 SCR 697; and ''[[R v Butler]]'', [1992] 1 SCR 452.&lt;/ref&gt; Limiting the form of the expression can often invoke section 2(b) as it will often have the effect of limiting the content as well.&lt;ref&gt;For example, instead of banning [[rock music]] (the content), banning [[FM radio]] (the method of conveying the music).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a law does not intend to limit the freedom of expression it may still infringe section 2(b) through its effects.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ramsden v Peterborough (City of)]]'', [1993] 2 SCR 1084.&lt;/ref&gt; A law will be found to restrict expression if it has the effect of frustrating "the pursuit of [[truth]], participation in the community, or individual self-fulfillment and human flourishing".

===Commercial expression===
Commercial expression is recognized as an activity protected under section 2(b). This includes advertising and any other similar means of expression used to sell goods and services. In fact, even false or misleading advertising is protected. The value of the expression does not come into play until the section 1 analysis.

The protection of commercial expression was first established in ''[[Ford v Quebec (AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 2 SCR 712.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court struck down a Quebec law requiring all signs to be exclusively in French. This was soon followed by ''Irwin Toy'',&lt;ref&gt;''Supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court found that Quebec law prohibiting advertising to children to violate section 2(b) but was saved under section 1.

The Supreme Court has also found that restrictions on advertising by professionals to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rocket v Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario]]'', [1990] 2 SCR 232.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, even communications for the purpose of prostitution was found to be protected as commercial expression.&lt;ref&gt;''Prostitution Reference'', ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Picketing===
Protesting by labour groups and trade unions have long been recognized as a protected form of expression.

There are not many instances of limiting primary picketing. Typically, the debate has been over whether [[secondary picketing]] can be restricted; the practice of picketing businesses not directly involved in a labour dispute has in the past been banned under the common law. The most significant decision on limiting primary picketing is ''[[British Columbia Government Employees' Union v British Columbia (AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 2 SCR 214.&lt;/ref&gt; where employees at the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]], who were protesting as part of a province-wide public service employee strike, were ordered back to work by the Chief Justice of the court. The order was found to clearly violate section 2(b) but the Supreme Court upheld it on section 1.

===Freedom of thought, belief and opinion===
Section 2(b) guarantees freedom of thought, belief and opinion in addition to freedom of expression. However, some have argued that freedoms of thought, belief and opinion in the ''Charter'' have had little practical consequence, and question whether governments have the capacity to stifle unspoken thoughts in any case.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 917.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application in the civil context===
The need to protect freedom of expression is considered a guiding principle of interpretation in civil cases between individuals. In '' Crookes v. Newton'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chartercases.com/crookes-v-newton-2011-scc-47/]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the Supreme Court of Canada found that section 2(b) must be considered in determining the extent to which common law libel restrictions should apply to new technologies such as internet hyperlinks.

==Freedom of peaceful assembly==
[[File:Occupy Montreal - Global Day of Action - 2011-10-15 - Victoria Square - General assembly.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Occupy Canada]] stages a peaceful assembly in Victoria Square in Montreal.]] 
Freedom of peaceful assembly under section 2(c) has not had a major impact on the case law.  In ''[[Reference Re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1987] 1 SCR 313 [''Alberta Reference''].&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court found that despite being written as a separate right, it was closely related to freedom of expression. The [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court]] defined it in ''Fraser et al v AGNS et al'' (1986) as including rights to meet as part of a committee or as workers. If there are membership fees to attend a meeting, prohibitions on being able to spend money for membership would be an abridgement of the right to peaceful assembly. In 2011, [[Occupy Canada]]'s protests in public parks raised questions of whether their eviction was prohibited by freedom of assembly, as well as expression and association.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Gollom, "[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/11/17/occupy-protest-rights.html Will charter protect Occupy protesters from eviction?]", CBC News, 18 November 2011, URL accessed 18 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of association==
Freedom of association is guaranteed under section 2(d). This right provides individuals the right to establish, belong to and maintain to any sort of organization, unless that organization is otherwise illegal. Generally, this is used in the [[Labour movement|labour]] context where employees are given the right to associate with certain [[trade union|unions]] or other similar group to represent their interests in labour disputes or negotiations.

It is important to note that this right only protects the right of individuals to form associations and not associations themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Alberta Reference'', ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, government legislation affecting the powers of established labour associations do not necessarily invoke section 2(d). It is only where legislation restricts the associative nature of an activity will section 2 be invoked. However, in the landmark ''Health Services and Support – Facilities Subsector Bargaining Association v British Columbia'',&lt;ref&gt;2007 SCC 27 [''Health Services''].&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that freedom of association guaranteed by section 2(d) includes a procedural right to collective bargaining. The Court ruled in this case that legislation that "substantially interferes" with the process of collective bargaining is a section 2(d) infringement. The test for "substantial interference" is twofold: (1) the importance of the matter affected to the process of collective bargaining, and more specifically, the capacity of union members to come together and pursue collective goals in concert; and (2) the manner in which the measure impacts on the collective right to good faith negotiation and consultation.&lt;ref&gt;''Health Services'', ''supra'' at 394.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not certain whether the decision in ''Health Services'' overturns jurisprudence arising from the so-called "labour trilogy" cases of 1987 which found that section 2(d) did not include a right to collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;''Health Services'', ''supra'' at 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court has since found in ''Ontario (AG) v Fraser'',&lt;ref&gt;2011 SCC 20 [''Fraser''].&lt;/ref&gt; that the right to collective bargaining does not require government to take an active role in promoting and fostering collective bargaining, but merely to refrain from excessive interference with the collective bargaining process. In effect, the right to collective bargaining "guarantees a process, not a result". ''Fraser'' was affirmed and expanded upon by the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] in 2012 in ''Association of Justice Counsel v Canada (AG)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Association of Justice Counsel v. Canada (Attorney General)|link=Association of Justice Counsel v. Canada (Attorney General)|year=2012|court=onca|num=530|format=onca|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, where a union is denied a right it does not preclude the employees from forming a separate association. In ''[[Delisle v Canada (Deputy AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1999] 2 SCR 989.&lt;/ref&gt; members of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] were excluded from the public services legislation. The Supreme Court held that they were not precluded from forming their own association outside of the impugned legislation. However, in contrast the decision of ''[[Dunmore v Ontario (AG)]]''&lt;ref&gt;2001 SCC 94.&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that agricultural workers who were excluded from provincial labour relations legislation were entitled to be included because individually they were unable to form their own associations, and consequently, this imposed a duty upon the government to include them.

The freedom of association also includes the freedom not to associate.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lavigne v Ontario Public Service Employees Union]]'', [1991] 2 SCR 211 [''Lavigne''].&lt;/ref&gt; In certain employment circumstances, employees are required to contribute to a union as conditions of their employment (see [[Rand formula]]). However, mandatory associations do not invoke section 2(d) in and of themselves. In ''Lavigne'', the Court found that the right not to be associated extended only to where the association supported causes that went beyond what is necessary for employee representation. More generally, the Supreme Court had stated that the right is violated only when the mandatory association imposes "ideological conformity".&lt;ref&gt;''R v Advance Cutting &amp; Coring Ltd'', 2001 SCC 70 [''Advance Cutting &amp; Coring''].&lt;/ref&gt; Such violations have also mostly been found by the Supreme Court to be justified under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]], resulting in a right not to associate that has more theoretical than practical effects.

In ''Advance Cutting &amp; Coring'',&lt;ref&gt;''Supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court was called to examine the constitutional validity of a Quebec law that required all persons working in the province's construction industry to join a designated union. Eight of nine judges (Justice [[Claire L'Heureux-Dubé]] dissenting) confirmed that section 2 includes, to at least some degree, the negative right to ''not'' associate. With a majority of five judges to four, the Court determined that the law at issue violated this right. But with the same majority (judge [[Frank Iacobucci]] "switching camps" on the two issues and citing a "unique and complex historical context" in Quebec), the Court deemed the law to be ''justified in a free and democratic society'' under section 1 and thus constitutional.

The idea of '''sexual script''' brings a new metaphor and imagery for understanding [[human sexual activity]] as social and learned interactions. The concept was introduced by sociologists [[John H. Gagnon]] and [[William Simon (sociologist)|William Simon]] in their 1973 book ''Sexual Conduct''. The idea highlights three levels of scripting: cultural/historical, social/interactive and personal/[[intrapsychic]]. It draws from a range of theories including [[symbolic interactionism]], discourse theory and [[feminism]].&lt;!-- It is the foundation of the new Critical Sexualities Studies and the reshaping of the field of sexualities studies in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century.--&gt; The theory of sexual scripting brings sociological, cultural, anthropological, historical and social psychological tools to the study of human sexualities. Whereas human sexuality is usually seen as the province of the biologist and the clinician, scripting helps research and analysis to understand sexualities as less biological and more cultural, historical and social.

== Sexual script ==
Sexual scripting suggests the importance of meanings and symbols in human sexuality. According to Gagnon and Simon, scripts can be layered through three dimensions: 'cultural scenarios', 'interpersonal scenarios', and 'intrapsychic scenarios'. Sexual feeling does not simply happen from within the body, but needs meanings and symbols which provide cues and clues to enable sexualities to develop. Cultural scenarios are linked to different historical periods and social change; scripts can be shown to change with the arrival of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s, for example (Epstein, Lauman ...). Interpersonal scenarios are linked to encounters and interactions (for example in rape, as illustrated in the early work of [[Stevi Jackson]]). And intra-psychic scenarios indicate the ways in which personal sexual 'turn ons' and imageries grow.&lt;!-- (cf [[William Simon (sociologist)|William Simon]]'s)--&gt; Sexual scripts can be seen as providing guidelines for appropriate sexual behaviour and sexual encounters, as sexual behaviour and encounters are learned through culture and others in interactions. It can be linked to theories of [[sexual desire]] but is critical of the tendency to stress the purely biological aspects of desire.

== Developments==
Drawing upon [[conversational analysis]],&lt;!--Frith and Kitzinger,--&gt; sexual encounters are considered to be scripted if the parties involved use any of these five linguistic devices:&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Frith, Celia Kitzinger, Reformulating Sexual Script Theory. Theory and Psychology, 11 (2). pp.&amp;nbsp;209–232. Sass, November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on sexual scripts and sexual script theory have concluded that sexual scripts are organised through gender, class, ethnicity and other social vectors.

Sexual script theory and its application in clinical practice are founded on the undeniable reality that the subjective understandings of each person about his or her sexuality (and called a sexual script) substantively determine that person's choice of sexual actions and the subsequent qualitative experiencing of those sexual acts. Scripts refer to social functions. They dictate what one should be doing at a particular time and in a particular place if one is to play the role characteristically associated with that script. There may be several people involved in the same situation, but they may differ in the roles that they have been given or have chosen to enact. Script theory is a form of social scripting theory which has been defined clearly by Michael W. Wiederman who says, "Social scripting theory points to the fact that much of sexual behavior seems to follow a script. Similar to scripts that stage actors use to guide their behavior, social scripts instruct members of a society as to appropriate behavior and the meanings to attach to certain behaviors."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael Wiederman, The Gendered Nature of Sexual Scripts. The Family Journal, Vol. 13, No. 4, 496-502. Sage Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Social scripting theory directly relates to sexual scripts as it is just a specified example regarding sexual encounters and sexual behavior in social context. [[Social theory]] is also a useful resource in determining the construction of social scripts.

== Social constructionism ==
The theory is linked to the wider development of [[social constructionism]] on the socially created nature of social life.&lt;!-- See the social construction of sexuality.--&gt; Social construction is important to sexual script because sexual scripts can come from how a child is raised through the beliefs of social construction.&lt;ref&gt;Social Construction of Gender. http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/ARTH/ARTH200/gender.html&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, women are to be subjected to [[male gaze]] in order to be a part of the social construction system and maintain social norms of a long living society.

== Sexuality ==
Sexuality is the behavior of human beings with regard to the activities that causes or is associated with sexual arousal. It is influenced by the genetically inherited sexual response patterns, societal attitudes toward sex, and each individual's upbringing. "Physiology sets only very broad limits on human sexuality; most of the enormous variation found among humans results from learning and conditioning. What is deviant in one society may be normal in another. Sexuality covers gender identity, sexual orientation, and actual practices, as well as one's acceptance of these aspects of one's personality, which may be more important than their specifics."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/reproductive-health]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual norms ==
A [[sexual norm]] can be an individual or a social norm, which is a rule that is socially enforced. Norms affect a wide variety of human behavior.
Social norms regarding sexuality are present in most cultures. For example, the norm in most cultures consists of heterosexual acts between married individuals. Sexual norms are constantly changing and normal sexual behavior is a spectrum and cannot be rigidly defined. 
Deviance from normal sexual behavior is common and can be classified in several ways. If non-restrictive sexual norms are regarded positively they may be called "sexual freedom", "sexual liberation", or "free love". If regarded negatively they may be called "sexual license" or "licentiousness". Restrictive behavior when judged negatively is called "sexual oppression"; if judged positively they are called "chastity", "sexual restraint", The Maritial Effect, or "sexual decency".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
In the West, sexual normality can be defined as any sexual practice which does not involve sexual perversions. There has been a liberalization in attitudes which has resulted in the legalization of homosexuality in many countries. There is a tendency in Western countries toward serial monogamy as a normal heterosexual lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton L. Jones, Heather R. Hostler, Sexual Script Theory: An Integrative Exploration of the Possibilities and Limits of Sexual Self-Definition. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists believe that emotion emerges in relation to dominant sexual scripts and [[sexual identity]]. Sexual script is also believed to have different scripts for males and females in relation to sexual activity. In sexual script's link to sexual activity; sexuality, sexual norms, social construction and gender roles all play a part in what makes sexual script differ between males and females.

== Gender script ==
{{Main|Gender Script}}
[[Gender schema theory]] also plays a part in sexual script because studies show that males and females interact in different ways, even from a young age. In 1991, Martha Boston and Gary Levy found that through their research observations, children, primarily boys, were better with being able to sequence own-sex rather than other-sex scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Levy, Martha Boston, Preschoolers' Recall of Own-Sex and Other-Sex Gender Scripts. The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 155(3). pp.&amp;nbsp;369–371. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; "As well as acquiring knowledge about the sex-role stereotypes of their culture, young children also develop sex-typed attitudes, preferences, and behaviors that pervade many aspects of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Serbin, Kimberly Powlishta, Judith Gulko, The Development of Sex Typing in Middle Childhood. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, Volume 58, No. 2. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an early age men are often raised to embrace their sexuality while women are usually brought up to suppress it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahs|first=Breanne|date=2010|title=Daddy's Little Girls: On the Perils of Chastity Clubs, Purity Balls, and Ritualized Abstinence|url=|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=31 |issue=3|pages=116|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomically, boys have the benefit (or curse) of genitals that are more easily viewed and handled by their owners. The young boy is taught to hold onto his penis to urinate and to handle it for purposes of washing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Conversely, the young girl is not taught to touch her clitoris. She is taught to wipe care- fully after urination so as not to contract an infection by transferring bacteria from her rectum to her vagina. The end result? Boys and girls are given two subtly different sets of messages regarding their own genitals. Boys readily discover that their genitals feel good when handled and are not necessarily any “dirtier” than other parts of their body that they can see.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Girls readily learn that their genitals are difficult, if not impossible, for them to see and that there are “dirty” aspects that require appropriate precautionary measures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, gender roles may encourage sexual exploration more for boys than for girls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A double standard exists in the traditional heterosexual sexual script. It endorses different sexual behavior for women and men, whereby women are expected to confine sexual behavior to the context of a committed relationship and men are expected to engage in sexual behavior in all kinds of relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Young adult men who have not realized that their female peers hold a different set of sexual scripts are often perplexed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At a time when young adults have finally gained a marked increase in privacy from family (such as going away to college or getting married), it often seems obvious to young men that sexual activity should “naturally” occur now that a major barrier has been overcome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females who take such a view run the risk of being labeled deviant. To be too sexually interested or aggressive, especially outside the context of an intimate relationship, implies masculinity, or desperation, or some other flaw.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ellen van Oost uses the concept of gender script "to illustrate the ways that the design of technological artifacts are affected by the gender assumptions held about their 'envisioned users.'" Drawing from Akrich's argument that, "like a film script, technical objects define a framework of action together with the actors and the space in which they are supposed to act,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Akrich |first=Madeleine |year=1992 |chapter=The de-scription of technical objects |editor1-last=Bijker |editor1-first=Wiebe E. |editor2-last=Law |editor2-first=John |title=Shaping technology/building society: Studies in sociotechnical change |publisher=The MIT Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; van Oost extends the script approach to include the gender aspects of technological innovation.&lt;!-- Oudshoorn and Pinch describe van Oost's approach as "[adopting] the views that technological innovation[, which] requires a renegotiation of gender relations and an articulation of performance of gender identities" (10).--&gt; van Oost looks at the ways electric shavers are gendered for men and women starting in the late 1920s, including the "cigar" model for men and the "lipstick model for women." van Oost also argues that the development of the electric razor systematically constructs a gender script of technological incompetence as feminine, and "inhibits the ability of women to see themselves as interested in technology and as technologically competent, whereas the genderscript of [electric razors "for men"] invites men to see themselves that way. In other words: [electric razors] not only [produce] razors but also gender."&lt;ref name=vanoost&gt;van Oost, Ellen. "Materialized Gender: How Shavers Configure the Users' Femininity and Masculinity," in Nelly Oudshoorn and Trevor Pinch, eds. How Users Matters. The Co-construction of Users and Technology (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2003). 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
The theory has now been applied to a wide range of areas including:

'''Social stratification''' is a kind of [[social differentiation]] whereby a society groups people into [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic]] strata,  based upon their [[Job|occupation]] and [[income]], [[wealth]] and [[social status]], or derived [[Power (social and political)|power]] (social and political). As such, stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group, category, geographic region, or [[social unit]].

In modern [[Western culture|Western societies]], social stratification typically is distinguished as three [[social class]]es: (i) the [[upper class]], (ii) the [[middle class]], and (iii) the [[Working class|lower class]]; in turn, each class can be subdivided into strata, e.g. the upper-stratum, the middle-stratum, and the lower stratum.&lt;ref name="Saunders1990"&gt;{{cite book | author-link=Peter Robert Saunders | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FK-004p0J_EC | title=Social Class and Stratification | publisher=Routledge | last=Saunders | first=Peter | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-415-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of [[kinship]], [[clan]], [[tribe]] or [[caste]], or all four.

The categorization of people by social strata occurs in all societies, ranging from the complex, [[State (polity)|state-based]] or [[Polycentric law|polycentric]] societies to [[tribal]] and [[feudal]] societies, which are based upon socio-economic relations among classes of [[nobility]] and classes of [[peasant]]s. Historically, whether or not [[hunter-gatherer]] societies can be defined as socially stratified or if social stratification began with [[agriculture]] and common acts of [[Social exchange theory|social exchange]], remains a debated matter in the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://worldhistoryconnected.press.illinois.edu/1.2/toye.html | title=The Emergence of Complex Societies: A Comparative Approach | author=Toye, David L. | journal=World History Connected |date=May 2004  | volume=11 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining the structures of social stratification arises from inequalities of status among persons, therefore, the degree of [[social inequality]] determines a person's social stratum. Generally, the greater the [[social complexity]] of a society, the more social strata exist, by way of [[Differentiation (sociology)|social differentiation]].&lt;ref name="Grusky2011a"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_yr2011_chunk_g978140512433125_ss1-273#citation | title=Theories of Stratification and Inequality | encyclopedia=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell. | accessdate=23 June 2014 | author=Grusky, David B. | editor=Ritzer, George and J.

==Overview==

===Definition and usage===

Social stratification is a term used in the social sciences to describe the relative social position of persons in a given [[social group]], [[categorization|category]], geographical region or other [[social unit]]. It derives from the [[Latin]] ''strātum'' (plural ''strata''; parallel, horizontal layers) referring to a given society’s categorization of its people into rankings of [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic]] tiers based on factors like [[wealth]], [[income]], [[social status]], [[job|occupation]] and [[Power (social and political)|power]]. In modern [[Western culture|Western societies]], stratification is often broadly classified into three major divisions of [[social class]]: [[upper class]], [[middle class]], and [[Working class|lower class]]. Each of these classes can be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. "upper middle").&lt;ref name="Saunders1990" /&gt; Social strata may also be delineated on the basis of [[kinship|kinship ties]] or [[caste]] relations.

The concept of social stratification is often used and interpreted differently within specific theories. In [[sociology]], for example, proponents of [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] have suggested that social stratification is commonly found in [[Development theory|developed]] societies, wherein a [[dominance hierarchy]] may be necessary in order to maintain [[social order]] and provide a stable [[social structure]]. So-called [[Conflict theory|conflict theories]], such as [[Marxism]], point to the inaccessibility of resources and lack of [[social mobility]] found in stratified societies. Many sociological theorists have criticized the extent to which the [[working classes]] are unlikely to advance socioeconomically while the [[Wealth#The upper class|wealthy]] tend to hold political power which they use to [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] the [[proletariat]] (laboring class). [[Talcott Parsons]], an American sociologist, asserted that stability and social order are regulated, in part, by [[universal value]]s.  Such values are not identical with "consensus" but can as well be an impetus for ardent social conflict as it has been multiple times through history. Parsons never claimed that universal values, in and by themselves, "satisfied" the [[functional prerequisites]] of a society.  Indeed, the constitution of society is a much more complicated codification of emerging historical factors. Theorists such as [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] alternately note the tendency toward an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies due to the necessity of an educated workforce in technological economies. Various social and political perspectives concerning [[globalization]], such as [[dependency theory]], suggest that these effects are due to change in the status of workers to the [[third world]].

===Four underlying principles===
Four principles are posited to underlie social stratification.  First, social stratification is socially defined as a property of a society rather than individuals in that society. Second, social stratification is reproduced from generation to generation. Third, social stratification is universal (found in every society) but variable (differs across time and place).  Fourth, social stratification involves not just quantitative [[economic inequality|inequality]] but qualitative beliefs and attitudes about social status.&lt;ref name="Grusky2011a" /&gt;

===Complexity===
Although stratification is not limited to complex societies, all complex societies exhibit features of stratification.  In any complex society, the total stock of valued goods is distributed unequally, wherein the most [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileged]] individuals and families enjoy a disproportionate share of [[income]], [[Power (social and political)|power]], and other [[Value theory|valued]] resources. The term "stratification system" is sometimes used to refer to the complex [[social relationship]]s and [[social structure]] that generate these observed inequalities. The key components of such systems are: (a) [[Social institution|social-institutional]] processes that define certain types of goods as valuable and desirable, (b) the [[Social contract|rules]] of allocation that distribute goods and resources across various positions in the [[division of labor]] (e.g., physician, farmer, ‘housewife’), and (c) the [[social mobility]] processes that link individuals to positions and thereby generate unequal control over valued resources.&lt;ref name="Grusky1992"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Social Stratification | encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Sociology | publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company. |author1=Grusky, David B.  |author2=Ann Azumi Takata  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1992 | pages=1955–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social mobility===
Social mobility is the movement of individuals, social groups or categories of people between the layers or strata in a stratification system.  This movement can be intragenerational (within a generation) or intergenerational (between two or more generations).  Such mobility is sometimes used to classify different systems of social stratification.  [[Open system (systems theory)|Open]] stratification systems are those that allow for mobility between strata, typically by placing value on the [[achieved status]] characteristics of individuals.  Those societies having the highest levels of intragenerational mobility are considered to be the most open and malleable systems of stratification.&lt;ref name="Grusky2011a" /&gt;  Those systems in which there is little to no mobility, even on an intergenerational basis, are considered closed stratification systems. For example, in caste systems, all aspects of social status are [[Ascribed status|ascribed]], such that one's social position at birth is the position one holds for a lifetime.&lt;ref name="Grusky1992" /&gt;

==Theories of stratification==

===Historical===

====Karl Marx====
{{Main|Marxism|Historical materialism|Base and superstructure}}
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumbnail|The 1911 "[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]" cartoon is an example of socialist [[critique of capitalism]] and of social stratification]]
In Marxist theory, the modern [[mode of production]] consists of two main economic parts: the base and the superstructure. The base encompasses the [[relations of production]]: employer–employee work conditions, the technical [[division of labour]], and property relations. Social class, according to Marx, is determined by one's relationship to the means of production.  There exist at least two classes in any class-based society: the owners of the means of production and those who sell their labor to the owners of the means of production.  At times, Marx almost hints that the ruling classes seem to own the working class itself as they only have their own [[labor power]] ('[[wage labor]]') to offer the more powerful in order to survive. These relations fundamentally determine the ideas and philosophies of a society and additional classes may form as part of the superstructure. Through the ideology of the ruling class—throughout much of history, the land-owning [[aristocracy]]—[[false consciousness]] is promoted both through political and non-political institutions but also through the [[arts]] and other elements of [[culture]]. When the aristocracy falls,  the [[bourgeoisie]] become the owners of the means of production in the capitalist system. Marx predicted the [[capitalist]] mode would eventually give way, through its own internal conflict, to revolutionary consciousness and the development of more egalitarian, more [[communist]] societies.

Marx also described two other classes, the petite [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[lumpenproletariat]]. The petite bourgeoisie is like a small business class that never really accumulates enough profit to become part of the bourgeoisie, or even challenge their status. The lumpenproletariat is the [[underclass]], those with little to no social status. This includes prostitutes, beggars, the [[Homelessness|homeless]] or other [[Untouchability|untouchables]] in a given society. Neither of these subclasses has much influence in Marx's two major classes, but it is helpful to know that Marx did recognize differences within the classes.&lt;ref&gt;Doob, Christopher. ''Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society'' (1st ed.), Pearson Education, 2012, {{ISBN|0-205-79241-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marvin Harris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Harris | first=Marvin | author-link=Marvin Harris | year=1967 | title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture | publisher=Routledge | isbn=0-7591-0133-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TlgVAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tim Ingold]],&lt;ref name="Ingold, Tim 2006 p. 400"&gt;Ingold, Tim (2006) "On the social relations of the hunter-gatherer band," in [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard B. Lee]] and Richard H. Daly (eds.), ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers,'' p. 400. New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-60919-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s accounts of egalitarian hunter-gatherers formed part of Karl Marx' and [[Friedrich Engels]]' inspiration for [[communism]]. Morgan spoke of a situation in which people living in the same community pooled their efforts and shared the rewards of those efforts fairly equally. He called this "communism in living." But when Marx expanded on these ideas, he still emphasized an economically oriented culture, with [[property]] defining the fundamental relationships between people.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Alan (2006) "Images of hunters and gatherers in European social thought," in [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard B. Lee]] and Richard H. Daly (eds.), ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers,'' p. 379. New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-60919-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, issues of [[ownership]] and property are arguably less emphasized in hunter-gatherer societies.&lt;ref name="Gowdy2006"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | isbn=0-521-60919-4 | title=Hunter-gatherers and the mythology of the market | encyclopedia=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Gowdy, John | editor=Lee, Richard B. and Richard H. Daly | year=2006 | pages=391–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with the very different social and economic situations of hunter-gatherers may account for many of the difficulties encountered when implementing communism in industrialized states. As Ingold points out: "The notion of communism, removed from the context of domesticity and harnessed to support a project of social engineering for large-scale, industrialized states with populations of millions, eventually came to mean something quite different from what Morgan had intended: namely, a principle of redistribution that would override all ties of a personal or familial nature, and cancel out their effects."&lt;ref name="Ingold, Tim 2006 p. 400"/&gt;

The counter-argument to Marxist's conflict theory is the theory of structural functionalism, argued by [[Kingsley Davis]] and [[Wilbert E. Moore|Wilbert Moore]], which states that social inequality places a vital role in the smooth operation of a society. The [[Davis–Moore hypothesis]] argues that a position does not bring power and prestige because it draws a high income; rather, it draws a high income because it is functionally important and the available personnel is for one reason or another scarce. Most high-income jobs are difficult and require a high level of education to perform, and their compensation is a motivator in society for people to strive to achieve more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Some Principles of Stratification|jstor = 2085643|journal = American Sociological Review|date = 1945-04-01|pages = 242–249|volume = 10|issue = 2|doi = 10.2307/2085643|first = Kingsley|last = Davis|first2 = Wilbert E.|last2 = Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Max Weber====
{{Main|Three-component theory of stratification|Tripartite classification of authority}}
[[Max Weber]] was strongly influenced by Marx's ideas but rejected the possibility of effective communism, arguing that it would require an even greater level of detrimental social control and bureaucratization than capitalist society. Moreover, Weber criticized the [[dialectical]] presumption of a proletariat revolt, maintaining it to be unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Holborn, M. &amp; Langley, P. (2004) AS &amp; A level Student Handbook, accompanies the Sixth Edition: Haralambos &amp; Holborn, ''Sociology: Themes and perspectives,'' London: Collins Educational&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he develops a [[three-component theory of stratification]] and the concept of [[life chances]]. Weber held there are more class divisions than Marx suggested, taking different concepts from both [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] and [[Marxist]] theories to create his own system. He emphasizes the difference between class, status and power, and treats these as separate but related sources of power, each with different effects on [[social action]]. Working half a century later than Marx, Weber claims there to be four main social classes: the [[upper class]], the [[white collar workers]], the [[petite bourgeoisie]], and the manual [[working class]]. Weber's theory more-closely resembles contemporary [[Western culture|Western]] class structures, although economic status does not currently seem to depend strictly on earnings in the way Weber envisioned.

Weber derives many of his key concepts on social stratification by examining the social structure of [[Germany]]. He notes that, contrary to Marx's theories, stratification is based on more than simple ownership of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Weber examines how many members of the aristocracy lacked economic wealth yet had strong political power. Many wealthy families lacked prestige and power, for example, because they were [[Jewish]]. Weber introduced three independent factors that form his theory of stratification hierarchy, which are; class, status, and power:
* '''Class''': A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology 7th Canadian Ed|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, Ontario|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber notes how corporate executives control firms they typically do not own; Marx would have placed these people in the [[proletariat]] despite their high incomes by virtue of the fact they sell their labor instead of owning capital.
* '''Status''': A person's prestige, social honor, or popularity in a society. Weber notes that political power is not rooted in capital value solely, but also in one's individual status. Poets or saints, for example, can have extensive influence on society despite few material resources.
* '''Power''': A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others, particularly in their ability to engage [[social change]]. For example, individuals in government jobs, such as an employee of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], or a member of the [[United States Congress]], may hold little property or status but still wield considerable [[Power (social and political)|social power]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====C. Wright Mills====
{{Main|Elite theory}}

[[C. Wright Mills]], drawing from the theories of [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Gaetano Mosca]], contends that the imbalance of power in society derives from the complete absence of countervailing powers against corporate leaders of the [[Power elite]].&lt;ref name="Doob"&gt;{{cite book | title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society | publisher=Pearson Education Inc. | last=Doob | first=Christopher | year=2013 | location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | page=38 | isbn=978-0-205-79241-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills1956"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Power Elite | publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Mills | first=Charles W. | year=1956 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mills both incorporated and revised [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas. While he shared [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] recognition of a dominant wealthy and powerful class, [[C. Wright Mills|Mills]] believed that the source for that power lay not only in the economic realm but also in the political and military arenas.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt; During the 1950s, Mills stated that hardly anyone knew about the power elite's existence, some individuals (including the elite themselves) denied the idea of such a group, and other people vaguely believed that a small formation of a powerful elite existed.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt; "Some prominent individuals knew that [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] had permitted a handful of political leaders to make critical decisions about peace and war; and that two [[atomic bomb]]s had been dropped on Japan in the name of the United States, but neither they nor anyone they knew had been consulted."&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;

[[C. Wright Mills|Mills]] explains that the power elite embody a privileged class whose members are able to recognize their high position within society.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt; In order to maintain their highly exalted position within society, members of the power elite tend to marry one another, understand and accept one another, and also work together.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills1956" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5]&lt;/sup&gt;  The most crucial aspect of the power elite's existence lays within the core of education.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt; "Youthful upper-class members attend prominent preparatory schools, which not only open doors to such elite universities as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] but also to the universities' highly exclusive clubs. These memberships in turn pave the way to the prominent social clubs located in all major cities and serving as sites for important business contacts."&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills1956" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[p.&amp;nbsp;63–67]&lt;/sup&gt; Examples of elite members who attended prestigious universities and were members of highly exclusive clubs can be seen in [[George W. Bush]] and [[John Kerry]]. Both Bush and Kerry were members of the [[Skull and Bones]] club while attending Yale University.&lt;ref name="Leung"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leung|first=Rebecca|title=Skull and Bones|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-576332.html|work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] ([[CBS]]) (accessed 12/03/2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This club includes members of some of the most powerful men of the twentieth century, all of which are forbidden to tell others about the secrets of their exclusive club. Throughout the years, the Skull and Bones club has included [[Presidents of the United States|presidents]], cabinet officers, Supreme Court justices, spies, captains of industry, and often their sons and daughters join the exclusive club, creating a social and political network like none ever seen before.&lt;ref name="Leung"/&gt;

The upper class individuals who receive elite educations typically have the essential background and contacts to enter into the three branches of the power elite: The political leadership, the military circle, and the corporate elite.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;

*'''The Political Leadership:''' Mills held that, prior to the end of [[World War II]], leaders of corporations became more prominent within the political sphere along with a decline in central decision-making among professional politicians.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;
*'''The Military Circle:''' During the 1950s-1960s, increasing concerns about [[warfare]] resulted in top military leaders and issues involving defense funding and military personnel training becoming a top priority within the United States. Most of the prominent politicians and corporate leaders have been strong proponents of military spending.
*'''The Corporate Elite:''' Mills explains that during the 1950s, when the military emphasis was recognized, corporate leaders worked with prominent military officers who dominated the development of policies. Corporate leaders and high-ranking military officers were mutually supportive of each other.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills1956" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[pp.&amp;nbsp;274–276]&lt;/sup&gt;

Mills shows that the power elite has an "inner-core" made up of individuals who are able to move from one position of institutional power to another; for example, a prominent military officer who becomes a political adviser or a powerful politician who becomes a corporate executive.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt; "These people have more knowledge and a greater breadth of interests than their colleagues. Prominent bankers and financiers, who Mills considered 'almost professional go-betweens of economic, political, and military affairs,' are also members of the elite's inner core.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills1956" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[pp. 288–289]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Anthropological theories===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}
Some [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] dispute the "universal" nature of social stratification, holding that it is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy (2006) writes, "Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal, that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples.&lt;ref name="Gowdy2006" /&gt; Non-stratified [[egalitarian]] or [[Acephalous Society|acephalous]] ("headless") societies exist which have little or no concept of social hierarchy, political or economic status, class, or even permanent leadership.

===Kinship-orientation===
{{See also|Original affluent society}}

Anthropologists identify egalitarian cultures as "[[kinship]]-oriented," because they appear to value social harmony more than wealth or status. These cultures are contrasted with economically oriented cultures (including [[State (polity)|states]]) in which status and material wealth are prized, and stratification, competition, and conflict are common. Kinship-oriented cultures actively work to prevent social hierarchies from developing because they believe that such stratification could lead to conflict and instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gender and Rural Development | publisher=LIT Verlag Münster | author=Deji, Olanike F. | year=2011 | location=London | page=93 | isbn=978-3643901033}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reciprocal altruism]] is one process by which this is accomplished.

A good example is given by [[Richard Borshay Lee]] in his account of the [[Khoisan]], who practice ''"insulting the meat."'' Whenever a hunter makes a kill, he is ceaselessly teased and ridiculed (in a friendly, joking fashion) to prevent him from becoming too proud or egotistical. The meat itself is then distributed evenly among the entire social group, rather than kept by the hunter. The level of teasing is proportional to the size of the kill. Lee found this out when he purchased an entire cow as a gift for the group he was living with, and was teased for weeks afterward about it (since obtaining that much meat could be interpreted as showing off).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Richard B. (1976), ''Kalahari Hunter-Gatherers: Studies of the !Kung San and Their Neighbors,'' Richard B. Lee and Irven DeVore, eds. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Indigenous Australians]] of [[Groote Eylandt]] and [[Bickerton Island]], off the coast of [[Arnhem Land]], who have arranged their entire society—spiritually and economically—around a kind of [[gift economy]] called ''[[Reciprocal altruism|renunciation]].'' According to [[David H. Turner]], in this arrangement, every person is expected to give ''everything'' of any resource they have to any other person who needs or lacks it at the time. This has the benefit of largely eliminating social problems like theft and relative poverty. However, misunderstandings obviously arise when attempting to reconcile Aboriginal ''renunciative economics'' with the competition/scarcity-oriented [[economics]] introduced to Australia by Anglo-European colonists.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, David H. (1999), ''Genesis Regained: Aboriginal Forms of Renunciation in Judeo-Christian Scriptures and Other Major Traditions,'' pp. 1-9, Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variables in theory and research==

The social status variables underlying social stratification are based in social perceptions and [[Social attitude|attitudes]] about various characteristics of persons and peoples. While many such variables cut across time and place, the relative [[Statistical weight|weight]] placed on each variable and specific combinations of these variables will differ from place to place over time.  One task of research is to identify accurate [[mathematical model]]s that explain how these many variables combine to produce stratification in a given society. Grusky (2011) provides a good overview of the historical development of sociological theories of social stratification and a summary of contemporary theories and research in this field.&lt;ref name="Grusky2011b"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/grusky/article_files/past_present_future_social_inequality.pdf | title="The Past, Present and Future of Social Inequality." In Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender in Sociological Perspective (Second Edition) | publisher=Westview Press | author=Grusky, David B | year=2011 | location=Boulder | pages=3–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the variables that contribute to an understanding of social stratification have long been identified, models of these variables and their role in constituting social stratification are still an active topic of theory and research.  In general, sociologists recognize that there are no "pure" economic variables, as social factors are integral to economic value. However, the variables posited to affect social stratification can be loosely divided into economic and other social factors.

===Economic===
{{Main|Economic inequality}}

Strictly [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] economic variables are more useful to [[Descriptive statistics|describing]] social stratification than [[Explanatory power|explaining]] how social stratification is constituted or maintained.  [[Income]] is the most common variable used to describe stratification and associated [[economic inequality]] in a society.&lt;ref name="Grusky1992" /&gt; However, the distribution of individual or [[household]] accumulation of [[excess supply|surplus]] and [[wealth]] tells us more about variation in individual [[well-being]] than does income, alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Who Rules America? The Triumph of the Corporate Rich | publisher=McGraw-Hill | author=Domhoff, G. William | year=2013 | page=288 | isbn=978-0078026713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealth variables can also more vividly illustrate salient variations in the well-being of groups in stratified societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Perry-Rivers, P. |date=October 2014  | title = Stratification, Economic Adversity, and Entrepreneurial Launch: The Converse Effect of Resource Position on Entrepreneurial Strategy | journal = Entrepreneurship Theory &amp; Practice |volume=40  |issue=3  |pages=685  | doi=10.1111/etap.12137}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), especially ''per capita'' GDP, is sometimes used to describe economic inequality and stratification at the [[International inequality|international]] or global level.

===Social===
{{Main|Social status}}

Social variables, both quantitative and [[qualitative research|qualitative]], typically provide the most explanatory power in [[Causality|causal]] research regarding social stratification, either as [[Independent variable#Independent variable|independent]] variables or as [[intervening variable]]s. Three important social variables include [[gender roles|gender]], [[Race (human classification)|race]], and [[ethnicity]], which, at the least, have an intervening effect on social status and stratification in most places throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Hill1998"&gt;{{cite book | title="Toward a new vision: race, class and gender as categories of analysis and connection" in Social Class and Stratification: Classic Statements and Theoretical Debates | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author=Collins, Patricia Hill | year=1998 | location=Boston | pages=231–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional variables include those that describe other ascribed and achieved characteristics such as [[Job (role)|occupation]] and [[skill]] levels, [[Ageing|age]], [[education]] level, education level of parents, and [[Geography|geographic]] area. Some of these variables may have both causal and intervening effects on social status and stratification.  For example, absolute age may cause a low income if one is too young or too old to perform productive work.  The social perception of age and its role in the workplace, which may lead to [[ageism]], typically has an intervening effect on [[employment]] and income.

Social scientists are sometimes interested in quantifying the degree of economic stratification between different social categories, such as men and women, or workers with different levels of education. An index of stratification has been recently proposed by Zhou for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Zhou2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Xiang|title=A Nonparametric Index of Stratification|journal=Sociological Methodology|date=2012|volume=42|issue=1|pages=365–389|doi=10.1177/0081175012452207|url=http://smx.sagepub.com/content/42/1/365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender====
{{Main|Gender inequality}}

Gender is one of the most pervasive and prevalent social characteristics which people use to make social distinctions between individuals. Gender distinctions are found in economic-, kinship- and caste-based stratification systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Issues of Gender | publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |author1=Friedman, Ellen |author2=Jennifer Marshall  |lastauthoramp=yes | year= 2004 | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social role]] expectations often form along sex and gender lines.  Entire societies may be classified by social scientists according to the [[rights]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]] afforded to men or women, especially those associated with ownership and inheritance of [[property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title= The Impact of Gender Equality in Land Rights on Development |author1=Mason, K.  |author2=H. Carlsson  |lastauthoramp=yes | booktitle= Human Rights and Development: Towards Mutual Reinforcement | year= 2004 | conference= Human Rights and Development: Towards Mutual Reinforcement | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[patriarchal]] societies, such rights and privileges are [[norm (social)|normatively]] granted to men over women; in [[matriarchal]] societies, the opposite holds true.  Sex- and gender-based [[division of labor]] is historically found in the annals of most societies and such divisions increased with the advent of [[industrialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= New Family Values: Liberty, Equality, Diversity | publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author= Struening, Karen | year= 2002 | location= New York | isbn= 978-0-7425-1231-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-based [[wage discrimination]] exists in some societies such that men, typically, receive higher wages than women for the same type of work. Other differences in employment between men and women lead to an overall gender-based pay-gap in many societies, where women as a category earn less than men due to the types of jobs which women are offered and take, as well as to differences in the number of hours worked by women.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | title= Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale: Women in the International Division of Labour. 
| publisher= Palgrave MacMillan | author= Mies, Maria | year= 1999 | location= London
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other gender-related values affect the distribution of income, wealth, and property in a given social order.

====Race====
{{Main|Racism}}

Racism consists of both [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] based in social perceptions of observable biological differences between peoples. It often takes the form of [[social actions]], practices or beliefs, or [[political system]]s in which different races are perceived to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities. In a given society, those who share racial characteristics socially perceived as undesirable are typically under-represented in positions of social power, i.e., they become a [[Minority group|minority category]] in that society. Minority members in such a society are often subjected to discriminatory actions resulting from majority policies, including [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[Social exclusion|exclusion]], [[oppression]], [[exile|expulsion]], and [[genocide|extermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Devising an Adequate System of Minority Protection: Individual Human Rights, Minority Rights and the Right to Self-Determination | publisher=Springer | author=Henrard, Kristen | year=2000 | location=New York | isbn=978-9041113597}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overt racism usually feeds directly into a stratification system through its effect on social status.  For example, members associated with a particular race may be assigned a [[Slavery|slave status]], a form of oppression in which the majority refuses to grant basic [[rights]] to a minority that are granted to other members of the society.  More [[covert racism]], such as that which many scholars posit is practiced in more contemporary societies, is socially hidden and less easily detectable.  Covert racism often feeds into stratification systems as an intervening variable affecting income, educational opportunities, and housing. Both overt and covert racism can take the form of [[structural inequality]] in a society in which [[Institutional racism|racism has become institutionalized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Social Construction of Whiteness: Racism by Intent, Racism by Consequence | author=Guess, Teresa J | journal=Critical Sociology |date=July 2006  | volume=32 | issue=4 | pages=649–673 | doi=10.1163/156916306779155199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethnicity====
{{Main|Ethnocentricity}}

Ethnic prejudice and discrimination operate much the same as do racial prejudice and discrimination in society.  In fact, only recently have scholars begun to differentiate race and ethnicity; historically, the two were considered to be identical or closely related.  With the scientific development of [[genetics]] and the [[human genome]] as fields of study, most scholars now recognize that [[race (human classification)|race]] is socially defined on the basis of biologically determined characteristics that can be observed within a society while ethnicity is defined on the basis of [[Culture|culturally]] learned behavior. Ethnic identification can include shared cultural heritage such as [[language]] and [[dialect]], [[symbolic system]]s, [[religion]], [[mythology]] and [[cuisine]]. As with race, ethnic categories of persons may be socially defined as minority [[Ethnic groups|categories]] whose members are under-represented in positions of social power.  As such, ethnic categories of persons can be subject to the same types of majority policies. Whether ethnicity feeds into a stratification system as a direct, causal factor or as an intervening variable may depend on the level of ethnocentrism within each of the various ethnic populations in a society, the amount of conflict over scarce resources, and the relative social power held within each ethnic category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Theory of the Origin of Ethnic Stratification | author=Noel, Donald L. | journal=Social Problems |date=Autumn 1968  | volume=16 | issue=2 | pages=157–172 | doi=10.2307/800001 | jstor=800001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global stratification==
{{Main|World-systems theory|Dependency theory}}

The world and the pace of [[social change]] today are very different than in the time of Karl Marx, Max Weber, or even C. Wright Mills.  [[Globalization|Globalizing]] forces lead to rapid international integration arising from the interchange of [[world view]]s, products, ideas, and other aspects of culture.&lt;ref name=GCSP&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf |date=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Albrow&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990). ''Globalization, Knowledge and Society ''London: Sage. {{ISBN|978-0803983243}} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advances in [[transportation]] and [[telecommunication]]s infrastructure, including the rise of the [[telegraph]] and its posterity the [[Internet]], are major factors in globalization, generating further [[interdependence]] of economic and cultural activities.&lt;ref name=Stever_1972&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stever | first1 = H. Guyford | year = 1972 | title = Science, Systems, and Society | url = | journal = Journal of Cybernetics | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 1–3 | doi = 10.1080/01969727208542909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like a stratified class system within a nation, looking at the [[world economy]] one can see class positions in the unequal distribution of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and other resources between nations. Rather than having separate national economies, nations are considered as participating in this world economy. The world economy manifests a global [[division of labor]] with three overarching classes: [[core countries]], [[semi-periphery countries]] and [[periphery countries]],&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1974). The Modern World-System I: Capitalist Agriculture and  the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; according to World-systems and Dependency theories. Core nations primarily own and control the major means of production in the world and perform the higher-level production tasks and provide international financial services. Periphery nations own very little of the world's [[means of production]] (even when factories are located in periphery nations) and provide low to non-skilled labor. Semiperipheral nations are midway between the core and periphery. They tend to be countries moving towards industrialization and more diversified economies.&lt;ref name=PH&gt;Paul Halsall [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/wallerstein.html Modern History Sourcebook: Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory], August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Core nations receive the greatest share of surplus production, and periphery nations receive the least. Furthermore, core nations are usually able to purchase raw materials and other goods from noncore nations at low prices, while demanding higher prices for their exports to noncore nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Social Change in the Twentieth Century | publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich | author=Chirot, Daniel | year=1977 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[global workforce]] employed through a system of [[global labor arbitrage]] ensures that companies in core countries can utilize the cheapest semi-and non-skilled labor for production.

Today we have the means to gather and analyze data from economies across the globe.  Although many societies worldwide have made great strides toward more equality between differing geographic regions, in terms of the [[standard of living]] and [[life chances]] afforded to their peoples, we still find large gaps between the wealthiest and the poorest within a nation and between the wealthiest and poorest nations of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2013/2013-world-population-data-sheet.aspx | title=2013 World Population Data Sheet | publisher=Population Research Bureau | date=2013 | accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A January 2014 [[Oxfam]] report indicates that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2014-01-20/rigged-rules-mean-economic-growth-increasingly-winner-takes-all-for-rich-elites Rigged rules mean economic growth increasingly "winner takes all" for rich elites all over world]. ''[[Oxfam]].'' 20 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, for 2012, the [[World Bank]] reports that 21 percent of people worldwide, around 1.5 billion, live in extreme poverty, at or below $1.25 a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/isp/publication/inequality-in-focus | title=An Overview of Global Income Inequality Trends |author1=Olinto, Pedro  |author2=Jaime Saavedra  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Inequalitty in Focus |date=April 2012  | volume=1 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zygmunt Bauman has provocatively observed that the rise of the rich is linked to their capacity to lead highly mobile lives: 'Mobility climbs to the rank of the uppermost among coveted values -and the freedom to move, perpetually a scarce and unequally distributed commodity, fast becomes the main stratifying factor of our late modern or postmodern time.' &lt;ref&gt;Bauman, Z.

{{For|the ranking system, e.g. "four out of five stars"|Star (classification)}}
{{star nav}}

In [[astronomy]], '''stellar classification''' is the classification of [[star]]s based on their [[stellar spectrum|spectral]] characteristics. [[Electromagnetic radiation]] from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a [[prism]] or [[diffraction grating]] into a [[spectrum]] exhibiting the [[Continuum (spectrum)|rainbow]] of colors interspersed with [[spectral line]]s. Each line indicates a particular [[chemical element]] or [[molecule]], with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element. The strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the [[photosphere]], although in some cases there are true abundance differences. The ''spectral class'' of a star is a short code primarily summarizing the [[ionization]] state, giving an objective measure of the photosphere's temperature.

Most stars are currently classified under the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system using the letters ''O'', ''B'', ''A'', ''F'', ''G'', ''K'', and ''M'', a sequence from the hottest (''O'' type) to the coolest (''M'' type). Each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with ''0'' being hottest and ''9'' being coolest (e.g. A8, A9, F0, and F1 form a sequence from hotter to cooler). The sequence has been expanded with classes for other stars and star-like objects that do not fit in the classical system, such as class&amp;nbsp;''D'' for [[white dwarf]]s and classes&amp;nbsp;''S'' and ''C'' for [[carbon star]]s.

In the MK system, a [[luminosity class]] is added to the spectral class using [[Roman numerals]]. This is based on the width of certain absorption lines in the star's spectrum, which vary with the density of the atmosphere and so distinguish giant stars from dwarfs. Luminosity class&amp;nbsp;''0'' or ''Ia+'' is used for ''hypergiants'', class&amp;nbsp;''I'' for ''supergiants'', class&amp;nbsp;''II'' for bright ''giants'', class&amp;nbsp;''III'' for regular ''giants'', class&amp;nbsp;''IV'' for ''sub-giants'', class&amp;nbsp;''V'' for ''[[main-sequence]] stars'', class&amp;nbsp;''sd'' (or ''VI'') for ''sub-dwarfs'', and class&amp;nbsp;''D'' (or ''VII'') for ''white dwarfs''. The full spectral class for the [[Sun]] is then G2V, indicating a main-sequence star with a temperature around 5,800&amp;nbsp;K.

==Conventional color description==
{{Main|Green star (astronomy)}}
[[File:TernaryColorTmap.PNG|thumb|Just-saturated RGB-camera discs]]

The conventional color description takes into account only the peak of the stellar spectrum. In actuality, however, stars radiate in all parts of the spectrum. Because all spectral colors combined appear white, the actual apparent colors the human eye would observe are far lighter than the conventional color descriptions would suggest. This characteristic of 'lightness' indicates that the simplified assignment of colors within the spectrum can be misleading. Excluding color-contrast illusions in dim light, there are no green, indigo, or violet stars. [[Red dwarf]]s are a deep shade of orange, and [[brown dwarf]]s do not literally appear brown, but hypothetically would appear dim grey to a nearby observer.

==Modern classification{{anchor|MK}}==
[[File:Morgan-Keenan spectral classification.png|thumb|The Morgan–Keenan spectral classification]]

The modern classification system is known as the ''Morgan–Keenan'' (MK) classification. Each star is assigned a spectral class from the older Harvard spectral classification and a luminosity class using Roman numerals as explained below, forming the star's spectral type.

Other modern [[photometric system|stellar classification systems]], such as the [[UBV photometric system|UBV system]], are based on [[color index]]es—the measured differences in three or more [[Magnitude (astronomy)|color magnitude]]s. Those numbers are given labels such as "U-V" or "B-V", which represent the colors passed by two standard filters (e.g. ''U''ltraviolet, ''B''lue and ''V''isual).

===Harvard spectral classification===
The ''Harvard system'' is a one-dimensional classification scheme by astronomer [[Annie Jump Cannon]], who re-ordered and simplified a prior alphabetical system. Stars are grouped according to their spectral characteristics by single letters of the alphabet, optionally with numeric subdivisions. Main-sequence stars vary in surface temperature from approximately 2,000 to 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]], whereas more-evolved stars can have temperatures above 100,000&amp;nbsp;K. Physically, the classes indicate the temperature of the star's atmosphere and are normally listed from hottest to coldest.

[[File:H-R diagram.svg|thumb|The [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] relates stellar classification with [[absolute magnitude]], [[luminosity]], and surface [[temperature]].]]

The spectral classes O through M, as well as other more specialized classes discussed later, are subdivided by [[Arabic numerals]] (0–9), where 0 denotes the hottest stars of a given class. For example, A0 denotes the hottest stars in class&amp;nbsp;A and A9 denotes the coolest ones. Fractional numbers are allowed; for example, the star [[Mu Normae]] is classified as O9.7.&lt;ref name="UpsOriType"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS). II.

Conventional color descriptions are traditional in astronomy, and represent colors relative to the mean color of an A&amp;nbsp;class star, which is considered to be white. The apparent color&lt;ref name="möre"/&gt; descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. However, most stars in the sky, except the brightest ones, appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work. Red supergiants are cooler and redder than dwarfs of the same spectral type, and stars with particular spectral features such as carbon stars may be far redder than any black body.

The fact that the Harvard classification of a star indicated its surface or [[Photosphere|photospheric]] [[temperature]] (or more precisely, its [[effective temperature]]) was not fully understood until after its development, though by the time the first [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] was formulated (by 1914), this was generally suspected to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Relations Between the Spectra and Other Characteristics of the Stars |magazine=Popular Astronomy |last=Russell |first=Henry Norris |volume=22 |pages=275–294 |date=March 1914 |bibcode=1914PA.....22..275R}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the Indian physicist [[Meghnad Saha]] derived a theory of ionization by extending well-known ideas in physical chemistry pertaining to the dissociation of molecules to the ionization of atoms. First he applied it to the solar chromosphere, then to stellar spectra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On a Physical Theory of Stellar Spectra |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A |last=Saha |first=M. N. |volume=99 |issue=697 |pages=135–153 |date=May 1921 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1921.0029 |bibcode=1921RSPSA..99..135S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard astronomer [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin|Cecilia Payne]] then demonstrated that the ''O-B-A-F-G-K-M'' spectral sequence is actually a sequence in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |title=Stellar Atmospheres; a Contribution to the Observational Study of High Temperature in the Reversing Layers of Stars |publisher=Radcliffe College |first=Cecilia Helena |last=Payne |type=Ph.D |date=1925 |bibcode=1925PhDT.........1P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the classification sequence predates our understanding that it is a temperature sequence, the placement of a spectrum into a given subtype, such as B3 or A7, depends upon (largely subjective) estimates of the strengths of absorption features in stellar spectra. As a result, these subtypes are not evenly divided into any sort of mathematically representable intervals.

Hydrogen lines are strongest for types A and B, and the overall spectrum peaks at shorter wavelengths for hotter stars.]]

The ''Yerkes spectral classification'', also called the ''MKK'' system from the authors' initials, is a system of stellar spectral classification introduced in 1943 by [[William Wilson Morgan]], [[Philip Childs Keenan|Philip C. Keenan]], and [[Edith Kellman]] from [[Yerkes Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An atlas of stellar spectra, with an outline of spectral classification |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |first1=William Wilson |last1=Morgan |first2=Philip Childs |last2=Keenan |first3=Edith |last3=Kellman |date=1943 |bibcode=1943assw.book.....M |oclc=1806249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This two-dimensional ([[temperature]] and [[luminosity]]) classification scheme is based on [[spectral line]]s sensitive to stellar temperature and [[surface gravity]], which is related to luminosity (whilst the ''Harvard classification'' is based on just surface temperature). Later, in 1953, after some revisions of list of standard stars and classification criteria, the scheme was named the ''Morgan–Keenan classification'', or ''MK'',&lt;ref name="ref_MK"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Spectral Classification |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |first1=William Wilson |last1=Morgan |first2=Philip Childs |last2=Keenan |volume=11 |pages=29–50 |date=1973 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.11.090173.000333 |bibcode=1973ARA&amp;A..11...29M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this system remains in use.

Denser stars with higher surface gravity exhibit greater [[pressure broadening]] of spectral lines. The gravity, and hence the pressure, on the surface of a [[giant star]] is much lower than for a [[dwarf star]] because the radius of the giant is much greater than a dwarf of similar mass. Therefore, differences in the spectrum can be interpreted as ''luminosity effects'' and a luminosity class can be assigned purely from examination of the spectrum.

A number of different ''luminosity classes'' are distinguished, as listed in the table below.&lt;ref name="CDS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~pberlind/atlas/htmls/note.html |title=A note on the spectral atlas and spectral classification |publisher=[[Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginal cases are allowed; for example, a star may be either a supergiant or a bright giant, or may be in between the subgiant and main-sequence classifications. 
In these cases, two special symbols are used:
*A slash ('''/''') means that a star is either one class or the other.
*A dash ('''-''') means that the star is in between the two classes.

For example, a star classified as A3-4III/IV would be in between spectral types A3 and A4, while being either a giant star or a subgiant.

Sub-dwarf classes have also been used: VI for sub-dwarfs (stars slightly less luminous than the main sequence).

Nominal luminosity class&amp;nbsp;VII (and sometimes higher numerals) is now rarely used for white dwarf or "hot sub-dwarf" classes, since the temperature-letters of the main sequence and giant stars no longer apply to white dwarfs.

Occasionally, letters ''a'' and ''b'' are applied to luminosity classes other than supergiants; for example, a giant star slightly more luminous than typical may be given a luminosity class of IIIb.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=An Encoding System to Represent Stellar Spectral Classes in Archival Databases and Catalogs |eprint=1112.3617 |last1=Smith |first1=Myron A. |last2=Thompson |first2=Randall W. |last3=Gray |first3=Richard O. |last4=Corbally |first4=Christopher |last5=Kamp |first5=Inga |display-authors=1 |class=astro-ph.SR |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The reason for the odd arrangement of letters in the Harvard classification is historical, having evolved from the earlier Secchi classes and been progressively modified as understanding improved.

===Secchi classes===
During the 1860s and 1870s, pioneering stellar spectroscopist [[Angelo Secchi]] created the ''Secchi classes'' in order to classify observed spectra. By 1866, he had developed three classes of stellar spectra, shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30204/f364.table Analyse spectrale de la lumière de quelques étoiles, et nouvelles observations sur les taches solaires], P.

Secchi, ''Comptes Rendus des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences'' '''63''' (July–December 1866), pp. 621–628.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hearnshaw |first=J.

In the late 1890s, this classification began to be superseded by the Harvard classification, which is discussed in the remainder of this article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~gott/AST1002/Additional_Notes/Add_notes.week5 Classification of Stellar Spectra: Some History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaler |first=James B. |date=1997 |title=Stars and Their Spectra: An Introduction to the Spectral Sequence |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=62–63 |isbn=0-521-58570-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 60–63, Hearnshaw 1986; pp. 623–625, Secchi 1866.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, the astronomer [[Edward C. Pickering]] began to make a survey of stellar spectra at the [[Harvard College Observatory]], using the objective-prism method. A first result of this work was the ''Draper Catalogue of Stellar Spectra'', published in 1890. [[Williamina Fleming]] classified most of the spectra in this catalogue.

The catalogue used a scheme in which the previously used Secchi classes (I to IV) were subdivided into more specific classes, given letters from A to N. Also, the letters O, P, and Q were used &amp;ndash; O for stars whose spectra consisted mainly of bright lines, P for planetary nebulae, and Q for stars not fitting into any other class.&lt;ref name="drapera"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1890AnHar..27....1P |title=The Draper Catalogue of stellar spectra photographed with the 8-inch Bache telescope as a part of the Henry Draper memorial |journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory |volume=27 |pages=1 |author1=Pickering |first1=Edward C. |year=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="draperb"&gt;pp. 106–108, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard system===
In 1897, another worker at Harvard, [[Antonia Maury]], placed the Orion subtype of Secchi class&amp;nbsp;I ahead of the remainder of Secchi class&amp;nbsp;I, thus placing the modern type&amp;nbsp;B ahead of the modern type&amp;nbsp;A. She was the first to do so, although she did not use lettered spectral types, but rather a series of twenty-two types numbered from I to XXII.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 111–112, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1897AnHar..28....1M |title=Spectra of bright stars photographed with the 11&amp;nbsp;inch Draper Telescope as part of the Henry Draper Memorial |journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory |volume=28 |pages=1 |author1=Maury |first1=Antonia C. |last2=Pickering |first2=Edward C. |year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, [[Annie Jump Cannon]] returned to the lettered types, but dropped all letters except O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, used in that order, as well as P for planetary nebulae and Q for some peculiar spectra. She also used types such as B5A for stars halfway between types B and A, F2G for stars one-fifth of the way from F to G, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1901AnHar..28..129C |title=Spectra of bright southern stars photographed with the 13&amp;nbsp;inch Boyden telescope as part of the Henry Draper Memorial |journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory |volume=28 |pages=129 |author1=Cannon |first1=Annie J. |last2=Pickering |first2=Edward C. |year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;117–119, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, by 1912, Cannon had changed the types B, A, B5A, F2G, etc. to B0, A0, B5, F2, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1912AnHar..56..115C |title=Classification of 1,688 southern stars by means of their spectra |journal=Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College |volume=56 |pages=115 |author1=Cannon |first1=Annie Jump |last2=Pickering |first2=Edward Charles |year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp. 121–122, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; This is essentially the modern form of the Harvard classification system.

A common [[mnemonic]] for remembering the order of the spectral type letters, from hottest to coolest, is "Oh, Be A Fine Guy/Girl, Kiss Me".

==Spectral types==
The stellar classification system is [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]], based on [[Type (biology)|type specimens]], similar to classification of species in [[biology]]: The categories are defined by one or more standard stars for each category and sub-category, with an associated description of the distinguishing features.&lt;ref name="Garrison"/&gt;

==="Early" and "late" nomenclature===
Stars are often referred to as ''early'' or ''late'' types. "Early" is a synonym for ''hotter'', while "late" is a synonym for ''cooler''.

Depending on the context, "early" and "late" may be absolute or relative terms. "Early" as an absolute term would therefore refer to O or B, and possibly A stars. As a relative reference it relates to stars hotter than others, such as "early K" being perhaps K0, K1, and K3.

"Late" is used in the same way, with an unqualified use of the term indicating stars with spectral types such as K and M, but it can also be used for stars that are cool relative to other stars, as in using "late G" to refer to G7, G8, and G9.

In the relative sense, "early" means a lower Arabic numeral following the class letter, and "late" means a higher number.

This obscure terminology is a hold-over from an early 20th&amp;nbsp;century model of stellar evolution, which supposed that stars were powered by gravitational contraction via the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]], which is now known to not apply to [[main sequence]] stars. If that were true, then stars would start their lives as very hot "early-type" stars and then gradually cool down into "late-type" stars. This mechanism provided ages of the [[Sun]] that were much smaller than what is observed in the [[geologic record]], and was rendered obsolete by the discovery that stars are powered by [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/L/latetype.html |title=late-type star |first=David |last=Darling |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science |accessdate=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "early" and "late" were carried over, beyond the demise of the model they were based on.

===Class O===
{{Main|O-type star}}
{{See also|O-type main-sequence star|Blue giant|Blue supergiant}}
[[File:Zeta Puppis.png|thumb|Artist's rendering of [[Zeta Puppis]], an O4 supergiant]]

O-type stars are very hot and extremely luminous, with most of their radiated output in the [[ultraviolet]] range. These are the rarest of all main-sequence stars. About 1 in 3,000,000 (0.00003%) of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are O-type stars.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"&gt;These proportions are fractions of stars brighter than absolute magnitude&amp;nbsp;16; lowering this limit will render earlier types even rarer, whereas generally adding only to the M class.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Real Starry Sky |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |last=Ledrew |first=Glenn |volume=95 |page=32 |date=February 2001 |bibcode=2001JRASC..95...32L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[List of most massive stars|most massive stars]] lie within this spectral class. O-type stars frequently have complicated surroundings that make measurement of their spectra difficult.

O-type spectra formerly were defined by the ratio of the strength of the [[Helium|He]]&amp;nbsp;II λ4541 relative to that of He&amp;nbsp;I λ4471, where λ is the [[wavelength]], measured in [[ångström]]s. Spectral type O7 was defined to be the point at which the two intensities are equal, with the He&amp;nbsp;I line weakening towards earlier types. Type&amp;nbsp;O3 was, by definition, the point at which said line disappears altogether, although it can be seen very faintly with modern technology. Due to this, the modern definition uses the ratio of the [[nitrogen]] line N&amp;nbsp;IV λ4058 to N&amp;nbsp;III λλ4634-40-42.&lt;ref name="Walborn"/&gt;

O-type stars have dominant lines of absorption and sometimes emission for [[helium|He]]&amp;nbsp;II lines, prominent ionized ([[silicon|Si]]&amp;nbsp;IV, [[oxygen|O]]&amp;nbsp;III, [[nitrogen|N]]&amp;nbsp;III, and [[carbon|C]]&amp;nbsp;III) and neutral [[helium]] lines, strengthening from O5 to O9, and prominent hydrogen [[Balmer lines]], although not as strong as in later types. Because they are so massive, O-type stars have very hot cores and burn through their hydrogen fuel very quickly, so they are the first stars to leave the [[main sequence]].

When the MKK classification scheme was first described in 1943, the only subtypes of class&amp;nbsp;O used were O5 to O9.5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/ASS_Atlas/frames.html ''An atlas of stellar spectra, with an outline of spectral classification''], W. W. Morgan, P. C. Keenan and E.

===Class B===
{{See also|B-type main-sequence star|Blue giant|Blue supergiant}}
[[File:Eta CMa.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of [[Eta Canis Majoris|Aludra]], a B5 [[supergiant]] seen in [[Canis Major]].]]

B-type stars are very luminous and blue. Their spectra have neutral helium lines, which are most prominent at the B2 subclass, and moderate hydrogen lines. As [[OB star|O- and B-type stars]] are so energetic, they only live for a relatively short time. Thus, due to the low probability of kinematic interaction during their lifetime, they are unable to stray far from the area in which they formed, apart from [[runaway star]]s.

The transition from class&amp;nbsp;O to class&amp;nbsp;B was originally defined to be the point at which the [[Helium|He]]&amp;nbsp;II λ4541 disappears. However, with modern equipment, the line is still apparent in the early B-type stars. Today for main-sequence stars, the B-class is instead defined by the intensity of the He&amp;nbsp;I violet spectrum, with the maximum intensity corresponding to class&amp;nbsp;B2. For supergiants, lines of [[silicon]] are used instead; the Si&amp;nbsp;IV λ4089 and Si&amp;nbsp;III λ4552 lines are indicative of early B. At mid B, the intensity of the latter relative to that of Si&amp;nbsp;II λλ4128-30 is the defining characteristic, while for late B, it is the intensity of Mg&amp;nbsp;II λ4481 relative to that of He&amp;nbsp;I λ4471.&lt;ref name="Walborn"/&gt;

These stars tend to be found in their originating [[OB association]]s, which are associated with giant [[molecular cloud]]s. The Orion OB1 association occupies a large portion of a [[spiral arm]] of the [[Milky Way]] and contains many of the brighter stars of the [[Orion constellation|constellation Orion]]. About 1 in 800 (0.125%) of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are [[B-type main-sequence star]]s.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"/&gt;

Massive yet non-[[supergiant]] entities known as "Be&amp;nbsp;stars" are main-sequence stars that notably have, or had at some time, one or more [[Balmer lines]] in emission, with the [[hydrogen]]-related [[electromagnetic radiation]] [[Hydrogen spectral series|series]] projected out by the stars being of particular interest. Be stars are generally thought to feature unusually strong [[stellar wind]]s, high surface temperatures, and significant attrition of [[stellar mass]] as the objects [[Stellar rotation|rotate]] at a curiously rapid rate.&lt;ref name="Slettebak1988"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Be Stars |journal=[[Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] |first=Arne |last=Slettebak |volume=100 |pages=770–784 |date=July 1988 |doi=10.1086/132234 |bibcode=1988PASP..100..770S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects known as [[B(e) star|"B(e)" or "B[e]" stars]] possess distinctive neutral or low ionisation [[emission lines]] that are considered to have '[[forbidden mechanism]]s', undergoing processes not normally allowed under current understandings of [[quantum mechanics]].

A-type stars are among the more common naked eye stars, and are white or bluish-white.

The presence of [[calcium|Ca]]&amp;nbsp;II lines is notably strengthening by this point.

G-type stars, including the [[Sun]]&lt;ref name="SunSpectrum"/&gt; have prominent spectral lines ''H'' and ''K'' of [[calcium|Ca]]&amp;nbsp;II, which are most pronounced at G2. They have even weaker hydrogen lines than F, but along with the ionized metals, they have neutral metals. There is a prominent spike in the G band of [[cyanide|CH]] molecules.

K-type stars are orangish stars that are slightly cooler than the Sun. They make up about 12% of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"/&gt; There are also giant K-type stars, which range from [[hypergiant]]s like [[RW Cephei]], to [[Giant star|giants]] and [[supergiant]]s, such as [[Arcturus]], whereas [[K-type main-sequence star|orange dwarfs]], like [[Alpha Centauri]]&amp;nbsp;B, are main-sequence stars.

They have extremely weak hydrogen lines, if they are present at all, and mostly neutral metals ([[manganese|Mn]]&amp;nbsp;I, [[iron|Fe]]&amp;nbsp;I, [[silicon|Si]]&amp;nbsp;I). By late K, molecular bands of [[titanium monoxide|titanium oxide]] become present.

[[File:UY Scuti zoomed in, Rutherford Observatory, 07 September 2014.jpeg|thumb|[[UY Scuti]], an M4 supergiant]]

Class&amp;nbsp;M stars are by far the most common. About 76% of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are class&amp;nbsp;M stars.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This rises to 78.6% if we include all stars. (See the above note.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"/&gt; However, class&amp;nbsp;M main-sequence stars ([[red dwarf]]s) have such low luminosities that none are bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye, unless under exceptional conditions. The brightest known M-class main-sequence star is M0V [[Lacaille 8760]], with [[stellar magnitude|magnitude]] 6.6 (the limiting magnitude for typical naked-eye visibility under good conditions is typically quoted as 6.5), and it is extremely unlikely that any brighter examples will be found.

Although most class&amp;nbsp;M stars are red dwarfs, most of the largest ever supergiant stars in the Milky Way are M stars. such as [[VY Canis Majoris]], [[Antares]] and [[Betelgeuse]] are also class&amp;nbsp;M. Furthermore, the larger, hotter [[brown dwarf]]s are late class&amp;nbsp;M, usually in the range of M6.5 to M9.5.

The spectrum of a class&amp;nbsp;M star contains lines from [[oxide]] [[molecule]]s (in the [[visible spectrum]], especially [[titanium monoxide|TiO]]) and all neutral metals, but absorption lines of hydrogen are usually absent. TiO bands can be strong in class&amp;nbsp;M stars, usually dominating their visible spectrum by about M5. [[Vanadium(II) oxide]] bands become present by late M.

A number of new spectral types have been taken into use from newly discovered types of stars.&lt;ref name=nasa1010 /&gt;

===Hot blue emission star classes===

Spectra of some very hot and bluish stars exhibit marked emission lines from carbon or nitrogen, or sometimes oxygen.

====Class W: Wolf–Rayet====
{{Main|Wolf–Rayet star}}
[[File:M1-67 &amp; WR124.png|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]] image of the nebula M1-67 and the Wolf–Rayet star [[WR 124]] in the center]]

Class&amp;nbsp;W or WR represents the [[Wolf–Rayet star]]s, notable for spectra lacking hydrogen lines. Instead their spectra are dominated by broad emission lines of highly ionized helium, nitrogen, carbon and sometimes oxygen. They are thought to mostly be dying supergiants with their hydrogen layers blown away by [[stellar wind]]s, thereby directly exposing their hot helium shells. Class&amp;nbsp;W is further divided into subclasses according to the relative strength of nitrogen and carbon emission lines in their spectra (and outer layers).&lt;ref name=WR&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2007ARA&amp;A..45..177C |title=Physical Properties of Wolf-Rayet Stars |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume=45 |pages=177–219 |author1=Crowther |first1=Paul A. |year=2007 |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.45.051806.110615 |arxiv=astro-ph/0610356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these show [WC] spectra, some [WO], and very rarely [WN].

====The "Slash" stars====
{{Main|Slash star}}
The ''slash'' stars are O-type stars with WN-like lines in their spectra. The name "slash" comes from their printed spectral type having a slash in it (e.g. "Of/WNL"&lt;ref name="Walborn"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2008RMxAC..33....5W |title=Multiwavelength Systematics of OB Spectra |journal=Massive Stars: Fundamental Parameters and Circumstellar Interactions (Eds. P. Benaglia |volume=33 |pages=5 |author1=Walborn |first1=N. R. |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There is a secondary group found with this spectra, a cooler, "intermediate" group designated "Ofpe/WN9".&lt;ref name="Walborn"/&gt; These stars have also been referred to as WN10 or WN11, but that has become less popular with the realisation of the evolutionary difference from other Wolf–Rayet stars. Recent discoveries of even rarer stars have extended the range of slash stars as far as O2-3.5If&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/WN5-7, which are even hotter than the original "slash" stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Crowther |first1=P.

===Cool red and brown dwarf classes===
{{main|Brown dwarf|Red dwarf}}
The new spectral types L, T, and Y were created to classify infrared spectra of cool stars. This includes both [[red dwarf]]s and [[brown dwarf]]s that are very faint in the [[visible spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2008ASPC..384...85K |arxiv=0704.1522 |title=Outstanding Issues in Our Understanding of L, T, and Y Dwarfs |journal=14th Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars |volume=384 |pages=85 |author1=Kirkpatrick |first1=J. D. |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brown dwarf]]s, whose energy comes from [[gravitational]] attraction alone, cool as they age and so progress to later spectral types. Brown dwarfs start their lives with M-type spectra and will cool through the L, T, and Y spectral classes, faster the less massive they are; the highest-mass brown dwarfs cannot have cooled to Y or even T dwarfs within the age of the universe. Because this leads to an unresolvable overlap between spectral types{{'}} [[effective temperature]] and [[luminosity]] for some masses and ages of different L-T-Y types, no distinct [[effective temperature|temperature]] or [[luminosity]] values can be given.&lt;ref name=bdevol&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolutionary models for cool brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets.

====Class L====
[[File:L-dwarf-nasa-hurt.png|thumb|Artist's impression of an L-dwarf]]

Class L dwarfs get their designation because they are cooler than M stars and L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support [[hydrogen fusion]] and are therefore stars, but most are of [[substellar object|substellar]] mass and are therefore brown dwarfs. They are a very dark red in color and brightest in [[infrared]]. Their [[atmosphere]] is cool enough to allow [[metal hydride]]s and [[alkali metal]]s to be prominent in their spectra.&lt;ref name="kirk_ARAA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.

Due to low surface gravity in giant stars, [[Titanium monoxide|TiO]]- and [[Vanadium monoxide|VO]]-bearing condensates never form. Thus, L-type stars larger than dwarfs can never form in an isolated environment. However, it may be possible for these L-type supergiants to form through stellar collisions, an example of which is [[V838 Monocerotis]] while in the height of its [[luminous red nova]] eruption.

====Class T: methane dwarfs{{anchor|Class T}}====
[[File:T-dwarf-nasa-hurt.png|thumb|Artist's impression of a T-dwarf]]

Class&amp;nbsp;T dwarfs are cool [[brown dwarf]]s with surface temperatures between approximately {{convert|550|and|1300|K|C F}}. Their emission peaks in the [[infrared]]. [[Methane]] is prominent in their spectra.&lt;ref name="kirk_ARAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kirk_ApJ"/&gt;

Classes&amp;nbsp;T and L could be more common than all the other classes combined if recent research is accurate. Because brown dwarfs persist for so long—a few times the age of the universe—in the absence of catastrophic collisions these smaller bodies can only increase in number.

Study of the number of [[protoplanetary disk|proplyds]] (protoplanetary disks, clumps of gas in [[nebula]]e from which stars and planetary systems are formed) indicates that the number of stars in the [[galaxy]] should be several [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] higher than what was previously conjectured. It is theorized that these proplyds are in a race with each other. The first one to form will become a [[protostar]], which are very violent objects and will disrupt other proplyds in the vicinity, stripping them of their gas. The victim proplyds will then probably go on to become main-sequence stars or brown dwarfs of the L and T classes, which are quite invisible to us.

====Class Y====

[[File:WISE 1828+2650 Brown dwarf.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a Y-dwarf]]

Brown dwarfs of spectral class&amp;nbsp;Y are cooler than those of spectral class&amp;nbsp;T and have qualitatively different spectra from them.

The latest brown dwarf proposed for the Y spectral type, [[WISE 1828+2650]], is a &gt;&amp;nbsp;Y2&amp;nbsp;dwarf with an effective temperature originally estimated around 300&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]], the temperature of the human body.&lt;ref name="stars-cooler-than-body"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cool-y-dwarf"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eso1110&gt;[[European Southern Observatory]].

The mass range for Y&amp;nbsp;dwarfs is 9–25&amp;nbsp;[[Jupiter]] masses, but young objects might reach below one Jupiter mass, which means that Y class objects straddle the 13&amp;nbsp;Jupiter mass [[deuterium]]-fusion limit that marks the current [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] division between brown dwarfs and planets.&lt;ref name=ydwarfsurvey /&gt;

===Late giant carbon-star classes===
Carbon-stars are stars whose spectra indicate production of carbon—a byproduct of [[Triple-alpha process|triple-alpha]] helium fusion. With increased carbon abundance, and some parallel [[s-process]] heavy element production, the spectra of these stars become increasingly deviant from the usual late spectral classes&amp;nbsp;G, K, and M. Equivalent classes for carbon-rich stars are S and C.

The giants among those stars are presumed to produce this carbon themselves, but some stars in this class are double stars, whose odd atmosphere is suspected of having been transferred from a companion that is now a white dwarf, when the companion was a carbon-star.

====Class C: carbon stars====
{{Main|Carbon star}}
[[File:Curious spiral spotted by ALMA around red giant star R Sculptoris (data visualisation).jpg|thumb|Image of the carbon star [[R Sculptoris]] and its striking spiral structure]]

Originally classified as R and N stars, these are also known as ''carbon stars''. These are red giants, near the end of their lives, in which there is an excess of carbon in the atmosphere. The old R and N classes ran parallel to the normal classification system from roughly mid G to late M. These have more recently been remapped into a unified carbon classifier C with N0 starting at roughly C6. Another subset of cool carbon stars are the C-J&amp;nbsp;type stars, which are characterized by the strong presence of molecules of [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]][[cyanide|CN]] in addition to those of [[Carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;]][[cyanide|CN]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouigue, R. (1954). Annales d'Astrophysique, Vol.&amp;nbsp;17, p.&amp;nbsp;104&lt;/ref&gt; A few main-sequence carbon stars are known, but the overwhelming majority of known carbon stars are giants or supergiants. There are several subclasses:
* C-R &amp;ndash; Formerly its own class (''R'') representing the carbon star equivalent of late G to early K-type stars.
* C-N &amp;ndash; Formerly its own class representing the carbon star equivalent of late K to M-type stars.
* C-J &amp;ndash; A subtype of cool C stars with a high content of [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]].
* C-H &amp;ndash; [[Population II]] analogues of the C-R stars.
* C-Hd &amp;ndash; Hydrogen-deficient carbon stars, similar to late G supergiants with [[Methylidyne radical|CH]] and [[diatomic carbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] bands added.

====Class S====
{{Main|S-type star}}
Class&amp;nbsp;S stars form a continuum between class&amp;nbsp;M stars and carbon stars. Those most similar to class&amp;nbsp;M stars have strong [[Zirconium monoxide|ZrO]] [[spectral bands|absorption bands]] analogous to the [[Titanium monoxide|TiO]] bands of class&amp;nbsp;M stars, whereas those most similar to carbon stars have strong [[Sodium|sodium D line]]s and weak [[Diatomic carbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, P. C. (1954). ''Astrophysical Journal'', vol.&amp;nbsp;120, p.&amp;nbsp;484&lt;/ref&gt; Class&amp;nbsp;S stars have excess amounts of [[zirconium]] and other elements produced by the [[s-process]], and have more similar carbon and oxygen abundances than class&amp;nbsp;M or carbon stars. Like carbon stars, nearly all known class&amp;nbsp;S stars are [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic-giant-branch]] stars.

The spectral type is formed by the letter&amp;nbsp;S and a number between zero and ten. This number corresponds to the temperature of the star and approximately follows the temperature scale used for class&amp;nbsp;M giants. The most common types are S3 to S5. The non-standard designation S10 has only been used for the star [[Chi Cygni]] when at an extreme minimum.

The basic classification is usually followed by an abundance indication, following one of several schemes: S2,5; S2/5; S2 Zr4 Ti2; or S2*5. A number following a comma is a scale between 1 and 9 based on the ratio of [[Zirconium monoxide|ZrO]] and [[Titanium monoxide|TiO]]. A number following a slash is a more recent but less common scheme designed to represent the ratio of carbon to oxygen on a scale of 1 to 10, where a 0 would be an MS star. Intensities of [[zirconium]] and [[titanium]] may be indicated explicitly. Also occasionally seen is a number following an asterisk, which represents the strength of the [[Zirconium monoxide|ZrO]] bands on a scale from 1 to 5.

====Classes MS and SC: intermediary carbon-related classes====
In between the M and S classes, border cases are named MS stars. In a similar way, border cases between the S and C-N classes are named SC or CS. The sequence M → MS → S → SC → C-N is hypothesized to be a sequence of increased carbon abundance with age for [[carbon star]]s in the [[asymptotic giant branch]].

The class&amp;nbsp;D (for [[Electron-degenerate matter|Degenerate]]) is the modern classification used for white dwarfs – low-mass stars that are no longer undergoing [[nuclear fusion]] and have shrunk to planetary size, slowly cooling down. Class&amp;nbsp;D is further divided into spectral types DA, DB, DC, DO, DQ, DX, and DZ. The letters are not related to the letters used in the classification of other stars, but instead indicate the composition of the white dwarf's visible outer layer or atmosphere.

The white dwarf types are as follows:&lt;ref name="sionspectra"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1983ApJ...269..253S |title=A proposed new white dwarf spectral classification system |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=269 |pages=253 |author1=Sion |first1=E.

* DA &amp;ndash; a [[hydrogen]]-rich atmosphere or outer layer, indicated by strong Balmer hydrogen [[spectral line]]s.
* DB &amp;ndash; a [[helium]]-rich atmosphere, indicated by neutral helium, [[spectroscopic notation|He&amp;nbsp;I]], spectral lines.
* DO &amp;ndash; a helium-rich atmosphere, indicated by ionized helium, [[spectroscopic notation|He&amp;nbsp;II]], spectral lines.
* DQ &amp;ndash; a [[carbon]]-rich atmosphere, indicated by atomic or molecular carbon lines.
* DZ &amp;ndash; a [[metal (astronomy)|metal]]-rich atmosphere, indicated by metal spectral lines (a merger of the obsolete white dwarf spectral types, DG, DK and DM).
* DC &amp;ndash; no strong spectral lines indicating one of the above categories.
* DX &amp;ndash; spectral lines are insufficiently clear to classify into one of the above categories.

The type is followed by a number giving the white dwarf's surface temperature. This number is a rounded form of 50400/''T''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]], measured in [[kelvin]]s. Originally, this number was rounded to one of the digits 1 through 9, but more recently fractional values have started to be used, as well as values below 1 and above 9.&lt;ref name="sionspectra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="villanovar4"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1999ApJS..121....1M |title=A Catalog of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarfs |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=121 |pages=1–130 |author1=McCook |first1=George P. |last2=Sion |first2=Edward M. |year=1999 |doi=10.1086/313186 |citeseerx=10.1.1.565.5507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two or more of the type letters may be used to indicate a white dwarf that displays more than one of the spectral features above.&lt;ref name="sionspectra"/&gt;

'''Extended white dwarf spectral types:'''&lt;ref name="sionspectra"/&gt;
* DAB &amp;ndash; a hydrogen- and helium-rich white dwarf displaying neutral helium lines.
* DAO &amp;ndash; a hydrogen- and helium-rich white dwarf displaying ionized helium lines.

A different set of spectral peculiarity symbols are used for white dwarfs than for other types of stars:

==Stellar remnants==
{{Main|Neutron star|Black hole|Exotic star}}
Stellar remnants are objects associated with the death of stars. Included in the category are white dwarfs, and as can be seen from the radically different classification scheme for class&amp;nbsp;D, non-stellar objects are difficult to fit into the MK system.

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which the MK system is based on, is observational in nature so these remnants cannot easily be plotted on the diagram, or cannot be placed at all. Old [[neutron star]]s are relatively small and cold, and would fall on the far right side of the diagram. [[Planetary nebula]]e are dynamic and tend to quickly fade in brightness as the progenitor star transitions to the [[white dwarf]] branch. If shown, a planetary nebula would be plotted to the right of the diagram's upper right quadrant. A [[black hole]] emits no visible light of its own, and therefore would not appear on the diagram.&lt;ref name="chan-var-hr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/formal/variable_stars/bg_info.html |title=Pulsating Variable Stars and the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) Diagram |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |date=9 March 2015 |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replaced spectral classes==
Several spectral types, all previously used for non-standard stars in the mid-20th century, have been replaced during revisions of the stellar classification system. They may still be found in old editions of star catalogs: R and N have been subsumed into the new C class as C-R and C-N.

{{distinguish|Empathy}}
'''Sympathy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''syn'' "together" and ''pathos'' "feeling" which means "fellow-feeling") is the perception, understanding, and reaction to the distress or need of another [[life form]].&lt;ref name="Decety 2010 886–899"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tear|first=J|author2=Michalska, KJ |title=Neurodevelopmental changes in the circuits underlying empathy and sympathy from childhood to adulthood|journal=Developmental Science|year=2010|volume=13|issue=6|pages=886–899|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00940.x|pmid=20977559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This empathic concern is driven by a switch in viewpoint, from a personal perspective to the perspective of another group or individual who is in need.

==Etymology==
The words ''[[empathy]]'' and ''sympathy'' are often used interchangeably. Sympathy is a [[feeling]], but the two terms have distinct origins and meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lishner|first=D. A.|author2=Batson, C. D. |author3=Huss, E. |title=Tenderness and Sympathy: Distinct Empathic Emotions Elicited by Different Forms of Need|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2011|volume=37|issue=5|pages=614–625|doi=10.1177/0146167211403157}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Merriam-Webster]] defines ''empathy'' as "the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empathy|website=Merriam-Webster|title=Definition of empathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merriam-Webster defines that sympathy is when you share the feelings of another; empathy is when you understand the feelings of another but do not necessarily share them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the difference between sympathy and empathy?|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/sympathy-empathy-difference|website=Merriam Webster|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sympathy|website=Merriam-Webster|title=Definition of sympathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''sympathy'' was defined by 18th century philosophers such as Adam Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bloom|first1=Paul|title=Against Empathy|url=http://www.bostonreview.net/forum/paul-bloom-against-empathy|publisher=Boston Review|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Grammarist.com defines ''sympathy'' as "the feeling that you care about and are sorry about someone else's trouble, grief, misfortune, etc."; "a feeling of support for something"; or "a state in which different people share the same interests, opinions, goals, etc.", but not necessarily the feeling that you share another person's emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Empathy vs. sympathy|url=http://grammarist.com/usage/empathy-sympathy/|publisher=Grammarist|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:US Navy 100119-N-7948C-048 A Haitian woman screams in pain as U.S. military medical personnel try to set her broken leg at a clinic at the Killick Haitian Coast Guard Base.jpg|thumb|alt=|Medical personnel aid a suffering woman after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].]]

In order to get an experience of sympathy there are specific conditions that need to occur. These include: attention to a subject, believing that a person/group is in a state of need, and the specific characteristics of a given situation. An individual must first give his or her attention to a person/group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dickert|first=S|author2=Slovic, P |title=Attentional mechanisms in the generation of sympathy|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2009|volume=4|issue=4|pages=297–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distractions severely limit the ability to produce strong affective responses. Without distractions, people are able to attend to and respond to a variety of emotional subjects and experiences. Attention facilitates the experience of sympathy, and without giving undivided attention to many situations sympathy cannot be experienced.

The need of an individual/group is also considered to elicit sympathy. Varying states of need (such as perceived vulnerability or pain) require unique human reactions, ranging from attention to sympathy. A person with cancer might draw a stronger feeling of sympathy than a person with a cold. The conditions which sympathy is deemed as an appropriate response are organized into individual differences and situational differences.

The ways in which people think about human deservingness, interdependence, and vulnerability motivate sympathy. A person who seems 'deserving' of aid is more likely to be helped.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein 2007 112–126"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=G.|author2=Small, D. A. |title=The scarecrow and the tin man: The vicissitudes of human sympathy and caring|journal=Review of General Psychology|year=2007|volume=11|issue=2|pages=112–126|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.2.112}}&lt;/ref&gt; A belief in human interdependence fuels sympathetic behavior.

Sympathy is also believed to be based on the principle of the powerful helping the vulnerable (young, elderly, sick).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djiker|first=A. J. M.|title=Perceived vulnerability as a common basis of moral emotions|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=49|pages=415–423|doi=10.1348/014466609x482668}}&lt;/ref&gt; This desire to help the vulnerable has been suggested to stem from the paternalistic nature of humans, in which they seek to protect and aid the children and the weak in their survival. People help others based on maternal/paternal instincts to care for their own children or family when they are in need.

Individual moods, previous experiences, social connections, novelty, salience, and spatial proximity can also influence the experience of sympathy.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein 2007 112–126"/&gt; Individuals experiencing positive mood states and people who have similar life experiences are more likely to produce sympathy.

Spatial proximity, or when a person or group exists close geographically (such as neighbors and citizens of a given country), they will more likely experience sympathy towards each other. Similarly, ''social'' proximity follows the same pattern. Members of certain groups (ex. racial groups) favor people who are also members of groups similar to their own.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein 2007 112–126"/&gt; Social proximity is intimately linked  with in-group and out-group status. In-group status, or a person falling within a certain social group, is also integral to the experience of sympathy. Both of these processes are based on the notion that people within the same group are interconnected and share successes and failures and therefore experience more sympathy towards each other than to out-group members, or social outsiders.

New and emotionally provoking situations also represent an explanation for empathic emotions, such as sympathy. People seem to habituate to events that are similar in content and type and strength of emotion. The first horrific event that is witnessed will elicit a greater sympathetic response compared to the subsequent experiences of the same horrific event.

==Evolutionary origins==
The evolution of sympathy is tied directly into the development of [[social intelligence]]. Social intelligence references a broad range of behaviors, and their associated cognitive skills, such as pair bonding, the creation of social hierarchies, and alliance formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dautenhahn|first=Kerstin|title=I Could Be You: The Phenomenological Dimension Of Social Understanding|journal=Cybernetics and Systems|date=1 July 1997|volume=28|issue=5|pages=417–453|doi=10.1080/019697297126074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers theorize that empathic emotions, or those relating to the emotions of others, arose due to reciprocal altruism, mother-child bonding, and the need to accurately estimate the future actions of conspecifics. In other words, empathic emotions were driven by the desire to create relationships that were mutually beneficial and to better understand the emotions of others that could avert danger or stimulate positive outcomes. By working together, there were better results for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Vignemont|first=Frederique|author2=Singer, Tania |title=The empathic brain: how, when and why?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1 October 2006|volume=10|issue=10|pages=435–441|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social order is improved when people are able to provide aid to others when it is a detriment to oneself for the good of the greater society. For example, giving back to the community often leads to personal benefits.
 
The conditions necessary to develop empathic concerns, and later sympathy, begin with the creation of a small group of socially dependent individuals. Second, the individuals in this community must have a relatively long lifespan in order to encounter several opportunities to react with sympathy. Parental care relationships, alliances during conflicts, and the creation of social hierarchies are also associated with the onset of sympathy in human interactions. Sympathetic behavior originally came about during dangerous situations, such as predator sightings, and moments when aid was needed for the sick and/or wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of sympathy as a social catalyst can be seen in both primate species and in human development.

==Communication==
Verbal communication is the clearest medium by which individuals are able to communicate feelings of sympathy. People can express sympathy by addressing the emotions being felt by themselves and others involved and by acknowledging the current environmental conditions for why sympathy would be the appropriate reaction.

Nonverbal communication presents a fascinating study of speech intonation, facial expression, bodily motions and person-to-person physical contacts. Some other forms of nonverbal communication include how far people position themselves in relation to each other, posture and appearance. These forms of expression can convey messages related to emotion as well as opinions, physical states (fatigue), and understanding. Emotional expression is especially linked to the production of emotion-specific facial expressions. These expressions are often the same from culture to culture and are often reproduced by observers, which facilitates the observers' own understanding of the emotion and/or situation.  There are six universal emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust and anger.

[[File:Portret van een man005.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Facial expressions can communicate sympathy and other emotions nonverbally.]]

Nonverbal communication cues are often subconscious and difficult to control. Deliberate regulation of emotion and nonverbal expression is often imperfect. Nonverbal gestures and facial expressions are also generally better understood by people observing the gestures, expressions, etc., and not by the person experiencing them first hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DePaulo|first=B. M.|title=Nonverbal behavior and self-presentation|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1992|volume=111|issue=2|pages=203–243|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communicating using physical touch has the unique ability of conveying affective information upon contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=R.|author2=Quek, F. |title=Touch &amp; talk: Contextualizing remote touch for affective interaction|journal=Proceedings of the fourth international conference on Tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction|year=2010|pages=13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, this sensation must be paired with the understanding of the specific context of a given situation. The touch of the hand on the shoulder during a funeral might be the fastest method of conveying sympathy. Patting a person on their back, arms, or head for a few seconds can effectively convey feelings of sympathy between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hertenstein|first=Matthew J. |author2=Holmes, Rachel |author3=McCullough, Margaret |author4=Keltner, Dacher|title=The communication of emotion via touch.|journal=Emotion|year=2009|volume=9|issue=4|pages=566–573|doi=10.1037/a0016108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonverbal communication seems to provide a more genuine communication of sympathy, because it is difficult to control nonverbal behavior and expressions. The combination of verbal and nonverbal communication facilitates the acknowledgment and comprehension of sympathy.

==Human behavior==
Although sympathy is a well-known term, the implications of sympathy found in the study of human behavior are often less clear. Decision-making, an integral part of human behavior, involves the weighing of costs with potential outcomes. Research on decision-making has been divided into two mechanisms, often labeled "System 1" and "System 2." These two systems, representing the gut and the head respectively, influence decisions based on context and the individual characteristics of the people involved. Sympathy is an agent working in System 1, a system that uses affective cues to dictate decisions whereas System 2 is based in logic and reason. For example, deciding on where to live based on how the new home feels would be a System 1 decision, whereas deciding on a home based on the property value and personal savings would be a System 2 decision. Sympathy acts in a way that provides a means of understanding another person's experience or situation, good or bad, with a focus on their individual well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Arthur J.|title=Empathy and Sympathy: Therapeutic Distinctions in Counseling|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=95–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often easier to make decisions based on emotional information, because all humans have general understanding of emotions. It is this understanding of emotions that allows people to use sympathy to make their decisions.

Sympathy also helps to motivate philanthropic, or aid-giving, behavior (i.e. donations, community service). The choice to donate, and the subsequent decision of how much to give, can be separated into two, different emotion-driven decision making processes. Mood management, or how people act to maintain their moods, influences the initial decision to donate because of selfish concerns (to avoid regret or feel better). However, how a person feels about the deservingness of the recipient determined ''how much'' to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dickert|first=Stephan |author2=Sagara, Namika |author3=Slovic, Paul|title=Affective motivations to help others: A two-stage model of donation decisions|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=1 October 2011|volume=24|issue=4|pages=361–376|doi=10.1002/bdm.697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human sympathy in donation behavior can influence the amount of aid given to people and regions that are in need. Increasing how emotional a description is, presenting individual cases instead of large groups, and using less information and numerical information can positively influence giving behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A. |author2=Loewenstein, George |author3=Slovic, Paul|title=Sympathy and callousness: The impact of deliberative thought on donations to identifiable and statistical victims|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=2007|volume=102|issue=2|pages=143–153|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its influence on decision-making, sympathy also plays a role in maintaining social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irwin|first=K.|author2=Mcgrimmon, T. |author3=Simpson, B. |title=Sympathy and Social Order|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=1 December 2008|volume=71|issue=4|pages=379–397|doi=10.1177/019027250807100406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging people's character helps to maintain social order, making sure that those who are in need receive the appropriate care. The notion of interdependence fuels sympathetic behavior; this action is seen as self-satisfying because helping someone who is connected to you through some way (family, social capital) will often result in a personal reward (social, monetary, etc.). Regardless of selflessness or selfishness, sympathy facilitates the cycle of give and take that is necessary for maintaining a functional society.

==Healthcare==
Sympathy can also impact the way doctors, nurses, and other members of society think about and treat people with different diseases and conditions. Sympathetic tendencies within the health field fall disproportionately based on patient characteristics and disease type.&lt;ref name="Etchegary 65–84"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etchegary|first=Holly|title=Stigma and Genetic Risk: Perceptions of Stigma among Those at Risk for Huntington Disease (HD)∗|journal=Qualitative Research in Psychology|date=7 August 2007|volume=4|issue=1-2|pages=65–84|doi=10.1080/14780880701473417}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One factor that is frequently considered when determining sympathy is controllability, or the degree to which an individual could have avoided contracting the disease or medical condition. People devote less sympathy to individuals who had control during the event when they acquired HIV.&lt;ref name="Norman 1032–1039"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norman|first=L. R.|author2=Carr, R. |author3=Uche, C. |title=The role of sympathy on avoidance intention toward persons living with HIV/AIDS in Jamaica|journal=AIDS Care|date=1 November 2006|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1032–1039|doi=10.1080/09540120600578409}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even less sympathy is granted to individuals who have control over the means by which they contracted HIV, such as individuals who engage in prostitution.

Sympathy in health-related decision making is heavily based on disease stigma. Disease stigma can lead to discrimination in the work place and in insurance coverage.&lt;ref name="Etchegary 65–84"/&gt; High levels of stigma are also associated with social hostility. Several factors contribute to the development of negative disease stigmas, including the disease's time course, severity, and the dangers that the disease might pose to others. Sexual orientation of individual patients has also been shown to affect stigma levels in the case of HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skelton|first=J. A.|title=How Negative Are Attitudes Toward Persons With SAKIDESL–TLOENUKEMIA PARADIGM AIDS? Examining the AIDS–Leukemia Paradigm|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=28|issue=3|pages=251–261|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp2803_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sympathy is generally associated with low levels of disease stigmatization.

Sympathy is related to increased levels of knowledge regarding HIV and a lower likelihood of avoiding individuals with HIV.&lt;ref name="Norman 1032–1039"/&gt;

==Neuroscience perspectives==
[[File:User-FastFission-brain.gif|thumb|right|alt=A succession of brain scan images|Sympathy is being studied with new technology.]]

Social and emotional stimuli, particularly those related to the well-being of another person, are being more directly studied with advent of technology that can track brain activity (such as [[Electroencephalogram]]s and [[functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]]). [[Amygdala]] and insula activation occur when a person experiences emotions, such as fear and disgust respectively.&lt;ref name='Decety'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Decety|first=Jean|author2=Michalska, Kalina J. |title=Neurodevelopmental changes in the circuits underlying empathy and sympathy from childhood to adulthood|journal=Developmental Science|date=1 November 2010|volume=13|issue=6|pages=886–899|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00940.x|pmid=20977559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary motor regions are also activated during sympathy. This could be caused by humans' reaction to emotional faces, reflecting the expressions on their own faces, which seems to help people better understand the other person's emotion. In addition, researchers have also suggested that the neural mechanisms that are activated when personally experiencing emotions are also activated when viewing another person experiencing the same emotions ([[mirror neurons]]).&lt;ref name="Singer 81–96"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Tania|author2=Lamm, Claus |title=The Social Neuroscience of Empathy|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=1 March 2009|volume=1156|issue=1|pages=81–96|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04418.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain seems to specifically activate a region known as the cingulate cortex,{{mcn|date=August 2016}} in addition to activation that is mentioned earlier.  The temporal parietal junction, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum are also thought to play a role in the production of emotion.{{mcn|date=August 2016}}

Generally, empathic emotions (including sympathy), require the activation of top-down and bottom-up activity. Top-down activity refers to cognitive processes that originate from the frontal lobe and require conscious thought whereas bottom-up activity begins from sensation of stimuli in the environment. From the sensory level, people must sense and experience the emotional cues of another. At the same time, indicative of the dual-process theory, top-down responses must be enacted to make sense of the emotional inputs streaming in and apply motive and environmental influence analyses to better understand the situation. Top-down processes often include attention to emotion and emotion regulation.&lt;ref name="Singer 81–96"/&gt;

==Child development==
[[File:Baby yelling.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|A baby will often cry at the sound of another baby's cries.]]

Sympathy is a stepping stone in both social and moral development. It generally arises between 2–3 years old, although some instances of empathic emotion can be seen as early as 18 months. Basic sharing of emotions, a precursor for sympathy, can be seen in infants. For example, babies will often begin to cry when they hear another baby crying nearby.&lt;ref name="Decety 2010 886–899"/&gt; This emphasizes the infant's ability to recognize emotional cues in his or her environment, even if not able to fully comprehend the emotion. Another milestone in child rearing is the development of the ability to mimic facial expressions. Both of these processes act on sensory and perceptual pathways, yet executive functioning for empathic emotions does not begin during these early stages. Decety and Michalska (2010) believe that early affective development and later development of executive functions create a disparity between how children and young adults experience another person's pain. Young children tend to be negatively aroused more often in comparison to the older subjects.&lt;ref name='Decety'/&gt;

Sympathy can lead to, and be the cause of [[prosocial]] and [[altruistic]] behaviour. Altruistic behaviour is when people who experience emotional reactions consistent with the state of another person and feel "other-oriented" (inclined to help other people in need or distressed.)
People are more inclined to help those in need when they cannot easily escape the situation. If leaving is easy, an individual is likely to reduce one's own distress (of sympathy; feeling bad) by avoiding contact with the other(s) in need. Sympathy is still experienced when it is easy to escape the situation, showing that humans are "other oriented" and altruistic.&lt;ref name="Nancy Eisenberg 1989"&gt;Nancy Eisenberg, R. A. (1989). Relation of Sympathy and Personal Distress to Prosocial Behavior: A Multimethod Study. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to acknowledge that the use or acceptance of sympathy can be both altruistic and self-satisfying in social situations. Parenting styles (specifically level of affection) can influence the development of sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wispé|first=Lauren|title=The distinction between sympathy and empathy: To call forth a concept, a word is needed.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1986|volume=50|issue=2|pages=314–321|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.2.314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosocial and moral development extends into adolescence and early adulthood as humans learn to better assess and interpret the emotions of others. Prosocial behaviours have been observed in children 1–2 years old. Through self-report methods it is difficult to measure emotional responses as they are not as able to report these responses as well as adult.&lt;ref name="Nancy Eisenberg 1989"/&gt; This is representative of an increased efficiency of and ability to engage in internal moral reasoning.

===Theory of mind===
The development of [[theory of mind]], or the ability to view the world from perspectives of other people, is strongly associated with the development of sympathy and other complex emotions.&lt;ref name="Decety 2010 886–899"/&gt; These emotions are complex because they involve more than just one's own emotional states; complex emotions involve the interplay of multiple people's varying and fluctuating thoughts and emotions within given contexts. The ability to experience vicarious emotion, or imagining how another person feels, is integral for empathic concern. Moral development is similarly tied to the understanding of outside perspectives and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weele|first=Cor|title=Empathy's purity, sympathy's complexities; De Waal, Darwin and Adam Smith|journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy|year=2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=583–593|doi=10.1007/s10539-011-9248-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral reasoning has been divided into five categories beginning with a hedonistic self-orientation and ending with an internalized sense of needs of others, including empathic emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=Nancy |author2=Carlo, Gustavo |author3=Murphy, Bridget |author4=Court, Patricia|title=Prosocial Development in Late Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|journal=Child Development|date=1 August 1995|volume=66|issue=4|pages=1179–1197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00930.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innate feature===
A study conducted in Switzerland in 2006 sought to find whether or not sympathy demonstrated by children was solely for personal benefit, or if the emotion was an innate part of development. Parents, teachers, and 1,300 children (aged 6 and 7) were interviewed regarding the child's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Buchmann, Marlis, Michaela Gummerum, Monika Keller, and Tina Malti. "Child's Moral Motivation, Sympathy, and Prosocial Behaviour." Child Development 80.2 Apr. (2009): 442-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of one year, questionnaires were filled out regarding the progress and behavior of each youth. Thereafter, an interview was conducted in the spring of 2007. The study concluded that children do develop sympathy and empathy independently of parental guidance. Furthermore, the study found that girls are more sympathetic, prosocial, and morally motivated than boys. [[Prosocial behavior]] has been noted in children as young as 12 months when showing and giving toys to their parents, without promoting or being reinforced by praise. Levels of prosocial behavior increased with sympathy in children with low moral motivation, as it reflects the link between innate abilities and honing them with the guidance of parents and teachers.

'''''The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World''''' is a book by [[Pedro Domingos]] released in 2015. Domingos wrote the book in order to generate interest from people outside the field.

The book outlines five tribes of machine learning: [[inductive reasoning]], [[connectionism]], [[evolutionary computation]], [[Bayes' theorem|bayes theorem]] and [[Analogical modeling|analogical modelling]]. The author explains these tribes to the reader by referring to more understandable processes of [[logic]], connections made in the [[brain]], [[natural selection]], [[probability]] and [[Similarity (psychology)|similarity]] judgements. Throughout the book, it is suggested that each different tribe has the potential to contribute to a unifying "master algorithm".

Towards the end of the book the author pictures a "master [[algorithm]]" in the near future, where [[machine learning algorithm]]s asymptotically grow to a perfect understanding of how the world and people in it work.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Slate.com_September_26_2015c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/09/pedro_domingos_master_algorithm_how_machine_learning_is_reshaping_how_we.2.html|title=Pedro Domingos' Master Algorithm: How machine learning is reshaping how we live.|author=|date=|accessdate=September 26, 2015|newspaper=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the algorithm doesn't yet exist, he briefly reviews his own invention of the [[Markov logic network]].&lt;ref name="Dom2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Master Algorithm: How machine learning is reshaping how we live.|last=Domingos|first=Pedro|date=2015|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=246–7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
In 2016 [[Bill Gates]] recommended the book, alongside [[Nick Bostrom]]'s ''[[Superintelligence (book)|Superintelligence]]'', as one of two books everyone should read to understand AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ha|first1=Thu-Huong|title=Bill Gates says these are the two books we should all read to understand AI|url=https://qz.com/698334/bill-gates-says-these-are-the-two-books-we-should-all-read-to-understand-ai/|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=Quartz|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the book was noted to be on Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]]'s bookshelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Zheping|title=The two books helping China's Xi Jinping understand artificial intelligence|url=https://qz.com/1170185/the-master-algorithm-and-augmented-the-two-books-helping-chinas-xi-jinping-understand-ai/|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=Quartz|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
A computer science educator stated in ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' that the examples are clear and accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World, by Pedro Domingos|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-the-master-algorithm-pedro-domingos-allen-lane|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|date=17 September 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''[[The Economist]]'' agreed Domingo "does a good job" but complained that he "constantly invents metaphors that grate or confuse".&lt;ref&gt;"Machines for thinking: artificial intelligence." The Economist, 3 Oct. 2015, p. 86(US).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised the book, stating "Readers unfamiliar with logic and computer theory will have a difficult time, but those who persist will discover fascinating insights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MASTER ALGORITHM by Pedro Domingos {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/pedro-domingos/the-master-algorithm/|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2015|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New Scientist]]'' review called it "compelling but rather unquestioning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=&lt;em&gt;The Master Algorithm&lt;/em&gt;: A world remade by machines that learn|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22830450-900-the-master-algorithm-a-world-remade-by-machines-that-learn/|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=New Scientist|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3306">A '''true threat''' is a [[threatening communication]] that can be prosecuted under the law. It is distinct from a threat that is made in jest. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has held that true threats are not protected under the [[U.S. Constitution]] based on three justifications: preventing fear, preventing the disruption that follows from that fear, and diminishing the likelihood that the threatened violence will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=81|publisher=N.Y.U. L. Rev.|pages=385|year=2006|title=Toward an Improved True Threat Doctrine for Student Speakers; Stanner, Andrew P.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/nylr81&amp;section=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some concern that even satirical speech could be regarded as a "true threat" due to concern over [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=58|publisher=U. Miami L. Rev.|pages=843|date=2003–2004|title=Mocking George: Political Satire as True Threat in the Age of Global Terrorism|author=Gilbert, Lauren|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/umialr58&amp;section=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The true threat doctrine was established in the 1969 Supreme Court case ''[[Watts v. United States]]''.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{citation|volume=72|publisher=Fordham L. Rev.|pages=1283|year=2004|title=Is the True Threats Doctrine Threatening the First Amendment? Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette, Inc. v. American Coalition of Life Activists Signals the Need To Remedy an Inadequate Doctrine; Weiss, Lori|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3953&amp;context=flr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, an eighteen-year-old male was convicted in a Washington, D.C. District Court for violating a statute prohibiting persons from knowingly and willfully making threats to harm or kill the President of the United States.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; The conviction was based on a statement made by Watts, in which he said, "[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is [[Lyndon B. Johnson|L.B.J.]]"&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Watts appealed, leading to the Supreme Court finding the statute constitutional on its face, but reversing the conviction of Watts. 

In reviewing the lower court's analysis of the case, the Court noted that "a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech."&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; The Court recognized that "uninhibited, robust, and wideopen" political debate can at times be characterized by "vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials." In light of the context of Watts' statement - and the laughter that it received from the crowd - the Court found that it was more "a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President" than a "true threat." &lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; In so holding, the Court established that there is a "true threat" exception to protected speech, but also that the statement must be viewed in its context and distinguished from protected hyperbole. The opinion, however, stopped short of defining precisely what constituted a "true threat." &lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">In the area of [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] known as [[type theory]], a '''type constructor''' is a feature of a typed [[formal language]] that builds new types from old ones. [[Basic type]]s are considered to be built using [[nullary]] type constructors. Some type constructors take another type as an argument, e.g., the constructors for [[product type]]s, [[function type]]s&lt;!-- needs writing --&gt;, power types and [[list type]]s&lt;!-- ibid --&gt;. New types can be defined by recursively composing type constructors.

For example, [[simply typed lambda calculus]] can be seen as a language with a single type constructor&amp;mdash;the function type constructor. Product types can generally be considered "built-in" in [[Typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculi]] via [[currying]].

Abstractly, a type constructor is an ''n''-ary '''type operator''' taking as argument zero or more types, and returning another type. Making use of currying, ''n''-ary type operators can be (re)written as a sequence of applications of unary type operators. Therefore, we can view the type operators as a simply typed lambda calculus, which has only one basic type, usually denoted &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, and pronounced "type", which is the type of all types in the underlying language, which are now called ''proper types'' in order to distinguish them from the types of the type operators in their own calculus, which are called ''[[Kind (type theory)|kind]]s''.

Instituting a simply typed lambda calculus over the type operators results in more than just a formalization of type constructors though. Higher-order type operators become possible. Type operators correspond to the 2nd axis in the [[lambda cube]], leading to the simply typed lambda-calculus with type operators, λ&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;; while this is not so well known, combining type operators with polymorphic lambda calculus ([[system F]]) yields [[system F-omega]].

'''Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo''' (April 11, 1925 – March 25, 1965) was a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]]&lt;ref name="uua"/&gt; [[civil rights]] activist from [[Michigan]]. In March 1965 Liuzzo, then a housewife and mother of five with a history of local activism, heeded the call of [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and traveled from [[Detroit]], Michigan, to [[Selma, Alabama]] in the wake of the [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]] attempt at marching across the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]].  Liuzzo participated in the successful [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and helped with coordination and logistics. Driving back from a trip shuttling fellow activists to the Montgomery airport, she was murdered by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. She was 39 years old.

One of the four Klansmen in the car from which the shots were fired was [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) informant [[Gary Thomas Rowe]].&lt;ref name="uua"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |title=Viola Liuzzo |work=Dictionary of Unitarian &amp; Universalist Biography |publisher=Uua.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316062159/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |archive-date=2013-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrhighdropout.com/post/105092804453/government-evils-not-to-be-forgotten |title=Government Evils Not To Be Forgotten |publisher=JrHighDropOut.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rowe testified against the shooters and was given [[witness protection]] by the FBI.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/04/us/gary-t-rowe-jr-64-who-informed-on-klan-in-civil-rights-killing-is-dead.html|title=Gary T. Rowe Jr., 64, Who Informed on Klan In Civil Rights Killing, Is Dead|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FBI later leaked what were purported to be salacious details about Liuzzo. The FBI attempted to downplay the situation and discredit Liuzzo by spreading rumors that she was a member of the [[Communist Party]], was a heroin addict,&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;Jack Anderson (March 21, 1983). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19830321&amp;id=QV1GAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zTENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2477,2441456&amp;hl=en "Hoover smear tactics hurt civil rights case"]. ''The Evening News''.&lt;/ref&gt; and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African-Americans involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Viola Liuzzo|url = http://uudb.org/articles/violaliuzzo.html|website = uudb.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these were either proved or substantiated in any way.

In addition to other honors, Liuzzo's name is today inscribed on the [[Civil Rights Memorial]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], created by Maya Lin.

==Early life==
Liuzzo was born '''Viola Fauver Gregg''' on April 1, 1925, in the small town of [[California, Pennsylvania]], the elder daughter of Eva Wilson, a teacher, and Heber Ernest Gregg, a coal miner and World War I veteran. He left school in the eighth grade but taught himself to read. Her mother Eva had a teaching certificate from the University of Pittsburgh. The couple had one other daughter, Rose Mary, in 1930. While on the job, Heber's right hand was blown off in a mine explosion and, during the [[Great Depression]], the Greggs became solely dependent on Eva's income. Work was very hard to come by for Mrs. Gregg, as she could pick up only sporadic, short-term teaching positions. The family descended further into poverty and decided to move from Georgia to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where Eva found a teaching position, when Viola was six.&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"&gt;Stanton, Mary (2004). "Viola Liuzzo and the Gendered Politics of Martyrdom: From Selma to Sorrow: The Life and Death of Viola Liuzzo". ''[[Harvard Women's Law Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family was very poor and lived in one-room shacks with no running water. The schools Liuzzo attended did not have adequate supplies and the teachers were too busy to give extra attention to children in need. Because the family moved so often, Liuzzo never began and ended the school year in the same place. Having spent much of her childhood and adolescence poor in Tennessee, Viola experienced the segregated nature of the South firsthand. This would have a powerful impact on her activism. It was during her formative years that she realized the injustice of segregation and racism, as she and her family, in similar conditions of great poverty, were still afforded social privilege and amenities denied to African-Americans under the Jim Crow laws.&lt;ref name="serialssolutionscivil"&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/93289614&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michigan==
In 1941 the Gregg family moved to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], where her father sought a job assembling bombs at the Ford Motor Co. Viola's strong-willed nature led her to drop out of high school after one year, and elope at the age of 16. The marriage did not last and she returned to her family. Two years later the Gregg family moved to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], which was starkly segregated by race.  Tensions between whites and blacks there was very high and the early 1940s saw violence and rioting.  Witnessing these horrific ordeals was a major motivator that influenced Viola's future civil rights work.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 she married George Argyris, the manager of a restaurant where she worked. They had two children, Penny and Evangeline Mary, and divorced in 1949.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt; She later married Anthony Liuzzo, a [[Teamsters]] union business agent.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teamsters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teamster.org/content/civil-rights-martyr-viola-liuzzo |title=Civil Rights Martyr Viola Liuzzo |publisher=[[Teamsters]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children: Tommy, Anthony Jr. and Sally.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;  Liuzzo sought to return to school, and attended the Carnegie Institute in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. She then enrolled part-time at [[Wayne State University]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="uu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Viola Liuzzo |url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626124213/http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 26, 2003 |publisher=[[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 she began attending the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Detroit, and joined the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;

A large part of Viola's activism, particularly with the NAACP, was due to a close friendship with an African-American woman, Sarah Evans. After initially meeting in a grocery store where Liuzzo worked as a cashier, the two kept in touch. Evans eventually became Liuzzo's housekeeper while still maintaining a close, friendly relationship in which they shared similar views including support for the civil rights movement. In the aftermath of Liuzzo's death, Evans would go on to become the permanent caretaker of Liuzzo's five young children.&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"/&gt;

Liuzzo so passionately believed in the fight for civil rights that she helped organize Detroit protests, attended civil rights conferences and worked with the NAACP. She had a strong desire to make a difference on as large a scale as she could.&lt;ref name="serialssolutionscivil"/&gt;

==Local activism==
In addition to actively supporting the civil rights movement, Liuzzo was also notable for her protest against Detroit's laws that allowed for students to more easily drop out of school. Her disagreement with this law led her to withdraw her children from school in protest. Because she deliberately home-schooled them for two months, Liuzzo was arrested, but did not waiver. She pleaded guilty in court and was placed on probation.&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"/&gt;

==Selma==
In February 1965 a night demonstration for voting rights at the Marion, Alabama, courthouse turned violent. State troopers clubbed marchers and beat and shot a 26-year-old African-American named [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]], who later died. His death spurred on the fight for civil rights in Selma, Alabama. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) scheduled a protest march for Sunday, March 7, 1965. Gov. George Wallace banned the march, but the ban was ignored. Six hundred marchers headed for the arched [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] that crossed the Alabama River. As the protesters reached the crest of the bridge, they saw a terrifying sight on the other side: state troopers armed with clubs, whips and tear gas and a sheriff's posse on horseback. When told to stop and disperse, the marchers refused. The troopers advanced on the marchers, clubbing and whipping them, fracturing bones and gashing heads. Seventeen people were hospitalized on the day later called "[[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]".

Liuzzo was horrified by the images of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|aborted march]] on Bloody Sunday. A second march took place March 9. Troopers, police and marchers confronted each other at the county end of the bridge, but when the troopers stepped aside to let them pass, the [[Rev. Martin Luther King]] led the marchers back to the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Branch | first = Taylor | title = The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was obeying a federal injunction while seeking protection from federal court for the march. That night a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist [[James Reeb]], a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston, who had come to Selma to march with the second group.&lt;ref&gt;http://uudb.org/articles/jamesjosephreeb.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many other clergy and sympathizers from across the country also gathered for the second march.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On March 16, Liuzzo took part in a protest at Wayne State. She then called her husband to tell him she would be traveling to [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] after hearing the Rev Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. call for people of all faiths to come and help, saying that the struggle "was everybody's fight."   Leaving her children in the care of family and friends she contacted the Southern Christian Leadership Conference who took her on and tasked her with delivering aid to various locations, welcoming and recruiting volunteers and transporting volunteers and marchers to and from airports, bus terminals and train stations, for which she volunteered the use of her car,&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"/&gt; a 1963 [[Oldsmobile]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On March 21, 1965 more than 3,000 people began the third march, including blacks, whites, doctors, nurses, working-class people, priests, nuns, rabbis, homemakers, students, actors, and farmers. Many famous people participated, including Dr. Martin Luther King, [[Ralph Bunche]], [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Ralph Abernathy]], and [[Andrew Young]]. It took five days for the protesters to reach their goal. Liuzzo marched the first full day and returned to Selma for the night. That Wednesday, March 24, she rejoined the march four miles from the end, where a "Night of the Stars" celebration was held the City of St. Jude with performances by many popular entertainers of the day, including [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Joan Baez]], and [[Dick Gregory]]. Liuzzo helped at the first aid station. On Thursday, Liuzzo and other marchers reached the state capitol building, with a Confederate flag flying above it. Martin Luther King addressed the crowd of 25,000, calling the march, a "shining moment in American history."{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Murder and aftermath==
After the third march concluded on March 25, Liuzzo, assisted by Leroy Moton, a 19-year-old [[African American]], continued shuttling marchers and volunteers from Montgomery back to Selma in her car.  As they were driving along Route 80, a car tried to force them off the road. After dropping passengers in Selma, she and Moton headed back to Montgomery. As they were getting gas at a local filling station, they were subject to abusive calls and racist scorn. When Liuzzo stopped at a red light, a car with four members of the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] pulled up alongside her. When they saw a white woman and a black man in a car together, they followed Liuzzo as she tried to outrun them. Overtaking the Oldsmobile, they shot directly at Liuzzo, mortally wounding her twice in the head. The car veered into a ditch, crashing into a fence.&lt;ref name="teamsters"/&gt;

Although Moton was covered with blood, the bullets missed him. He lay motionless when the Klansmen reached the car to check on their victims. After the Klansmen left, Moton began searching for help, and eventually flagged down a truck driven by Rev. Leon Riley. Like Moton and Liuzzo, Riley was shuttling civil rights workers back to Selma.

Liuzzo's funeral was held at Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church on March 30 in Detroit, with many prominent members of both the civil rights movement and government there to pay their respects. Included in this group were [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]; [[NAACP]] executive director [[Roy Wilkins]]; [[Congress on Racial Equality]] national leader [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]]; Michigan lieutenant governor [[William G. Milliken]]; Teamsters president [[Jimmy Hoffa]]; and [[United Auto Workers]] president [[Walter Reuther]]. She was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Less than two weeks after her death, a [[Cross burning|charred cross]] was found in front of four Detroit homes, including the Liuzzo residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fourth Cross Is Burned On Detroit Lawn |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/823323// |newspaper=[[The Brownsville Herald]]|date=April 4, 1964|page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=August 4, 2014}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and legal proceedings==
The four Klan members in the car, Collie Wilkins (21), FBI informant Gary Rowe (34), William Eaton (41) and Eugene Thomas (42) were quickly arrested; within 24 hours, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] appeared on national television to announce their arrest. In order to avoid bad press, President Johnson made sure to focus on the positive work of the FBI agents' solving of the murder of Viola Liuzzo, in an attempt to divert scrutiny away from the fact that one of the men in the car, Gary Thomas Rowe, Jr., was an FBI informant and therefore protected by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/111/3/870.full |author=Gary May |title=The Informant: The FBI, The Ku Klux Klan, and the Murder of Viola Liuzzo |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2005 |page=431 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alabama mistrial and acquittal===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
Wilkins, Eaton, and Thomas were indicted in the State of Alabama for Liuzzo's death on April 22. FBI informant Rowe was not indicted and served as a witness.  Rowe testified that Wilkins had fired two shots on the order of Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;http://law.jrank.org/pages/3141/Collie-Leroy-Wilkins-Trial-1965.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal civil trial===
The next phase of the lengthy process began when a federal trial charged the defendants with conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|Ku Klux Klan Act]], a [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] civil rights statute. The charges did not specifically refer to Liuzzo's murder. On December 3, the trio were found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in Southern legal history.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p 130&lt;/ref&gt;

While out on appeal, Wilkins and Thomas were each found guilty of firearms violations and sent to jail for those crimes. During this period, the January 15, 1966, edition of the ''[[Birmingham News]]'' published an ad offering Liuzzo's bullet-ridden car for sale. Asking $3,500, the ad read, "Do you need a crowd-getter? I have a 1963 Oldsmobile two-door in which Mrs. Viola Liuzzo was killed. Bullet holes and everything intact. Ideal to bring in crowds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liuzzo protests car advertising|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EcIlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HPUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2564,308263&amp;dq=vilola+liuzzo&amp;hl=en|accessdate=21 June 2011|newspaper=Baltimore Afro-American|date=18 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After all three defendants were convicted of the federal charges, state murder cases proceeded against Eaton and Thomas. Eaton, the only defendant who remained out of jail, died of a heart attack on March 9. Thomas's state murder trial – the final trial – got under way on September 26, 1966. The prosecution built a strong circumstantial case in the trial that included an FBI ballistics expert testifying that the bullet removed from the woman's brain was fired from a revolver owned by Thomas. Two witnesses testified they had seen Wilkins drinking beer at a [[VFW]] Hall near Birmingham, 125 miles from the murder scene, an hour or less after Liuzzo was shot. Despite the presence of eight African Americans on the jury, Thomas was acquitted of the state murder charge the following day after just 90 minutes of deliberations. State attorney general [[Richmond Flowers, Sr.]] criticized the verdict, deriding the black members of the panel, who had been carefully screened, as "[[Uncle Tom]]s."

On April 27, 1967, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[New Orleans]] upheld the federal convictions of the surviving defendants. Thomas served six years in prison for the crime. Due to threats from the Klan, both before and after his testimony, Gary Thomas Rowe went into the federal witness protection program.&lt;ref name=RoweVGriffin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openjurist.org/676/f2d/524/rowe-v-griffin-o |title=676 F. 2d 524 – Rowe v. Griffin |author=Judge Peter Thorp Fay for the United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit |date=May 17, 1982 |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]/OpenJurist |accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe died in 1998 in Savannah, Georgia, after having lived several decades under several assumed identities.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==FBI cover-up and leaks==
Within 24 hours after Liuzzo's assassination by the Ku Klux Klan and the FBI's informant Gary Thomas Rowe, [[J. Edgar Hoover]] began a smear campaign to the press, to subordinate FBI agents and to select politicians, claiming the cut marks from the car's shattered window were "puncture marks in her arm indicating recent use of a hypodermic needle; she was sitting very, very close to that negro in the car; that it has the appearance of a necking party."&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt;

While attempting to obscure the fact that an FBI informant was in the car, and to ensure that the FBI was not held responsible for permitting their informant to participate in violent acts, without FBI surveillance or backup, the FBI was concerned that they might be held accountable for their informant's (Rowe) role in the death.  Rowe had been an informant for the FBI since 1960. The FBI was aware that Rowe had participated in acts of violence during Ku Klux Klan activities. On the day of Liuzzo's death, prior to the shooting, Rowe called his FBI contact and notified him that Rowe and other Klansman were travelling to Montgomery, and that violence was planned.&lt;ref name="Stanton, pp 52-55"&gt;Stanton, pp 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autopsy testing in 1965 showed no traces of drugs in Liuzzo's system, and that she had not had sex recently at the time of death.   The FBI's role in the smear campaign was uncovered in 1978 when Liuzzo's children obtained case documents from the FBI under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, pp 52–55, 189–192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blake, p 201.  Quote from Penny on p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and subsequent lawsuits==
[[File:Memorial to Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo, (Lowndes County, Alabama).jpg|thumb|200 px|Memorial to Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo in Lowndes County, Alabama]]
Liuzzo was condemned by different racist organizations for having brought her death upon herself. At the time, Liuzzo's choice to immerse herself in such a dangerous undertaking was seen by some as radical and controversial. However, of all the deaths to occur during the campaign, Liuzzo's was the only one scrutinized in such a way, where other male activists who were killed were recognized as heroes.&lt;ref name="serialssolutionscivil"/&gt;

Rowe was indicted in 1978 and tried for his involvement in the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Ingalls, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The first trial ended in a [[hung jury]], and the second trial ended in his acquittal.&lt;ref name=RoweVGriffin/&gt;

On May 27, 1983, Judge [[Charles Wycliffe Joiner]] rejected the claims in the Liuzzo family lawsuit, saying there was "no evidence the FBI was in any type of joint venture with Rowe or conspiracy against Mrs. Liuzzo. Rowe's presence in the car was the principal reason why the crime was solved so quickly." In response to the verdict, Liuzzo family lawyer Dean A. Robb said "This is a terrible opinion. I'm shocked. I think this is incredible."&lt;ref name="AAN"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pyen |first1=Chong |last2=Cain |first2=Stephen |title=Judge Rules Against Liuzzo Family |url=https://aadl.org/aa_news_19830527-judge_rules_against_liuzzo_family |accessdate=4 August 2018 |work=Ann Arbor News |date=27 May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1983, the FBI was awarded $79,873 in court costs,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Sixties: A Decade of Culture and Counterculture'' {{ISBN|978-0-313-32944-9}} p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; but costs were later reduced to $3,645 after the [[ACLU]] appealed on behalf of the family.&lt;ref&gt;See Liuzzo v. US, 565 F. Supp. 640 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Walter P. Reuther Library]] contains original archival material surrounding Liuzzo and her case. [http://reuther.wayne.edu/files/UP001745_.pdf The Viola Liuzzo Papers] contain documentation of the events surrounding the murder, the resulting investigation, and later legal involvement of the Liuzzo Family. The papers contain FBI murder investigation files and completed Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (FOIPA) requests for the FBI's involvement with the Ku Klux Klan. Several documents relate to the Freedom Riders.

Liuzzo was featured in part 3 of a series of videos, ''Free at Last: Civil Rights Heroes''.

Her murder was shown in Episode 2 of the ''[[King (TV miniseries)|King]]'' miniseries.

Viola Liuzzo Park is located at Winthrop and Trojan in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/2015/04/07/viola-liuzzo-detroit-wayne-state-degree-selma-civil-rights/25432865/ |title=Week of events will honor Viola Liuzzo |publisher=Detroitnews.com |date=2015-04-07 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liuzzo has her name included as part of the [[Civil Rights Memorial]], a monument in Montgomery, Alabama, created by [[Maya Lin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/civil-rights-memorial/civil-rights-martyrs |title=Civil Rights Martyrs &amp;#124; Southern Poverty Law Center |publisher=Splcenter.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Liuzzo was the subject of a documentary, ''[[Home of the Brave (2004 film)|Home of the Brave]]''.

In 2008, Liuzzo's story was memorialized in a song, "Color Blind Angel" by the late blues singer [[Robin Rogers]] on her [[album]] ''Treat Me Right''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Hal |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/treat-me-right-mw0000789597 |title=Treat Me Right – Robin Rogers : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Viola Liuzzo Ethics Scholarship was started at [[Adrian College]] by her grandson, Joshua James Liuzzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/adriancollege_/docs/contactmagspring2012/23 |title=Contact Magazine Spring 2012 by Adrian College |publisher=ISSUU |date= |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ''Outside Agitators'' was written by 20% Theater's Artistic Associate, Laura Nessler. Inspired by and based on Liuzzo's story, the play premiered at the Prop Theater in Chicago, Illinois, on September 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/outside-agitators/Event?oid=14993117|title=Outside Agitators|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liuzzo was played by [[Tara Ochs]] in the 2014 film [[Selma (film)|''Selma'']].

In 2015, [[Wayne State University]] bestowed its first posthumous honorary doctorate degree on Liuzzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spratling |first=Cassandra |url=http://www.freep.com/story/life/2015/04/10/viola-liuzzo-wayne-state-university-honor/25603257/ |title=Wayne State hails civil rights icon Viola Liuzzo as hero |publisher=Freep.com |date=1965-03-25 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8938">The '''War Resisters League''' (WRL) is the oldest secular [[pacifist]] organization in the United States.&lt;ref name="forusa.org"&gt;[http://forusa.org/groups/affiliate-groups/war-resisters-league "War Resisters League" Fellowship for Reconciliation website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warresisters.org/history |title=WRL History |publisher=Warresisters.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Founded in 1923 by men and women who had [[opposed World War I]], it is a section of the London-based [[War Resisters' International]].&lt;ref name="S2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Powers S|title=Protest, Power, and Change: An Encyclopedia of Nonviolent Action|year= 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76482-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xmlWr4aAt4EC&amp;pg=PA563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be one of the leading radical voices in the anti-war movement.&lt;ref name="forusa.org"/&gt;

Many of the organization's founders had been jailed during [[World War I]] for refusing [[conscription in the United States|military service]].  From the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] many [[Jew]]s, [[suffragist]]s, [[socialist]]s, and [[anarchists]] separated to form this more [[secular]] organization.

Although the WRL was opposed to US participation in [[World War II]], it did not protest against it; the WRL complied with the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]], ceased public protests, and did not solicit new members during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], many members were imprisoned as conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. 69ff&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, WRL members worked in the [[civil rights movement]] and organized protests against [[nuclear weapon]]s testing and [[United States civil defense|civil defense]] drills.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In the 1960s, WRL was the first [[pacifist]] organization to call for an end to the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; WRL also organized the first demonstration against the war with a September 21, 1963 vigil at the U.S. Mission to the UN, followed by an October 9, 1963 picket of [[Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu]] speaking at the [[Waldorf-Astoria in New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;''WRL News'', Nov-Dec 1963, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; WRL was among the primary groups (along with [[Committee for Nonviolent Action]], the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], the [[Socialist Party]], and the [[Student Peace Union]]) to organize coordinated nationwide protests against the Vietnam War on December 19, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of the People'', ed. Robert Cooney &amp; Helen Michalowski, [[New Society Publishers]], Philadelphia, PA, 1987, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's opposition to nuclear weapons was extended to include [[nuclear power]] in the 1970s and 1980s. The WRL has also been active in [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-[[racism|racist]] causes and works with other organizations to reduce the level of violence in modern culture.

==Current activities==
Presently, the War Resisters League is actively organizing against the wars in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] as well as the impact of war at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barry |first=Dan |title=A nation at war: at war at home; as wars come and go, Ralph keeps protesting |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6D91F31F931A15750C0A9659C8B63&amp;&amp;scp=9&amp;sq=%22War%20Resisters%20League%22&amp;st=cse |journal=New York Times |year=2003 |issue=March 22 |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its organizing is focused on challenging military recruiters and ending corporate profit from war. It publishes an annual peace calendar, the quarterly magazine ''WIN: Through Revolutionary Nonviolence'', and other materials and is involved in a number of national peace and justice coalitions, including [[United for Peace and Justice]] and the [[National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee]]. Since 1958, WRL has awarded almost annually the [[War Resisters League Peace Award]] to a person or organization whose work represents the League's radical nonviolent program of action.

The War Resisters League annually publishes a pie chart showing how much of the [[US Budget|U.S. federal budget]] actually covers current and past [[Military budget of the United States|military expenses]], listing the total as 54%:
:"The figures are federal funds, which do not include trust funds — such as Social Security — that are raised and spent separately from income taxes....The government practice of [[Unified budget|combining trust and federal funds]] began during the [[Vietnam War]], thus making the human needs portion of the budget seem larger and the military portion smaller. "&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warresisters.org/pages/piechart.htm Pie chart], warresisters.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/sardi/sardi59.html|title=How Much Does It Cost Your Household for War?|last=Sardi|first=Bill |work=lewrockwell.com|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These figures are at odds with official government figures:  
:"[Dov S. Zakheim, the Pentagon comptroller pointed] out that the 2004 military budget would represent 16.6 percent of all federal spending, compared with 27.3 percent in the late 1980's."&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Leslie. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/04/us/president-s-budget-proposal-military-despite-bush-s-vow-spending-high-tech.html?scp=1&amp;sq=federal+budget+military+spending&amp;st=nyt THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE MILITARY; Despite Bush's Vow, Spending on High-Tech Weapons Remains at Low Level], [[New York Times]]. (February 4, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

:"...War Resisters....count moneys appropriated for veterans' benefits and payment of the national debt as "taxes to support past wars." The group does this because the only way it can arrive at the figure of 47 percent of the federal budget going to the military is to count what they see as past military spending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=B65F7E43-50D4-409D-9162-2BC1CEA92E94 |title=No Taxes for Freedom!|last=Jennings|first=Daniel G. |date=May 2, 2003 |publisher=FrontPageMagazine.com|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
