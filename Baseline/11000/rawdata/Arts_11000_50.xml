Vamana’s [[Kavyalankara Sutra]] is considered as the first attempt at evolving a [[Philosophy of education|philosophy]] of literary [[aesthetics]].

'''Contemporary dance in Australia''' is diverse with [[dance company|dance companies]] performing a broad range of what elsewhere may be termed [[contemporary dance|contemporary]] and [[modern dance|modern]] [[20th century concert dance|dance styles]].

Reduced funding (from the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] level down) has led to a reduction in the ability to sustain full-time employment to dancers, with only 5 companies in Australia that ''may'' offer a full year contract.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} All other companies work on a project basis with artists contracted for a set period of time, ranging from days to months, with no guarantee of further employment. Other funding sources include project specific funding for a dance work by example by a festival or performance venue to raise the expenses required to bring it to fruition.

==Dance film==
{{main|Dance film}}
Dance film provides one mode of contemporary dance in Australia with the [[ReelDance Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reeldance.org.au/ ReelDance Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; being the main avenue, with other opportunities being through installations at venues such as night clubs, back alley's to art galleries, shown as part of a live performance, or sometimes purchased for home viewing.

==On television==
[[So You Think You Can Dance Australia]] has drawn criticism for poorly representing dance as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/opinion/australia-you-cant-dance-like-that/2008/03/02/1204402265772.html Valerie Lawson, (3 March 2008), "Australia, you can't dance like that", ''Brisbane Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ABC1]] broadcasts contemporary dance as part of its [[Sunday Arts]] programming.

==Companies==
Australian contemporary dance companies include:
*[[Australian Dance Theatre]]
*[[Bangarra Dance Theatre]]
*[[Chunky Move]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2200">The '''Charcoal Club''' has been an arts club in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], USA, on an intermittent basis since 1883.

==History==
Started as the Sketch Club in 1883 by a group of male artists in Baltimore who "desired to draw and paint from life" (meaning nude models), the Charcoal Club was incorporated in 1885. The founding officers included [[Adalbert J. Volck]] and [[Joseph Evans Sperry]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiegand, Henry H.  "The Charcoal Club of Baltimore",  ''Art and Archaeology'' '''19''' (5-6) June 1925: p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The Club held exhibitions of local and national artists and its "annual juried exhibition of contemporary American art [was]...from 1911 to 1926...the high point of Baltimore's brief art season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirwin|first=Liza|title=Back to Bohemia with the Charcoal Club of Baltimore|journal=Archives of American Art Journal|year=1985|volume=25|issue=1-2|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Club was also known for its wild annual "Bal des Arts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirwin|first=Liza|title=Back to Bohemia with the Charcoal Club of Baltimore|journal=Archives of American Art Journal|year=1985|volume=25|issue=1-2|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coast Salish art''' is an art unique to the Pacific [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest Coast]] among the [[Coast Salish peoples]]. Coast Salish are peoples from the Pacific Northwest Coast made up of many different languages and cultural characteristics. Coast Salish territory covers the coast of [[British Columbia]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state.  Within traditional Coast Salish art there are two major forms; the flat design and carving, and basketry and weaving.  In historical times these were delineated among male and female roles in the community with men made "figurative pieces, such as sculptures and paintings that depicts crest, shamanic beings, and spirits, whereas women produced baskets and textiles, most often decorated with abstract designs."&lt;ref&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p22&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The settlement of non-natives in this region was one of the first for the Pacific Northwest Coast which brought early cultural disruptions much sooner and faster than most of the coast. This made it so a limited quantity of ancient artifacts of the art form were produced, especially compared to amount that exists about other Northwest Coastal art.&lt;ref name="Jonaitis, Aldona 2006"&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coast Salish lived in shed-roofed [[longhouse]]s, large dwellings made from [[western red cedar|cedar]] planks and beams, with large extended families living within the house. Platforms around on the inside stood 3 or 4 feet above ground against the wall and were used as sleeping areas.  Sometimes large beams on the sides of the longhouse called "House Posts" would be carved or painted depicting [[ancestor]]s, [[family history]], or [[supernatural being]]s.  Some longhouses grew to enormous sizes such as one [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] described in his visit with [[Sto:lo]] people with a house measuring 640 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] long and 60 feet wide&lt;ref&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p71&lt;/ref&gt; or another [[Squamish people|Squamish]] longhouse measuring 200 feet long by 60 feet wide where 11 families lived in the house, numbering around 100 people.&lt;ref&gt;Barman, Jean. ''Stanley Park's Secret''. Harbour Publishing, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-55017-420-5}}. p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Coast Salish in the central region, the sxwayxwey (Sx̱wáýx̱way or Skwayskway in other languages) [[mask]] ceremony is an important part of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p 75&lt;/ref&gt;  Men from families who have the hereditary right to be initiated into the sxwayxwey society and wear the mask, and perform dance with the addition of women singers and a special song.  The masks themselves have budged out cylindrical eyeballs, "horns" represented by animal heads, and drooping tongues with large feathers creating a dynamic crown.  They are accompanied by special [[regalia]] covered with [[feather]]s and [[leggings]] with [[hoof]] rattles attached.

[[Image:Skwxwu7mesh Siiyamiyn.jpg|thumb|left|Squamish leaders in 1903 are wearing traditional mountain-goat wool blankets.  These blankets show the different designs and patterns woven.]]Wool from the [[mountain goat]] and [[Salish Wool Dog]], now extinct, were used to craft wool woven mats, blankets, clothing, and robes.  The wool would be taken from the animals and then mixed with a [[diatomaceous earth]] removing oils and adding a white colour.  After wetting, the wool would be twisted between the palm and thigh to create a loose strand, after which was spun.  Whorls were placed on the shafts of wood [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]s, and the loose strands of wool were spun. Some of the circular spindle whorls were plain, but others had elaborate designs and beings depicted.

[[Image:WHORL WOMAN.gif|thumb|Here a Squamish elder woman is spinning wool on spindle-whorl c. 1893]][[Blanket]]s, [[mat]]s, and [[robe]]s were woven on [[loom]]s which were made up of two upright bars and were attached to two horizontal rollers.  Some loom poles were also carved with figures illustrating supernatural characters or family history.  Specially designed [[comb]]s were used during the process of preparing the wool, and another tool pushed the [[weft]] during [[weaving]].  Although the smaller textiles were often functional, many larger robes served as indicators of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Men carved house posts, grave monuments, masks, and ritual paraphernalia such as rattles; while women crafted woven robes, some plain, some elaborately coloured. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s made from sheets of mountain-goat horn bent and then sewn to form volumetric triangles originally adorned with strands of mountain-goat wool. The art form is used in spindle whorls, house posts, welcome figures, combs, bent wood boxes, canoes, and other cultural objects.

=== Revival ===
Coast Salish art has undergone a revival in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.straight.com/article-150247/susan-point-people-amongst-people Laurence, Robin.

[[Cowichan peoples|Cowichan]] artist Edward Joe, who has adapted the Coast Salish art form into fine jewelry and prints, says "(Coast) Salish art has as smooth slowing motion intended to create a calm mood. The stories, legends, and myths are depicted in many of my art pieces. Animals from the land, sea, and sky are designed in a playful manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alcheringa-gallery.com/artists.html?do=view&amp;artist=317 Edward Joe Profile at Alcheringa Gallery.] - Retrieved November 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2008, the [[Seattle Art Museum]] opened "''S'abadeb—The Gifts: Pacific Coast Salish Art and Artists''", a Coast Salish art exhibition from 75 works of art from national and international collections of both traditional and contemporary artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/exhibit/exhibitDetail.asp?eventID=13771# S'abadeb—The Gifts: Pacific Coast Salish Art and Artists] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202094154/http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/exhibit/exhibitDetail.asp?eventID=13771 |date=2008-12-02 }} - Retrieved November 09, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
It also differs from other [[Northwest Coast art]] in that it is more minimalist and straight forward. A belief in the overexposure of spirit images would weaken the spiritual powers of the beings portrayed, and as a result very few pieces were produced.&lt;ref name="Jonaitis, Aldona 2006"/&gt;

The "simplicity, antiquity, limited quantity and sometimes impenetrable iconography of (Coast) Salish art" have led to dismiss it in comparison to neighbor art forms, but Aldona Jonaitis in ''Art of the Northwest Coast'' remarks "Coast Salish art, like that of other Northwest Coast groups, responds to the social needs for which the archaic style was well suited... Coast Salish art cannot be judged according to alien values appropriate to other Northwest Coast groups, but, like most kinds of art, must be understood as visual statements meaningful and valuable to their creators."&lt;ref&gt;Jonaitis, Aldona. Art of the Northwest Coast. Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006. {{ISBN|0-295-98636-0}}. p 88&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Morrell''' (born April 24, 1943) is a Canadian-American [[novelist]], best known for his debut 1972 [[novel]] ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'', which would later become [[Rambo (film series)|the successful Rambo film franchise]] starring [[Sylvester Stallone]]. He has written 28 novels, and his work has been translated into 26 languages.&lt;ref name=BioPage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmorrell.net/about.cfm |title=Biography |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He  also wrote the 2007–2008 [[Captain America]] [[comic book]] [[miniseries]] ''The Chosen''.

==Early life==
Morrell was born on the 24 April 1943 in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada. He decided to become a writer at the age of 17, after being inspired by the writing in the classic television series ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''. In 1966, Morrell received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in English from [[St. Jerome's University]] and moved to the United States to study with [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] scholar Philip Young at [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he would eventually receive his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in [[American literature]].

==Career==
During his time at Penn State he met [[science fiction]] writer Philip Klass, better known by the pseudonym [[William Tenn]], who taught the basics of writing fiction.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt; Morrell began work as an English professor at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1970. In 1972, his novel ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'' was published; it would eventually be made into the [[First Blood|1982 film of the same name]] starring [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Vietnam veteran John Rambo. Morrell continued to write many other novels, including ''[[The Brotherhood of the Rose]]'', the first in a trilogy of novels, which was adapted into a 1989 [[NBC]] [[miniseries]] starring [[Robert Mitchum]]. He gave up his tenure at the university in 1986 in order to write full-time.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt;

Morrell is the co-president of the [[International Thriller Writers]] organization.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt;

==Personal life==
Morrell's teenaged son Matthew died of [[Ewing's sarcoma]], a rare form of [[bone cancer]], in 1987. The trauma of his loss influenced Morrell's work, in particular in his creative fiction memoir about Matthew, ''Fireflies''. The protagonist of Morrell's novel ''Desperate Measures'' also experiences the loss of a son.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt;

Morrell is a graduate of the [[National Outdoor Leadership School]] for wilderness survival as well as the [[G. Gordon Liddy]] Academy of Corporate Security. He is also an honorary lifetime member of the Special Operations Association and the Association of Former Intelligence Officers.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt;

According to his website, he has been trained to handle [[firearms]], [[crisis negotiation]], assuming identities, [[executive protection]], and [[defensive driving]], among numerous other action skills that he describes in his novels. He earned an FAA licence to pilot his own small plane as part of research for his 2009 novel, ''The Shimmer''.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt;

Morrell lives in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanindian.net/kusi/davidmorrell/index.html |title=David Morrell |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrell was presented with the 2009 ThrillerMaster Award from the ITW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thrillerwriters.org/?s=thriller+master&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|title=The 2011 Thriller Awards|publisher=ITW|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design''' is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction. Design has different [[connotation]]s in different fields (see [[#Design disciplines|design disciplines]] below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in [[pottery]], [[engineering]], management, [[software development|coding]], and [[graphic design]]) is also considered to use design thinking.

Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]], economic, and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable [[research]], [[thought]], [[Physical model|modeling]], interactive [[problem solving|adjustment]], and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including [[clothing]], [[graphical user interface]]s, products, skyscrapers, [[corporate identity|corporate identities]], [[business process]]es, and even methods or processes of designing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brinkkemper, S. |year=1996|title= Method engineering: engineering of information systems development methods and tools|journal= Information and Software Technology |volume=38|issue=4|pages=275–280|doi=10.1016/0950-5849(95)01059-9|url=http://doc.utwente.nl/18012/1/Brinkkemper96method.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus "design" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation as is made clear by grammatical context.

== Definitions ==
More formally design has been defined as follows:
{{Quote|(noun) a specification of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]], manifested by an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]], intended to accomplish [[goal]]s, in a particular [[Environment (systems)|environment]], using a set of primitive components, satisfying a set of [[requirement]]s, subject to constraints; (verb, transitive) to create a design, in an [[Environment (systems)|environment]] (where the designer operates)&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P. and Wand, Y. (2009). A proposal for a formal definition of the design concept. In Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., editors, Design Requirements Workshop (LNBIP 14), pp. 103–136. Springer-Verlag, p. 109 {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-540-92966-6_6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another definition for design is "a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective."&lt;ref&gt;Don Kumaragamage, Y. (2011). Design Manual Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, a "specification" can be manifested as either a plan or a finished product, and "primitives" are the elements from which the design object is composed.

The person designing is called a designer, which is also a term used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a textile designer, fashion designer, product designer, concept designer, web designer or interior designer). A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process while the scientific study of design is called [[design science]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C. (1964) Notes on the Synthesis of Form, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eekels, J. |year=2000|title=On the Fundamentals of Engineering Design Science: The Geography of Engineering Design Science, Part 1|journal= Journal of Engineering Design |volume=11|pages=377–397|doi=10.1080/09544820010000962|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="design theory"&gt;Braha, D. and Maimon, O. (1998) A Mathematical Theory of Design, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of design is planning to manufacture an object, system, component or structure. Thus the word "design" can be used as a noun or a verb. In a broader sense, design is an applied art and engineering that integrates with technology.

While the definition of design is fairly broad, design has a myriad of specifications that professionals utilize in their fields.

Major examples of design are [[blueprint|architectural blueprints]], [[engineering drawing]]s, [[business process]]es, [[circuit diagram]]s, and [[Pattern (sewing)|sewing patterns]]&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary meanings in the [//dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/design Cambridge Dictionary of American English], at [//www.dictionary.com/browse/design Dictionary.com] (esp. meanings 1–5 and 7–8) and at [//en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/design AskOxford] (esp. verbs).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design as a process{{anchor|Process}}==
Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs. Kees Dorst and Judith Dijkhuis, both designers themselves, argued that "there are many ways of describing design processes" and discussed "two basic and fundamentally different ways",&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Dijkhuis 1995, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called "the rational model",&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "technical problem solving"&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"&gt;Schön 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and "the reason-centric perspective".&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"&gt;Ralph 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative view has been called "reflection-in-action",&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"/&gt; "evolutionary design",&lt;ref name="design theory"/&gt; "co-evolution",&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Cross 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and "the action-centric perspective".&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt;

===The rational model===
The rational model was independently developed by [[Herb Simon|Herbert A. Simon]],&lt;ref&gt;Newell and Simon 1972; Simon 1969&lt;/ref&gt; an American scientist, and Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz, two German engineering design theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl and Beitz 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that:
# designers attempt to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] a design candidate for known [[constraint optimization|constraints]] and [[Goal|objectives]],
# the design process is plan-driven,
# the design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages.

The rational model is based on a [[Rationalism|rationalist philosophy]]&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; and underlies the [[waterfall model]],&lt;ref&gt;Royce 1970&lt;/ref&gt; [[systems development life cycle]],&lt;ref&gt;Bourque and Dupuis 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and much of the [[engineering design]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner.

====Example sequence of stages====
Typical stages consistent with the rational model include the following:
* Pre-production design
** [[Design brief]] or ''[[Parti pris]]''&amp;nbsp;– an early (often the beginning) statement of design goals
** [[Analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– analysis of current design goals
** [[Research]]&amp;nbsp;– investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
** [[Specification]]&amp;nbsp;– specifying requirements of a design solution for a product ([[product design specification]])&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N., 2006. T211 Design and Designing: Block 2, p. 99. Milton Keynes: The Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; or service.
** [[Problem solving]]&amp;nbsp;– [[wikt:conceptualize|conceptualizing]] and [[document]]ing design solutions
** [[Presentation]]&amp;nbsp;– presenting design solutions
* Design during production
** [[Product development|Development]]&amp;nbsp;– continuation and improvement of a designed solution
** Testing&amp;nbsp;– ''[[in situ]]'' testing of a designed solution
* Post-production design feedback for future designs
** [[Implementation]]&amp;nbsp;– introducing the designed solution into the environment
** [[Evaluation]] and [[logical consequence|conclusion]]&amp;nbsp;– summary of process and results, including [[constructive criticism]] and suggestions for future improvements
* Redesign&amp;nbsp;– any or all stages in the design process repeated (with corrections made) at any time before, during, or after production.

Each stage has many associated [[best practices]].&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, David G. (2009) The Mechanical Design Process, Mc Graw Hill, 4th edition {{ISBN|0-07-297574-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of the rational model====
The rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds:

# Designers do not work this way&amp;nbsp;– extensive empirical evidence has demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests.&lt;ref name="Cross 1983"&gt;Cross et al. 1992; Ralph 2010; Schön 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unrealistic assumptions&amp;nbsp;– goals are often unknown when a design project begins, and the requirements and constraints continue to change.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks 2010; McCracken and Jackson 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

===The action-centric model===
The action-centric perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated concepts, which are antithetical to the rational model.&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt; It posits that:

# designers use [[creativity]] and [[emotion]] to generate design candidates,
# the design process is [[Improvisation|improvised]],
# no universal sequence of stages is apparent&amp;nbsp;– analysis, design and implementation are contemporary and inextricably linked&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt;

The action-centric perspective is based on an [[Empiricism|empiricist philosophy]] and broadly consistent with the [[Agile software development|agile approach]]&lt;ref&gt;Beck et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and amethodical development.&lt;ref&gt;Truex et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers.&lt;ref name="Cross 1983"/&gt; Like the rational model, the action-centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge. However, research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the judgment and common sense of designers&amp;nbsp;– by designers "thinking on their feet"&amp;nbsp;– more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated by the rational model.

====Descriptions of design activities====
At least two views of design activity are consistent with the action-centric perspective. Both involve three basic activities.

In the [[Reflective practice|reflection-in-action paradigm]], designers alternate between "[[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]", "making moves", and "evaluating moves". "Framing" refers to conceptualizing the problem, i.e., defining goals and objectives. A "move" is a tentative design decision. The evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design.&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"/&gt;

In the sensemaking–coevolution–implementation framework, designers alternate between its three titular activities. [[Sensemaking (information science)|Sensemaking]] includes both framing and evaluating moves. Implementation is the process of constructing the design object. Coevolution is "the process where the design agent simultaneously refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of the context, and vice versa".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph 2010, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the [[design cycle]] is understood as a circular time structure,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fischer: ''Design Enigma. A typographical metaphor for enigmatic processes, including designing'', in: T. Fischer, K. De Biswas, J.J. Ham, R. Naka, W.X. Huang, Beyond Codes and Pixels: Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, p. 686&lt;/ref&gt; which may start with the thinking of an idea, then expressing it by the use of visual or verbal means of communication (design tools), the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea, and finally starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea. Anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression, which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Anderson: ''Architectural Design'', Basics Architecture 03, Lausanne, AVA academia, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-940411-26-9}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophies and studies of design==
There are countless philosophies for guiding design as design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different schools of thought{{which|date=February 2018}} and among practicing designers.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. A design goal may range from solving the least significant individual problem of the smallest element, to the most [[holistic]] influential [[utopian]] goals. Design goals are usually for guiding design. However, conflicts over immediate and minor goals may lead to questioning the purpose of design, perhaps to set better long term or ultimate goals.  John Heskett, a 20th-century British writer on design claimed, "Design, stripped to its essence, can be defined as the human nature to shape and make our environment in ways without precedent in nature, to serve our needs and give meaning to our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heskett|first1=John|title=Toothpicks and Logos: Design in Everyday Life|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophies for guiding design===
Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. Reflections on [[material culture]] and environmental concerns ([[sustainable design]]) can guide a design philosophy. One example is the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]] which was launched within the graphic design community and states "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication&amp;nbsp;– a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."&lt;ref name="maxbruinsma.nl"&gt;[http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm First Things First 2000 a design manifesto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219160927/http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |date=2011-12-19 }}. manifesto published jointly by 33 signatories in: Adbusters, the AIGA journal, Blueprint, Emigre, Eye, Form, Items fall 1999/spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Sciences of the Artificial'' by polymath [[Herbert A. Simon]], the author asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. "Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process of design."&lt;ref name="Herbert A. Simon 1996"&gt;Simon (1996), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approaches to design===
A design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer. A combination of approaches may be used if they don't conflict.

Some popular approaches include:
* [[Sociotechnical system]] design, a philosophy and tools for participative designing of work arrangements and supporting processes - for organizational purpose, quality, safety, economics and customer requirements in core work processes, the quality of peoples experience at work and the needs of society
* [[KISS principle]], (Keep it Simple Stupid), which strives to eliminate unnecessary complications.
* [[There is more than one way to do it]] (TIMTOWTDI), a philosophy to allow multiple methods of doing the same thing.
* [[Use-centered design]], which focuses on the goals and tasks associated with the use of the artifact, rather than focusing on the end user.
* [[User-centered design]], which focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact.
* [[Critical design]] uses designed artifacts as an embodied critique or commentary on existing values, morals, and practices in a culture.
* [[Service design]] designing or organizing the experience around a product and the service associated with a product's use.
* [[Transgenerational design]], the practice of making products and environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily living.
* Speculative design, the speculative design process doesn't necessarily define a specific problem to solve, but establishes a provocative starting point from which a design process emerges. The result is an evolution of fluctuating iteration and reflection using designed objects to provoke questions and stimulate discussion in academic and research settings.
* [[Participatory design|Participatory Design]] (originally co-operative design, now often co-design) is the practice of collective creativity to design, attempting to actively involve all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. Participatory design is an approach which is focused on processes and procedures of design and is not a design style&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://studiolab.ide.tudelft.nl/manila/gems/contextmapping/PreprintDraft.pdf|title=Co-creation and the new landscape of design|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of designing===
{{Main article|Design methods}}
Design methods is a broad area that focuses on:
* [[Exploring]] possibilities and constraints by focusing critical thinking skills to research and define problem spaces for existing [[Product (business)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]]—or the creation of new categories (see also [[Brainstorming]])
* [[Definition|Redefining]] the specifications of design solutions which can lead to better guidelines for traditional design activities (graphic, industrial, architectural, etc.);
* [[Management|Managing]] the process of exploring, defining, creating artifacts continually over time
* [[Prototyping]] possible scenarios, or solutions that incrementally or significantly improve the inherited situation
* Trendspotting; understanding the trend process.

==Terminology==
The word "design" is often considered ambiguous, as it is applied in varying contexts.
[[File:M-T4.jpg|thumb|166px|left|The new terminal at [[Barajas airport]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]

===Design and art===
Today, the term design is widely associated with the [[applied arts]] as initiated by [[Raymond Loewy]] and teachings at the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Ulm School of Design]] (HfG Ulm) in Germany during the 20th century.

The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. [[Applied arts]] has been used as an umbrella term to define fields of [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[fashion design]], etc. The term '[[decorative arts]]' is a traditional term used in historical discourses to describe craft objects, and also sits within the umbrella of [[applied arts]]. In [[graphic art]]s (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration), the distinction is often made between [[fine art]] and [[commercial art]], based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded.

To a degree, some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared across the disciplines within the [[applied arts]] and [[fine art]]. Mark Getlein, writer, suggests the principles of design are "almost instinctive", "built-in", "natural", and part of "our sense of 'rightness'."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Getlein, ''Living With Art'', 8th ed. (New York: 2008) 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly.

[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to design, with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]

===Design and engineering===
In [[engineering]], design is a component of the engineering process. Many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing [[Product design]], [[Industrial design]] and [[Engineering]]. The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] defines design as: ''"To conceive or fashion in the mind; invent,"'' and ''"To formulate a plan"'', and defines engineering as: ''"The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems."''.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (APA): [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108172005/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design |date=2007-01-08 }}. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved January 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (APA): [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/engineering engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102052421/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/engineering |date=2007-01-02 }}. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved January 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Both are forms of problem-solving with a defined distinction being the application of "scientific and mathematical principles". The increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice, however, has raised the importance of more new "human-centered" fields of design.&lt;ref&gt;Faste 2001&lt;/ref&gt; How much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered "[[science]]". Along with the question of what is considered science, there is [[social science]] versus [[natural science]]. Scientists at [[Xerox PARC]] made the distinction of design versus engineering at "moving minds" versus "moving atoms" (probably in contradiction to the origin of term "engineering - engineer" from Latin "in genio" in meaning of a "genius" what assumes existence of a "mind" not of an "atom").

[[File:Aluminium MacBook.png|thumb|166px|left|[[Jonathan Ive]] has received several awards for his design of [[Apple Inc.]] products like this MacBook. In some design fields, [[personal computer]]s are also used for both design and production]]

===Design and production===
The relationship between design and [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] is one of planning and executing. In theory, the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process. Design involves problem-solving and [[creativity]]. In contrast, production involves a routine or pre-planned process. A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers. In some cases, it may be unnecessary or impractical to expect a designer with a broad [[multidisciplinary]] knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed [[Division of labour|specialized]] knowledge of how to produce the product.

Design and production are intertwined in many [[creative professional]] careers, meaning problem-solving is part of execution and the reverse. As the cost of rearrangement increases, the need for separating design from production increases as well. For example, a high-budget project, such as a [[skyscraper]], requires separating (design) [[architect]]ure from (production) [[construction]]. A Low-budget project, such as a [[Multifunction printer|locally printed]] office party invitation [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]], can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper, a few drops of ink, and less than one hour's pay of a [[desktop publishing|desktop publisher]].

This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a production position (e.g. [[production artist]], [[construction worker]]) with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition (copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity or problem-solving skills from the designer.

[[File:BPMN-DiscussionCycle.jpg|thumb|An example of a business workflow process using [[Business Process Model and Notation]].]]

===Process design===
{{See also|Business process management|Method engineering}}
"Process design" (in contrast to "design process" mentioned [[#Design as a process|above]]) refers to the planning of routine steps of a process aside from the expected result. Processes (in general) are treated as a product of design, not the method of design. The term originated with the industrial [[Process design (chemical engineering)|designing of]] [[chemical process]]es. With the increasing complexities of the [[information age]], consultants and executives have found the term useful to describe the [[Business process modeling|design of business processes]] as well as [[manufacturing|manufacturing processes]].

The '''Dublin Fringe Festival''' is an annual curated arts festival in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]. The festival allows artists to submit their work via an application which is subsequently reviewed by the programme manager.{{fact|date=December 2017}} The festival is open to both Irish and international participants.

The festival started in 1995 and expanded into a sixteen-day festival, annually held in September and focuses on new and emerging artists.{{fact|date=December 2017}} The Dublin Fringe has live entertainment as well as performances in dance, theatre, live art, visual art, and music.

To attract aspiring artists, the fringe runs workshops throughout the festival to teach a variety of skills such as tassel swirling, [[hip hop]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], and others.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==History==
Originating in 1995, Bedrock Productions, with some support from the established [[Dublin Theatre Festival]] and Arts office of Dublin City Council, created the Dublin Fringe Festival, to "promote and showcase the work of small and vibrant theatre companies and theatre makers".{{fact|date=December 2017}} In the first year, [[Conor McPherson]]'s ''This Lime Tree Bower'' premiered, and in 1996 [[Enda Walsh]]'s ''Disco Pigs'' took off from The International Bar.

Directors who have presented works at the festival have included Jimmy Fay (1995-1996), Ali Curran (1997-2000), Vallejo Gantner (2001 -2005), Wolfgang Hoffmann (2006-2007), Roise Goan (2008-2013),&lt;ref name="roise" /&gt; and Kris Nelson (since 2014).{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Successful works from past Fringe Festivals have included early plays by Conor McPherson, Enda Walsh, Owen McCafferty, Corn Exchange, Loose Canon, Pan Pan Theatre Company, Semper Fi, Anu Productions,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and [[Eva O'Connor]].&lt;ref name="RTE 30 December 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last= O'Connor |first= Eva| title= Eva O'Connor on turning mental health experiences into art |url= https://www.rte.ie/culture/2016/1223/840992-first-fortnight-eva-oconnor/| date= 30 December 2016|website= www.rte.ie |publisher= [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]| location= Dublin| accessdate=31 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==
Each performance takes place in a venue which is deemed most suitable to the show. This can range from a number of cafes and theatres, as well as less traditional venues such as the Liffey Boardwalk or on a Dublin bus.

For a number of years until 2009, The Spiegeltent was a major part of the festival. This tent was erected in several sites including at [[Georges Dock]]. The Dublin Fringe Festival and Spiegeltent have attracted numerous shows, including the cabaret/variety show [[La Clique]].

== Sponsors ==
Past sponsors include [[Absolut vodka]] who sponsored the events between 2009 and 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinksindustryireland.ie/article.aspx?id%3D1471 |publisher = drinksindustryireland.ie |title=Absolut’s 2nd Dublin Fringe sponsorship |accessdate=2013-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145538/http://www.drinksindustryireland.ie/article.aspx?id=1471 |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a four-year deal.&lt;ref name="roise"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/how-r%C3%B3ise-goan-grew-the-fringe-1.1515922 | quote = ''one condition of a four-year title sponsorship was to sacrifice a portion of its identity (Absolut Fringe)'' | title = How Róise Goan grew the Fringe | publisher = Irish Times | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130905092945/http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/how-r%C3%B3ise-goan-grew-the-fringe-1.1515922 | archivedate = 5 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erik D. Demaine''' (born 28 February 1981) is a [[professor]] of [[Computer Science]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and a former [[child prodigy]].

== Early life and education ==
Demaine was born in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], to artist sculptor [[Martin L. Demaine]] and Judy Anderson. From the age of 7, he was identified as a child prodigy and spent time traveling across  [[North America]] with his father.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101327,00.html|title=Calculating Change: Why Origami Is Critical to New Drugs: The Folded Universe|last=Kher|first=Unmesh|date=2005-09-04|publisher=TIME|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[homeschooling|home-schooled]] during that time span until entering university at the age of 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F1C278D90533407&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Road Scholar Finds Home at MIT|last=Barry|first=Ellen|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2002-02-17|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2003/demaine-0226.html|title=Prodigy prof skipped school until he started college at 12|last=Nadis|first=Steve|publisher=New Scientist|date=2003-01-18|accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demaine completed his [[bachelor's degree]] at 14 years old at [[Dalhousie University]] in Canada, and completed his [[PhD]] at the [[University of Waterloo]] by the time he was 20 years old.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/15/science/15origami.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=7c6938eb4b440672&amp;ex=1266210000&amp;partner=rssuserland|title=Origami as the Shape of Things to Come|last=Wertheim|first=Margaret|publisher=The New York Times|date=2005-02-15|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://moreresults.factiva.com/results/index/index.aspx?ref=IRTI000020050819e18j00023|title= Commercial origami starts to take shape|last=O'Brien|first=Danny|publisher=Irish Times|date=2005-08-19|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional accomplishments ==
[[File:Erik Demaine et al 2005 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Erik Demaine (left), Martin Demaine (center), and Bill Spight (right) watch [[John Horton Conway]] demonstrate a card trick (June 2005)]]
Demaine's [[doctorate|PhD]] dissertation, a work in the field of [[computational origami]], was completed at the University of Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-15|url=http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=2852|title= National honour for Demaine|publisher=[[University of Waterloo]]|date=2003-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was awarded the Canadian [[Governor General's Academic Medal|Governor General's Gold Medal]] from the [[University of Waterloo]] and the [[NSERC]] Doctoral Prize (2003) for the best [[thesis|PhD thesis]] and research in Canada. The content of this thesis was later incorporated into a collection of academic works on [[Mathematics of paper folding|geometric folding]] published in 2007.&lt;ref name="GFALOP"&gt;
{{Cite book| last1 = Demaine| first1 = Erik| last2 = O'Rourke| first2 = Joseph| authorlink2 = Joseph O'Rourke (professor)| title = Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra| publisher = Cambridge University Press| date = July 2007| location =| pages = Part II| url = http://www.gfalop.org| doi =| isbn = 978-0-521-85757-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demaine joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2001 at age 20, reportedly the youngest professor in the history of MIT,&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beasley|first=Sandra|title=Knowing when to fold|journal=American Scholar|date=2006-09-22|volume=75|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to full professorship in 2011. Demaine is a member of the [[theory of computation|Theory of Computation]] group at [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]].

[[Mathematical origami]] artwork by Erik and Martin Demaine was part of the ''Design and the Elastic Mind'' exhibit at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 2008, and has been included in the MoMA permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://erikdemaine.org/curved/ Curved Origami Sculpture], Erik and Martin Demaine.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was one of the featured artists in ''[[Between the Folds]]'', an international documentary film about origami practitioners which was later broadcast on [[PBS]] television.  He is president of the board of directors of [[Gathering 4 Gardner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gathering4gardner.org/about/|title=About Gathering 4 Gardner Foundation|journal=Gathering 4 Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
In 2003, Demaine was awarded the [[MacArthur Fellowship]], the so-called "genius grant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neal|first1=Rome|title=Behind The 'Genius Grants'|journal=CBS News|date=October 4, 2003|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/behind-the-genius-grants/|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Demaine received the EATCS [[Presburger Award]] for young scientists. The award citation listed accomplishments including his work on the [[carpenter's rule problem]], [[hinged dissection]], [[prefix sum]] data structures, [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)|competitive analysis]] of [[binary search tree]]s, [[graph minor]]s, and computational [[origami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatcs.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-news/1512-presburger-award-2013|title=Presburger Award 2013| accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was awarded a fellowship by the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/17377-erik-demaine |title=Erik Demaine at the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |accessdate=23 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430160156/http://www.gf.org/fellows/17377-erik-demaine |archivedate=30 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his work on [[bidimensionality]], he was the winner of the [[Nerode Prize]] in 2015 along with his co-authors Fedor Fomin, Mohammad T. Hajiaghayi, and Dimitrios Thilikos. The work was the study of a general technique for developing both [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]] exact algorithms and [[approximation algorithm]]s for a class of algorithmic problems on graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/about-us/news/hajiaghayi-wins-2015-nerode-prize|title=Hajiaghayi Wins 2015 Nerode Prize|date=May 8, 2015|publisher=University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies|accessdate=2015-09-03}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun''' have been held at museums in several countries, notably the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, United States, Canada, Japan, and France.

The [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] had sparked widespread interest in [[ancient Egypt]] when they were [[KV62|discovered between 1922 and 1927]], but most of them remained in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] until the 1960s, when they were first exhibited outside of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Epic"&gt;Melani McAlister, ''Epic Encounters: Culture, Media, and U.S. Interests in the Middle East Since 1945'' (2005), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these exhibitions, relics from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] are among the most travelled artifacts in the world. Probably the best-known tour was the ''Treasures of Tutankhamun'' from 1972 until 1981.

Other exhibitions have included ''Tutankhamun Treasures'' in 1961 and 1967, ''Tutankhamen: The Golden Hereafter'' beginning in 2004, ''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' beginning in 2005, and ''Tutankhamun: The Golden King and the Great Pharaohs'' in 2008. Permanent exhibitions include the ''Tutankhamun Exhibition'' in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], United Kingdom, which contains replicas of many artifacts.

==Ownership and normal display==
[[File:GD-EG-Caire-Musée127.JPG|thumb|One of the golden shrines, now on display in the [[Egyptian Museum]].]]
All of the artifacts exhumed from the Tutankhamun tomb are, by international convention, considered property of the Egyptian government.&lt;ref&gt;Zahi A. Hawass, ''The Golden Age of Tutankhamun: Divine Might and Splendor in the New Kingdom'' (2004), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these pieces are normally kept at the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]; the only way for them to be shown internationally is by approval of Egyptian authorities. Although journalists and government officials generally support the tours, some Egyptians argue that the artifacts should remain on display in their own country, where Egyptian school-children would have greater access to them, and where the museum's exhibit would attract foreign tourists.&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt;

==''TutTreasures'' (1961–67)==
The first travelling exhibition of a substantial number of Tutankhamun artifacts took place from 1961 to 1966. The exhibition, titled ''Tutankhamun Treasures'', initially featured 34 smaller pieces made of gold, alabaster, glass, and similar materials.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;"Tutankhamun Treasures", ''Art international: Volume 6'' (1962), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The portions of the exhibition occurring in the United States were arranged by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and organized by Dr. [[Froelich Rainey]], Director of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], with the assistance of Dr. [[Sarwat Okasha]], Minister of Culture and National Guidance of the [[United Arab Republic]].&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt; The exhibit travelled to 18 cities in the United States and six in Canada.&lt;ref name = Malek&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/4semmel.html| first= Jaromir |last = Malek| title = Some thoughts inspired by a current exhibition:'Tutankhamun: His Tomb and Treasures'| location = Brno, Czech Rep.| date = January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition had a public purpose in mind, to "stimulate public interest in the [[UNESCO]]-sponsored salvage program for Nubian monuments threatened by the [[Aswan Dam]] project".&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Overseas"&gt;Institute of International Education, ''Overseas: Volume 1'' (1961), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition opened in November 1961 at the Smithsonian's [[National Gallery of Art]], in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt;

==''The Treasures of Tutankhamun'' (1972–1981)==
[[File:Tutanchamun Maske.jpg|thumb|right|The iconic [[Tutankhamun's mask|burial mask of Tutankhamun]] was among the most popular pieces in the Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition.]]
The genesis of the ''Treasures of Tutankhamun'' exhibition reflected the changing dynamic of [[Middle-East]] relations.

===United Kingdom===
It was first shown in London at the [[British Museum]] in 1972. After a year of negotiations between Egypt and the United Kingdom, an agreement was signed in July 1971. Altogether, 50 pieces were chosen by the directors of the British Museum and the [[Cairo Museum]] to be shown at the exhibition, including 17 never before displayed outside Egypt. For insurance purposes, the items were valued at £9.06&amp;nbsp;million. In January 1972, they were transported to London on two civilian flights and one by the [[Royal Air Force]], carrying, among other objects, the gold [[Tutankhamun's mask|death mask of Tutankhamun]]. Queen [[Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] officially opened the exhibition on March 29, 1972. More than 30,000 people visited in its first week. By September, 800,000 had been to the exhibition, and its duration was extended by three months because of the popularity. When it did close on December 31, 1972, 1.6&amp;nbsp;million visitors had passed through the exhibition doors. All profits (£600,000) were donated to [[UNESCO]] for conserving the temples at [[Philae]], Egypt.&lt;ref name="zaki"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tutankhamun Exhibition at the British Museum in 1972: A historical perspective|first=Assaad A.|last=Zaki|journal=Journal of Tourism Theory and Research|volume=3|number=2|pages=79-88|year=2017|doi=10.24288/jttr.312180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Treasures of Tutankhamun'' was the most popular exhibition in the museum's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/past_exhibitions/1972/archive_tutankhamun.aspx|title=Treasures of Tutankhamun|publisher=The British Museum|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a landmark achievement in [[Egypt–United Kingdom relations]].&lt;ref name="zaki"/&gt; The exhibition moved on to other countries, including the USSR, US, Canada, and West Germany.

===United States===
Egyptian cultural officials initially stalled prospects of an American tour, as Egypt was then more closely aligned with the Soviet Union, where fifty pieces had toured in 1973.&lt;ref name="Epic"/&gt; However, relations thawed later that year when the U.S. interceded on Egypt's behalf to prevent the total destruction of Egypt's [[Third Army (Egypt)|Third Army]] during a military conflict with [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Epic"/&gt; U.S. president [[Richard Nixon]] thereafter visited Egypt, becoming the first American President to do so since the [[Second World War]], and personally prevailed upon Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] to permit the artifacts to tour the United States – with the U.S. tour including one more city than the Soviet tour had included, and several additional pieces.&lt;ref name="Epic"/&gt; The showing was the largest of Tutankhamun's artifacts, with 53 pieces.&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt; 

[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] organized the U.S. exhibition, which ran from November 17, 1976, through September 30, 1979. More than eight million attended.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, ''Classical Bearings: Interpreting Ancient History and Culture'' (1998), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan's exhibition was designed to recreate for visitors the drama of the 1922 discovery of the treasure-filled tomb. Included along with original objects excavated from the tomb were reprints from [[glass plate]] negatives in the Metropolitan’s collection of the expedition photographer [[Harry Burton (Egyptologist)|Harry Burton]]'s photographs documenting the excavation's discoveries step by step.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/MacManus_Tutankhamun_records_b18131165.pdf Finding aid for the Irvine MacManus records related to "Treasures of Tutankhamun" exhibition, 1975-1979] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian described the exhibit as one of the initial "blockbuster exhibits" which sparked the museum community's interest in such exhibitions.&lt;ref name = SIMarket/&gt;

After the six U.S. tour locations were named, San Francisco citizens bombarded the Mayor's Office with inquiries as to why the tour was not coming there. As a result, museum trustees flew to Egypt to meet with the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo, where they worked out a mutual agreement for a seventh stop. Profits after exhibition expenses resulted in $10+ million going to the Egyptian Museum for refurbishing.&lt;ref name="Tut in SF"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[David P.

While the exhibition was on display in San Francisco, Police Lieutenant George E. LaBrash suffered a minor stroke as he guarded the treasures after hours. He later filed a [[lawsuit]] against the city on the theory that his injury had resulted from the legendary [[Curse of the pharaohs]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081360,00.html Chatter]", ''[[People Magazine]]'', Vol. 17, No. 4 (February 1, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' (2004-2011)==
Originally entitled ''Tutankhamen: The Golden Hereafter'', this exhibition is made up of fifty artifacts from Tutenkhamun's tomb as well as seventy funerary goods from other [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] tombs. The tour of the exhibition began in 2004 in [[Basel, Switzerland]] and went to [[Bonn, Germany]] on the second leg. The European tour was organized by the Art and Exhibition Hall of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA), and the Egyptian Museum in cooperation with the [[Antikenmuseum Basel]] and [[Sammlung Ludwig]]. [[Deutsche Telekom]] sponsored the Bonn exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/716/he1.htm |title=Under Tut's spell |work=Al-Ahram Weekly |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' consists of the same items from the Germany and Switzerland tour but in a slightly different exhibition. Of the 50 artifacts from the Tutankhamun tomb fewer than ten were repeated from the 1970s exhibition. This exhibition began in 2005, and was directed by Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, together with Arts and Exhibitions International and [[National Geographic Society|the National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref name="AEI"&gt;

===Exhibition overview===
The initial American leg of the ''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' exhibition attracted estimated three million visitors, and was displayed in the following venues:
*[[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] – June 16 to November 15, 2005
*[[Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale]] – December 15, 2005 to April 23, 2006
*[[Field Museum of Natural History]] – May 26, 2006 to January 1, 2007
*[[Franklin Institute]] – February 3 to September 30, 2007

From November 15, 2007, to August 31, 2008, the exhibition was shown in [[The O2 (London)|The O2]], London. It then stayed for eight months in [[Dallas]], Texas, at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] (October 2008 – May 2009), and for nine months at the [[De Young Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] from June 27, 2009 to March 28, 2010. From April 23, 2010, to January 11, 2011, the exhibition was shown at the [[Discovery Times Square Exposition]] in New York City.

In 2011 the exhibition visited Australia for the first time, opening at the [[Melbourne Museum]] in April for its only Australian stop where it achieved the highest touring exhibition box office numbers in the country's history before Egypt's treasures return to Cairo in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingtutmelbourne.com.au/home.html |title=Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs |publisher=Kingtutmelbourne.com.au |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/whatson/coming-soon/tutankhamun |title=Melbourne Museum: Tutankhamun |publisher=Museumvictoria.com.au |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-06/tutankhamun-exhibition-smashes-box-office-records/3714930 |title=Tutankhamun exhibition smashes box office record|publisher= ABC News |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artifacts on display===
''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' displays actual items excavated from tombs of ancient Egyptian Pharaohs. From 130 authentic artifacts presented, 50 were found specifically during the excavations of Tutankhamun's tomb. The exhibition includes 80 exhibits from the reigns of Tutankhamun's immediate predecessors in the Eighteenth dynasty, such as [[Hatshepsut]], whose trade policies greatly increased the wealth of that dynasty and enabled the lavish wealth of Tutankhamun's burial artifacts. Other items were taken from other royal graves of the 18th Dynasty (dating 1555 [[BCE]] to 1305 [[BCE]]) spanning Pharaohs [[Amenhotep II]], [[Amenhotep III]] and [[Thutmose IV]], among others. Items from the largely intact tomb of [[Yuya]] and [[Tjuyu]] (King Tut's great-grandparents; the parents of [[Tiye]] who was the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]]) are also included. [[Yuya]] and [[Tjuyu]]'s tomb was one of the most celebrated historical finds in the Valley of the Kings until Howard Carter's discovery in 1922. This exhibition does not include either the gold death mask that was a popular exhibit from ''The Treasures of Tutankhamun'' exhibition, or the mummy itself. The Egyptian Government has determined that these artifacts are too fragile to withstand travel, and thus they will permanently remain in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article409075.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12|title=CT scan may solve Tutankhamun death riddle|author=Jenny Booth|work=The Times |location=UK |date=January 6, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mummy of Tutankhamun is the only known mummy in the Valley Of The Kings to still lie in its original tomb, [[KV62]].

===History===
''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' was expected to draw more than three million people.&lt;ref name="AEI"/&gt; The exhibition started in Los Angeles, California, then moved to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], Florida, [[Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia]]. The exhibition then moved to London&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/tutankhamun/article2624036.ece Return of the King (''Times Online'')] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616044834/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/tutankhamun/article2624036.ece |date=June 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before finally returning to Egypt in August 2008. Subsequent events have propelled an encore of the exhibition in the United States, beginning with the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] in October 2008 which hosted the exhibition until May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dallasmuseumofart.org/Dallas_Museum_of_Art/index.htm |title=Dallas Museum of Art Website |publisher=Dallasmuseumofart.org |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tour continued to other U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ilm6sCZestVa2WGI2D5pyovNphdA Tut Exhibit to Return to US Next Year]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026035620/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ilm6sCZestVa2WGI2D5pyovNphdA |date=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dallas the exhibition moved to the [[de Young Museum]] in [[San Francisco]], to be followed by the [[Discovery Times Square Exposition]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famsf.org/tut/ |title=Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs, King Tut Returns to San Francisco, June 27, 2009 – March 28, 2010 |publisher=Famsf.org |accessdate=July 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120032414/http://famsf.org/tut/ |archivedate=January 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Tutankhamun: The Golden King and the Great Pharaohs'' (2008-2013)==
This exhibition, featuring completely different artifacts to those in ''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'', first ran at the Ethnological Museum in Vienna from March 9 to September 28, 2008 under the title ''Tutankhamun and the World of the Pharaohs''. It featured a further 140 treasures from the Valley of the Kings including objects from the tomb of King Tut. The exhibition continued with the following itinerary:

* [[Atlanta Civic Center]] (November 15, 2008 to May 22, 2009), Atlanta, Georgia
* [[Indianapolis Children's Museum]] (June 25 to October 25, 2009), Indianapolis, Indiana
* [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] (November 20, 2009 to May 2, 2010), Toronto, Ontario, Canada

==Exhibitions of replicas==
Several exhibitions have been established which feature replicas of Tutankhamun artifacts, rather than real artifacts from archaeological sites.&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt; These provide access to pieces of comparable appearance to viewers living in places where the real artifacts have not circulated. The first replica exhibition, a copy of the entire tomb of Tutankhamun, was built only a few years after the discovery of the tomb. This replica was temporary, staged by Arthur Weigall for the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley]], in 1924.&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt; Modern replica exhibitions exist in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], Dorset, England, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada, United States, and even in [[Cairo]], Egypt (where the replica exhibition is intended to reduce the overwhelming traffic to the real locations).&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt; A travelling exhibition of replicas titled ''Tutankhamun: His Tomb and Treasures'', featuring several hundred pieces, has been shown in [[Zürich]], [[Brno]], Munich, and [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt;

===Tutankhamun Exhibition, Dorchester===
The ''Tutankhamun Exhibition'' in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], Dorset, England, is a permanent exhibition set up in 1986 by  Michael Ridley as a re-creation of the tomb of the ancient Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]]. The exhibition does not display any of the actual treasures of Tutankhamun, but all artifacts are recreated to be exact facsimiles of the actual items. Original materials have been used where possible, including gold. The story line is based around the famous English archaeologist [[Howard Carter]]. The Exhibition reveals history from Carter's point of view as he entered the tomb in [[Valley of the Kings]] in November 1922.

==== Exhibition sections ====
*The entry section of the Exhibition displays general information about Tutankhamun's life and death.
*[[Tutankhamun's mummy]]. A life-size model of the mummy is displayed. The exhibitors claim that it took more than two years to recreate the mummy. X-ray pictures taken from the real mummy helped to make an exact copy.
*The ante-chamber contains replicas of furniture and Tutankhamun's personal items he had been buried with.
*The burial chamber exhibits replicas of the sarcophagus and coffin of Tutankhamun.
*The Treasure Hall shows recreations of statues and jewels found within the tomb of Tutankhamun. [[Anubis Shrine|Sitting statue of Anubis]], the Golden Throne, Gold Death Mask and statue of guardian goddess [[Selkit]] are displayed among other items.

=== ''Discovering Tutankhamun'' Exhibition, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford===
The ''Discovering Tutankhamun'' exhibition at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford, England, was a temporary exhibition, open from July until November 2014, exploring [[Howard Carter]]’s excavation of the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] in 1922. Original records, drawings and photographs from the [[Griffith Institute]] are on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashmolean Museum|url=http://www.ashmolean.org/exhibitions/discovertut/|work=Ashmolean website|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete records of the ten year excavation of the tomb of Tutankhamun were deposited in the [[Griffith Institute]] Archive at the [[University of Oxford]] shortly after Carter's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Griffith Institute Archive|url=http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/discoveringTut/|work=Griffith Institute Archive|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A replica death mask was displayed along with replicas of other items from the tomb.

'''Flora Caroline Twort''' (24 June 1893 &amp;ndash; 1985) was an English painter who specialised in [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]s and [[pastel]]s of the scenes and people of [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]], [[Hampshire]].

==Biography==
Twort was born on 24 June 1893 in [[Yeovil]], [[Somerset]]. Her parents were [[Albert Samuel Twort]] and Jane Rapley.&lt;ref name=Birth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldconnect.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=turte_twort&amp;id=P972 |title=Ancestry chart of John Turte &amp; Katerina Holmsby |publisher=Rootsweb |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twort began painting at the age of four, and was educated at the [[South Hampstead High School]],&lt;ref&gt;Who was Flora Twort?, HantsWeb biography&lt;/ref&gt; [[London School of Art]], the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]] and the [[Slade School of Art]]. At the end of [[World War I]] she moved to Petersfield, where she ran a secondhand bookshop at Numbers 1 and 2 The Square, in partnership with two other young women. The shop also sold handmade jewellery, pottery and textiles and gained a reputation as one of the finest book shops in the South of England. In 1934 she joined the [[Society of Women Artists]].&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Jean H |date=1998 |title=Famous Women of Hampshire |publisher=Happy Walking International |pages=34-35 |isbn=1874754675}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Her studio was above this shop until 1948, when the three partners decided to give up the shop and Twort moved to a studio in the nearby Church Path. Her work was exhibited in the [[Royal Academy]] and other London galleries, and she continued to paint until she was 81.

Her pictures, usually watercolours, typically contain local scenes of Petersfield which are filled with people and animals, with such subjects as The Square on Market Day, or the fair on Petersfield Heath. She also produced drawings in pencil, crayon, charcoal and pastel, including some fine portraits.

Twort was a friend of [[Nevil Shute]], who in 1925 proposed marriage to her, unsuccessfully, though they remained lifelong friends &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevilshute.org/TimeLine/timeline1921-1930.php Timeline 1921-1930], Neville Shute Norway Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; and she became godmother to his daughter Shirley Anne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevilshute.org/TimeLine/timeline1931-1940.php Timeline 1931-1940], Neville Shute Norway Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; For a short period in 1939, Shute and his family lived at The Old Mill at [[Langstone, Hampshire|Langstone]], which she owned.

On her death she bequeathed her studio cottage and pictures to [[Hampshire County Council]]. A selection of her pictures is now displayed in her old studios, which have become the 
[[Flora Twort Gallery]]; the selection is changed twice per year. Hampshire County Council has also put 600 of her pictures online.

'''''Freedom Writers''''' is a  2007 [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Richard LaGravenese]] and starring [[Hilary Swank]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Imelda Staunton]], [[Patrick Dempsey]] and [[Mario (American singer)|Mario]].

It is based on the book ''[[The Freedom Writers Diary]]'' by teacher [[Erin Gruwell]] who wrote the story based on [[Woodrow Wilson Classical High School]] in Long Beach, California. The movie is also based on the DC program called City at Peace.  The title is a play on the term "[[Freedom Riders]]", referring to the multiracial [[civil rights]] activists who tested the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ordering the [[desegregation]] of interstate buses in 1961.

The idea for the film came from journalist Tracey Durning, who made a documentary about Erin Gruwell for the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Primetime Live]]''. Durning served as co-executive producer of the film. The film was dedicated to the memory of Armand Jones, who was killed after wrapping up ''Freedom Writers''. He was 18 and was shot to death in [[Anaheim, California]] after a confrontation with a man who robbed Jones of a necklace in a [[Denny's]] restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2012/07/14/actors-death-eerily-similar-to-film-role/|title=Actor's death eerily similar to film role|work=[[Orange County Register]]|date=July 14, 2012|access-date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1994, in Long Beach, California, Erin Gruwell ([[Hilary Swank]]) has been accepted to teach English for at-risk students at Woodrow Wilson High School, a once highly acclaimed school, but where racial tensions have increased since the [[Los Angeles riot of 1992|Los Angeles Riots]] two years prior. Erin struggles to connect to her students and she experiences numerous fights between some students, who are in rival gangs.

One night, Eva Benitez ([[April L. Hernandez]]), her boyfriend, and a friend go to a convenience store. Sindy ([[Jaclyn Ngan]]), a Cambodian refugee, frequents the same convenience store. Grant Rice (Armand Jones), an African-American student at Woodrow Wilson, frustrated at losing an arcade game, demands a refund from the store owner. As Grant storms out of the store, Eva's boyfriend, Paco (as retaliation for losing a fight against Grant that took place earlier during a gang fight at Woodrow Wilson), attempts a drive-by shooting to kill Grant, but misses accidentally killing Sindy's boyfriend. As a witness, Eva must testify at court; she intends to guard "her own" in her testimony.

At school, Gruwell intercepts a racist drawing by one of her high school students and utilizes it to teach them about the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], most of whom have no knowledge of. She gradually begins to earn their trust and buys them composition books to record their diaries, in which they talk about their experiences of being abused, seeing their friends die, and being evicted. Determined to reform her high school students, Gruwell takes on two part-time jobs to pay for more books and spends a lot more time at school, much to the disappointment of her husband ([[Patrick Dempsey]]). Her students start to behave with respect and discover a lot more. A transformation is specifically visible in one student, Marcus ([[Jason Finn (actor)|Jason Finn]]). Gruwell invites various Jewish Holocaust survivors to talk with her class about their experiences and requires the students to attend a field trip to the [[Museum of Tolerance]]. Meanwhile, her unique training methods are scorned by her colleagues and department chair Margaret Campbell ([[Imelda Staunton]]).

The following school year comes, and Gruwell teaches her class (now sophomores) again, making it the second year that she is their teacher. On the first day of semester, Gruwell makes her class do a "Toast for Change", allowing everyone to open up about their struggles and what they wish to change about themselves. Later on, the class makes enough money to have [[Miep Gies]] to arrive to the United States and tell her experience when she helped [[Anne Frank]], her family, and the Van Pels hide from the [[Nazis]]; she then also persuades the students that they are heroes and that they "within their own small ways, [can] turn on a small light in a dark room." These two events inspire Eva to break free of the demands of her father to always protect her own rather than tell the truth. At Grant's trial, she shocks the courtroom by revealing that Paco actually killed Sindy's boyfriend in the store; Grant is spared of being convicted and Sindy later forgives Eva. On leaving the court, Eva is attacked and threatened but ultimately spared by members of her gang and ends up going to live with her aunt in order to keep herself safe.

Meanwhile, Gruwell asks her students to write their diaries in book form. She compiles the entries and names it ''The Freedom Writers Diary''. Her husband divorces her and Margaret tells her she cannot teach her kids for their junior year. Gruwell fights this decision, eventually convincing the superintendent to permit her to teach her kids during their junior and senior years, much to their elation. The film ends with a note that Gruwell successfully prepared numerous high school students to graduate high school and attend college, for many the first in their families to do so.

==Reception==
''Freedom Writers'' has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] provides links to 124 reviews, 70% of which are positive. The critical consensus is that "''Freedom Writers'' is a frank, formulaic entry in the inspirational inner-city teacher genre, with an energetic Hilary Swank leading the appealing cast of unknowns."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|freedom_writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean|weighted average]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 64/100 based on 29 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom Writers|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/freedom-writers|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cynthia Fuchs of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the film three out of five stars, writing in her review that "the plot is predictable, the actors too old to play high school students, and the pacing too slow. And really, the camera circles around deep-thinking faces a few too many times. But ''Freedom Writers'' also argues for listening to teenagers. That in itself makes it a rare and close-to-wonderful thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom Writers|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/freedom-writers|publisher=Common Sense Media|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received a positive rating from ''Fox Weekly'', giving the film a 9 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: ‘Freedom Writers’ (2007)|url=http://foxweekly.com/2014/03/28/reviews/review-freedom-writers-2007.html|publisher=Fox Weekly|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle''''' (c. 1531-1532) is a painting by the Italian late [[Renaissance]] artist [[Antonio da Correggio]]. It is housed in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]],  [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

The work was part of a series executed by Correggio for [[Federico II Gonzaga]] in [[Mantua]], about the loves of [[Jupiter]].

==History==
The series of Jupiter's Loves was conceived after the success of ''[[Venus and Cupid with a Satyr]]''. Correggio painted four canvasses in total, although others had been programmed perhaps.

In the first edition of his ''Lives'', late Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] mentions only two of the paintings, ''[[Leda (Correggio)|Leda]]'' (today at the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]) and one ''Venus'' (presumably the ''[[Danae (Correggio)|Danae]]'' currently  in the [[Borghese Gallery]] of [[Rome]]), although he knew them only from descriptions provided by [[Giulio Romano]]. Vasari mentions that the commissioner, Duke Federico II Gonzaga, wanted to donate the works to emperor and King of Spain [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]: the fact that the other two works, the ''Ganymede'' and ''Jupiter and Io'', were in Spain during the 16th century implies that they were part of the same series. British art historian [[Cecil Gould]] suggested that Federico had commissioned the ''Io'' and ''Ganymede'' for himself, and that they were ceded to Charles V only after the duke's death in 1540, perhaps on occasion of the marriage of the king's son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]];&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{cite book|first=Cecil |last=Gould|authorlink = Cecil Gould|title=The paintings of Correggio|location=London |year=1976|pages= 130–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; others hypothesized that Federico ordered them for the Ovid room in his [[Palazzo Te]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Egon |last=Verheyen|title=Correggio's Amori di Giove|journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes|volume=XXIX |year=1966|pages=160–192|doi=10.2307/750714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603–1604 the painting was acquired by emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] together with [[Parmigianino]]'s ''[[Cupid Making His Arch]]'', and sent to [[Prague]]. The canvas was in Vienna since as early as the 1610s, when it is mentioned in the Habsburg imperial collections together with ''Io''.&lt;ref name=Gould/&gt;

In mathematics, any [[Lagrangian system]] generally admits gauge symmetries, though it may happen that they are trivial. In [[theoretical physics]], the notion of [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]] depending on parameter functions is a cornerstone of contemporary [[field theory (physics)|field theory]]. 

A gauge symmetry of a [[Lagrangian system|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a differential operator on some [[fiber bundle|vector bundle]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; taking its values in the linear space of (variational or exact) symmetries of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, a gauge symmetry of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;
depends on sections of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and their partial derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;Giachetta (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, this is the case of gauge symmetries in [[classical field theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Giachetta (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills gauge theory]] and [[gauge gravitation theory]] exemplify classical field theories with gauge symmetries.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel (1980), Eguchi (1980), Marathe (1992), Giachetta (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gauge symmetries possess the following two peculiarities.
# Being Lagrangian symmetries, gauge symmetries of a [[Lagrangian system|Lagrangian]] satisfy [[Noether's theorem|first Noether's theorem]], but the corresponding conserved current &lt;math&gt;J^\mu&lt;/math&gt; takes a particular superpotential form  &lt;math&gt;J^\mu=W^\mu + d_\nu U^{\nu\mu}&lt;/math&gt; where the first term &lt;math&gt; W^\mu&lt;/math&gt; vanishes on solutions of the [[Lagrangian system|Euler–Lagrange equations]] and the second one is a boundary term, where &lt;math&gt; U^{\nu\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is called a superpotential.&lt;ref&gt;Gotay (1992), Fatibene (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
# In accordance with [[Noether's second theorem|second Noether's theorem]], there is one-to-one correspondence between the gauge symmetries of a [[Lagrangian system|Lagrangian]] and the [[Noether identities]] which the [[Lagrangian system|Euler–Lagrange operator]] satisfies. Consequently, gauge symmetries characterize the degeneracy of a [[Lagrangian system]].&lt;ref&gt;Gomis (1995), Giachetta (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that, in [[quantum field theory]], a generating functional fail to be invariant under gauge transformations, and gauge symmetries are replaced with the [[Faddeev–Popov ghost|BRST symmetries]], depending on ghosts and acting both on fields and ghosts.&lt;ref&gt;Gomis (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geguti.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the royal palace of Geguti]] 

'''Geguti''' ({{lang-ka|გეგუთი}}) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] medieval royal palace, now in ruins, at the homonymous village, 7 km south of the city of [[Kutaisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. 

The ruins of the Geguti palace complex occupy the area of over 2,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; along the [[Rioni River]]. An extensive fieldwork between 1953 and 1956 allowed the specialists to stratify the principal archaeological layers and reconstruct the architectural form and decoration of the medieval edifices bulk of which dates to the 12th century, the period when the first written mention of Geguti appears in the Georgian Chronicle. The earliest structure – a plain, one-room building with a large fireplace – dates back to the 8th/9th century. A principal part of the royal complex, commissioned by King [[George III of Georgia]] (r. 1156-1184), is a four-tier brick edifice built onto a three-metre high stone plinth, with its spacious, cruciform central hall surmounted by a dome 14 m in diameter resting on squinches. The entire building is walled and fortified with massive pillars. Westerly located additional structures and a palace church are of a later period, dating to the 13th/14th century. 

The importance of the ruins of the Geguti palace is emphasized by its largely secular nature as most of the surviving monuments of medieval Georgian architecture are churches and monasteries. Records of medieval secular patronage (basically palaces with extensive decorative cycles) exist in the Georgian written sources, although only the shells of castles and the ruins of Geguti survive to testify the extent of the work produced.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner (ed., 1996). ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art|The Dictionary of Art]]'', p. 331. Grove, {{ISBN|1-884446-00-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Geguti reconstruction.JPG|thumb|300px|left|Reconstruction sketch by V. Tsintsadze]]
The main complex of the Geguti royal palace was constructed during what is considered to be medieval Georgia's "[[golden age]]". Although the Georgian court was quite mobile, the establishment of a royal palace of this scale near the kingdom’s second capital and a major cultural center can be understood as the desire to establish a more settled, regal court, and royal bureaucracy which, indeed, reached its climax under the [[queen regnant]] [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] (r. 1184-1213).&lt;ref name="Eastmond"&gt;Antony Eastmond (1998), ''Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia'', pp. 152, 188-190. Penn State Press, {{ISBN|0-271-01628-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geguti palace frequently features in the Georgian annals as a beloved place of rest of the Georgian royalty. In the reign of Tamar, it was the place where her former husband, Prince [[Yuri Bogolyubsky]], was crowned by the rebellious nobles during an abortive coup against the queen in 1191.&lt;ref name="Eastmond"/&gt;

In 2016, a glass panel installation was erected, surrounding the ruins, to show visitors the complete original shape of the monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Technology shows historic Geguti Palace 800 years ago|url=http://agenda.ge/news/53983/eng|accessdate=6 November 2016|work=Agenda.ge|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hávamál''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|h|ɑː|v|ə|m|ɑː|l}} {{respell|HAH|və-mahl}}; "sayings of the high one"; {{IPA-non|ˈhɒːwaˌmɒːl}}, {{IPA-is|ˈhauvaˌmaul̥}}) is presented as a single poem in the [[Codex Regius]], a collection of [[Old Norse]] poems from the Viking age. The poem, itself a combination of different poems, is largely [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]], presenting advice for living, proper conduct and wisdom.

The verses are attributed to [[Odin]]; the implicit attribution to Odin facilitated the accretion of various mythological material also dealing with the same deity.&lt;ref&gt;Bellows (1936), introductory note.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the most part composed in the [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] [[Alliterative verse#Ljóðaháttr|''Ljóðaháttr'']], a metre associated with wisdom verse, ''Hávamál'' is both practical and philosophical in content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=Df3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=havamal+reviewed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uUAdThDbNA&amp;sig=a-EUTIfEqnRFftft1qMgfXYfwqM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifxc-L0vzVAhXizIMKHYmrAewQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Church Review|last=Richardson|first=Nathaniel Smith|last2=Boggs|first2=Edward Brenton|last3=Baum|first3=Henry Mason|date=1872|publisher=Bassett and Bradley|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the gnomic  "''Hávamál'' proper" comes the ''Rúnatal'', an account of how Odin won the [[rune]]s, and the ''Ljóðatal'', a list of magic chants or [[galdr|spells]].&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON14&gt;Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) ''The Poetic Edda'', page 14. [[Oxford World's Classics]] {{ISBN|0-19-283946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual history==
The only surviving source for ''Hávamál'' is the 13th century [[Codex Regius]]. The part dealing with ethical conduct (the ''Gestaþáttr'') was traditionally identified as the oldest portion of the poem by scholarship in the 19th and early 20th century.
Bellows (1936) identifies as the core of the poem a "collection of proverbs and wise counsels" which dates to "a very early time", but which, by the nature of oral tradition, never had a fixed form or extent.
[[Von See]] (1981) identifies direct influence of the ''[[Disticha Catonis]]'' on the ''Gestaþáttr'', suggesting that also this part is a product of the high medieval period and casting doubt on the "unadulterated Germanic character" of the poem claimed by earlier commentators.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von See: „Disticha Catonis und Hávamál.“ In: Klaus von See: Edda, Saga, Skaldendichtung. Heidelberg 1981, 27-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]] core of the poem, other fragments and poems dealing with wisdom and proverbs accreted over time. A discussion of authorship or date for the individual parts would be futile, since almost every line or stanza could have been added, altered or removed at will at any time before the poem was written down in the 13th century.
Individual verses or stanzas nevertheless certainly date to as early as the 10th, or even the 9th century. Thus, the  line ''deyr fé, deyja frændr'' ("cattle die, kinsmen die") found in verses 76 and 77 of the ''Gestaþáttr'' can be shown to date to the 10th century, as it also occurs in the ''[[Hákonarmál]]'' by [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]].

==Structure==
The ''Hávamál'' is edited in 165 stanzas by Bellows (1936). Other editions give 164 stanzas, combining Bellow's stanzas 11 and 12, as the manuscript abbreviates the last two lines of stanzas 11. Some editors also combine Bellow's stanzas 163 and 164. In the following, Bellow's numeration is used.

The poems in ''Hávamál'' is traditionally taken to consist of at least five independent parts,
#the ''Gestaþáttr'', or ''Hávamál'' proper,  (stanzas 1–80), a collection of proverbs and [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]] wisdom
#a dissertation on the faithlessness of women (stanzas 81–95), prefacing an account of the love-story of Odin and the [[daughter of Billingr]] (stanzas 96-102) and the story of how Odin got the [[mead of poetry]] from the maiden [[Gunnlöð]]  (stanzas 103–110)
#the ''Loddfáfnismál'' (stanzas 111–138), a collection of gnomic verses similar to the ''Gestaþáttr'', addressed to a certain Loddfáfnir
#the  ''Rúnatal'' (stanzas 139–146), an account of how Odin won the runes, introductory to the  ''Ljóðatal''
#the '' Ljóðatal'' (stanzas 147–165), a collection of charms

Stanzas 6 and 27 are expanded beyond the standard four lines by an additional two lines of "commentary". Bellow's edition inverses the manuscript order of stanzas 39 and 40. Bellow's stanza 138 (''Ljóðalok'') is taken from the very end of the poem in the manuscript, placed before
the ''Rúnatal'' by most editors following Müllenhoff. Stanzas 65, 73–74, 79, 111, 133–134, 163 are defective.

Stanzas  81-84 are in ''[[málaháttr]]'', 85–88 in ''[[fornyrðislag]]''. The entire section of 81–102 appears to be an ad hoc interpolation. Stanza 145 is also an interpolation in  ''málaháttr''.

==Contents==

===''Gestaþáttr''===
The first section '''''Gestaþáttr''''', the "guest's section". Stanzas 1 through 79 comprise a set of maxims for how to handle oneself when a guest and traveling, focusing particularly on [[manners]] and other behavioral relationships between hosts and guests and the sacred [[Folklore|lore]] of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] and [[hospitality]] to the [[Norse paganism|Norse pagans]].

The first stanza exemplifies the practical behavioral advice it offers:
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
All the entrances, before you walk forward,
you should look at,
you should spy out;
for you can't know for certain where enemies are sitting,
ahead in the hall''&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON14/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Number 76 is possibly the most known section of ''Gestaþáttr'':
{{Verse translation|

deyr sjálfur ið sama; 
en orðstír 
deyr aldregi

Cattle die,
kinsmen die
you yourself die;
One thing now

===On women===
[[File:Billingr's girl, bitch, and Odin by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Billingr's girl watches on while Odin encounters the bitch tied to her bedpost (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
Stanzas 83 to 110 deal with the general topic of [[romantic love]] and the character of [[women]].

It is introduced by a discussion of the faithlessness of women and advice for the seducing of them in stanzas 84–95, followed by two mythological accounts of Odin's interaction with women also known as "Odin's Examples" or "Odin's Love Quests". The first is an account of Odin's thwarted attempt of possessing the daughter of [[Billingr|Billing]]  (stanzas 96–102), followed by the story of the [[mead of poetry]] which Odin won by seducing its guardian, the maiden [[Gunnlöð]] (stanzas 103–110).

===''Loddfáfnismál''===
The '''''Loddfáfnismál'''''  (stanzas 111–138) is again gnomic, dealing with morals, ethics, correct action and codes of conduct. The section is directed to [[Loddfáfnir]] ("stray-singer").

===''Rúnatal''===
[[Image:Odin's Self-sacrifice by Collingwood.jpg|thumb|"Odin's Self-sacrifice" (1908) by W. G. Collingwood.]]
[[File:Jelling gr Stein 3.JPG|thumb|The younger [[Jelling stone]] (erected by [[Harald Bluetooth]] ca. 970) shows the [[crucifixion of Christ]] with the victim suspended in the branches of a tree instead of on a cross.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Patton 2009:271.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Rúnatal''''' or '''''Óðins Rune Song''''', ''Rúnatáls-þáttr-Óðins'' (stanzas 139-146) is a section of the ''Hávamál'' where Odin reveals the origins of the [[runes]].
In stanzas 139 and 140, Odin describes his  sacrifice of himself to himself:
{{Verse translation|lang=non|
Veit ec at ec hecc vindga meiði a
netr allar nío,
geiri vndaþr oc gefinn Oðin,
sialfr sialfom mer,
a þeim meiþi, er mangi veit, hvers hann af rótom renn.

Við hleifi mic seldo ne viþ hornigi,
nysta ec niþr,
nam ec vp rvnar,
opandi nam,
fell ec aptr þaðan.
|
I know that I hung on a windy tree
[[Numbers in Norse mythology|nine]] long nights,
wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,
myself to myself,
on that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.

No bread did they give me nor a [[Drinking horn|drink from a horn]],
downwards I peered;
I took up the runes,
screaming I took them,
then I fell back from there.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON34&gt;Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) ''The Poetic Edda'', page 34. [[Oxford World's Classics]] {{ISBN|0-19-283946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "windy tree" from which the victim hangs is often identified with the world tree [[Yggdrasil]] by commentators. The entire scene, the sacrifice of a god to himself, the execution method by hanging the victim on a tree, and the wound inflicted on the victim by a spear, is often compared to the [[crucifixion of Christ]] as narrated in the [[gospel]]s.
The parallelism of Odin and Christ during the period of open co-existence of Christianity and Norse paganism in Scandinavia (the 9th to 12th centuries, corresponding with the assumed horizon of the poem's composition) is also evident from other sources. To what extent this parallelism is an incidental similarity of the mode of [[human sacrifice]] offered to Odin and the crucifixion, and to what extent a Pagan influence on Christianity, or vice versa, may have occurred, is a complex question on which scholarly opinions vary.&lt;ref&gt;a sketch of the problem is given by  Kimberley Christine Patton, ''Religion of the gods: ritual, paradox, and reflexivity'' Oxford University,  {{ISBN|978-0-19-509106-9}}, chapter 7 "Myself to Myself: The Norse Odin and Divine Autosacrifice".&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ljóðatal''===
The last section, the '''''Ljóðatal''''' enumerates eighteen songs (''ljóð''), sometimes called "charms", prefaced with
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|Ljóð ek þau kann
er kann-at þjóðans kona
ok mannskis mǫgr}}
|attr1=stanza 147|
The songs I know
that king's wives know not
Nor men that are sons of men.}}

The songs themselves are not given, just their application or effect described.
They are explicitly counted from "the first" in stanza 147, and "a second" to "an eighteenth" in stanzas 148 to 165, given in Roman numerals in the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Bellows separates the "seventeenth" item into stanzas 163 and 164. There is a gap in stanza 163, and some editors have also combined 163 and 164 into a single stanza.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no explicit mention of runes or [[runic magic]] in the ''Ljóðatal'' excepting in
the twelfth song (stanza 158), which takes up the motif of Odin hanging on the tree and its association with runes,
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|svá ek ríst
ok í rúnum fá'k}}
|
So do I write
and color the runes}}

Nevertheless, because of the ''Rúnatal'' preceding the list, modern commentators sometimes reinterpret the ''Ljóðatal'' as referring to runes, specifically with the sixteen letters of the [[Younger Futhark]].

Müllenhoff takes the original ''Ljóðatal'' to have ended with stanza 161, with the final three songs (16th to 18th) taken as late and obscure additions.

==Germanic Neopaganism==
The difference of sixteen runes of the [[Younger Futhark]] vs. eighteen charms in the ''Ljóðatal'' has notably motivated proponents of [[Ariosophy|Germanic mysticism]] to expand the row by two extra runes. The best-known attempt to this effect are the [[Armanen runes]] by [[Guido von List]] (1902).

Various proponents of [[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagan]] groups place an emphasis on ''Hávamál'' as a source of a Norse pagan ethical code of conduct. The  "[[Nine Noble Virtues]]", first compiled by [[Odinic Rite]] founder John "Stubba" Yeowell in the 1970s are "loosely based" on the Hávamál.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
The [[Northvegr Foundation]] cites the Hávamál among other Old Norse and Old English sources to illustrate "the ethical ideal of the Northern spiritual faith of Heithni."&lt;ref&gt;Alfta Lothursdottir, ''Trulog and Sogumal'', Northvegr (2006); [http://www.northvegr.org/northern/book/trulog.php Trúlög: Northern Truisms] (northvegr.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson]], leader of the Icelandic ''[[Ásatrúarfélagið]]'', published his performance of a number of Eddaic poems, including the Hávamál,  chanted in [[rímur]] style.&lt;ref&gt;"Edda", Current 93 (1991); [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY7dtuYH7B0 youtube.com link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], specifically in the [[representation theory]] of [[group (mathematics)|group]]s and [[algebra over a field|algebras]], an '''irreducible representation''' &lt;math&gt;(\rho, V)&lt;/math&gt; or '''irrep''' of an algebraic structure &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a nonzero representation that has no proper subrepresentation &lt;math&gt;(\rho|_W,W), W \subset V&lt;/math&gt; closed under the action of &lt;math&gt;\{ \rho(a) : a\in A \}&lt;/math&gt;.

Every finite-dimensional [[unitary representation]] on a [[Hermitian]]{{clarify|pre-text=[[Sesquilinear form]] or|date=July 2016}} vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the [[direct sum]] of irreducible representations. As irreducible representations are always '''indecomposable''' (i.e. cannot be decomposed further into a direct sum of representations), these terms are often confused; however, in general there are many reducible but indecomposable representations, such as the two-dimensional representation of the real numbers acting by upper triangular unipotent matrices.

==History==

Group representation theory was generalized by [[Richard Brauer]] from the 1940s to give [[modular representation theory]], in which the matrix operators act on a vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of arbitrary [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]], rather than a vector space over the field of [[real number]]s or over the field of [[complex number]]s.  The structure analogous to an irreducible representation in the resulting theory is a [[simple module]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Overview==

{{details|Group representation}}

Let &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; be a representation i.e. a [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\rho: G\to GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a [[vector space]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. If we pick a basis &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as a function (a homomorphism) from a group into a set of invertible matrices and in this context is called a '''matrix representation'''. However, it simplifies things greatly if we think of the space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; without a basis.

A [[linear subspace]] &lt;math&gt;W\subset V&lt;/math&gt; is called '''&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant''' if &lt;math&gt;\rho(g)w\in W&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt; w\in W&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; to a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant subspace &lt;math&gt;W\subset V&lt;/math&gt; is known as a '''subrepresentation'''. A representation &lt;math&gt;\rho: G\to GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''irreducible''' if it has only [[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] subrepresentations (all representations can form a subrepresentation with the trivial &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant subspaces, e.g. the whole vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and [[zero vector space|{0}]]). If there is a proper non-trivial invariant subspace, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''reducible'''.

===Notation and terminology of group representations===

Group elements can be represented by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], although the term "represented" has a specific and precise meaning in this context. A representation of a group is a mapping from the group elements to the [[general linear group]] of matrices. As notation, let {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''...}} denote elements of a group {{math|''G''}} with group product signified without any symbol, so {{math|''ab''}} is the group product of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} and is also an element of {{math|''G''}}, and let representations be indicated by {{math|''D''}}. The '''representation of ''a''''' is written

:&lt;math&gt;D(a) = \begin{pmatrix}
D(a)_{11} &amp; D(a)_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; D(a)_{1n} \\
D(a)_{21} &amp; D(a)_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; D(a)_{2n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
D(a)_{n1} &amp; D(a)_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; D(a)_{nn} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition of group representations, the representation of a group product is translated into [[matrix multiplication]] of the representations:

:&lt;math&gt;D(ab) = D(a)D(b) &lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''e''}} is the [[identity element]] of the group (so that {{math|''ae'' {{=}} ''ea'' {{=}} ''a''}}, etc.), then {{math|''D''(''e'')}} is an [[identity matrix]], or identically a block matrix of identity matrices, since we must have

:&lt;math&gt;D(ea) = D(ae) = D(a)D(e) = D(e)D(a) = D(a) &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for all other group elements. The last two staments correspond to the requirement that {{math|''D''}} is a [[group homomorphism]].

===Decomposable and Indecomposable representations===

A representation is decomposable if a [[Matrix similarity|similar matrix]] {{math|''P''}} can be found for the [[matrix similarity|similarity transformation]]:&lt;ref name="Wigner p 73"&gt;{{cite book| author=E.P. Wigner|title=Group theory and its application to the quantum mechanics of atomic spectra|year=1959|series=Pure and applied physics|page=73|publisher=Academic press|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; D'(a) \equiv P^{-1} D(a) P&lt;/math&gt;

which [[matrix diagonalization|diagonalizes]] every matrix in the representation into the same pattern of [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] [[block matrix|block]]s&amp;nbsp;– each of the blocks are representation of the group independent of each other. The representations {{math|''D''(''a'')}} and {{math|''D'''(''a'')}} are said to be '''equivalent representations'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= W.K. Tung|title=Group Theory in Physics|page=32|publisher=World Scientific|year=1985|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O89tgpOBO04C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=group+theory+in+physics#v=onepage&amp;q=group%20theory%20in%20physics&amp;f=false|isbn=978-997-1966-560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The representation can be decomposed into a [[direct sum of matrices|direct sum of ''k'' matrices]]:

:&lt;math&gt; D'(a) = P^{-1} D(a) P = \begin{pmatrix} 
D^{(1)}(a) &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; D^{(2)}(a) &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; D^{(k)}(a) \\
\end{pmatrix} = D^{(1)}(a) \oplus D^{(2)}(a) \oplus \cdots \oplus D^{(k)}(a) &lt;/math&gt;

so {{math|''D''(''a'')}} is '''decomposable''', and it is customary to label the decomposed matrices by a superscript in brackets, as in {{math|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'')}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''k''}}, although some authors just write the numerical label without parantheses.

The dimension of {{math|''D''(''a'')}} is the sum of the dimensions of the blocks:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{dim}[D(a)] = \mathrm{dim}[D^{(1)}(a)] + \mathrm{dim}[D^{(2)}(a)] + \ldots + \mathrm{dim}[D^{(k)}(a)] &lt;/math&gt;

If this is not possible, i.e. {{math|''k''{{=}}1}}, then the representation is indecomposable.&lt;ref name="Wigner p 73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tung 33"&gt;{{cite book|author= W.K. Tung|title=Group Theory in Physics
|page=33|publisher=World Scientific|year=1985|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O89tgpOBO04C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=group+theory+in+physics#v=onepage&amp;q=group%20theory%20in%20physics&amp;f=false|isbn=978-997-1966-560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All groups &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; have a one-dimensional, irreducible trivial representation. More generally, any one-dimensional representation is irreducible by virtue of having no proper nontrivial subspaces.

===Irreducible Complex Representations===

The irreducible complex representations of a finite group G can be characterized using results from [[character theory]]. In particular, all such representations decompose as a direct sum of irreps, and the number of irreps of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Serre"&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre| first=Jean-Pierre| last= Serre| title=Linear Representations of Finite Groups | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1977 | isbn=978-0387901909}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The irreducible complex representations of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; are exactly given by the maps &lt;math&gt;1 \mapsto \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th [[root of unity]].
* Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional complex representation of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; with basis &lt;math&gt;\{v_i\}^n_{i=1}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; decomposes as a direct sum of the irreps &lt;math&gt;V_{triv} = \mathbb{C}( \sum^n_{i=1} v_i)&lt;/math&gt; and the orthogonal subspace given by:
::&lt;math&gt;V_{std} = \{ \sum^n_{i=1} a_i v_i : a_i \in \mathbb{C},  \sum^n_{i=1} a_i = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;
:The former irrep is one-dimensional and isomorphic to the trivial representation of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. The latter is &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; dimensional and is known as the standard representation of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Serre"/&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. The [[regular representation]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the free complex vector space on the basis &lt;math&gt;\{e_g\}_{g \in G}&lt;/math&gt; with the group action &lt;math&gt;g \cdot e_{g'} = e_{gg'}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}G&lt;/math&gt;. All irreducible representations of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; appear in the decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}G&lt;/math&gt; as a direct sum of irreps.

==Applications in theoretical physics and chemistry==

{{see also|Symmetry in quantum mechanics|Jahn–Teller effect}}

In [[quantum physics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], each set of [[Degenerate energy levels|degenerate eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian operator]] comprises a vector space {{mvar|V}} for a representation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, a "multiplet", best studied through reduction to its irreducible parts.  Identifying the irreducible representations therefore allows one to label the states, predict how they will [[energy level splitting|split]] under perturbations;  or transition to other states in {{mvar|V}}. Thus, in quantum mechanics, irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the system partially or completely label the energy levels of the system, allowing the [[selection rule]]s to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry|title=A Dictionary of Chemistry, Answers.com|edition=6th|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/irreducible-representation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lorentz group===

{{main|Representation theory of the Lorentz group}}

The irreps of {{math|''D''('''K''')}} and {{math|''D''('''J''')}}, where {{math|'''J'''}} is the generator of rotations and {{math|'''K'''}} the generator of boosts, can be used to build to spin representations of the Lorentz group, because they are related to the spin matrices of quantum mechanics. This allows them to derive [[relativistic wave equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4078">{{for|the English Viscount born in 1932|John Manningham-Buller, 2nd Viscount Dilhorne}}

'''John Manningham''' (died 1622) was an English lawyer and diarist, a contemporary source for [[Elizabethan era]] and [[Jacobean era]] life and the London dramatic world, including [[William Shakespeare]].

==Life==

He was son of Robert Manningham of [[Fen Drayton]], [[Cambridgeshire]], by his wife Joan, daughter of John Fisher of [[Bledlow]], [[Buckinghamshire]].

He matriculated at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]] around 1592, and graduated B.A. in 1596.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|MNNN592J|Manningham, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 1598 he entered as a student in the [[Middle Temple]], and on 7 June 1605 he was called to the degree of an utter barrister.

A fellow-student, Edward, son of William Curll and brother of [[Walter Curll]], obtained for him the post of auditor of the court of wards. He was also befriended by a distant relative, Richard Manningham, who, born at [[St Albans]] in 1539, made a fortune in London as a mercer, and in his old age retired to [[Bradbourne]], near [[Maidstone]]. Richard Manningham died on 25 April 1611, and was buried in [[East Malling]] Church, where John Manningham erected a monument to his memory. To John, his sole executor, Richard left his house and lands in [[Kent]].

==Diary==

Manningham wrote a diary, preserved among the [[Harleian Manuscripts]], and first printed by the [[Camden Society]] in 1868, under the editorship of [[John Bruce (antiquary)|John Bruce]]. It covers the period from January 1602 to April 1603; at the time the writer was a student in the Middle Temple. The work is a medley of anecdotes of London life, political rumours, accounts of sermons, and memoranda of journeys. The gossip respecting Queen Elizabeth's illness and death and the accession of James I is set down in detail, and Manningham often supplies comments on the character of the chief lawyers and preachers of the day. He also gives an account of the performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' on 2 February 1602 in the Middle Temple Hall. [[John Payne Collier]]&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Annals of the Stage'', 1831, i. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; first called attention to Manningham's work. The anecdote of Shakespeare's triumph over [[Richard Burbage]] in the pursuit of the favors of a lady of doubtful virtue ("William the Conqueror was before Richard III") comes from his diary entry dated March 13, 1602.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3345890/Diaries-reveal-Shakespeare-posed-rival-actor-entertain-fan.html ''Daily Mail'', December 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Thomas Bodley]], [[John Stow]], and [[Sir Thomas Overbury]] are also occasionally mentioned by Manningham.

==Family==
Manningham married, about 1607, Ann, sister of his friend Curll. By her he had three sons, Richard (born 1608), John (born 1616), and Walter, and three daughters, Susannah, Ann, and Elizabeth. Walter Curll, by his will of 15 March 1646–7, left legacies to his sister Mrs. Manningham and her son and his godson Walter. She was dead before 1656, when her eldest son Richard sold the property at Bradbourne to [[Sir Thomas Twisden, 1st Baronet|Thomas Twysden]], serjeant-at-law.

The '''Kammerzell House''' ([[Alsatian language|Alsatian]]: ''Kammerzellhüs'', [[French language|French]]: ''Maison Kammerzell'', [[German language|German]]: ''Kammerzellhaus'') is one of the most famous buildings of [[Strasbourg]] and one of the most ornate and well preserved [[Middle Ages|medieval]] civil housing buildings in late [[Gothic architecture]] in the areas formerly belonging to the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Built in 1427 but twice transformed in 1467 and 1589, the building as it is now historically belongs to the [[German Renaissance]] but is stylistically still attached to the [[Rhineland]] black and white timber-framed style of civil (as opposed to administrative, clerical or noble) architecture.

It is situated on the ''Place de la Cathédrale'', north-west of the [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], with whose rosy colour it contrasts in a picturesque way when seen from the opposite direction.

The building's inside has been decorated on all floors by lavish [[fresco]]es by Alsatian painter [[Léo Schnug]] (1878-1933). It now houses a restaurant.

This is a list of [[botanical illustrator]]s born or active in Ireland.
[[Botanical illustration]] involves the painting, drawing and illustration of plants and ecosystems.

'''Liz Johnson Artur''' (born 1964) is a Ghanaian-Russian photographer based in London.  Her work documents the lives of black people from across the [[African diaspora|African Diaspora]]. Her work strives to display and celebrate the normal, the vibrant and the subtle nuances of each of these people lives that she encounters.&lt;ref name="i-d.vice.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/j587y7/liz-johnson-arturs-photos-celebrate-black-communities-black-aesthetics-and-black-creativity|title=liz johnson-artur’s photos celebrate black communities, black aesthetics, and black creativity|date=2016-09-29|work=I-d|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson Artur works as a [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]] and editorial photographer for various fashion magazines and record labels all over the world, as well as her independent artistic practice.  Her monograph with Bierke Verlag was included in the 'Best Photo Books 2016' list of the [[The New York Times|New York Times]].

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Liz Johnson Artur was born in Bulgaria but grew up in Eastern Europe and Germany.&lt;ref name="afrorepublic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afro-Russian Photographer Captures Images of Black People in Europe, US and Africa|url=http://afrorepublic.blogspot.ca/2016/04/afro-russian-photographer-captures.html|website=afrorepublic.blogspot.ca|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was Ghanaian and she was raised by her Russian mother. She says that she is “a product of Migration.” She lived in West Germany for three months with her mother on a tourist visa before it expired; then they lived as illegal immigrants. Johnson Artur spent most of her days on the streets unable to go to school due to her status. This was when her initial encounters with strangers occurred; “What I most remember about this time is the pleasure I got from meeting strangers on the street, I think this has affected me as a photographer in a big way.” &lt;ref name="photographers' gallery"&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Photographers' Gallery|title=Brief Encounters: An interview with Liz Johnson-Artur|url=https://thephotographersgalleryblog.org.uk/2016/08/17/brief-encounters-an-interview-with-liz-johnson-artur|website=BLOG - The Photographers' Gallery|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Introduction to photography ===
In 1985 she got her first camera and began taking photos during a trip to New York City. During this trip, she stayed with a Russian family in a black neighbourhood in Brooklyn. In an interview with [[The Fader]], she described how "I'd never been in a black neighbourhood before and I didn't take any pictures then. But my memory of what I saw made me want to start taking pictures." This began her journey to take and compile photographs of weddings, parties, church and everyday life.&lt;ref name="fader"&gt;{{cite web|title=Photographer Liz Johnson Artur On Capturing Beautiful Moments Of Everyday Black Life Around The World|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/11/28/liz-johnson-artur-photographer-book-interview|website=The FADER|accessdate=3 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[I-D|i-D Magazine]], Johnson Artur explained that she got into photography because she "wanted to record the normality of black lives and black culture, which is something that isn't often reflected in the mainstream media." For her, photography was a way of gaining access to people and spaces that sparked her curiosity.  The goal of her work is to move beyond stereotypes of black people and represent each person as a unique individual.&lt;ref name="i-d.vice.com"/&gt;

Johnson Artur received her MA in Photography from the [[Royal College of Art]] in London and has taught at the [[London College of Communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aimiaagophotographyprize.com/artists/liz-johnson-artur|title=Liz Johnson Artur - AGO {{!}} AIMIA Photography Prize|last=Science|first=Art &amp;|website=www.aimiaagophotographyprize.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Johnson Artur has spent the past 30 years photographing the diverse experience of black people across the globe.&lt;ref name="aimia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=AIMIA/AGO Photography Prize|title=Liz Johnson Artur - AGO AIMIA Photography Prize|url=https://www.aimiaagophotographyprize.com/artists/liz-johnson-artur|website=www.aimiaagophotographyprize.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the majority of her recent career, she has been focused on representing black people in South London.&lt;ref name="photographers' gallery" /&gt;

=== Artistic practice ===
Photography is a very personal act for Johnson Artur. She has a collaborative attitude toward her work and makes close connections with her subjects as a way of respecting the vulnerability they show by letting her into their spaces. This process gives a sense of intimacy to her photographs.&lt;ref name="aimia" /&gt; The photographs have an unfinished quality to them. Though some photos are posed, the attention Johnson Artur pays to each individual’s sense of self presentation lends an element of authenticity to the work.&lt;ref name="photographers' gallery" /&gt;

In an interview with The Photographers' Gallery she described this need to represent the personal style and the people she is capturing: "This way I believe photography can show us something very unique and still familiar."&lt;ref name="photographers' gallery" /&gt;

=== Ideology ===
Johnson Artur is committed to consistently photographing black people globally, and noticing the diverse aesthetics in these communities. When asked if she considered her work to be political, she responded that “I take what I do very seriously, but I wouldn't necessarily have called it political unless you asked me that question. My work's political in the sense that it's about communicating, about being able to understand people's struggles, to learn how we can live together."&lt;ref name="i-d"&gt;{{cite web|title=Liz Johnson-Artur’s Photos Celebrate Black Communities, Black Aesthetics, and Black Creativity|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/j587y7/liz-johnson-arturs-photos-celebrate-black-communities-black-aesthetics-and-black-creativity|website=I-d|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en-us|date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson Artur's work focuses on themes of self-presentation and issues of representation. The photographs are taken in public spaces in an endeavour to capture moments; to connect, see, hear and photograph with authenticity.&lt;ref name="LJA"&gt;{{cite web|title=News|url=http://www.lizjohnsonartur.co.uk/new-page/|website=Liz Johnson Artur|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In taking the photo she is establishing their presence.&lt;ref name="photographers' gallery" /&gt; These brief encounters are prompted by style, flamboyance and body language of people who catch her attention.&lt;ref name="aimia" /&gt;

=== Exhibitions ===
'''David Nolan Gallery (New York) "This Synthetic Moment", January 18 - March 10, 2018'''

Curated by David Hartt, this exhibit also included work by [[James Barnor]], [[Kwame Brathwaite]], David Hartt, [[Zoe Leonard]], and [[Christopher Williams (American artist)|Christopher Williams]].  This show focused on themes of [[national identity]], border crossing, transition and how we view each other in the [[public sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.davidnolangallery.com/exhibitions/this-synthetic-moment|title=This Synthetic Moment - Exhibitions - David Nolan Gallery|website=www.davidnolangallery.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lothringer 13 Halle (Munich) “A Thousand and X Little Actions”, October 10 - November 21, 2016'''

In this exhibition, Liz Johnson Artur’s ''Black Balloon Archive'' was shown for the first time.  She was included in this show because of her focus and curiosity towards the lives of others, and her exploration of relationships between human beings. The show was curated by [[Jörg Koopmann]] and also included artists [[Jacob Holdt]], David Hartt, William E. Jones, and Jason Larkin.

'''Kunstverein (Leipzig) “1.-3.Personal plural: wir, ihr, sie”, August 20 - September 6, 2016'''

Thirteen of Johnson Artur’s photographs were included in this exhibit curated by Anna Voyswinckel. The themes explored in this exhibit included border crossing, personal and community identity, Othering, and the relationship between artist and viewer.

'''The Photographer's Gallery (London) “Made You Look: Dandyism and Black Masculinity”,  July 15 - September 25, 2016'''

Twelve of Johnson Artur’s photographs from the ''Black Balloon Archive'' were included in this photography group exhibit, curated by [[Ekow Eshun]].  Other artists included in the exhibit were [[Malick Sidibé]], Jeffrey Henson Scales, and [[Samuel Fosso]], as well as others.  The theme of the exhibit was to explore the complications of the identity of the black [[dandy]], how these men are trendsetters in many media realms while also at a high degree of vulnerability and at risk of state violence and [[Imprisonment|incarceration]].&lt;ref name="LJA" /&gt;

=== Editorial and commercial work ===
Liz Johnson Artur has worked for the last 30 years as a freelance editorial and commercial photographer on countless publications such as [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe Magazine]], [[Fader (magazine)|Fader]], [[I-D|i-D Magazine]], and [[Spin (magazine)|Spin Magazine]] to name a few.  Artur has said that working commercially has provided her with opportunities photograph people and places relevant to her own artistic practice that she would not have had access to otherwise to.&lt;ref name="photographers' gallery" /&gt;

She has photographed the likes of [[Mos Def]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Amy Winehouse]], the [[Spice Girls]] and toured with  [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Seun Kuti]].

== Other projects ==

=== Black Balloon Archive ===

Consisting of hundreds of [[Gelatin silver process|gelatin silver prints]] and [[chromogenic print]]s, Black Balloon Archive is an archive of images that reflect black communities and their members globally.&lt;ref name="aimia" /&gt; It began in 1991 and is an ongoing project that involves a desire to create powerful images of the [[African diaspora|black diaspora]] and is motivated by a hunger to make connections with communities which, until her mid twenties, she barely knew existed.

The name ''Black Balloon Archive'' comes from a song by Syl Johnson called “Black Balloons.&lt;ref name="CA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://canadianart.ca/features/hunger-and-black-balloons-an-interview-with-liz-johnson-artur/|title=Hunger and Black Balloons: An Interview with Liz Johnson Artur|last=Pasipanodya|first=Chiedza|date=April 18, 2018|website=Canadian Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Black Balloon Archive'' is a project whose goal is to show respect to her subject’s ability to control how they are presented in their own lives by honestly representing that image.  In a media climate that often [[Dehumanization|dehumanizes]] black people and uses their images in unethical ways,Artur’s body of work is especially important as she focuses on her subjects’ ability to self-determine how they present and are seen by the viewer.  The artist explained to [[I-D|i-D magazine]] that “there's a sense of pride in how people display themselves. It's why I like street portraits, because I think there's a real presence that everyone has." &lt;ref name="i-d" /&gt;

'''''Magdalene with the Smoking Flame''''' (also titled in [[French language|French]] ''La Madeleine à la veilleuse'', and ''La Madeleine à la flamme filante'') is an oil-on-canvas depiction of [[Mary Magdalene]] by French [[Baroque]] painter [[Georges de La Tour]], painted in 1640. This version of the painting is currently held and exhibited at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-14-classic-works-of-art-with-books-20-003-photo.html |title=The Magdalen with the Smoking Flame |publisher=LA Times |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Louvre Museum]] (''La Madeleine a la veilleuse'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=8707 |title=Louvre Museum Official Website |website=Cartelen.louvre.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other paintings by La Tour containing the Penitent Magdalene are exhibited at the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150712135241/http://www.metmuseum.org/search-results?ft=de%2Bla%2Btour%2Bmagdalene&amp;x=0&amp;y=0] &lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Gallery of Art]], and the [[Louvre]].

==History==
Bought in 1949 from the French Administration des Douanes. In the somewhat uncertain chronology of Georges de La Tour's work, this painting has been allotted the date of 1640, by analogy with the Saint Mary with a Mirror, which has been dated between 1635 and 1645.[2]

==Themes==
During the 17th century, great devotion was shown to Mary Magdalene in all Catholic countries. She was the perfect lover of Christ, her beauty made yet more appealing by reason of her repentance, which had a special attraction for a period so passionately interested in problems of mysticism, quietism and asceticism. The theme of the repentance of sinners and trials sent by God is illustrated in such subjects as the Repentance of St. Peter, Mary Magdalene and Job.[3] A number of written works give evidence of the cult of the Magdalene[4] and this cult was the more widespread since Provence owned two great sanctuaries dedicated to her: the grotto of La Sainte-Baume, and the Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.[5] It has been suggested that Georges de La Tour took a gypsy as his model: at the time, there were many in Lorraine where he painted this picture.[6]

This painting and the Mirror one mentioned above, seem to have been inspired by several themes popular with Italian and Dutch artists: the repentant Magdalene, Melancholy, and Vanity. The artist has given it a feeling of philosophical meditation in keeping with the spirit of the time; the subject's body is enveloped in mysterious darkness, and her face illumined only by the candle. On her knees a skull (for the Golgotha), on the table some books and a candle, and, on a wooden cross, a blood-stained scourge.

==In popular culture==
* The painting appears in [[Ariel (Disney)|Ariel]]'s grotto during the song "[[Part of Your World]]" in the 1989 film [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|''The Little Mermaid'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artdocentprogram.com/mystery-painting-little-mermaid/|title=What's that Mystery Painting in "The Little Mermaid"|last=|first=|date=2015-03-26|website=Art Docent Program|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parkett''' is an international magazine specializing in art. The magazine will cease publication in Summer 2017 with its 100th issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Brian Boucher|title=Parkett Ceases Print Magazine After 33 Years|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/parkett-ceases-print-magazine-33-years-870326|accessdate=3 April 2017|work=Artnet|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Published three times per year in English and German by its publishing house in Zurich, Switzerland, with an additional editorial office in New York, Parkett has a circulation of 12,000 and is read by some 30,000 readers in 40 countries, one third of them in North America.&lt;ref name="parkettart.com"&gt;[http://www.parkettart.com/set_aboutus.htm About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118034107/http://www.parkettart.com/set_aboutus.htm |date=2009-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in the early 1980s with the idea of fostering an open dialogue between the artistic communities of Europe and America, ''Parkett'' is based in Zurich, with an office also in New York.  The magazine's goal has been to actively and directly collaborate with important international artists whose oeuvre is explored in several essays by leading writers and critics in both German and English. Each artist featured also creates a special signed and numbered work exclusive to Parkett. By 2010, ''Parkett'' had published more than 80 volumes with some 180 monographs and over 1500 in-depth texts making it one of the most comprehensive libraries on contemporary art worldwide. Critics, curators, art historians, and other commentators join in the conversation contained within its pages. Many write on the collaborating artists; some write opinions under a variety of topic headings that recur issue to issue; others write on additional artists and ideas. The result is more of a curated event-between-covers than a typical art magazine with reviews and news items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2001/parkett/|title=Interactives - Exhibitions - 2001 - Collaborations with Parkett|work=MoMA|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the fortieth issue of ''Parkett'', in June 1994 the editors presented a special thematic issue asking what beauty will look like after it reemerges from Postmodernism? And how, when contemporary life demands so many different things from contemporary art, do we strike a balance between history and presence, politics and humor? Taking the children's game of Snakes and Ladders as a guiding metaphor, the gala issue offers six mini-collaborations: Holland Cotter on [[Francesco Clemente]]; [[Boris Groys]] on [[Peter Fischli and David Weiss]]; David Rimanelli and Max Weechsler on [[Gunther Förg]]; [[Gordon Burn]] on [[Damien Hirst]]; Joan Simon on [[Jenny Holzer]]; and [[Gilbert Lascault]] on [[Rebecca Horn]]. Also in this issue, [[Dave Hickey]] wrote on magic, [[Vik Muniz]] on apparitions, Jeff Perrone on boards and borders, and [[G. Roger Denson]] on nomadic critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbook.com/3907509900.html|title=Parkett No. 40/41 Snakes &amp; Ladders|work=Artbook|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, on the occasion of ''Parkett'''s retrospective, the Museum of Modern Art in New York staged the exhibition, "Parkett - 20 Years of Artists' Collaborations", replete with a catalog raisonné of all artists' editions.  A book from the Kunsthaus Zurich exhibition in 2004 features unpublished artists sketches, documents, interviews, photographs and statements on the history and the making of Parkett since 1984. Exhibitions of Parkett's artists' editions have also been held in Cologne (Ludwig Museum), Frankfurt (Portikus), Copenhagen (Louisiana Museum), Tokyo (Hillside Forum), Geneva (Centre d'Art Contemporain), London (Whitechapel Art Gallery), and Zurich (Kunsthaus).&lt;ref name="parkettart.com"/&gt;

'''Piotr Konstantinovich Vasiliev''' ({{lang-ru|Пё́тр Константи́нович Васи́льев}}; January 26, 1909, Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire &amp;ndash; June 9, 1989, Leningrad, USSR) was Russian Soviet realist painter, who lived and worked in Leningrad. He was a member of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists]]&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of Members of the Union of Artists of USSR. Volume 1.''- Moscow: Soviet artist, 1979. - p.182.&lt;/ref&gt; and regarded as one of representatives of the [[Leningrad School of Painting|Leningrad school of painting]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.''- Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – pp.15, 18, 28, 29, 78, 79, 358, 384, 390, 394, 396, 402, 404, 405, 411, 414, 416, 421, 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
'''Piotr Konstantinovich Vasiliev''' was born January 26, 1909, in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire in the working-class family.

In 1930, Piotr Vasiliev entered at the first course of Department of Painting at the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]], where he studied of noted educators [[Mikhail Bernshtein]], [[Alexander Lubimov]], Vladimir Serov, [[Arcady Rylov]].

In 1938 Piotr Vasiliev graduated from the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] in [[Isaak Brodsky]] studio, together with [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Alexander Laktionov]], [[Yuri Neprintsev]], and other young artists. His graduated work was historical painting named "Farewell member of the Komsomol at the front. 1919.", dedicated to the events of the Civil War in Russia in 1918-1921.&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. - Saint Petersburg: Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. p.62.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, Piotr Vasiliev was sent to work for an art teacher in [[Chuvash Republic|Chuvashia]]. After returning to Leningrad in the years 1939-1941 he taught painting in the [[Tavricheskaya Art School]].

In June 1941, Piotr Vasiliev was drafted into the [[Red Army]] and took part in the [[Great Patriotic War]] of the Soviet people against Nazi Germany and its allies. He fought on the [[Leningrad Front]], [[Karelian Front]], and [[3rd Ukrainian Front]]. He was wounded and marked by military awards.

In 1944-1945, Piotr Vasiliev took part in the liberation of the Nazi occupation of Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Austria.

Piotr Vasiliev has participated in art exhibitions since 1938. He painted portraits, landscapes, still lifes, genre and historical paintings. In 1946 Piotr Vasiliev was admitted to the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists]] (since 1992 known as the Saint Petersburg Union of Artists).

His picturesque style is typical for students of Isaac Brodsky, and based on the constructive role of drawing, on classically constructed composition and delicate tonal relations, on transfer of lighting and shadow contrasts. The artist used mainly broad painting and a rich palette of colors.

Piotr Konstantinovich Vasiliev died on June 9, 1989, in Leningrad at the eighty-first year of life. His paintings reside in art museums and private collections in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' - Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – p.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; England, in the U.S., Japan, France,&lt;ref&gt;''Peinture Russe. Catalogue.'' - Paris: Drouot Richelieu, 26 Avril, 1991. - p.7,25.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

'''Potbelly sculptures''', (Spanish '''barrigones''' pl. or '''barrigón''' sing.), are in-the-round sculptures of obese human figures carved from boulders.  They are a distinctive element of the sculptural tradition in the [[southern Maya area]] of [[Mesoamerica]]. The precise purpose of potbelly sculptures is unknown, although they appear to have been the focus of public veneration and ritual directed by the ruling elite.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sharer 2000, pp.476-477.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this sculptural tradition is found within the southern [[Maya civilization|Maya]] area, it has been recognized that the sculptures themselves are non-Maya.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Potbelly monuments are generally crude in-the-round sculptures of extremely fat human figures; they are usually seated cross-legged and have enormous swollen stomachs gripped in the figure's arms and legs. The heads are round and normally have the eyes closed and possess puffy eyelids and prominent lips. The monuments are generally of indeterminate gender and are usually carved from [[porphyritic]] [[basalt]], a kind of rock with a combination of large and small grains of mineral that is common along the foothills of [[Central America]]. There are occasional examples of potbelly figures crafted from other materials, such as [[pottery]] or from other types of rock.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are variations on the potbelly theme including complete potbelly sculptures, headless potbellies, some of which may be deliberately headless, and potbelly sculptures that consist of only a bodiless head that are recognised as belonging to the style even though they have no potbelly body. Some potbelly sculptures are wearing collars or clothing while others are apparently naked. There are examples with very prominent navels while other sculptures have no emphasis on the navel at all. Some examples of potbelly sculpture have chest ornaments and some sculptures are seated on pedestals. There are examples of potbelly sculptures corresponding to the general type that are not so fat as is the norm.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.18, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potbelly sculptures vary enormously in size and weight, from the smallest examples that can weigh as little as a few grams and measure {{convert|4|cm|in}} to monuments that weigh 12 tons and measure {{convert|2|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.16-17, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
The dating of potbelly sculptures has been problematic with few of the earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was [[Olmec]] derived or perhaps pre-Olmec.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on [[radiocarbon dating]].&lt;ref&gt;Diehl 2004, pp.9, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations at [[Santa Leticia (Mesoamerican site)|Santa Leticia]] were focused on answering the dating problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 using a combination of radiocarbon dating and ceramic evidence.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The dating of the monuments to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] indicate that the potbelly style may be a later derivative of earlier [[Olmec colossal heads]], although it does not answer the question of the ethnicity of the sculptors. Potbelly monuments were sometimes reused by later peoples in the region, such as at [[Sin Cabezas]], [[Copán]] and Teopán. Arguing against the theory of potbelly sculpture being an Olmec influenced art form is that the direction of diffusion of the style appears to have been from south to north, while the [[Olmec heartland]] lies to the north, on the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which would indicate an expected diffusion from north to south if the Olmecs were indeed the origin of the style.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.22-23. Amaroli, pp.51-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[Image:TakalikAbajHead.jpg|thumb|Takalik Abaj Monument 99, a potbelly style colossal head with a puffed face suggestive of a bloated cadaver.]]
Potbelly sculptures have been interpreted in a variety of manners. Investigators have theorised that potbelly sculptures represent dead ancestors. Alternatively, they have been associated with babies or with the poorly understood Fat God of Mesoamerican mythology. Potbelly monuments have also been associated with a group of [[Household deity|supernatural entities]] associated with the domestic [[hearth]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; A further interpretation, based on the sculpture found at Teopán in western El Salvador, interprets potbelly figures as pregnant women at full term, possibly in the very act of giving birth.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Amaroli, pp.51-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory is that the sculptures represent deceased individuals with bloated bodies, closed eyes, distended bellies and puffed out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of the boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that [[Pasaco]] Monument 2 and the potbelly from [[San Juan Sacatepéquez]] portray the placement of a [[jade]] bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although it has been suggested that the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; One of these is a ceramic potbelly from [[Colha, Belize|Colha]] in [[Belize]], the others are from [[Chalchuapa]] and [[Kaminaljuyu]]. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Democracia 5.jpg|thumb|left|A potbelly sculpture from Monte Alto, on display in La Democracia]]
An alternative interpretation of potbelly monuments is that they were representations of rulership. This is suggested by the body position represented in the sculptures, the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them, the pedestals on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites. The potbelly body position is symbolic of rulership; the figures are seated cross-legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object. Twenty-five potbelly monuments are known to display a collar as neck jewellery, again suggestive of rulership. Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas, [[Antigua Guatemala]], Kaminaljuyu, [[Santa Cruz del Quiché]], [[Takalik Abaj]], [[Tikal]], [[Ujuxte]], [[El Balsamo]], [[Los Cerritos, Guatemala|Los Cerritos]] and [[La Nueva]] in [[Guatemala]], Chalchuapa in [[El Salvador]], and Copán in [[Honduras]]. This represents 42% of sites with potbelly sculptures. If pedestals are equivalent to thrones then [[Bilbao (Mesoamerican site)|Bilbao]] Monument 58 is also relevant, which was found associated with a four-legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned on top of it.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

The diversity of monuments falling within the potbelly sculptural tradition and the individuality of the monuments support the argument that the monuments represent individual rulers. The monuments may have been viewed by the ancient peoples of the region as a depiction of both rulership and their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
[[Image:Formative Period southern Mesoamerica 2.svg|right|thumb|350px|The Pacific coastal zone of southern Mesoamerica showing the core of the potbelly distribution zone.]]
Potbelly sculptures are distributed along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] slope of southern Mesoamerica from [[Chiapas]] in [[Mexico]], through Guatemala to El Salvador, as well as in the Guatemalan highlands. A few examples have been found further afield in the [[Geography of Mesoamerica|Maya lowlands]] of Guatemala and Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.13, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A ceramic potbelly figure was found as far away as Colha in northern Belize and has been dated to c.880&amp;ndash;600 BC, in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic]].&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the distribution area falls within a humid [[foothills|piedmont]] zone with the land consisting of volcanic soil and rubble carried down from the mountains, with naturally occurring basalt boulders of varying sizes that provided a practical raw material for sculpture.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Potbelly sculptures are found in prominent ceremonial centres.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Examples have been found at many sites on the Pacific coast of Guatemala including Takalik Abaj, [[Monte Alto culture|Monte Alto]], Bilbao and [[El Baúl]]. The earliest examples of potbellied monuments have been dated to the Middle Preclassic, with the majority dating to the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Well-preserved examples of Late Preclassic potbelly sculptures have been found at Bilbao, on the coastal plain, and at Kaminaljuyu in the Guatemalan highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; A small potbelly monument has been found at the major Maya city of Tikal in the lowlands of [[Petén Basin|Petén]] in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer 2000, p.476.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:La Democracia 1.jpg|thumb|right|Colossal head in potbelly style on display in [[La Democracia, Escuintla]] and originally from Monte Alto.]]
There is some variation in the exact features, those at Kaminaljuyu have fat bodies with short, thick necks and large heads, sometimes wearing a wide collar. The faces are depicted with incised lines and are heavy and coarse. The legs curve around the body parallel to the ground and the arms are clasped against the torso with the elbows bent.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaminaljuyu has the greatest concentration of potbelly sculptures in any site, with several of them found concentrated in the Palangana monument plaza.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Large potbelly monuments have been found at Giralda, a site {{convert|6|km|mi}} from the Pacific coastline.&lt;ref&gt;Bove &amp; Medrano Busto 2003, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas are stylistically related to Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples, being found in [[fill (archaeology)|fill]] dating to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] period. The monuments at Sin Cabezas were headless when they were found and no fragments of the missing heads were evident, suggesting that they had already been damaged when they were re-erected by later occupants of the site.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Takalik Abaj the potbelly style monuments all date to the Late Preclassic. Stylistically, the monuments are very similar to those of Kaminaljuyu and Monte Alto. Seven monuments are potbelly sculptures (Monuments 2, 3, 19, 40, 69, 94 and 117), six of these represent complete figures. Three monuments are small potbelly sculptures (Monuments 100, 107 and 109) and one sculpture is a colossal head in potbelly style (Monument 99).&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

One potbelly sculpture was found in [[Chocolá]], Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey 2012, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honduras===
At Copán in Honduras, another important Maya site, archaeologists found a potbelly sculpture on top of the Northwest Platform, to the west of the Great Plaza. Another was found in a cache under Stela 4. Further potbelly monuments have been found in caches under Late Classic [[Maya stelae|stelae]] in the Great Plaza itself and throughout the Copán valley.&lt;ref&gt;Fash 2005, pp.78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===El Salvador===
A small example excavated from underneath the Late Preclassic levels of Structure E3-1 at Chalchuapa in El Salvador may date to the Middle Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer 2000, pp.476-477. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; Three potbelly monuments were found resting on a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador, a site near Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms. These monuments were large and especially obese.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, p.56. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 were important in securely dating the potbelly style of sculpture.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The El Salvador potbellies conform to the Monte Alto style of boulder sculpture.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

In Chalchuapa, potbelly monuments were grouped in the El Trapiche ceremonial centre.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp.24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Leticia Monument 1 is a nearly spherical potbelly sculpture and the smallest of the three potbelly monuments at the site, measuring {{convert|1.6|m|ft}} high. Monument 2 is a massive {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=on}} high potbelly that has been split in half down the middle. Monument 3 is a finely carved potbelly figure with stylistic affinities to some of the sculptures found at Monte Alto in Guatemala, it measures {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} high. All three sculptures measured {{convert|1.5|to|2|m|ft}} in height and diameter. The monuments were arranged in a north-south line on a {{convert|70|m|ft|adj=on}} wide terrace projecting from a hill, Cerrito de Apaneca.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest et al. 1982, pp.558, 560-562.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teopán potbelly clearly represents a female figure and has been interpreted as the sculpture of a Late Preclassic earth goddess.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Teopán itself is a small site located on an island in [[Coatepeque Caldera|Lake Coatepeque]] in western El Salvador.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The site has been identified as that of Late [[Preclassic Maya]] settlement.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Although the Teopán sculpture has typical Monte Alto-style traits such as closed puffy eyes, no neck, wrap-around arms, a clearly marked naval and grooves forming portions of the nose and mouth, it also includes some unusual features such as clearly indicated breasts, wide hips, buttocks and a {{convert|10|cm|in|adj=on}} concavity below the legs.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The closed eyelids were later re-carved with the addition of two irregular oval concavities in order to represent open eyes, probably in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic Period]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The Teopán potbelly is likely to be the idol mentioned by Spanish Colonial official Diego García de Palacio in a letter written in 1576, in which he mentions that the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] natives on the island worshipped "a large stone idol in the form of a woman".&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

*The International Contemporary Art Prize (PIAC) is open to [[Juried (competition)|juried]] artists who submit three works of any artistic format as part of a contemporary art exhibition held in Monaco. Originally established in 1965, the competition has been organised by the Foundation since 1983. Prior to 2005 the Artistic Committee made an annual award of the Prince Rainier III Grand Prize of 15,000 euros and the [[Princess Grace]] Foundation prize, the Discovery Scholarship, of 12,000 euros to an artist under the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071018153543/http://www.fondationprincepierre.mc/index.html?pagecode=boursedeladecouverte&amp; The Discovery Scholarship.]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the prize has been worth €40,000 to a single winner, of which €20,000 is to cover the cost of new work. In 2010 the format was changed to involve the Prize being awarded every three years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fondationprincepierre.mc/en/4-international-contemporary-art-prize.html| title= The International Contemporary Art Prize| publisher= Foondation Price Pierre de Monaco|accessdate= 16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prithvi Theatre''' is one of [[Mumbai]]'s best known [[theatre]]s. It was built by [[Shashi Kapoor]] and his wife [[Jennifer Kapoor]] in memory of [[Prithviraj Kapoor]], Shashi's father, who had dreamt of having a "home" for his repertory theatre company, Prithvi Theatres, belongs to the [[Kapoor family]], one of the most influential actor and director families in [[Bollywood]]. [[Prithviraj Kapoor]] founded 'Prithvi Theatres', a travelling theatre company in 1944. The company ran for sixteen years.&lt;ref name=mum&gt;[http://www.mumbainet.com/travel/prithvi.htm Prithvi] www.mumbainet.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Ved Segan was the architect who designed and built the Theatre with the supervision of Jennifer Kapoor. Jennifer, (Trustee) supervised the building and running of the theatre until her death in 1984. In 1978 Prithvi Theatre opened in [[Juhu]], [[Mumbai]]. Shashi Kapoor was the Managing Trustee, the daily affairs are looked after by [[Kunal Kapoor (Kapoor family)|Kunal Kapoor]] (Trustee) with a small but efficient team. Prithvi Theatre has shows every day of the year (closed Mondays), hosts an annual Summertime programme of workshops and plays for children, the Memorial Concert on 28 February, an annual Theatre Festival in November, and many partnership programmes promoting language, poetry, international cinema &amp; documentaries, performing arts – which are free to the public.&lt;ref name=ben&gt;{{cite news |title=Prithvi, pioneer in theatre  |url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2003/11/07/stories/2003110701340600.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=7 November 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prithvi Theatre was founded in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/477270/Prithvi-Theatre#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Prithvi%20Theatre%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia Prithvi Theatre] [[Britannica.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Prithviraj Kapoor]], as a travelling troupe with 150 members,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.junglee.org.in/ptheatre.html Prthvi Theatre History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817051543/http://www.junglee.org.in/ptheatre.html |date=17 August 2008 }} www.junglee.org.&lt;/ref&gt; which staged productions across India. Its maiden performance was [[Kalidasa]]'s classic "Shakuntala". In subsequent years the theatre staged more than 2,600 plays such as "Deewar" (Wall), "Pathan" (a community comprising Hindus and Muslims of North India), "Ghaddar" (Traitor), "Aahuthi" (Offering), "Kalaakar" (Artist), "Paisa" (Money) and "Kisaan" (Farmer). Prithviraj starred as the lead actor in ''every show''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004432/bio Prithviraj Kapoor biography] ''[[IMDB]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prithvitheatre.org/about_us.php?about_us_sub_page=our_history History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727185147/http://www.prithvitheatre.org/about_us.php?about_us_sub_page=our_history |date=27 July 2011 }} Prithvi Theatre.&lt;/ref&gt; His work in the Indian film industry funded the activities of the company &lt;ref name=dna&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1060555 How ‘Papaji’s’ films funded Prithvi Theatre] ''[[DNA (newspaper)]]'', 27 October 2006."[[Zohra Sehgal]] once asked Prithviraj, “Why  the plural? Why Prithvi Theatres?” and he replied, “I wish there were many Prithvi Theatres all over the world that do what we do.”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prithviraj Kapoor]]'s youngest son [[Shashi Kapoor]], who had trained as an actor and director in the Prithvi Theatres, married [[Jennifer Kendal]], daughter of Laura and [[Geoffrey Kendal]], and the leading actress of their theatre company, Shakespearana. Shashi and Jennifer toured with both their parent’s companies – Prithvi Theatres and Shakespeareana, and shared a deep passion for theatre, and a great respect for [[Prithviraj Kapoor|Prithviraj's]] dream for Indian theatre.

==Re-emergence==
[[File:A play performance at Prithvi Theatre, Mumbai.jpg|left|thumb|A play performance at Prithvi Theatre, [[Mumbai]]]]

Prithviraj Kapoor’s dream was to have a permanent place for his theatre company. In 1962 he managed to lease a plot of land in Juhu on which to create a theatre space. Unfortunately his ill-health and subsequent death in 1972 delayed his dream turning into reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/11/22/stories/2004112201500100.htm Kissing the firmament with Prithvi Theatre] [[The Hindu]], 22 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  The year he died the lease on the land expired and was offered on sale to his family. Shashi Kapoor and his wife Jennifer decided to make Prithviraj’s dream a reality by buying the land, and setting up the 'Shri Prithviraj Kapoor Memorial Trust &amp; Research Foundation' in his memory with the intention of building a space to promote [[Hindi theatre]] and the performing arts.

Prithvi Theatre was inaugurated on 5 November 1978 in Mumbai. "Udhwastha Dharmashala", written by [[Govind Purushottam Deshpande|G P Deshpande]], staged  by [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Om Puri]] and [[Benjamin Gilani]] was Prithvi's first play. This was followed by a play by the [[Indian People's Theatre Association]] (IPTA), a political satire, "Bakri", directed by actor-director [[M. S. Sathyu]].

Theatre in Mumbai at the time was dominated by amateur English theatre of South Mumbai, Gujarati farce and low-key [[Marathi theatre]] in Dadar. Hindi theatre was at an all-time low with few venues available. Prithvi Theatre offered Hindi theatre an affordable platform where new styles and forms could be experimented with, a new exciting venue for the performers, directors, writers of theatre in the city, and creating a new audience for the genre.

[[File:Prithvi Theatre 1995 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|Prithvi Theatre and Prithviraj Kapoor on a 1995 stamp of India]]

The theatre's fifth anniversary in 1983 was celebrated with a festival to showcase the best of Prithvi, an event considered a success with audience and critics alike. By now the Prithvi Café, attached to the Theatre had become a well known meeting place for artists and art lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031130/spectrum/main4.htm Preserving a theatre tradition] [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]], 30 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/30978120.cms Sanjana Kapoor] [[Times of India]], 11 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Kapoor, the driving strength, mentor and inspiration of Prithvi Theatre died on 7 September 1984. The theatre was not allowed to close on the day of her death, and the ‘show went on’ in true theatre tradition. Jennifer and Shashi's eldest son, Kunal Kapoor, with the help of Feroz Abbas Khan, took over the running of the theatre, and held a month-long Festival in February 1985 showcasing theatre from all over India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19981101/30550474.html Prithvi theatre festival starts today] [[Indian Express]], 1 November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ustad Zakir Hussain, of whom Jennifer was great fan, performed on her birthday, 28 February during the festival, along with Pandit Shivkumar Sharma. Ustad Zakir Hussain has continued to perform every year on this date at Prithvi – probably the only place where audience members can experience Indian classical music without amplification – in the classic style of a ‘''baithak''’ – as was traditionally performed.

In the 1990s, Jennifer’s daughter Sanjna Kapoor started to help her brother [[Kunal Kapoor (Kapoor family)|Kunal Kapoor]] in the running of the theatre and its various activities. Gradually, as she learned and grew with experience, she added a host of activities and workshops, ‘Prithvi Players’ and ‘Little Prithvi Players’ (Theatre for Children).

The Indian government issued a commemorative stamp in 1995 to mark 50 years of 'Prithvi Theatre'.  In 2006, its annual festival celebrated the birth centenary of Prithviraj Kapoor, and was titled, "''Kala Desh ki Sewa mein''" (Art in service of the Nation).&lt;ref name=dna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/2006/11/24/stories/2006112402940200.htm A celebration of theatre] [[The Hindu]], 24 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prithvi Theatre continues to flourish, providing a home for new talent and source of inspiration to the theatre fraternity and audience with over 540 shows a year, Tuesday through Sunday.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4699">[[File:Tripoli Stazione Centrale.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Tripoli Railway Station in 1940]]
There were few railway stations built in [[Libya]] during the 20th century. The ones that were built were done so by the Italians from the 1920s as part of their colonial administration. Today there are no functioning railway stations active in the country, but new ones are planned, as part of a new railroad system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sinfin.net/railways/world/libya.html  Libya railways project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Rail transport in Libya}} {{Main|Italian Libya Railways}}
Between 1920 and 1936 the [[Italian Empire|Italians]] built some five small railways in [[Italian Libya]]. Served by a host of small stations. Indeed, the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] built in [[Libya]] nearly 400&amp;nbsp;km of railways with {{RailGauge|950mm|lk=on|al=on}} gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orsomax.com/OEA/OEAvillaggi3.htm |title=Orsomax OEA villaggi |publisher=Orsomax.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 40 small and big railways stations were built in Libya by the [[Italian Empire|Italians]], when they ruled Libya. The biggest and most important was the one of [[Italian Tripoli]]. In 1965 were closed the last remaining stations in Benghazi and Soluch. Actually no one is active, but there it is a huge project of building new ones with modern railways, contracted by Chinese and Russians under former dictator [[Kaddafi]].
[[File:Fiat train at Tripoli's railway central station.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Fiat train "Littorina" at Tripoli Station]]

[[File:Benghazi Central Station.jpg|thumb|270px|Benghazi Railway Station in 1930]]

By the 1960s there were only two small railways in [[Libya]], departing from Benghazi and serving classical Littorine: Benghazi-Barce and Benghazi-Soluch. In 1965 last remaining stations in Benghazi and Soluch closed. Today no active railway exists in Libya.

===Tripoli Station===

''Tripoli station'' in the capital [[Tripoli]], was the main terminal for western [[Libya]], not far away from the port and the "[[Tripoli International Fair|Fiera internazionale di Tripoli]]". The station was connected to the stations of Zuara, Tagiura and Garian by small but very active railways.

===Benghazi Station===

''Benghazi station'' was the second in importance, located in downtown [[Benghazi]]. It closed in 1963, when the last small railway of former Italian Libya the ''Benghazi-Solluch line'' was closed and dismantled.
[[File:Barce Stazione Centrale.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Barce Railway station in 1930]]

===Secondary Stations===
Other important railways stations were those in:

* Barce
* Zuara
* Garian
* Soluch
* Tagiura

== New railway stations ==

Plans for a new rail network, complete with stations have been under development for some time since the end of the 20th century. In the first years of the 21st century an ambitious railway plan was drawn up, with the support of former dictator [[Gaddafi]]. With backing from Russian Railways and China work started in September 2008 with earthworks begun between [[Sirte]] and [[Ras Ajdir]], Tunisia border, in 2001-5,&lt;ref name="rgijan01"&gt;{{cite news | title=Earthworks 60% complete on first section of Libyan network | url =http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/earthworks-60-complete-on-first-section-of-libyan-network.html | work =[[Railway Gazette International]] | date = 2001-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 and 2009 various contracts were placed and construction work started on a {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] railway parallel to the coast from the [[Transport in Tunisia|Tunisian]] border at [[Ras Ajdir]] to [[Tripoli]], and on to [[Misrata]], [[Sirte]], [[Benghazi]] and [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]]. Another railway line will run inland from [[Misrata]] to [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]] at the centre of a [[mineral]]-rich area.&lt;ref name=rgi20080901&gt;{{cite news | publisher=''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' | date=2008-09-01 | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/work-starts-on-libyan-railway.html | title=Work starts on Libyan railway | accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the ongoing conflict as a result of the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]], no new work on the rail network has been carried out since 2012.

The '''Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council''' (RACC) is an agency that oversees arts activity throughout the [[Portland metropolitan area]] in [[Oregon]], [[United States]]. It was established as an independent [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] in 1995, replacing a bureau that had been shared by the City of Portland and [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]] – the Metropolitan Arts Commission. Today, RACC serves the tri-county region of Multnomah, [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas]], and [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]] counties.

The mission of the organization is to integrate arts and culture in all aspects of community life through vision, leadership and service. RACC is funded by the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|City of Portland]], Multnomah, Clackamas, Washington counties, [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]], the [[Oregon Arts Commission]], and several private donors. It provides programs and offers grants to artists and arts organizations throughout the region. RACC also manages the 1.33-percent-for-art program for Multnomah County, and the 2%-for-art program for the City of Portland. The most famous of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]'s public artworks is ''[[Portlandia (statue)|Portlandia]]'', which was funded in association with the construction of the [[Portland Building]] in the mid-1980s.

RACC funds a variety of not-for-profit, publicly accessible arts activities in the region.&lt;ref name="RACC_PROG"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21234">'''Remodernism''' revives aspects of [[modernism]], particularly in its early form, and follows [[postmodernism]], to which it contrasts. Adherents of remodernism advocate it as a forward and radical, not reactionary, impetus.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=medina/&gt;

In 2000, [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement instigated remodernism,&lt;ref name=packer/&gt; with a manifesto, ''Remodernism'' in an attempt to introduce a period of new spirituality into art, culture and society to replace postmodernism, which they said was cynical and spiritually bankrupt. In 2002, a remodernism art show in [[Albuquerque]] was accompanied by an essay from [[University of California, Berkeley]] art professor, Kevin Radley, who said there was a renewal of artists working without the limitation of irony and cynicism, and that there was a renewal of the sense of beauty.

In 2006, the [[Stedelijk Museum]] and the [[University of Amsterdam]] held a talk on remodernism with Daniel Birnbaum and Alison Gingeras; the introduction to this talked of the revival of painting as a possible return to traditional modernist values, such as [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]], self-expression and autonomy, as opposed to multimedia practice.
&lt;ref name=amsterdam/&gt; In 2008, London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' critic, Ben Lewis, applied the term to three [[Turner Prize]] nominees and saw them amongst a movement which was reviving the formalism of the early 20th century; he advocated values of an aesthetic informed by modesty, generosity and genuine emotion.&lt;ref name=lewis-turner/&gt;

==History==
[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] and [[Billy Childish]], the founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement, inaugurated the period of remodernism.&lt;ref name=packer&gt;Packer, William. "Childish artists coming unstuck", p.13, and "Young pretenders of art have much to learn", p. 20, ''[[Financial Times]]'', March 13, 2001. The text from different editions is the same: "Childish and his co-founder, Charles Thomson, ushered in remodernism, 'a period of art . . . to reclaim the vision and spiritual values of the early Modernists and replace the ennui of Post-Modernism'."&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Remodernism'' manifesto was published on March 1, 2000 to promote vision, authenticity and self-expression, with an emphasis on painting, and subtitled "towards a new spirituality in art." Its premise is that the potential of the [[Modernism|modernist]] vision has not been fulfilled, that its development has been in the wrong direction and that this vision needs to be reclaimed, redefined and redeveloped. It advocates the search for truth, knowledge and meaning, and challenges [[formalism (art)|formalism]].

|colspan="2"|&lt;small&gt;In 1999, Childish and Thomson wrote a remodernism manifesto, calling for a period of new spirituality in art, culture and society to replace [[postmodernism]].&lt;/small&gt;
|}

It has a short introduction, summing up: "Modernism has progressively lost its way, until finally toppling into the bottomless pit of Postmodern balderdash." This is followed by 14 numbered points, stressing bravery, individuality, inclusiveness, communication, humanity and the perennial against nihilism, scientific materialism and the "brainless destruction of convention." Point 7 states:
{{quote|Spirituality is the journey of the soul on earth. Its first principle is a declaration of intent to face the truth. Truth is what it is, regardless of what we want it to be. Being a spiritual artist means addressing unflinchingly our projections, good and bad, the attractive and the grotesque, our strengths as well as our delusions, in order to know ourselves and thereby our true relationship with others and our connection to the divine.}}
Point 9 states: "Spiritual art is not religion. Spirituality is humanity's quest to understand itself and finds its symbology through the clarity and integrity of its artists." Point 12 links its use of the word "God" to enthusiasm&amp;mdash;from the Greek root ''en theos'' (to be possessed by God).

The summary at the end starts, "It is quite clear to anyone of an uncluttered mental disposition that what is now put forward, quite seriously, as art by the ruling elite, is proof that a seemingly rational development of a body of ideas has gone seriously awry," and finds the solution is a spiritual renaissance because "there is nowhere else for art to go. Stuckism's mandate is to initiate that spiritual renaissance now."&lt;ref&gt;Childish, Billy, and Thomson, Charles. [http://www.stuckism.com/remod.html "Remodernism"], stuckism.com, March 1, 2000.

Childish and Thomson sent their remodernism manifesto to [[Nicholas Serota|Sir Nicholas Serota]], Director of the [[Tate Gallery]], who replied, "You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto ''Remodernism''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021221052217/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/9704524l/MM%20Project/Html/stuck2.htm "Stuck on the Turner Prize: Send in the clowns"], [[University of Glasgow]].

In March 2000 the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] declared themselves to be the first remodernist art group at a show ''The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota''. In April, remodernism was quoted in ''The Gulf News'' ([[UAE]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lethbridge, Lucy (2000)[&lt;!--http://www.gulf-news.co.ae/18042000/FRIDAY/fri6.htm DEAD LINK REPLACED WITH INTERNET ARCHIVE CACHE --&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010222155937/http://www.gulf-news.co.ae/18042000/FRIDAY/fri6.htm "Letter from London"] ''The Gulf News'', May 14, 2000. Accessed April 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In May ''The Observer'' newspaper announced a stuckist show: "As the founding group of a self-named art movement called Remodernism, they stand on an art ticket that's against clever conceptualism and in favour of a more emotional and spiritual integrity in art via figurative painting."&lt;ref&gt;Sumpter, Helen (2000)[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,220529,00.html "Go see... the Stuckists"] ''The Observer'', May 14, 2000. Accessed April 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Thomson and Childish gave a talk on stuckism and remodernism at the Salon des Arts, Kensington, promoted by the [[Institute of Ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Vine1/Salon.html "Stella Vine meets (and joins) the Stuckists"] stuckism.com. Accessed April 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The same month the "Students for Stuckism" also gave "a Remodernist show and talk." The Institute of Remodernism was founded by Dr Khatereh Ahmadi.

In 2001, Thomson stood in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|UK general election]], stating, "The Stuckist Party aims to bring the ideas of Stuckism and Remodernism into the political arena."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/e01/man/StuckManifesto2.pdf "The Stuckist Party: Manifesto 2001"] pdf accessed from Keele University website, April 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The show curator, Yoshimi Hayashi, said:
{{quote|ReMo incorporates ideas from Modernism, Avantegardism, and Post Modernism; thus synthesizing an alternative and real time contemporary approach to art. In ReMo, issues such as multiculturalism, irony, the sublime, and identity are considered; however, they do not become the art itself. The reconsideration and redefinition of the traditions are sought not by mere deconstructionism, but rather by connecting new nodes of ideas. Therefore, by definition, ReMo is fundamentally cellular and its roots stem from provincial art settings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020207064328/http://www.magnifico.org/exh_pgm/ReMo_2002.html "Magnífico presents ReMo"], Magnifico, 2002.

American film makers/photographers [[Jesse Richards]] and [[Harris Smith (filmmaker)|Harris Smith]] co-founded a new group [[remodernist film]] and photography with an emphasis on emotional meaning and characterised by elements of new-wave, no-wave, expressionist and transcendental film-making.

Stuckist artist [[Bill Lewis]], interviewed by the [[BBC]] at the 2004 [[Liverpool Biennial]], said that remodernism was "not a movement as such,"&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; but a return to the start of modernism in order to move forward with an art for a new paradigm.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; To "remodernise" is to go "back to the root again, starting with painting ... and see where it goes."&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; He said that this had been called reactionary, but it was radical "in the true sense of the word."&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;[[Bill Lewis|Lewis, Bill]].

In August 2006, an online group called "The Remodernists of Deviantart" was founded by Clay Martin. The group is composed of artists who are active on the website deviantart.com. 

In 2006, artist Matt Bray said, "I do not wish to be considered a Stuckist, as I find some of there (sic) antics unnecessary. The Stuckists are however the first and most famous Remodernist group, so for that, and for bringing this particular manifesto to my attention; I thank them."&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Matt (2006)[http://www.artnowuk.com/ "Art Portal: Matt Bray 2006"] artnow.uk.com.

{{quote|The Japanese ideas of [[wabi-sabi]] (the beauty of imperfection) and [[mono no aware]] (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film.&lt;ref name="When The Trees Were Still Real"&gt;[http://jesse-richards.blogspot.com/2008/08/remodernist-film-manifesto.html "Remodernist Film Manifesto", When The Trees Were Still Real, August 27, 2008] Retrieved September 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}} Later, in 2009, in an essay on remodernist film for ''[[MungBeing]]'' magazine, Richards discussed Remodernism in relation to craft:
{{quote|Remodernism in general embraces the bravery of the amateur, so craft is a strange thing to think about. Craft is usually about something striving for perfection, without flaws, to be "professional". I don't like that. However if you consider craft something that can be developed and grown, I like that. I like the idea of filmmakers teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean. I think that is the exploration of craft.&lt;ref name=MungBeing&gt;[http://www.mungbeing.com/issue_28.html?page=32&amp;sub_id=1565#1565 "Remodernist Film", MungBeing, October 4, 2009] Retrieved October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Sandham Memorial Chapel''' is in the village of [[Burghclere]], [[Hampshire]], England. It is a grade I [[listed building|listed]]&lt;ref name="Listing"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1339741  |desc=Sandham Memorial Chapel|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1920s decorated chapel, designed by [[Lionel Godfrey Pearson]]. The chapel was built to accommodate a series of paintings by the English artist [[Stanley Spencer]]. It was commissioned by Mary and Louis Behrend (1881–1972) as a memorial to Mary's brother, Lieutenant Henry Willoughby Sandham who died at the end of [[World War I|the First World War]].  The chapel is surrounded by lawns and orchards, with views of [[Watership Down, Hampshire|Watership Down]]. It is now run by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and is open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sandham-memorial-chapel/|title=Sandham Memorial Chapel|publisher=[[National Trust]]|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paintings ==

Spencer's series of 17 paintings was inspired by his own experiences during the First World War, in which he served as an orderly with the Royal Army Medical Corps, first at [[Beaufort War Hospital]] in Bristol, and then in Macedonia, where he was subsequently transferred to the infantry. He was influenced by [[Giotto]]’s [[Arena Chapel]] murals in [[Padua]]. He wanted to paint [[mural]]s too, but the environmental conditions were not appropriate. The subsequent paintings were commissioned in 1923, with Spencer moving to Burghclere in 1926 to work in-situ. The series was completed in 1932. It is dominated by the [[Resurrection]] scene behind the altar, in which dozens of British soldiers lay the white wooden crosses that marked their graves at the feet of a distant Christ. The series chronicles Spencer's everyday experiences of the war rather than any scenes of action. When the art historian R. H. Wilenski saw the recently completed sequence, he wrote of his sense "that every one of the thousand memories recorded had been driven into the artist's consciousness like a sharp-pointed nail".&lt;ref&gt;Haycock (2009). ''A Crisis of Brilliance''. p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==

The Chapel is consecrated "The Oratory of All Saints" and only became officially recognised by its colloquial name Sandham Memorial Chapel following the National Trust's takeover of the property. Spencer would refer to it as his "Holy-Box", whilst the architect and patrons would privately refer to it as Spencer's "God-Box". Meanwhile, John and Mary Behrend's children pejoratively called it the "biscuit factory", in response to its "municipal" characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwell (2014). ''The God-Box of Burghclere'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sky Angel'''  is an American operator of [[Christian media|Christian television]] networks; it operates three channels, Angel One, Angel Two, and [[Kids &amp; Teens TV|KTV]], all of which are exclusive to [[Dish Network]]. The company's corporate headquarters are located in [[Naples, Florida]].&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; The company also operates a [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] location where programming, engineering and network operations reside.&lt;ref name="forbes-skyangel" /&gt;

The company previously operated as a Christian-oriented [[television provider]] carrying religious and family-oriented programming, first as a [[satellite television]] service, and later as an [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] [[internet television]] provider. The shift to an IPTV platform was later accompanied by the spin-off of the provider's secular offerings into a second service known as FAVE TV. On January 14, 2014, Sky Angel ceased its IPTV business, citing that because it didn't fall under the traditional legal definition of a [[multichannel video programming distributor]], it was unable to employ legal remedies for its allegations that broadcasters were discriminating against its business model by preventing carriage of their channels.

==History==
Sky Angel was formed in 1980 by Robert Johnson Sr., who aimed to create a faith-oriented television service that would be free of the objectionable content he had found on television. Johnson obtained an allocation of 8 [[direct-broadcast satellite]] frequencies for the service, and reached a deal with [[Dish Network]] to use space on its [[EchoStar III]] satellite. Sky Angel's lineup would consist primarily of [[Religious broadcasting|religious networks]], along with other secular television networks which the service considered to be family-oriented. Carrying around 30 channels in its lineup, Sky Angel reached around 115,000 subscribers, mostly within the [[Central United States]].&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6523982.html|title='Christ-Centered' IPTV Service to Offer NFL Network|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes-skyangel&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tiny TV Broadcaster That Cable And Internet Giants Are Trying To Kill|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/08/23/the-tiny-tv-broadcaster-that-cable-and-internet-giants-are-trying-to-kill/|work=Forbes|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc-spread"/&gt;

After the company declined to invest close to $400 million in manufacturing a replacement for the aging EchoStar III satellite, Sky Angel partnered with [[NeuLion]] in 2007 to develop a new [[Over-the-top content|over-the-top]] [[IPTV]]-based platform for the service. The new IPTV service would offer additional features such as an increased channel capacity, support for [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s, and the ability for Sky Angel to offer [[Internet television|internet]] and [[mobile television]] services in the future.&lt;ref name=forbes-skyangel/&gt;&lt;ref name="mc-spread"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/telco-tv/sky-angel-spread-iptv-wings-neulion/127630|title=Sky Angel to Spread IPTV Wings via NeuLion|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Sky Angel launched its "Sky Angel 2.0" platform, offering services featuring religious channels delivered via set-top boxes, and "Faith Everywhere", which added web streaming of its lineup through an [[iPad]] app. Sky Angel also introduced a new spin-off service known as FAVE TV ("Family and Values Entertainment"){{emdash}}a secular service which aimed to carry "mainstream" and "family-friendly" television channels.&lt;ref name=forbes-skyangel/&gt;&lt;ref name=skyangel-favepr&gt;{{cite web|title=Sky Angel Launches Sky Angel 2.0 and Creates New Television Service, FAVE TV, With the Help of NeuLion's TV Everywhere Technology|url=http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/sky-angel-launches-sky-angel-152949069.html|publisher=NeuLion press release|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the Faith Everywhere service became available through an app for [[Roku]] [[digital media player]]s.&lt;ref name=mc-skyangelroku&gt;{{cite web|title=Sky Angel’s ‘Faith Everywhere’ Package Runs $14.95 Per Month on the Streaming Platform|url=http://www.multichannel.com/distribution/roku-tunes-sky-angel/143653|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2014, Sky Angel suspended its television services; in an FCC complaint, the company detailed that it had been unable to offer a competitive service to its subscribers because content providers (including in particular, [[#Carriage disputes|Discovery Communications]]) had refused to allow the provider to "acquire programming in a fair and nondiscriminatory way".&lt;ref name=fcc-shutdown&gt;{{cite web|title=SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTS OF SKY ANGEL U.S., LLC|url=http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7521313509|publisher=FCC|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=recode-fcceffort&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Launches Effort to Help Online Video Providers Compete With Cable Guys|url=https://www.recode.net/2014/12/19/11633938/fcc-launches-effort-to-help-online-video-providers-compete-with-cable|website=Re/code|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming and services==
Sky Angel previously offered two programming packages for its IPTV service: the base "Faith Package", which consisted of primarily faith-based broadcasters (including various Evangelical Protestant and [[Roman Catholic]] broadcasters, and accompanying video on demand services)&lt;ref name="Catholic"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=11794 |title= Sky Angel IPTV service includes five Catholic channels |accessdate= 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the "Family Values Pack" added a selection of secular cable networks, including general entertainment, news, and sports. Sky Angel also offered a subscription "WebTV" package, which included a selection of around 35 of the service's faith-based channels available for live streaming on the Sky Angel website, along with video on demand content.&lt;ref name="SKY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyangel.com/About/Faq.asp?ws=s&amp;x=002|004&amp;~=|title=Sky Angel: FAQ|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carriage disputes ==
Sky Angel's switch to an over-the-top IPTV service led to several major carriage disputes, which led to concerns over the definition of Sky Angel's service under the regulations of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).

In 2009, [[C-SPAN]] was pulled from Sky Angel after being on its IPTV service for 2 days. In November 2012, Sky Angel filed an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] lawsuit against the network claiming that its owners (a consortium of major television providers) pulled its programming from Sky Angel to put the service at a disadvantage against its conventional rivals. The court dismissed the case without prejudice, believing that Sky Angel's case did not have enough evidence to justify its claims that C-SPAN's owners were trying to enforce a monopoly position. C-SPAN denied Sky Angel's arguments, and claimed the removal was for contractual reasons relating to IPTV. Sky Angel, in its filing with the court, showed that CSPAN was already streaming its channels over the web to the public free of charge.&lt;ref name=mcn-skyangelcspan&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Dismisses Sky Angel Suit Against C-SPAN|url=http://www.multichannel.com/index.php?q=news-article/court-dismisses-sky-angel-suit-against-c-span/143639|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the company subsequently filed a second antitrust suit. The claims were rejected, with the court arguing once again that Sky Angel had produced no actual evidence of [[collusion]] among the C-SPAN consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/strike-two-sky-angel-antitrust-claim-against-c-span/130154|title=Strike Two For Sky Angel Antitrust Claim Against C-SPAN|website=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, [[Discovery Communications]] announced that it would pull its channels from Sky Angel in response to unspecified concerns surrounding how its programming was delivered. In response, Sky Angel filed a [[Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act|program access]] complaint with the [[Federal Communications Commission]], alleging that Discovery was discriminating against the service by allowing other major cable providers to offer access to its programming over the internet (either through a [[TV Everywhere]] service, or through [[Dish Network]]'s [[Slingbox]]-based set-top boxes). The FCC denied Sky Angel's request for a standstill on the case, but the FCC Media Bureau began to dispute whether Sky Angel qualified as a "[[multichannel video programming distributor]]" (MVPD) under the regulations because it does not have a physical "transmission path" in its infrastructure. The Commission, along with allies such as [[Google]], acknowledged that making any ruling on whether an over-the-top service qualifies as an MVPD may have a major effect on the [[internet video]] industry as a whole.&lt;ref name=forbes-skyangel/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-skyangelcomplaint&gt;{{cite web|title=Sky Angel Files Program Access Complaint Against Discovery|url=http://www.multichannel.com/internet-video/sky-angel-files-program-access-complaint-against-discovery/131059|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-bedeviled&gt;{{cite web|title=Bedeviled By Sky Angel Decision|url=http://www.multichannel.com/content/bedeviled-sky-angel-decision|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-fearandloathing&gt;{{cite web|title=Fear and Loathing Over The Top|url=http://www.multichannel.com/content/fear-and-loathing-over-top|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South Australian Film Corporation''' (SAFC) is a [[South Australia]]n Government statutory corporation that was established in 1972.&lt;ref name="SAFC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.safilm.com.au/about/history/ | title=A Short History of the SAFC | publisher=South Australian Film Corporation | accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}

=== Origin ===
The South Australian Film Corporation was founded as a production company in 1972.&lt;ref name="afci"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afci.org/film-commissions/south-australian-film-corporation | title=South Australian Film Corporation | publisher=Association of Film Commissioners International | accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 it became the first state film corporation established in Australia. The success of its business model led other State Governments to establish similar bodies charged with the promotion of film production and fostering industry development. At the time of the Corporation's establishment, the Australian film industry was stagnating, and the Corporation played a significant role in the revival of Australian film making. Former State Premier [[Don Dunstan]] played an instrumental role in the foundation of the Corporation and its early film production activities.&lt;ref name="stratton"&gt;David Stratton, ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus &amp; Robertson, 1980 p17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation ===
From its genesis, the SAFC collaborated with various government departments and agencies in the production of short documentaries and educational films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mirror, mirror .. girls [videorecording]. - Version details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/37803572|website = trove.nla.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included co-productions with the South Australian Department of Agriculture and Fisheries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Food from the reluctant Earth - Details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11937022|website = trove.nla.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Soil erosion [videorecording] / [presented by] The South Australian government [and] The South Australian Dept. of Agriculture. - Version details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/15434924|website = trove.nla.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Department of Marine &amp; Harbors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Port of Adelaide - Details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21778183|website = trove.nla.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Education Department,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parent involvement in schools : Education Department of South Australia.

[videorecording] / - Version details - Trove|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/17322594|website = trove.nla.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

In the 1980s, the SAFC shifted its focus to television production. It relocated to a disused Philips factory in [[Hendon, South Australia#History|Hendon]] in the north-west suburbs of [[Adelaide]]. [[Jock Bair]] was head of drama.&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Hawker, "Going South: the Adelaide Connection", ''Cinema Papers'' January 1987 p21- 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moran"&gt;Albert Moran, ''Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series'', AFTRS 1993 p 548-550&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1994, the Corporation was involved in the production of films and television programs. The television mini-series ''[[The Battlers (TV series)|The Battlers]]'' was the last production produced by the SAFC. Since then, it has focused on supporting the production of films and television in South Australia, including providing funding and support, as well as making production and post-production facilities available.

Since 1994, the role of the Corporation has changed to that of a production facilitator, so that it no longer engages in the production process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.safilm.com.au/Content.aspx?p=208|title =A Short History of the SAFC|date =|accessdate =22 May 2015|website =www.safilm.com.au/|publisher =|last =|first =|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150818062117/http://www.safilm.com.au/Content.aspx?p=208|archive-date =18 August 2015|deadurl =yes|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It facilitated the production of the [[Nine Network]] program ''[[McLeod's Daughters]]'' (2001-2009), which was filmed on location in rural South Australia.

In 2017, the Corporation announced that a new TV Series "Soccer Swap" was a co-production with Australia's [[57 Films]] and China’s [[Qingdao TV Tower|Qingdao TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/asia/soccer-swap-series-australia-china-co-production-1202421907/|title=‘Soccer Swap’ Series set as Australia-China Co-Production|last=Frater|first=Patrick|date=2017-05-10|work=Variety|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relocation ===
In 2008, SA Premier and Arts Minister [[Mike Rann]] secured cabinet approval to fund the relocation of the SAFC, at a cost of A$43 million. The project included new sound stages and mixing suites, as well as a major refurbishment of a historic 19th century building as a high-tech film hub.

It moved its headquarters to [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]], in the eastern suburbs, having taken over buildings previously occupied by a mental hospital. Its new Adelaide Studios have been the recipient of major funding from the South Australian Government. The new Adelaide Studios were opened by Premier Mike Rann on 20 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Protesters mar Mike Rann's last engagement as Premier, The Advertiser, 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the Corporation continues to operate post-production facilities which have been used for a broad range of productions.

A '''statue menhir''' is a type of carved [[standing stone]] created during the later [[Europe]]an [[Neolithic]].

The statues consist of a vertical slab or pillar with a stylised design of a human figure cut into it, sometimes with hints of clothing or weapons visible.

==Locations==
They are most commonly found in southern and western [[France]], [[Catalonia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canovelles.cat/fitxer/12350/10menhir.pdf Estàtua-menhir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155014/http://www.canovelles.cat/fitxer/12350/10menhir.pdf |date=2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]] and the [[Alps]]. A group from the [[Iron Age]] also is known in [[Liguria]] and [[Lunigiana]].

There are two in [[Guernsey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=287103092|title=Le Dehus - Burial Chamber (Dolmen)|work=The Megalithic Portal|last=Evendon|first=J|accessdate=2008-09-16|date=2001-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Gran' Mère du Chimquière'' ('the Grandmother of the Cemetery'), a highly detailed example in the churchyard of [[St Martin's, Guernsey|Parish of Saint Martin]], and another known simply as ''La Gran' Mère'' in the Parish of [[Castel, Guernsey|Castel]]. The latter is an earlier, less detailed example found buried underneath the porch of the parish church.

{{Expand Spanish|Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (México)|date=November 2010}}
{{Politics of Mexico}}

The '''National Supreme Court of Justice''' ({{lang-es|Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación}} ('''SCJN''') is the Mexican institution serving as the country's federal [[high court]] and the spearhead organisation for the judiciary of the Mexican Federal Government. It consists of eleven [[magistrates]], known as ''ministers of the court'', one of whom is designated the court's ''president''.

Judges of the SCJN are appointed for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;Article 94 Mexican Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; They are ratified through affirmation by the [[Mexican Senate|Senate]] from a list proposed by the [[President of Mexico|President of the Republic]]. The ministers chosen will select from among themselves who shall be the President of the Court to serve a four-year period; any given minister may serve out more than one term as president, but may not do so consecutively. 

==Requirements for holding a seat on the National Supreme Court of Justice==
* Be a natural born citizen of Mexico.
* Be at least 35 years old at the time of one's appointment
* Have held a Law degree for at least 10 years.
* To have a good reputation and have not have been convicted of theft, fraud, forgery, breach of trust, or any other offense which could imply a punishment of more than one year in prison.
* Not have been Director for Domestic Affairs, Chief of an Administrative Department, Attorney General of the Republic or Federal District Attorney, Senator, Member of Parliament, Governor of any State, or Chief Executive of the Federal District during the year prior to his or her appointment.

The Constitution requires that the appointment of ministers of the court should fall to those persons who have served ably, effectively and honourably in the administration of justice, or to those who have distinguished themselves by their honor, competence and professional background in the exercise of their duties.

Ministers may take leave of their posts for three reasons:
* The end of their terms
* Relinquishment, which is only allowed in serious cases, all of which must be affirmed by the President and accepted or discarded by the Senate.
* Voluntary retirement: Proceeds when the interested party requests their retirement, as long as they meet the conditions of age and seniority.

==Supreme Court building==

The court itself is located just off the [[Zocalo|main plaza]] of [[Mexico City]] on the corners of Pino Suarez and Carranza Streets. It was built between 1935 and 1941 by Antonio Muñoz Garcia. Prior to the [[Conquest of Mexico|Conquest]], this site was reserved for the ritual known as "[[Danza de los Voladores de Papantla|Dance of the Flyers]]" which is still practiced today in [[Papantla]]. [[Hernán Cortés]] claimed the property after the Conquest and its ownership was in dispute during much of the colonial period with Cortes' heirs, the city government, and the [[Royal and Pontifical University]] all claiming rights. It was also the site of a very large market known as El Volador.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last= Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdalena Galindo   |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |url= |page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the building, there are four flanks painted in 1941 by [[José Clemente Orozco]], two of which are named ''The Social Labor Movement'' and ''Commonwealth''. There is also a mural done by American artist [[George Biddle]] entitled "War and Peace" at the entrance to the law library.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The building also contains a mural by [[Rafael Cauduro]], which "graphically illustrates the Gran Guignol of Mexican torture",&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; and includes a depiction of the 1968 [[Tlatelolco massacre]] as well as "a cut-away of a prison, perhaps the infamous Lecumberri Black Palace where student leaders who escaped death were jailed."&lt;ref name=ross&gt;John Ross, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 16 July 2010, [http://www.counterpunch.org/jross07162010.html In the Basement of Mexican Justice, No One is Innocent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719120301/http://www.counterpunch.org/jross07162010.html |date=19 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Charge of the Light Brigade'''" is an [[1854 in poetry|1854]] [[narrative poem]] by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] about the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]] during the [[Crimean War]]. He wrote it on December 2, 1854, and it was published on December 9, 1854 in ''The Examiner''. He was the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]] at the time.

==History==

===Composition===
During the 1850s, when Great Britain was engaged in the [[Crimean War]], Tennyson wrote several patriotic poems under various pseudonyms. Scholars speculate that Tennyson created his pen names because these verses used a traditional structure Tennyson employed in his earlier career but suppressed during the 1840s,&lt;ref&gt;Francis 113&lt;/ref&gt; worrying that poems like "The Charge of the Light Brigade" (which he initially signed only A.T.) "might prove not to be decorous for a poet laureate".&lt;ref&gt;Shannon and Ricks 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was written after the [[Light cavalry|Light Cavalry Brigade]] suffered great casualties in the [[Battle of Balaclava]]. Tennyson wrote the poem based on two articles published in ''[[The Times]]'': the first, published in November, 1854, provided the phrase "Some one has blunder'd" and thus the meter of the poem.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon and Ricks 1&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was written in a few minutes on December 2 of the same year, based on a recollection of that account;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon and Ricks 2&lt;/ref&gt; Tennyson wrote other similar poems, like "Riflemen, form in town and in Shrine" in a similar manner.&lt;ref&gt;Francis 115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later versions===
Tennyson made revisions to the poem due to criticisms by the American poet [[Frederick Goddard Tuckerman]] and others;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon and Ricks 7&lt;/ref&gt; these were published in Tennyson's volume ''[[Maud and other poems|Maud and Other Poems]]''. These changes were criticized by several, including both Tennyson and Tuckerman.

Tennyson sent a version of the poem, after correcting the revisions in ''Maud'', at the soldiers' request.&lt;ref name="Shannon and Ricks 10"&gt;Shannon and Ricks 10&lt;/ref&gt; There, it was distributed in pamphlet form at the behest of [[Jane Griffin (Lady Franklin)|Jane, Lady Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Lord Tennyson, ''Poems'', ed. Hallam Lord Tennyson and annotated by Alfred Lord Tennyson (London: Macmillan, 1908), II, 369.&lt;/ref&gt; The same version was used for the second printing of ''Maud''.&lt;ref name="Shannon and Ricks 10"/&gt;

Tennyson recited this poem onto a [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinder]] in 1890.

===Kipling's postscript===
[[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote "[[The Last of the Light Brigade]]" (1891) some 40 years after the appearance of "The Charge of the Light Brigade". His poem focuses on the terrible hardships faced in old age by veterans of the [[Crimean War]], as exemplified by the cavalry men of the Light Brigade. Its purpose was to shame the British public into offering financial assistance.&lt;ref name="Hell Riders"&gt;{{Citation|last=Brighton|first=Terry|title=Hell Riders: The True Story of the Charge of the Light Brigade|url=http://www.terrybrighton.com/HR.htm|year=2005|publisher=Penguin|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Het_Kanonschot_-_Canon_fired_(Willem_van_de_Velde_II,_1707).jpg|thumb|350px]]
'''''The Gun Salute''''' (Dutch - ''Het kanonschot'') is a c.1680 oil on canvas painting by [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]], showing a ship of the Dutch navy firing a gun salute. It and its [[pendant painting|pendant work]] ''The Gust of Wind'' (''De windstoot'') were painted after his arrival in England around 1672, where he later succeeded [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|his father]] as court painter to [[Charles II of England]].

The two works remained together for a long while and by the 18th century had joined [[Sir Philip Stephens, 1st Baronet|Sir Philip Stephens]]'s collection. In 1834 the Amsterdam-based banker and collector Adriaan van der Hoop bought ''The Gun Salute'' at auction. He believed it portrayed ''[[Dutch ship De Zeven Provinciën (1665)|De Zeven Provinciën]]'', flagship of the Dutch naval hero [[Michiel de Ruyter]] - de Ruyter had a high opinion of van de Velde and even fired cannon for him to allow him to study the light effects this produced. However, this identification has now been refuted.

In 1845, van der Hoop lent the painting to an old masters' exhibition- in a review of the exhibition the art critic Alexander Oltmans gave it its present title. It was initially assigned to the Museum van der Hoop, before being transferred to the [[Rijksmuseum]] in 1885 - ''The Gust of Wind'' is also in the Rijksmuseum collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">'''Useful art''', or '''useful arts''' or '''technics''', is concerned with the skills and methods of practical subjects such as manufacture and craftsmanship. The phrase has now gone out of fashion, but it was used during the [[Victorian era]] and earlier as an antonym to the [[performing art]] and the [[fine art]].&lt;ref&gt; George Washington used the term in a letter to Lafayette (Jan. 29, 1798). Washington distinguished commerce from useful arts by stating, “While our commerce has been considerably curtailed for want of that extensive credit formerly given in Europe, and for default of remittance; the useful arts have been almost imperceptibly pushed to a considerable degree of perfection.”  THE WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT SOURCES, 1732-1799 (Fitzpatrick ed.).  Other literary sources are collected in the PTO Supp. Br., ''In re Bilski'', p. 11 n.4 (useful arts are manufacturing processes).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "useful Arts" is used in the [[United States Constitution]], [[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress|Article One, Section 8, Clause 8]] which is the basis of United States [[patents in the United States|patent]] and [[Copyright in the United States|copyright]] law:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;…"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the clause, the phrase "useful Arts" is meant to reference inventions, while "Science" is meant to reference human knowledge, including{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} that which is encompassed in literature and the "fine arts".

In his dissenting opinion in ''[[In re Bilski]]'',&lt;ref&gt;In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haldane Robert Mayer|Judge Mayer]] criticized the majority for not addressing the preliminary issue of whether the claimed invention was within the useful arts. In Mayer's view this should have been dispositive, because he considered the claimed [[business method]] not to be within the useful arts. In the same case, [[Timothy Dyk|Judge Dyk]] filed a concurring opinion to similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://works.bepress.com/malla_pollack/12  Malla Pollack], "The Multiple Unconstitutionality of Business Method Patents: Common Sense, Congressional Choice, and Constitutional History" 61 Rutgers Computer &amp; Tech.

[[File:Cleveland Museum of Art - damaged Thinker.jpg|thumb|Vandalized cast of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] ''[[The Thinker]]'', [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]], US]]

'''Vandalism of art''' is intentional damage of an artwork. The object, usually exhibited in public, becomes damaged as a result of the act, and remains in place right after the act.  This may distinguish it from  [[art destruction]] and [[iconoclasm]], where it may be wholly destroyed and removed, and [[art theft]], or [[Looted art|looting]].

Numerous acts of vandalism against art exhibits are known and some objects, such as ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' and ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'', have been intentionally damaged several times. Many vandals were diagnosed with a mental disorder and some, such as [[Hans-Joachim Bohlmann]], had a history of attacking artworks. A vast amount of damage consists of leaving a minor scratch, a stuck chewing gum, a pencil mark and so on, and usually escapes publicity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gamboni|Gamboni]], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; More visible acts of vandalism were premeditated, as the tool of destruction&amp;nbsp;– a knife, paint, acid or hammer&amp;nbsp;– was intentionally brought to the scene. In most cases, the artworks were restored. Restorations were costly and time-consuming and in many cases were followed by shielding the artwork from future attacks.

The term ''vandalisme'' was coined in 1794 by [[Henri Grégoire]], bishop of [[Blois]], to describe the destruction of artwork following the [[French Revolution]]. The term originated from the invasion of Rome in 455 by the [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribe]] of [[Vandals]], which resulted in destruction of numerous artworks, and was quickly adopted across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merrills |first1=Andy |last2=Miles |first2=Richard |title=The Vandals |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6068-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTIHPoyMOFYC&amp;printsec=frontcover|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repeated vandalism ==

=== Hans-Joachim Bohlmann ===

[[Hans-Joachim Bohlmann]] (1937–2009) was a German serial vandal. Between 1977 and 2006, he damaged over 50 paintings worth more than 270&amp;nbsp;million [[Deutsche Mark]]s (about 138&amp;nbsp;million euros) by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] and other artists. Bohlmann had a [[personality disorder]] and was treated in various psychiatric hospitals since a young age. In most acts, he sprayed paintings with [[sulfuric acid]], targeting faces of the personages.&lt;ref name=sp2&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42008774.html Ich bin mein eigener Sklave]. ''Spiegel'', 1 October 2005 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mona Lisa ===

''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci]] has long been attracting vandals and is currently one of the best-protected artworks. In 1956, the lower part of the painting was severely damaged when a vandal doused the painting with acid while it was on display at a museum in Montauban, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5392000.stm|title=Faces of the week|work=BBC|date=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December of the same year, a young Bolivian named Ugo Ungaza Villegas threw a rock at the painting; this resulted in the loss of a speck of pigment near the left elbow, which was later painted over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140328010816/http://www.monalisamania.com/faq.htm Mona FAQ]. Mona Lisa Mania&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[bulletproof glass]] has shielded the Mona Lisa from more recent attacks. In April 1974, a handicapped woman, upset by the museum's policy for the disabled, sprayed red paint at the painting while it was on display at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GgwUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CIsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2980,1609749|title=Mona Lisa sprayed|work=[[The Free-Lance Star]]|date=20 April 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2009, a Russian woman, distraught over being denied French citizenship, threw a [[terracotta]] mug or teacup, purchased at the museum, at the painting in the Louvre; the vessel shattered against the glass enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/12/content_11868974.htm|title=Mona Lisa attacked by Russian woman|work=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/russian-tourist-hurls-mug-at-mona-lisa-in-louvre/article/feed/66265|title=Russian tourist hurls mug at Mona Lisa in Louvre|agency=Associated Press|date=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the painting was undamaged.

=== Night Watch ===
[[File:Vandalized Night Watch 1975-09-16c.jpg|260px|thumb|Rembrandt's ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' after being cut by William de Rijk in September 1975]]
Rembrandt's ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' (1642) is one of the most popular paintings at the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam. It is viewed by about 4,000 to 5,000 visitors daily with its value estimated at $925,000 in the 1970s. The painting was vandalized on several occasions. On 13 January 1911, an unemployed navy cook tried to cut it with a knife, but could not cut through the thick varnish on the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E1DB1331E233A25757C1A9679C946096D6CF Slashes famous picture.; Discharged Naval Cook Mutilate Master's "Night Watch" at Amsterdam], ''New York Times'', 14 January 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=t1&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1956922_1956921_1956951,00.html Rembrandt's Night Watch], ''Time'', 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, William de Rijk, an unemployed school teacher, cut dozens of zigzag lines in the painting with a knife before he was wrestled by the guards. The day before, de Rijk had been turned away from the museum because he arrived after closing time. After the event, he was identified with a mental disorder; he was sent to a psychiatric hospital and committed suicide there on 21 April 1976. It took six months to restore the painting, and traces of the cuts still remain.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;&lt;ref name=c1978/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goss, Steven (Summer 2001) [http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/3/toolsofartvandalism.php A Partial Guide to the Tools of Art Vandalism], ''Cabinet Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM87KqxAuO8C&amp;pg=PA114|page=114|title=Un iconoclasme moderne: théorie et pratiques contemporaines du vandalisme artistique|author=Gamboni, Dario |publisher=Editions d'En bas|year=1983|isbn=2-8290-0051-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, a man threw acid on the painting.

=== The Little Mermaid ===
[[File:Little mermaid examined.jpg|260px|thumb|Police technicians examine the damage to [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]] after it was blasted off its base on 10 September 2003.]]

''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' is a statue of the mermaid from the [[The Little Mermaid|fairy tale of the same name]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. The statue is located in the harbor of [[Copenhagen]] and is an icon and a major [[tourist attraction]] of the city. The statue has been damaged and defaced so many times since the mid-1950s that in 2007, Copenhagen officials announced that the statue may be moved further out in the harbor to avoid further vandalism and to prevent tourists from climbing onto it.

The main focus of vandalism for the statue has been [[decapitation]].  On 24 April 1964, the statue's head was sawn off and stolen by politically oriented artists of the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] movement. The head was never recovered and a new head was produced and attached to the statue.&lt;ref name=m3/&gt; On 6 January 1998, the statue was decapitated again;&lt;ref name=m1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/45721.stm|date=8 January 1998 | work=BBC News | title=Feminists claim responsibility for statue attack}}&lt;/ref&gt; the culprits were never found, but the head was returned anonymously to a nearby TV station, and re-attached on 4 February.

On the night of 10 September 2003, the statue was knocked off its base with explosives and later found in the harbor's waters. Holes were blasted in the mermaid's wrist and knee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3103906.stm Little Mermaid's unexpected swim], BBC News, 12 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Paint has been poured on the statue several times, including one episode in 1963 and two in March and May 2007. On 8 March 2006, green paint was poured over the statue and a [[dildo]] was attached to its hand.&lt;ref name=m3&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/reise/europa/0,1518,druck-572601,00.html Alter schützt Meerjungfrau nicht vor Rabauken (Age does not protect against Mermaid bullies)].

== Acid and paint ==
{{see also|Hans-Joachim Bohlmann}}
In 1880, exhibits of the Russian painter [[Vasily Vereshchagin]] in [[Vienna]] caused the opposition of the Catholic Church, which culminated in an attack on two paintings, ''Holy family'' ({{lang-ru|Святое семейство}}) and ''Resurrection'' ({{lang-ru|Воскресение Христово}}). A monk splashed enough acid on the paintings to virtually destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centre.smr.ru/win/artists/veresh/biogr_veresh.htm Peaceful painter]. centre.smr.ru (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Tony Shafrazi]] wrote "KILL LIES ALL" with red spray paint over the work ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]]. Shafrazi was ostensibly protesting [[Richard Nixon]]'s pardon of [[William Calley]] for the latter's actions during the [[My Lai massacre]]. The paint was removed with relative ease from the varnished surface.&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman, J.

On 15 June 1985, Rembrandt's 17th-century painting ''[[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Danaë]]'' was attacked in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in Russia. A man, later judged insane, first threw [[sulfuric acid]] on the canvas and then cut it twice with a knife.

In 1997, [[Alexander Brener]] painted a green dollar sign on [[Kazimir Malevich]]'s painting [[:File:Suprematist Composition - Kazimir Malevich.jpg|''Suprematisme'']]. The painting was restored and Brener was sentenced to 5&amp;nbsp;months in prison.

In 2012, Uriel Landeros spray painted a bull and wrote "Conquista" with black spray paint over the work ''[[Woman in a Red Armchair]]'' by Pablo Picasso. He was charged with felony graffiti and [[criminal mischief]] and sentenced to two years in prison.

In 2017, a [[2017 Paris machete attack|terror suspect attacked guards of the Louvre museum with machetes]] and was found carrying "bombs of aerosol paint" intended to "disfigure the masterpieces of the museum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Emilie Blachère|title=Attack at the Louvre: the tourist was a terrorist|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Societe/Attaque-au-Louvre-le-touriste-etait-un-terroriste-1184744|accessdate=13 February 2017|work=Paris Match|date=13 February 2017|language=French|quote=Investigators found bombs of aerosol paint in his bag.

On 16 January 1913, a 29-year-old [[iconographer]] Abram Balashev attacked the painting [[Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan|''Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan'']] by [[Ilya Repin]] in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in Moscow. With three knife blows, he cut through the faces of both Ivans. Balashev was found mentally ill and restricted to a psychiatric hospital. The painting was restored by two leading Russian experts within a week; the work was greatly assisted by the availability of good-quality photographs of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rusk.ru/st.php?idar=25141 Scene of Blood, or how Ilya Repin killed Tsarevich Ivan.

On 10 March 1914, militant suffragette [[Mary Richardson]] walked into the [[National Gallery]] of London and attacked [[Diego Velázquez]]'s painting ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'' with a [[meat cleaver]].

On 6 April 1978, a 31-year-old Dutch artist, disgruntled over the non-payment of his welfare by the Amsterdam authorities, made three 30–40&amp;nbsp;cm long cuts in the center of the painting ''[[:File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 084.jpg|La Berceuse]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]] at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam.

In 1986, a man "wishing to take revenge on abstract art" cut with a knife the painting ''[[Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue]] III'' by [[Barnett Newman]]. The restoration took 5&amp;nbsp;years and cost $450,000.

A rather unusual case, which might not qualify as vandalism, occurred in 1908. An exhibition was set up for May of that year with paintings by [[Claude Monet]], which had already been praised by critics and were estimated at $100,000 (1908 prices). Despite this, Monet decided that he was not satisfied with his work and in a sudden move destroyed all the paintings with a knife and a paint brush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1956922_1956921_1956949,00.html Monet's Rage of Perfectionism], ''Time'', 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Smashing and shattering ==

On 7 February 1845, the [[Portland Vase]], a [[Roman glass|Roman]] [[cameo glass]] vase dated to between 5 and 25&amp;nbsp;BCE, was shattered by a drunken William Lloyd while on display in the [[British Museum]]. The vase was pieced together and underwent several further repairs, all not entirely successful.

''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|La Pietà]]'', another work by Michelangelo, is a 1499 example of [[Renaissance]] sculpture housed in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Vatican City. On 21 May 1972, mentally disturbed geologist [[Laszlo Toth]], aged 33, attacked the statue with a hammer while yelling "I am Jesus Christ!", chipping the Virgin Mary's left eyelid, neck, head, veil and left forearm; the forearm fell on the floor, causing the fingers to break. Most broken pieces were collected by the service people but some were taken by tourists. The sculpture was repaired and is now protected by bulletproof glass. Toth was not charged with a crime, but was found socially dangerous and confined for two years to a psychiatric institution in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1956922_1956921_1956949,00.html Michelangelo's Pietà], ''Time'', 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2565,00.html Whatever happened to Laszlo Toth, the man who smashed Michelangelo's Pieta in 1972?] ''Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gamboni|Gamboni]], p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

A 37-year-old drunken man grabbed a metal stand and repeatedly hit the painting, shattering its protection glass, seriously damaging the original wooden frame, and tearing the central part of the canvas.

On 19 July 2007, police arrested artist Rindy Sam after she kissed the all-white canvas of ''Phaedrus'' by [[Cy Twombly]], leaving a red lipstick mark. The artwork, which was worth an estimated $2,830,000, was on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art in [[Avignon]], France. First attempts to remove the mark using about 30 various chemicals were unsuccessful. Sam was tried in a court in Avignon for "voluntary degradation of a work of art". She defended herself by saying to the court: "It was just a kiss, a loving gesture. I kissed it without thinking; I thought the artist would understand... It was an artistic act provoked by the power of Art".

==Firearms==
In July 1987, a man named Robert Cambridge entered the [[National Gallery]] in London with a sawn-off shotgun concealed under his coat. He then shot the drawing ''[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist]]'' by Leonardo da Vinci from a distance of about 2&amp;nbsp;meters (7&amp;nbsp;feet). The pellets did not penetrate the protective glass, but shattered it, and the splinters caused significant damage to the artwork. Cambridge told the police that he wanted to express his disgust with "political, social and economic conditions in Britain"; he was placed in a mental institution. The restoration of the drawing took more than a year to complete.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/arts/restoring-a-leonardo-drawing-that-was-hit-by-a-shotgun-blast.html Restoring a Leonardo Drawing That Was Hit by a Shotgun Blast], ''New York Times'',

The '''Voetboogdoelen''' ("crossbowmen's shooting range") was a 16th-century building on the [[Singel]] canal in [[Amsterdam]], at the corner of [[Heiligeweg]] near [[Koningsplein]] square, which served as headquarters and [[shooting range]] of the local ''[[schutterij]]'' (civic guard). [[Frans Hals]] painted a group portrait for the Voetboogdoelen, known as the ''[[Meagre Company]]''.

The spot where the Voetboogdoelen once stood is now occupied by the main building of the [[Amsterdam University Library]]. The nearby street Voetboogstraat was named in reference to the Voetboogdoelen.

== History ==

The Voetboogdoelen, also called ''Sint-Jorisdoelen '' after its [[patron saint]], [[Saint George]], was one of three ''doelens'' (shooting ranges) for the Amsterdam ''schutterij'' (civic guard). The other two shooting ranges were the [[Handboogdoelen, Amsterdam|Handboogdoelen]] and [[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]], located along the [[Singel]] and [[Kloveniersburgwal]] canals respectively. The Voetboogdoelen civic guard was armed with [[crossbow]]s, while the Handboogdoelen civic guard wielded [[longbow]]s and the Kloveniersdoelen civic guard used an early type of [[musket]], the [[arquebus]]. 

The Voetboogdoelen was established in 1458 as the shooting range for the ''voetboogschutterij'' (crossbowmen's civic guard), and the associated building was completed in the early 16th century. The shooting range extended from the Singel canal to the back side of the houses on [[Kalverstraat]] and Heiligeweg.&lt;ref name=fontaineverwey&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140822135314/http://dbnl.org/tekst/_boe022198601_01/_boe022198601_01_0002.php H. de la Fontaine Verwey, "Herinneringen van een bibliothecaris'", ''De boekenwereld'', Jaargang 3.

Amsterdam's militia [[guild]]s were formed in the [[Middle Ages]] to defend the city against attack. Around 1580, at the behest of [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], these Medieval guilds were incorporated into a new, much larger civic guard to defend the [[Alteratie|newly Protestant]] city against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] during the [[Dutch Revolt|Dutch revolt]] which ultimately led to a full-blown war of independence, the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Officers of this new civic guard were recruited from the well-to-do of Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160425014321/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-C-378 "The Company of Captain Dirck Jacobsz Rosecrans and Lieutenant Pauw, Cornelis Ketel, 1588", Rijksmuseum] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the mid-17th century, the Eighty Years' War ended and the civic guard no longer served a military purpose. The civic guard continued to exist, but membership became an honorary position and the ''doelens'' assumed a primarily social function. The wealthiest and most powerful citizens of [[Dutch Golden Age]] Amsterdam came together in the ''doelens'' to eat, drink and smoke. In 1650 the city gave permission for houses to be built on the former shooting ranges of the Voet- and Handboogdoelen. For these houses, two new streets were constructed: the Voetboogstraat and Handboogstraat.&lt;ref name=fontaineverwey /&gt;

Banquets were held in the Voetboogdoelen in 1653 and 1654 to celebrate the founding of the Amsterdam artists' guild, the [[Guild of Saint Luke]]. At the first of these feasts, on 20 October 1653, [[Joost van den Vondel]] was crowned with a [[laurel wreath]] to celebrate his career as a poet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151113083707/http://www.coret.org/cc/res/cornelisbrise.php Schilder Cornelis Brisé - Onderzoek - Coret Genealogie] (Dutch, archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1674, the Voetboogdoelen was rented out to the new [[Dutch West India Company]] — founded after the original company went bankrupt — to serve as its headquarters. From then on, the building was known as the ''West-Indisch Binnenhuis'' (Inner West India House) or simply ''West-Indisch Huis'' (West India House). The building was also used by the [[Society of Suriname]] from its founding in 1683 until the company was nationalized in 1795. During the [[French period]], the Voetboogdoelen served as [[barracks]]. In 1816 the building was demolished to make way for the [[Roman Catholic]] [[St. Catherine's Church, Amsterdam|St. Catherine's Church]], consecrated in 1820. In 1939, the church was itself demolished.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080518023635/http://dyksoft-superbe.50plusser.nl/?page=article&amp;warticle_id=28361&amp;De_verdwenen_Sint_Catharinakerk_op_het_Singel_te_Amsterdam#.WL6MmpOLQ5g Ger van Dijk, "De verdwenen Sint Catharinakerk op het Singel te Amsterdam"] (Dutch, archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archief.amsterdam/stukken/verdwenen_amsterdam/catharinakerk/index.html "Catharinakerk", Stadsarchief, Gemeente Amsterdam] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

This left the grounds unoccupied until the 1960s, when the main building of the [[Amsterdam University Library]] was built on the spot. The building, designed by architect [[Jan Leupen]] and others, has been named in the media as one of the ugliest of Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160624180255/http://www.amsterdamsebinnenstad.nl/binnenstad/179/binnengast.html "Van Stadsboekerij tot 'mega'bibliotheek?", ''Binnenstad'' 179, Nov. 1999] (Dutch, archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
Members of the civic guard, drawn from the well-to-do of Amsterdam, frequently commissioned group portraits of themselves, which were hung in the ''doelens''. The earliest known example of these so-called ''schuttersstukken'' is a 1529 [[triptych]] by [[Dirck Jacobsz.]] for the Kloveniersdoelen, now in the [[Amsterdam Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160409193216/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-C-402/catalogue-entry "Dirck Jacobsz, Triptych with Guardsmen of the Amsterdam Kloveniersdoelen (Headquarters of the Arquebusiers’ Civic Guard), 1529", Rijksmuseum] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; Group portraits for the Voetboogdoelen were commissioned from as early as the 1530s. 

[[Frans Hals]] was commissioned in 1633 to paint a group portrait for the Voetboogdoelen, ''[[Meagre Company|The Meagre Company]]''. However, Hals took years to complete it and, when the painting was still unfinished in 1636, [[Pieter Codde]] was contracted to complete it. Now on display in the Rijksmuseum, ''The Meagre Company'' is one of Hals' best-known works and was an important inspiration for [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160425014318/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-C-374 "Militia Company of District XI under the Command of Captain Reynier Reael, Known as ‘The Meagre Company’, Frans Hals, 1637", Rijksmuseum] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160929185218/http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let534/letter.html#n-4 "To Theo van Gogh. Nuenen, on or about Saturday, 10 October 1885", Vincent van Gogh: The Letters] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two group portraits were commissioned for the ''Oude Sael'' (Old Hall) of the Voetboogdoelen to commemorate the end of the [[Eighty Years' War]] with the [[Peace of Münster]] in 1648. The best-known of these two paintings is the ''[[Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster|Banquet at the Crossbowmen’s Guild in Celebration of the Treaty of Münster]]'' by [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]]. This painting is now in the Rijksmuseum. The painting was probably trimmed; on copies (such as a 1779 print by [[Jacob Cats (painter)|Jacob Cats]]), the back wall and window are much higher, and some of the ceiling is even visible. In the painting, some of the buildings on the opposite side of the [[Singel]] canal can be seen through the window, including a building at Singel 460 designed and built by [[Philip Vingboons]] (nowadays the Odeon club and restaurant).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-C-2 "Banquet at the Crossbowmen’s Guild in Celebration of the Treaty of Münster, Bartholomeus van der Helst, 1648", Rijksmuseum] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; The second group portrait commissioned for the Old Hall of the Voetboogdoelen was ''The company of Captain Joan Huydecoper'' by [[Govert Flinck]]. The painting is now in the Amsterdam Museum. 

From about 1683, the group portraits were removed from the ''doelens'', beginning with those in the former Voetboogdoelen. Most were hung in Amsterdam's city hall on [[Dam Square]] (now the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]]), others sold at auction. Many of these paintings, including [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Night Watch]]'' (which hung in the Kloveniersdoelen), were significantly trimmed to fit their new home. The full-size versions are known only through copies made of the original paintings, such as the watercolor copies contained in the Egerton Manuscript, which is now in the [[British Library]]. [[Cornelis Ketel]]'s 1588 group painting of a company of the Voetboogdoelen civic guard, ''The Company of Captain Dirck Jacobsz Rosecrans and Lieutenant Pauw'' (now in the [[Rijksmuseum]]) was cropped on all sides, with as much as 1.27 meters thought to have been cut off on the right-hand side.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160425014321/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-C-378 "The Company of Captain Dirck Jacobsz Rosecrans and Lieutenant Pauw", Cornelis Ketel, 1588] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160530115743/https://arthistoriesroom.wordpress.com/category/series/in-all-their-glory-amsterdam-civic-guards-portraits/ Maaike Dirkx, “In all their glory”: Amsterdam civic guards portraits – (2) Jan van Dyk and the paintings in the Town Hall", Rembrandt's Room, August 13, 2014] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voetboogdoelen was one of three ''doelens'' (shooting ranges) for the Amsterdam civic guard, alongside the [[Handboogdoelen, Amsterdam|Handboogdoelen]] and [[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]], which were located along [[Singel]] and [[Kloveniersburgwal]] canal respectively. Of the three, only the Handboogdoelen survives.

Other Dutch towns, including [[The Hague]], [[Leiden]] and [['s-Hertogenbosch]], also had a Voetboogdoelen or Sint-Jorisdoelen.

The original headquarters of the Dutch West India Company was the [[West-Indisch Huis (Amsterdam)|West-Indisch Huis]] (West India House, 1617), also in Amsterdam. The [[West-Indisch Pakhuis]] (West India Warehouse, 1642) in Amsterdam served as headquarters from 1647 until the Voetboogdoelen took over this function in 1674.

[[Image:Aa fitzcarraldo ship.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the side of the Fitzcarraldo]]
'''Walk the Plank''' are a British group of artists, theatre makers, pyrotechnicians and event engineers who specialise in outdoor arts/theatre, touring performance and [[pyrotechnic]]s. 

Their shows are on land and on water and often mix performance, music, lighting, visual images, fire, and [[fireworks]]. The company was established by John Wassell and Liz Pugh in 1991, who identified a [[niche market]] for a touring theatre ship, and other aquatic shows on the waterways. The company's work began when the pair purchased a touring [[theatre]] ship, the MV ''Fitzcarraldo''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The company's work has now extended far beyond the ship and they work on delivering shows and events, varying in scale from intimate to epic. Walk the Plank have produced work for Toronto’s [[Wintercity Festival]], [[Singapore Festival]], [[Euro 2004]], [[Tall Ships 2005]], [[Centerparcs]], Sir [[Paul McCartney]], the [[Commonwealth Games]], as well as multiple city and local councils. Perhaps their most well known credit are the opening and closing ceremonies for Liverpool's Capital of Culture celebrations.

Their administrative base is in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Greater Manchester]] and they have workshop facilities in Ramsbottom and Rawtenstall.

Their work often involves community engagement and they are known for scheduling and leading participation elements which fit the context of the event they are organising.

==Event management and consultancy==
The company's Senior Management Team (including co-founders John Wassell and Liz Pugh and Project Directors Andy Stratford and Billie Klinger) are trusted advisers in the areas of outdoor arts and cultural events.

==MV Fitzcarraldo==
The ''Fitzcarraldo'' [http://www.walktheplank.co.uk/wtp/index.php?page=nauticalia] was built in 1971 in [[Sandnessjøen]], Norway for [[TFDS]] as the MV Bjarkøj. She was 20 years a general cargo and passenger ferry working the islands around [[Tromsø]] in north [[Norway]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In December 1991 Walk the Plank purchased the ship, renaming it the ''Fitzcarraldo''. The ship was registered British in 1992, the same year of its first British national tour. Its hold was adapted as a theatre. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Each summer, from 1992 to 2006 the ''Fitzcarraldo'' set sail from the [[Albert Dock]], [[Liverpool]] and toured ports and harbours in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Audiences of up to 125 people can sit the aft deck to watch as the hatches rise and the cargo holds are [[Crane (machine)|crane]]d open.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 2000, 's co-production (with  Company) of "Moby Dick" won Best Fringe Production at the [[Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards]]. Jim Burke also won the Best New Play award for this adaptation. 

In 2003 the ship went on a national tour to 19 ports with a stage adaption of [[Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea]], to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dorset Echo'', 23 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Evening News'', 2 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; At first the audience sits on the [[quayside]], and the ''Fitzcarraldo'' represents the ''Abraham Lincoln''; later they sit in the ''Fitzcarraldo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s hold, which represents the inside of the ''Nautilus'', or occasionally the seabed.

Currently, due to mechanical deterioration to some of its driving components the ship resides in the [[Canning Dock]], which is part of Liverpool's [[Albert Dock]] complex, and is used as a static venue for many events including parties, [[cabaret]] evenings, live music, and drama.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Walk the Plank are currently making plans to sell the Fitzcarraldo, in order to focus on delivering large scale outdoor events, creating touring performance and continue to provide pyrotechnics elements and firework displays to both public sector and private corporate organisations.

==WTP Pyrotechnics==
'''WTP Pyrotechnics''' is a [[limited company]] who donate all their profits to Walk the Plank. This is a major source of income for Walk the Plank other than arts grants and donations. WTP Pyrotechnics creates [[fireshows]], [[firework]] displays, site-specific work, and outdoor spectacles – producing work in landlocked and waterside locations. They have created shows on canals and rivers, in harbours and parks and town centres in the UK and abroad.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Past projects include site-specific events, fireshows and aquatic spectacle, working with [[pyrotechnics]], machines, music, large images, and mobile structures, performance, and fire; usually, one-off specially-commissioned pieces created for a particular site or occasion. The work is often on, near, or by water, but they work inland also.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
