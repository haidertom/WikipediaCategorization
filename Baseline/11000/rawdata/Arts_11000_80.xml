'''Ablaq''' ({{lang-ar|أبلق}}; particolored; literally 'piebald'&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Islamic_Art_and_Architecture.html?id=i2elQgAACAAJ&amp;hl=en Islamic Art and Architecture], p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;) is an architectural style involving alternating or fluctuating rows of light and dark stone.&lt;ref name="Rabbat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/4.611/www/L10.html |title=10- The Emergence of the Citadel as Royal Residence: |work=[[Aga Khan]] program for Islamic architecture |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] School of Architecture |first1=Nasser O |last1=Rabbat |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hcebK67IRhkC&amp;pg=PA136 Dictionary of Islamic Architecture], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Records trace the beginnings of this type of masonry technique to the south parts of Syria.&lt;ref name="IslamicAblaq"/&gt; It is associated as an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term,&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; especially as related to Arabic Islamic architectural decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grvIugwjRJQC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=striped+masonry+of+Romanesque+architecture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uObeA2moOx&amp;sig=_RIwWoQjWubjyTkFwSDZ4o03jb8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OWglT8fuBKHw0gHvtuSTBA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ablaq&amp;f=false |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215172834/https://books.google.com/books?id=grvIugwjRJQC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=striped+masonry+of+Romanesque+architecture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uObeA2moOx&amp;sig=_RIwWoQjWubjyTkFwSDZ4o03jb8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OWglT8fuBKHw0gHvtuSTBA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 15, 2017 |title=Egypt and Syria in the Fatimid, Ayyubid and Mamluk eras |volume=3 |page=288 |first1=Urbain |last1=Vermeulen |first2=D. |last2=De Smet |first3=J. |last3=van Steenbergen|accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use of the term ''ablaq'' pertained to repairs of the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]] in 1109,&lt;ref name="IslamicAblaq"/&gt; but the technique itself was used much earlier.&lt;ref name="CordobaMosque"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamicspain.tv/Arts-and-Science/The-Culture-of-Al-Andalus/Architecture.htm |title=Architecture|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
This technique is a feature of [[Islamic architecture]].&lt;ref name="Rabbat"/&gt; The ablaq decorative technique is a derivative from the ancient [[Byzantine Empire]], whose [[Byzantine architecture|architecture]] used alternate sequential runs of light colored [[ashlar]] stone and darker colored orange brick.&lt;ref name="IslamicAblaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0002&amp;mode=full |title=Ablaq |work=Dictionary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Digital Library |first1=Andrew |last1=Petersen |accessdate=January 28, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known use of the term ablaq in building techniques is in masonry work in reconstruction improvements to the walls of the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of Damascus. According to records, these reconstruction masonry improvements to the north wall began in the early twelfth century.&lt;ref name="IslamicAblaq"/&gt; The local stone supply may have encouraged the use of alternating courses of light and dark stone. In the south part of [[Syria]] there is abundance of black [[basalt]] as well as white-colored [[limestone]]. The supplies of each are about equal, so it was natural that masonry techniques of balanced proportions were used.&lt;ref name="IslamicAblaq"/&gt;

The technique itself, however, was used much earlier, [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba]] being a notable example,&lt;ref name="CordobaMosque"/&gt; [[Medina Azahara]], and possibly [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], as well as the [[Dome of the Rock]].

The Mamluks utilized mottled light effects and  [[chiaroscuro]] in their buildings, and among the architectural elements that complemented it was ablaq.  Finely dressed [[ashlar]] stones was often combined with brickwork for vaults.  These Mamluk and Syrian elements were applied and shared by the [[Ayyubids]] and Crusaders in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt.&lt;ref name="Avendano"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.arkisabeato.multiply.multiplycontent.com/attachment/0/SOkraAoKCDYAAFFyAew1/Islamic%20Architecture%20Lecture%20Notes.pdf?nmid=118754735 |format=pdf |publisher=[[University of Santo Tomas]], College of Architecture |title=HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE 3, Islamic Architecture |first1=Clarissa L. |last1=Avendano |year=2008–2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1266&amp;nbsp;– 1269 [[Sultan of Egypt|Sultan]] [[Baibars|al-Zahir Baybars al-Bunduqdari]] built a mosque known as [[Mosque of al-Zahir Baybars]] or the Qasr Ablaq Palace which was constructed with alterations of light and dark masonry. Based on this mosque, ''ablaq'' as a masonry technique of alternate rows of light and dark, was fully in use in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="IslamicAblaq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hcebK67IRhkC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=ablaq+masonry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kFnW9gmiYs&amp;sig=Ztf3A9MGPvAYdZ5borC0icz0DaE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G2MkT_WGFMzhgge06MWqBA&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ablaq%20masonry&amp;f=false |title=Dictionary of Islamic Architecture |first1=Andrew |last1=Petersen |page=2 |isbn=0-415-21332-0 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |edition=Reprint |date=March 14, 2007|accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mamluk architecture]] of Syria, Egypt and Palestine adopted the ablaq technique in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. In these countries at about this time black and white stone were often used as well as red brick in recurring rows, giving a three colored striped building.&lt;ref name="IslamicAblaq"/&gt;

The ablaq masonry technique is used in the [[Azm Palace]] in [[Damascus]] and other buildings of the [[Ottoman period]]. In fact, Dr.Andrew Petersen, Director of Research in [[Islamic Archaeology]] at the [[University of Wales Lampeter]] states that ablaq (alternating courses of white [[limestone]] and black [[basalt]] is "A characteristic of the monumental masonry of [[Damascus, Syria|Damascus]].")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://islamic-arts.org/2011/damascus-history-arts-and-architecture/ |title=Damascus – history, arts and architecture |first1=Andrew |last1=Petersen |publisher=Islamic Arts &amp; Architecture |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Dome of the Rock in [[Jerusalem]], ablaq [[lintels]] in alternating red and white courses are combined to highlight the [[voussoir]]s of the Great Arch.{{sfn|Walls|1990|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GBfqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ablaq&amp;dq=Ablaq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V2IlT77MGZHpggf_re3kCA&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBg 18, 40, 144]}}  Jerusalem mamluk architecture (period 1250 AD to 1516 AD) include multi-colored masonry in white, yellow, red and black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hcebK67IRhkC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Mamluk+architecture+in+Jerusalem+include+ablaq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jmwlT_uxH8r20gHJjtWJCQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mamluk%20architecture%20in%20Jerusalem%20include%20ablaq&amp;f=false |first1=Andrew |last1=Petersen|title=Dictionary of Islamic Architecture |page=136 |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the marble ablaq treatments at the Dome are controversial, some theorizing them original, and some saying they were later additions (and differing then as to the dates and identity of the builders).&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/pisa.dor.htm |title=Pisa and the Dome of the Rock |edition=2nd |first1=Terry |last1=Allen |publisher=Solipsist Press |place=Occidental, California |year=2008 |format=electronic publication |isbn=0-944940-08-0|accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jordan]], the Mamluk fortified khan at [[Aqaba]] (ca 1145) is a medieval fortress modeled after those used by the [[Crusaders]]. It contains an arch above the protected entrance. The horseshoe arch has ablaq masonry, harkening to Mamluk architecture in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://islamic-arts.org/2011/hashemite-kingdom-of-jordan/ |title=Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan – Architecture &amp; History |work=Islamic Art &amp; Architecture |first1=Andrew |last1=Petersen |date=September 9, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pisa]]n [[ecclesiastical architecture|ecclesiastical]] monuments—particularly the [[Cathedral of Pisa]] and [[Church of San Sepolcro]] (commenced building 1113)—used ablaq, not simple "black and white in [[Revetment#Architecture and art history|revetment]]" between the conquest of Jerusalem in the [[First Crusade#Siege of Jerusalem|First Crusade]] (1099) and the completion of the latter ca. 1130. Various architectural motifs—ablaq, the [[zigzag]] arch, and voussoir (rippled and plain) were used. These embellishments were a direct appropriation of Moslem architecture, resulting from pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and war against the [[Saracen]] in the First Crusade. Those visitors to Jerusalem could see ablaq at the Dome of the Rock, and at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], as well as other examples that may no longer be extant. Thus zigzags (see [[Norman architecture]]) and ablaq became part of the repertoire of [[Romanesque architecture]].&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Terry |last1=Allen |title=A Classical Revival in Islamic Architecture |place=Wiesbaden |year=1986 |chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Carolina architect [[John Henry Devereux]] created a striking black and white ablaq edifice in the [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]]. However, that original conception has since been plastered over in [[monochrome]] red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/charleston/S10817710004/index_3.htm |title=Charleston Historic District |work=National Register Historic Properties in South Carolina |publisher = South Carolina Department of Archives and History |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adelaide Anne Procter''' (30 October 1825&amp;nbsp;– 2 February 1864) was an English poet and [[philanthropist]]. She worked prominently on behalf of unemployed women and the homeless, and was actively involved with [[feminist]] groups and journals. Procter never married. She became unhealthy, possibly due to her charity work, and died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 38.

Procter's literary career began when she was a teenager; her poems were primarily published in [[Charles Dickens]]'s periodicals ''[[Household Words]]'' and ''[[All the Year Round]]'' and later  published in book form. Her charity work and her conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]] appear to have strongly influenced her poetry, which deals most commonly with such subjects as homelessness, poverty, and [[fallen woman|fallen women]].

Procter was the favourite poet of [[Queen Victoria]]. Her poetry went through numerous editions in the 19th century; [[Coventry Patmore]] called her the most popular poet of the day, after [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; Her poems were set to music and made into hymns, and were published in the United States and Germany as well as in England. Nonetheless, by the early 20th century her reputation had diminished, and few modern critics have given her work attention. Those who have, however, argue that Procter's work is significant, in part for what it reveals about how [[Women in the Victorian era|Victorian women]] expressed otherwise repressed feelings.

==Life==
Adelaide Anne Procter was born at 25 [[Bedford Square]] in the [[Bloomsbury]] district of London, on 30 October 1825 to the poet [[Bryan Procter|Bryan Waller Procter]] and his wife Anne (''née'' Skepper).&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;Gregory (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The family had strong literary ties: novelist [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] enjoyed her visits to the Procter household,&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 5"&gt;Gregory (1998), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and Procter's father was friends with poet [[Leigh Hunt]], essayist [[Charles Lamb]], and novelist [[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref name="O'Gorman"&gt;O'Gorman (2004), 314.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being acquainted with poet [[William Wordsworth]]&lt;ref&gt;Blair (2004), 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and critic [[William Hazlitt]].&lt;ref name=H&amp;W1&gt;Hickok and Woodall (1998), 519.&lt;/ref&gt; Family friend [[Bessie Rayner Parkes|Bessie Rayner Belloc]] wrote in 1895 that "everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to flow in and out of the house. The Kembles, the Macreadys, the Rossettis, the Dickens {{sic}}, the Thackerays, never seemed to be exactly visitors, but to belong to the place."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1999), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Author and actress [[Fanny Kemble]] wrote that young Procter "looks like a poet's child, and a poet ... [with] a preter-naturally {{sic}} thoughtful, mournful expression for such a little child".&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 5" /&gt;

Dickens spoke highly of Procter's quick intelligence. By his account, the young Procter mastered without difficulty the subjects to which she turned her attention:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When she was quite a young child, she learnt with facility several of the problems of [[Euclid]]. As she grew older, she acquired the French, Italian, and German languages ... piano-forte ... [and] drawing. But, as soon as she had completely vanquished the difficulties of any one branch of study, it was her way to lose interest in it, and pass to another.&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3"&gt;Dickens (1866), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A voracious reader,&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3" /&gt; Procter was largely self-taught, though she studied at [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] in Harley Street in 1850.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; The college had been founded in 1848 by [[Frederick Denison Maurice|Frederick Maurice]], a [[Christian Socialist]]; the faculty included novelist [[Charles Kingsley]], composer [[John Hullah]], and writer [[Henry Morley]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victoria regia, poetry and prose (1861).djvu|left|thumb|upright|alt= Book cover showing a large, deep blue volume. The words "Victoria Regia" are prominent in the center, in a large, heavy, old-fashioned font, with gold embossed lettering. The title is surrounded by gold-embossed scrolls.|The 1861 edition of the ''Victoria Regia'', edited by Procter]]
Procter showed a love of poetry from an early age, carrying with her while still a young child a "tiny album ... into which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mother's hand before she herself could write ... as another little girl might have carried a doll".&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3" /&gt; Procter published her first poem while still a teenager; the poem, "Ministering Angels", appeared in ''Heath's Book of Beauty'' in 1843.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; In 1853 she submitted work to Dickens's ''[[Household Words]]'' under the name "Mary Berwick", wishing that her work be judged on its own merits rather than in relation to Dickens's friendship with her father;&lt;ref&gt;Dickens (1866), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens did not learn "Berwick's" identity till the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens (1866), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's publication began Procter's long association with Dickens's periodicals; in all, Procter published 73 poems in ''Household Words'' and 7 poems in ''[[All the Year Round]]'',&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; most of which were collected into her first two volumes of poetry, both entitled ''Legends and Lyrics''. She was also published in ''Good Words'' and ''Cornhill.''&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3" /&gt; As well as writing poetry, Procter was the editor of the journal ''Victoria Regia'', which became the showpiece of the [[Victoria Press]], "an explicitly feminist publishing venture".&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851,&lt;ref&gt;Bessie Rayner Parkes Belloc gives the date as 1849; Dickens as 1851 in his "Introduction" to the 1866 edition of ''Legends and Lyrics''. The introduction was read and approved by Procter's mother; Gill Gregory therefore argues that Dickens's date is the correct one (Gregory [1998], 8).&lt;/ref&gt; Procter converted to [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="O'Gorman" /&gt; Following her conversion, Procter became extremely active in several charitable and feminist causes. She became a member of the [[History of feminism#The ladies of Langham Place|Langham Place Group]], which set out to improve conditions for women, and was friends with [[feminist]]s [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]] (later Bessie Rayner Belloc) and [[Barbara Bodichon|Barbara Leigh Smith]], later Barbara Bodichon.&lt;ref name="O'Gorman" /&gt; Procter helped found the ''[[English Woman's Journal]]'' in 1858 and, in 1859, the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women,&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; both of which focused on expanding women's economic and employment opportunities. Though on paper Procter was merely one member among many, fellow-member [[Jessie Boucherett]] considered her to be the "animating spirit" of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Her third volume of poetry, ''A Chaplet of Verses'' (1861), was published for the benefit of a Catholic Night Refuge for Women and Children that had been founded  in 1860 at Providence Row in [[East End of London|East London]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter became engaged in 1858, according to a letter that her friend [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] wrote to his daughters that year. The identity of Procter's fiancé remains unknown, and the proposed marriage never took place.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her German biographer Ferdinand Janku, the engagement seems to have lasted several years before being broken off by Procter's fiancé.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Gill Gregory suggests that Procter may have been a [[lesbian]] and in love with [[Matilda Hays]], a fellow member of the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women;&lt;ref name="Gregory25"&gt;Gregory (1998), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; other critics have called Procter's relationship with Hays "emotionally intense."&lt;ref name=H123&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter's first volume of poetry, ''Legends and Lyrics'' (1858) was dedicated to Hays and that same year Procter wrote a poem titled "To M.M.H."&lt;ref&gt;Later published in ''Legends and Lyrics'' as "A Retrospect".&lt;/ref&gt; in which Procter "expresses love for Hays ... [Hays was a] novelist and translator of [[George Sand]] and a controversial figure ... [who] dressed in men's clothes and had lived with the sculptor [[Harriet Hosmer]] in Rome earlier in the 1850s."&lt;ref name="Gregory25" /&gt; While several men showed interest in her, Procter never married.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter fell ill in 1862; Dickens and others have suggested that her illness was due to her extensive charity work, which "appears to have unduly taxed her strength".&lt;ref&gt;Dickens (1866), 9; Lennox (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to improve her health by taking a [[Water cure (therapy)|cure]] at [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] failed.&lt;ref name="Lennox" /&gt; On 3 February 1864, Procter died of [[tuberculosis]], having been bed-ridden for almost a year.&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 1"&gt;Gregory (1998), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Her death was described in the press as a "national calamity".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gray (1999), 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Lennox" /&gt;

==Literary career==
Procter's poetry was strongly influenced by her religious beliefs and charity work; homelessness, poverty, and [[fallen women]] are frequent themes. Procter's prefaces to her volumes of poetry stress the misery of the conditions under which the poor lived, as do poems such as "The Homeless Poor":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In that very street, at that same hour,&lt;br /&gt;
In the bitter air and drifting sleet,&lt;br /&gt;
Crouching in a doorway was a mother,&lt;br /&gt;
With her children shuddering at her feet.

She was silent&amp;nbsp;– who would hear her pleading?&lt;br /&gt;
Men and beasts were housed&amp;nbsp;– but she must stay&lt;br /&gt;
Houseless in the great and pitiless city,&lt;br /&gt;
Till the dawning of the winter day. (51–58)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Procter's Catholicism also influenced her choice of images and symbols;&lt;ref name=H127&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter often uses references to the Virgin Mary, for example, to "introduce secular and Protestant readers to the possibility that a heavenly order critiques Victorian gender ideology's power structure."&lt;ref name=H127 /&gt;

Procter wrote several poems about war (the majority of poems published on this topic in ''Household Words'' were by Procter&lt;ref&gt;Markovits (2005), 472.&lt;/ref&gt;), although she rarely deals directly with the topic, preferring to leave war "in the background, something to be inferred rather than stated."&lt;ref name=M473&gt;Markovits (2005), 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these poems portray conflict as something "that might unite a nation that had been divided by class distinctions."&lt;ref name=M473 /&gt;

According to critic Gill Gregory, Procter "does not overtly ponder the vexed question of the poet, particularly the woman poet and her accession to fame",&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; unlike many other women poets of the time, such as [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]. Procter is instead primarily concerned with the working classes, particularly working-class women, and with "emotions of women antagonists which have not fully found expression".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter's work often embodies a Victorian aesthetic of sentimentality,&lt;ref&gt;Mason (2006), 82, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to Francis O'Gorman, does so with "peculiar strength"; Procter employs emotional affect without simplification, holding "emotional energy [in tension] ... against complications and nuances."&lt;ref name="O'Gorman" /&gt; Procter's language is simple; she expressed to a friend a "morbid terror of being misunderstood and misinterpreted",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; and her poetry is marked by "simplicity, directness, and clarity of expression".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter was "fabulously popular"&lt;ref name="Gray682"&gt;Gray (1999), 682.&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-19th century; she was [[Queen Victoria]]'s favourite poet&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 1" /&gt; and [[Coventry Patmore]] stated that the demand for her work was greater than that for any other poet, excepting [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; Readers valued Procter's poems for their plainness of expression,&lt;ref&gt;Belloc (1895), 173.&lt;/ref&gt; although they were considered "not so very original in thought; [their merit is that] they are indeed the utterances 'of a believing heart', pouring out its fulness."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1868), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter herself expressed little ambition about her work: her friend Bessie Raynor Belloc thought that Procter was pained that her reputation as a poet had outstripped her father's, and quoted Procter as saying that "Papa is a poet. I only write verses."&lt;ref&gt;Belloc (1895), 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter's popularity continued after her death; the first volume of ''Legends and Lyrics'' went through 19 editions by 1881, and the second through 14 editions by the same year.&lt;ref name="Gray682" /&gt; Many of her poems were made into hymns&lt;ref name="Lennox"&gt;Lennox (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise set to music.  Among these was "[[The Lost Chord]]", which [[Arthur Sullivan]] set to music in 1877; this song was the most commercially successful of the 1870s and 1880s in both Britain and the United States.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Scott (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Her work was also published in the United States and translated into German.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; By 1938, Procter's reputation had fallen so far that a textbook could mention her poems only to pronounce them "stupid, trivial and not worthy of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Poetry'', 1938, quoted in Psomiades (2000), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as Cheri Larsen Hoeckley, Kathleen Hickok, and Natalie Joy Woodall argue that the demise of Procter's reputation is due at least in part to the way Charles Dickens characterized her as a "model middle-class domestic angel"&lt;ref name=H125&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 125.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "fragile and modest saint"&lt;ref name=H&amp;W520&gt;Hickok and Woodall (1998), 520.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than as an "active feminist and strong poet."&lt;ref name=H&amp;W520 /&gt; Emma Mason argues that although Dickens's portrayal of Procter "extinguished modern interest" in her, it also "has helped rescue Procter from the kind of endless conjecture about her private life that has confused studies of women like [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon|Letitia Landon]]."&lt;ref name=Mason81&gt;Mason (2006), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern critics have given Procter's work little attention. The few critics who have examined Procter's poetry generally find it important for the way that she overtly expresses conventional sentiments while covertly undermining them. According to [[Isobel Armstrong]], Procter's poetry, like that of many 19th-century women poets, employs conventional ideas and modes of expression without necessarily espousing them in entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong (1996), 251, 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis O'Gorman cites "A Legend of Provence" as an example of a poem with this kind of "double relationship with the structures of gender politics it seems to affirm."&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman (2004), 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics since Armstrong agree that Procter's poetry, while ladylike on the surface, shows signs of repressed emotions and desires.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 130; Mason (2006), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Kirstie Blair states that the suppression of emotion in Procter's work makes the narrative poems all the more powerful,&lt;ref&gt;Blair (2004), 135.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gill Gregory argues that Procter's poetry often explores female sexuality in an unconventional way, while as often voicing anxiety about sexual desires.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1996), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Gray criticizes the fact that the few discussions of Procter's poetry that do exist focus primarily on gender, arguing that the "range and formal inventiveness of this illuminatingly representative Victorian poet have remained largely unexplored."&lt;ref name="Gray682" /&gt;

'''Amedeo Clemente Modigliani''' ({{IPA-it|ameˈdɛːo modiʎˈʎaːni}}; 12 July 1884 – 24 January 1920) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Jewish]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[Sculpture|sculptor]] who worked mainly in France. He is known for portraits and nudes in a [[modern art|modern]] style characterized by elongation of faces, necks, and figures that were not received well during his lifetime but later found acceptance. Modigliani spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1906 he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. By 1912 Modigliani was exhibiting highly stylized sculptures with Cubists of the [[Section d'Or]] group at the [[Salon d'Automne]].
 
Modigliani's œuvre includes paintings and drawings. From 1909 to 1914 he devoted himself mainly to sculpture. His main subject was portraits and full figures, both in the images and in the sculptures. Modigliani had little success while alive, but after his death achieved great popularity. He died at age 35 in Paris of [[tuberculous meningitis|tubercular meningitis]].

==Family and early life==
[[File:Modigliani Birthplace Livorno.jpg|thumb|upright|Modigliani's birthplace in [[Livorno]]]]

Modigliani was born into a [[Sephardic Jewish]] family in [[Livorno]], [[Italy]]. A port city, Livorno had long served as a refuge for those persecuted for their religion, and was home to a large [[History of the Jews in Livorno|Jewish community]]. His maternal great-great-grandfather, Solomon Garsin, had immigrated to Livorno in the 18th century as a refugee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 13| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modigliani's mother, Eugénie Garsin, born and raised in [[Marseille]], was descended from an intellectual, scholarly family of Sephardic ancestry that for generations had lived along the Mediterranean coastline. Fluent in many languages, her ancestors were authorities on sacred Jewish texts and had founded a school of [[Talmud]]ic studies. Family legend traced the family lineage to the 17th-century Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]. The family business was a credit agency with branches in Livorno, Marseille, Tunis, and London, though their fortunes ebbed and flowed.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, ''Modigilani,'' Alfred Knopf, 2011, pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond the Myth"&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=030010264X Klein, Mason, et al., ''Modigliani: Beyond the Myth'', page 197. The Jewish Museum and Yale University Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modigliani’s father, Flaminio, was a member of an Italian Jewish family of successful businessmen and entrepreneurs. While not as culturally sophisticated as the Garsins, they knew how to invest in and develop thriving business endeavors. When the Garsin and Modigliani families announced the engagement of their children, Flaminio was a wealthy young mining [[engineer]]. He managed the mine in Sardinia and also managed the almost {{convert|30000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of timberland the family owned.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,''pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

A reversal in fortune occurred to this prosperous family in 1883. An economic downturn in the price of metal plunged the Modiglianis into bankruptcy. Ever resourceful, Modigliani’s mother used her social contacts to establish a school and, along with her two sisters, made the school into a successful enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,'' pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Amedeo Modigliani was the fourth child, whose birth coincided with the disastrous financial collapse of his father's business interests. Amedeo's birth saved the family from ruin; according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or a mother with a newborn child. The bailiffs entered the family's home just as Eugenia went into labour; the family protected their most valuable assets by piling them on top of her.

Modigliani had a close relationship with his mother, who taught him at home until he was 10. Beset with health problems after an attack of [[pleurisy]] when he was about 11, a few years later he developed a case of [[typhoid fever]]. When he was 16 he was taken ill again and contracted the [[tuberculosis]] which would later claim his life. After Modigliani recovered from the second bout of pleurisy, his mother took him on a tour of southern Italy: [[Naples]], [[Capri]], [[Rome]] and [[Amalfi]], then north to [[Florence]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Fifield | first = William | date = 19 June 1978 | title = Modigliani: A Biography | publisher = W.H. Allen | page = 316| isbn = 0-491-02164-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Diehl | first = Gaston | date = Jul 1989|edition=Reissue | title = Modigliani | publisher = Crown Pub | page = 96| isbn = 0-517-50798-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Soby | first = James Thrall | date = Sep 1977 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = New York | publisher = Arno P | page = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother was, in many ways, instrumental in his ability to pursue art as a vocation. When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: "The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall have to wait and see what is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson | page = 14| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art student years==
Modigliani is known to have drawn and painted from a very early age, and thought himself "already a painter", his mother wrote,&lt;ref name="Mann 1980 12"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; even before beginning formal studies. Despite her misgivings that launching him on a course of studying art would impinge upon his other studies, his mother indulged the young Modigliani's passion for the subject.

At the age of fourteen, while sick with typhoid fever, he raved in his delirium that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the [[Palazzo Pitti]] and the [[Uffizi]] in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the [[Italian Renaissance]] masters, the tales he had heard about the great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might never get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, [[Guglielmo Micheli]].

===Micheli and the Macchiaioli===

[[File:Modigliani in Venice - Calle dell'Avogaria (a S.Sebastiano), 1633.jpg|thumb|His home in Venice.]]
Modigliani worked in Micheli's Art School from 1898 to 1900. Among his colleagues in that studio would have been [[Llewelyn Lloyd (painter)|Llewelyn Lloyd]], [[Giulio Cesare Vinzio]], [[Manlio Martinelli]], [[Gino Romiti]], [[Renato Natali]], and [[Oscar Ghiglia]]. Here his earliest formal artistic instruction took place in an atmosphere steeped in a study of the styles and themes of 19th-century Italian art. In his earliest Parisian work, traces of this influence, and that of his studies of [[Renaissance art]], can still be seen. His nascent work was shaped as much by such artists as [[Giovanni Boldini]] as by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]].

Modigliani showed great promise while with Micheli, and ceased his studies only when he was forced to, by the onset of tuberculosis.

In 1901, whilst in Rome, Modigliani admired the work of [[Domenico Morelli]], a painter of dramatic religious and literary scenes. Morelli had served as an inspiration for a group of iconoclasts who were known by the title "the [[Macchiaioli]]" (from ''macchia''&amp;nbsp;—"dash of colour", or, more derogatively, "stain"), and Modigliani had already been exposed to the influences of the Macchiaioli. This localized [[Landscape art|landscape]] movement reacted against the bourgeois stylings of the academic genre painters. While sympathetically connected to (and actually pre-dating) the [[French Impressionism|French Impressionists]], the Macchiaioli did not make the same impact upon international art culture as did the contemporaries and followers of [[Monet]], and are today largely forgotten outside Italy.

Modigliani's connection with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli was not only a Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous [[Giovanni Fattori]], a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint ''[[en plein air]]'', but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in cafés, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 16| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modigliani chose a proto-[[Cubism|Cubist]] palette more akin to [[Cézanne]] than to the Macchiaioli.

While with Micheli, Modigliani studied not only landscape, but also portraiture, still life, and the nude. His fellow students recall that the last was where he displayed his greatest talent, and apparently this was not an entirely academic pursuit for the teenager: when not painting nudes, he was occupied with seducing the household maid.&lt;ref name="Mann 1980 12" /&gt;

Despite his rejection of the Macchiaioli approach, Modigliani nonetheless found favour with his teacher, who referred to him as "Superman", a pet name reflecting the fact that Modigliani was not only quite adept at his art, but also that he regularly quoted from Nietzsche's ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. Fattori himself would often visit the studio, and approved of the young artist's innovations.&lt;ref name="Mann-1980-16"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Modigliani continued what was to be a lifelong infatuation with [[life drawing]], enrolling in the Scuola Libera di Nudo, or "Free School of Nude Studies", of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Accademia di Belle Arti]] in Florence. A year later, while still suffering from tuberculosis, he moved to Venice, where he registered to study at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Regia Accademia ed Istituto di Belle Arti]].
It is in Venice that he first smoked [[hashish]] and, rather than studying, began to spend time frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these lifestyle choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices do seem to be more than simple [[teenage rebellion]], or the cliched [[hedonism]] and [[bohemianism]] that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].

===Early literary influences===
Having been exposed to erudite philosophical literature as a young boy under the tutelage of Isaco Garsin, his maternal grandfather, he continued to read and be influenced through his art studies by the writings of Nietzsche, [[Baudelaire]], [[Giosuè Carducci|Carducci]], [[Comte de Lautréamont]], and others, and developed the belief that the only route to true creativity was through defiance and disorder.

Letters that he wrote from his 'sabbatical' in Capri in 1901 clearly indicate that he is being more and more influenced by the thinking of Nietzsche. In these letters, he advised friend Oscar Ghiglia;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(hold sacred all) which can exalt and excite your intelligence... (and) ... seek to provoke ... and to perpetuate ... these fertile stimuli, because they can push the intelligence to its maximum creative power.&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 17"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 17| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The work of [[Lautréamont]] was equally influential at this time. This doomed poet's ''[[Les Chants de Maldoror]]'' became the seminal work for the Parisian [[Surrealists]] of Modigliani's generation, and the book became Modigliani's favourite to the extent that he learnt it by heart.&lt;ref name="Mann-1980-16" /&gt; The poetry of Lautréamont is characterized by the juxtaposition of fantastical elements, and by sadistic imagery; the fact that Modigliani was so taken by this text in his early teens gives a good indication of his developing tastes. Baudelaire and [[D'Annunzio]] similarly appealed to the young artist, with their interest in corrupted beauty, and the expression of that insight through [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] imagery.

Modigliani wrote to Ghiglia extensively from Capri, where his mother had taken him to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani's mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, and it is likely that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | pages = 19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear friend, I write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself. I am the prey of great powers that surge forth and then disintegrate ... A [[bourgeois]] told me today–insulted me–that I or at least my brain was lazy. It did me good. I should like such a warning every morning upon awakening: but they cannot understand us nor can they understand life...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Paris==

=== Arrival ===
[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Portrait of Juan Gris.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Juan Gris]]'', 1915]]

In 1906, Modigliani moved to Paris, then the focal point of the [[avant-garde]]. In fact, his arrival at the centre of artistic experimentation coincided with the arrival of two other foreigners who were also to leave their marks upon the art world: [[Gino Severini]] and [[Juan Gris]].

He later befriended [[Jacob Epstein]], they aimed to set up a studio together with a shared vision to create a Temple of Beauty to be enjoyed by all, for which Modigliani created drawings and paintings of the intended stone caryatids for ‘The Pillars of Tenderness’ which would support the imagined temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|work=The New Art Gallery Walsall Catalogue|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-05-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Bateau-Lavoir, circa 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] in 1910]]
Modigliani [[Squatting|squat]]ted in [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[commune]] for penniless artists in [[Montmartre]], renting himself a studio in Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists' quarter of Montmartre was characterized by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented—initially, at least—as one would expect the son of a family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to someone with a finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in his brown corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 17" /&gt;

When he first arrived in Paris, he wrote home regularly to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the [[Académie Colarossi]], and he drank wine in moderation. He was at that time considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the asocial.&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 17" /&gt; He is noted to have commented, upon meeting [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 17" /&gt;

===Transformation===
Within a year of arriving in Paris, however, his demeanour and reputation had changed dramatically. He transformed himself from a dapper academician artist into a sort of prince of vagabonds.

The poet and journalist [[Louis Latourette]], upon visiting the artist's previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered the place in upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked his life and his training up to that point.

Not only did he remove all the trappings of his bourgeois heritage from his studio, but he also set about destroying practically all of his own early work, which he described as "Childish baubles, done when I was a dirty bourgeois".&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 19"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 19| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation for this violent rejection of his earlier self is the subject of considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181, 183&lt;/ref&gt; Tuberculosis—the leading cause of death in France by 1900&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;—was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a façade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

Modigliani's use of drink and drugs intensified from about 1914 onward. After years of remission and recurrence, this was the period during which the symptoms of his tuberculosis worsened, signaling that the disease had reached an advanced stage.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Nu Couché au coussin Bleu.jpg|thumb|''Nu Couché au coussin Bleu'', one of the finest examples of reclining nudes by Modigliani, 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/.../279754.pdf |title=Women in Art, PDF|publisher=shareholder.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}{{dl|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

He sought the company of artists such as [[Maurice Utrillo|Utrillo]] and [[Chaim Soutine|Soutine]], seeking acceptance and validation for his work from his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 19" /&gt; Modigliani's behavior stood out even in these [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] surroundings: he carried on frequent affairs, drank heavily, and used [[absinthe]] and [[hashish]]. While drunk, he would sometimes strip himself naked at social gatherings.&lt;ref name="werner-24"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1985 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = New York | publisher = Harry N. Abrams, Inc. | isbn = 0-8109-1416-6 | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Paris, aged 35. He became the epitome of the tragic artist, creating a posthumous legend almost as well known as that of [[Vincent van Gogh]].

During the 1920s, in the wake of Modigliani's career and spurred on by comments by [[André Salmon]] crediting hashish and absinthe with the genesis of Modigliani's style, many hopefuls tried to emulate his "success" by embarking on a path of substance abuse and bohemian excess. Salmon claimed that whereas Modigliani was a totally pedestrian artist when sober, "...from the day that he abandoned himself to certain forms of debauchery, an unexpected light came upon him, transforming his art. From that day on, he became one who must be counted among the masters of living art."&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 20"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 20| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some art historians suggest&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 20" /&gt; that it is entirely possible that Modigliani would have achieved even greater artistic heights had he not been immured in, and destroyed by, his own self-indulgences.

===Output===
During his early years in Paris, Modigliani worked at a furious pace. He was constantly sketching, making as many as a hundred drawings a day. However, many of his works were lost—destroyed by him as inferior, left behind in his frequent changes of address, or given to girlfriends who did not keep them.&lt;ref name="werner-24" /&gt;

He was first influenced by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], but around 1907 he became fascinated with the work of [[Paul Cézanne]]. Eventually he developed his own unique style, one that cannot be adequately categorized with those of other artists.

He met the first serious love of his life, Russian poet [[Anna Akhmatova]], in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and although 21-year-old Anna had recently married, they began an affair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/11532201/Modigliani-and-the-Russian-beauty-the-affair-that-changed-him.html "Modigliani and the Russian beauty: the affair that changed him"] Retrieved 21 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Anna was tall with dark hair, pale skin and grey-green eyes: she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other. After a year, however, Anna returned to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=wycoiv9BJ0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Secrest,+Meryle,+Modigliani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj93sOdgdfYAhWCVBQKHZDCDGoQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Secrest%2C%20Meryle%2C%20Modigliani&amp;f=false Secrest, Meryle, ''Modigliani''], Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2011, p. 136, {{ISBN|0307595471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
[[File:Salon d'Automne 1912, Paris, works exhibited by Kupka, Modigliani, Csaky, Picabia, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier.jpg|thumb|330px|Four sculptures by Modigliani were exhibited at the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] along with the Cubists.

Other works are shown by [[František Kupka]] (''Fugue in Two Colors''), [[Francis Picabia]] (''The Spring''), [[Jean Metzinger]] (''[[Dancer in a Café]]''), and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] (''Mountaineers Attacked by Bears'').]]
In 1909, Modigliani returned home to Livorno, sickly and tired from his wild lifestyle. Soon he was back in Paris, this time renting a [[studio]] in [[Montparnasse]]. He originally saw himself as a sculptor rather than a painter, and was encouraged to continue after [[Paul Guillaume]], an ambitious young art dealer, took an interest in his work and introduced him to sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. He was Constantin Brâncuși's disciple for one year.

Although a series of Modigliani's sculptures were exhibited in the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1912, by 1914 he abandoned sculpting and focused solely on his painting, a move precipitated by the difficulty in acquiring sculptural materials due to the [[World War I|outbreak of war]], and by Modigliani's physical debilitation.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Myth" /&gt;

In June 2010 Modigliani's ''[[Tête (sculpture)|Tête]]'', a limestone carving of a woman's head, became the [[List of most expensive sculptures|third most expensive sculpture ever sold]].

===Friends and influences===
Modigliani painted a series of portraits of contemporary artists and friends in Montparnasse: [[Chaim Soutine]], [[Moïse Kisling]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Marie Vorobieff|Marie "Marevna" Vorobyev-Stebeslka]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], all sat for stylized renditions.

==The war years==
[[File:Modigliani, Picasso and André Salmon.jpg|thumb|left|Modigliani, [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[André Salmon]], 1916]]

At the outset of [[World War I]], Modigliani tried to enlist in the army but was refused because of his poor health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=080219740X Dan Franck, ''Bohemian Paris: Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse, and the Birth of Modern Art''], Open Road, Grove/Atlantic, 2007, {{ISBN|080219740X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as ''Modì'' (which plays on the French word 'maudit', meaning 'cursed') by many Parisians, but as ''Dedo'' to his family and friends, Modigliani was a handsome man, and attracted much female attention.&lt;ref name="Modigliani"&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=8809042077 Fiorella Nicosia, Amedeo Modigliani, ''Modigliani''], Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005, pp. 38, 74, {{ISBN|8809042077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women came and went until [[Beatrice Hastings]] entered his life. She stayed with him for almost two years, was the subject of several of his portraits, including ''Madame Pompadour'', and the object of much of his drunken wrath.&lt;ref name="Modigliani" /&gt;

When the British painter [[Nina Hamnett]] arrived in Montparnasse in 1914, on her first evening there the smiling man at the next table in the café introduced himself as "Modigliani, painter and Jew". They became great friends.

In 1916, Modigliani befriended the [[Poland|Polish]] poet and art dealer [[Léopold Zborowski]] and his wife Anna. Zborowski became Modigliani's primary art dealer and friend during the artist's final years, helping him financially, and also organizing his show in Paris in 1917.

===The 1917 Paris Show===
The several dozen nudes Modigliani painted between 1916 and 1919 constitute many of his best-known works. This series of nudes was commissioned by Modigliani's dealer and friend Léopold Zborowski, who lent the artist use of his apartment, supplied models and painting materials, and paid him between fifteen and twenty francs each day for his work.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Mason, et al., 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings from this arrangement were thus different from his previous depictions of friends and lovers in that they were funded by Zborowski either for his own collection, as a favor to his friend, or with an eye to their "commercial potential", rather than originating from the artist's personal circle of acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Mason, et al., 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paris show of 1917 was Modigliani's only solo exhibition during his life, and is "notorious" in modern art history for its sensational public reception and the attendant issues of obscenity.&lt;ref name="K2"&gt;Klein, Mason, et al., 56&lt;/ref&gt; The show was closed by police on its opening day, but continued thereafter, most likely after the removal of paintings from the gallery's streetfront window.&lt;ref name="K2"/&gt;

''[[Nude Sitting on a Divan]]'' is one of a series of nudes painted by Modigliani in 1917 that created a sensation when exhibited in Paris that year. According to the catalogue description from the 2010 sale of the painting at Sotheby's, seven nudes were exhibited in the 1917 show.

''[[Nu couché]]'' realized $170,405,000 at a [[Christie's]], New York, sale on 9 November 2015, a record for a Modigliani painting and placing it high among the [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive paintings ever sold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robin Pgrebin and Scott Reyburn|title=With $170.4 Million Sale at Auction, Modigliani Work Joins Rarefied Nine-Figure Club|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/arts/with-170-4-million-sale-at-auction-modigliani-work-joins-rarefied-nine-figure-club.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nice===
On a trip to [[Nice]] which had been conceived and organized by Zborowski, Modigliani, Foujita and other artists tried to sell their works to rich tourists. Modigliani managed to sell a few pictures, but only for a few francs each. Despite this, during this time he produced most of the paintings that later became his most popular and valued works.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

During his lifetime, he sold a number of his works, but never for any great amount of money. What funds he did receive soon vanished for his habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-modigliani-amedeo.htm|title=Amedeo Modigliani Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|newspaper=The Art Story|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jeanne Hébuterne==
[[File:Jeanne Hebuterne seated.jpg|thumb|[[Jeanne Hébuterne]]]]
In the spring of 1917, the Russian sculptor [[Chana Orloff]] introduced him to a beautiful 19-year-old art student named [[Jeanne Hébuterne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen/exposiciones/WebExposiciones/2008/modigliani/fundacion/fundacion9_ing.html|title=Photo|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Museo Thyssen – Bornemisza|accessdate=June 8, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229014847/http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen/exposiciones/WebExposiciones/2008/modigliani/fundacion/fundacion9_ing.html|archivedate=February 29, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had posed for [[Tsuguharu Foujita]]. From a conservative [[bourgeois]] background, Hébuterne was renounced by her devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family for her liaison with Modigliani, whom they saw as little more than a debauched derelict. Despite her family's objections, soon they were living together.

Modigliani ended his relationship with the English poet and art critic Beatrice Hastings and a short time later Hébuterne and Modigliani moved together into a studio on the Rue de la Grande Chaumière. Jeanne began to pose for him and appears in several of his paintings. Jeanne Hébuterne became a principal subject for Modigliani's art.

[[File:Amedeo Modigliani, 1919, Jeanne Hébuterne, oil on canvas, 91.4 x 73 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|Amedeo Modigliani, 1919, ''Jeanne Hébuterne'', oil on canvas, 91.4 x 73 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
On December 3, 1917, Modigliani's first one-man [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] opened at the [[Berthe Weill]] Gallery in Paris. The chief of the Paris police was scandalized by Modigliani's nudes and forced him to close the exhibition within a few hours after its opening.

Towards the end of the First World War, early in 1918, Modigliani left Paris with Hébuterne to escape from the war and travelled to Nice and Cagnes-sur-Mer. They would spend a year in France. During that time they had a busy social life with many friends, including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[André Derain]]. [[File:Porträt der Jeanne Hébuterne, Amedeo Modigliani.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Jeanne Hébuterne]], 1918]] After he and Hébuterne moved to Nice on November 29, 1918, she gave birth to a daughter whom they named [[Jeanne Modigliani|Jeanne]] (1918–1984). In May 1919 they returned to Paris with their infant daughter and moved into an apartment on the rue de la Grande Chaumière.
 
Hébuterne became pregnant again. Modigliani then got engaged to her, but Jeanne's parents were against the marriage, especially because of Modigliani's reputation as an alcoholic and drug user. However, Modigliani officially recognized her daughter as his child. The wedding plans were shattered independently of Jeanne's parents' resistance when Modigliani discovered he had a severe form of tuberculosis.

==Death and funeral==

Although he continued to paint, Modigliani's health deteriorated rapidly, and his alcohol-induced blackouts became more frequent.

In 1920, after not hearing from him for several days, a neighbour checked on the family and found Modigliani in bed delirious and holding onto Hébuterne. A doctor was summoned, but little could be done because Modigliani was in the final stage of his disease, [[tubercular meningitis]]. He died on January 24, 1920, at the Hôpital de la Charité.

There was an enormous funeral, attended by many from the artistic communities in Montmartre and Montparnasse. When Modigliani died, twenty-one-year-old Hébuterne was eight months pregnant with their second child.

A day later, Hébuterne was taken to her parents' home. There, inconsolable, she threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, a day after Modigliani's death, killing herself and her unborn child. Modigliani was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]]. Hébuterne was buried at the [[Cimetière de Bagneux]] near [[Paris]], and it was not until 1930 that her embittered family allowed her body to be moved to rest beside Modigliani. A single tombstone honors them both. His epitaph reads: "Struck down by death at the moment of glory". Her's reads: "Devoted companion to the extreme sacrifice".&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Linda |last=Lappin |authorlink=Linda Lappin |date=June 22, 2002 |title=Missing person in Montparnasse: The case of Jeanne Hebuterne |journal=Literary Review |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=785–811 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91040705.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing only one solo exhibition in his life and giving his work away in exchange for meals in restaurants, Modigliani died destitute.

===Influences===

The linear form of African sculpture and the depictive humanism of the figurative [[Renaissance art|Renaissance painters]] informed his work. Working during that fertile period of “isms,” [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism]], Modigliani did not choose to be categorized within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas creating works not to shock and outrage, but to say, “This is what I see.”

More appreciated over the years by collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual [[avant-garde]] of the art world. One can say he recognized the merit of [[Jean Cocteau]]’s proclamation: “Ne t'attardes pas avec l'avant-garde” (“Don’t wait for the avant-garde”).&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, ''Modigliani'', Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, pp. 346–47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pseudo-goitre]], a medical condition is also known as Modigliani syndrome. This name was derived from the curved neck of women in Modigliani's paintings which appeared like pseudogoitre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burch M|first1=Warner|title=100 Questions and Answers about thyroid disorders|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7X1xT4XZWfkC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=modigliani+syndrome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MP_REcQ-OR&amp;sig=wx7zNemiqME6mEU__5pcCawzLok&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=modigliani%20syndrome&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Modigliani-fake.jpg|thumb|An [[Elmyr de Hory]]'s Modigliani painting]] --&gt;
Since his death, Modigliani's reputation has soared. Nine novels, a play, a documentary, and three feature films have been devoted to his life. Modigliani's sister in Florence adopted his daughter, [[Jeanne Modigliani|Jeanne]] (1918–1984). As an adult, she wrote a biography of her father titled ''Modigliani: Man and Myth''.

===Catalogue raisonnés===
[[File:Amedeo Modigliani 056.jpg|thumb|Nude]]
The Modigliani estate is one of the most problematic in the art world. There are at least five [[catalogue raisonné|catalogues raisonnés]] of the artist’s work including two volumes by [[Ambrogio Ceroni]], last updated in 1972. [[Arthur Pfannstiel]] (1929 and 1956) and [[Joseph Lanthemann]]'s (1970) books are widely dismissed today. Milanese scholar [[Osvaldo Patani]] produced three volumes: paintings (1991), drawings (1992) and one on the [[Paul Alexandre]] period (1994), while [[Christian Parisot]] has published Volumes I, II and IV (in 1970, 1971 and 1996) of a catalogue raisonné.&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Adam (May 15, 2002), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Pushkin-accused-of-displaying-a-fake/25016 Pushkin accused of displaying a fake] ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, about 6,000 documents from the estate—believed to be the only ones existing—were moved permanently from France to Italy. Parisot, as president of the Modigliani Institut Archives Légales in Rome, had the legal right to authenticate Modigliani’s work.&lt;ref&gt;Sophia Kishkovsky (November 10, 2011), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Pushkin-accused-of-displaying-a-fake/25016 Pushkin accused of displaying a fake] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Parisot was arrested by the Italian art forgery unit after a two-year investigation; the police seized works attributed to the artist, along with suspect authenticity certificates.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (January 24, 2013), [https://www.forbes.com/2002/05/15/0515hot.html Fake Modiglianis Poison Art Market] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art market===
In November 2010, a painting of a nude by Amedeo Modigliani, part of a series of nudes he created around 1917, sold for more than $68.9m (£42.7m) at an auction in New York—a record for the artist's work. Bidding for ''La Belle Romaine'' pushed its price well past its $40m (£24.8m) estimate. Modigliani's previous auction record was 43.2m euros (£35.8m), set earlier in 2010 in Paris. Another painting by the artist—[[Jeanne Hébuterne]] (au chapeau), one of the first portraits he painted of his lover—sold for $19.1m (£11.8m), much higher than its pre-sale estimate of $9–12m (£5.6–7.4m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11682850 | work=BBC News | title=Modigliani nude sells for a record $68.9m | date=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2015 the 1917 painting ''[[Nu couché]]'', sold at [[Christie's]] in New York for US$170.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/arts/with-170-4-million-sale-at-auction-modigliani-work-joins-rarefied-nine-figure-club.html|title=With $170.4 Million Sale at Auction, Modigliani Work Joins Rarefied Nine-Figure Club|first1=Robin|last1=Pogrebin|first2=Scott|last2=Reyburn|date=9 November 2015|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2018 the 1917 painting ''Nu couché (sur le côté gauche)'' sold at [[Sotheby's]] in New York for $157.2 million. This was the highest auction price in Sotheby's history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/arts/design/modigliani-sothebys-auction-picasso.html ''$157 Million for a Modigliani Raises Hardly Any Eyebrows''], ''The New York Times'', May 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
Two films have been made about Modigliani: ''[[Les Amants de Montparnasse]]'' (1958), directed by [[Jacques Becker]] and starring [[Gérard Philipe]] as Modigliani; and ''[[Modigliani (film)|Modigliani]]'' (2004), directed by [[Mick Davis (director)|Mick Davis]] and starring [[Andy García]] as Modigliani.

Modigliani's art was an influence on director [[Andy Muschetti]], who found his works frightening as a child. Creatures based on Modigliani's style have appeared in his films ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]'' and ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3458110/muschietti-talks-paintings-inspired-nightmarish-new-creature/|title=Muschietti Talks Paintings that Inspired Nightmarish New ‘IT’ Creature|last=Squires|first=John|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|date=September 10, 2017|accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
In 1987 the U.S. [[synth-pop]] band [[Book of Love (band)|Book of Love]] released the single "[[Modigliani (Lost In Your Eyes)]]".

In 1991 the Italian singer-songwriter [[Vinicio Capossela]], released his second album titled ''Modi''' which is also the title of the album's first track. The song's title recalls the French term "Maudit" (cursed) and gives an almost impressionist depiction of Modigliani's troubled soul, embracing in its lyrics the painter's well known love of poetry.

In 2015 Italian jazz player [[Claudio Ottaviano]] released the composition "Modigliani", opening track for the album ''Aurora'' on NuomRecords.

''Modi'Tango'' (Giovanna Pieri Buti, violin - Emiliano Degl'Innocenti, doublebass - Alessandro Ottaviani, accordion) is a musical band based in Livorno, that honours Modigliani taking inspiration from an oneiric meeting in [[Montparnasse]] between Modigliani and [[Carlos Gardel]] in front of a [[Milonga (place)|Milonga]]

==Critical reactions==
In 2011 [[Peter Schjeldahl]], reviewing [[Meryle Secrest]]'s book ''Modigliani: A Life'', wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, to one of his long-necked women, with their piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the succulent color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever since I have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.&lt;ref name=PSrev&gt;Peter Schjeldahl, Book review of Meryle Secrest's "Modigliani: A Life", [[The New Yorker]], March 7, 2011 [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2011/03/07/110307crbo_books_schjeldahl Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schjeldahl reports Secrest’s speculation that Modigliani was happy to let people consider him an alcoholic and drug addict, "and thus to mistake the symptoms of his [[tuberculosis]], which he kept a secret. Drunks were tolerated; carriers of infectious diseases were not."&lt;ref name=PSrev/&gt;

'''Antonio Nicolo Gasparo Jacobsen''' (November 2, 1850 – February 2, 1921) was a Danish-born American maritime artist known as the "[[John James Audubon|Audubon]] of Steam Vessels".&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Biography==
Jacobsen was born in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark where he attended the Royal Academy of Design before heading across the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; He arrived in the United States in August 1873.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.familydenmark.dk&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in [[West Hoboken, New Jersey]] (now [[Union City, New Jersey]]), across the [[Hudson River]] from [[Manhattan]] and [[New York Harbor]], its port filled with ships from America and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Halasz, Piri. "Art: Maritime Theme at Exhibitions; Appeal of Nostalgia History and Humor Portraits of Vessels", ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 21, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobsen got his start painting pictures of ships on safes, and as his reputation grew, he was asked to do portraits of ships by their owners, captains and crew members, with many of his works sold for five dollars.&lt;ref name=VaPilot/&gt;

Jacobsen painted more than 6,000 portraits of sail and steam vessels, making him "the most prolific of marine artists".&lt;ref name=VaPilot&gt;Maddry, Larry. [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1994/vp941217/12170036.htm "Maritime Artist Finally Gets Brush with Success"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'', December 17, 1994. Accessed December 25, 2007. "That was understandable – the Danish-born American holds the distinction of being the most prolific of marine artists. Jacobsen documented thousands of sail and steam vessels that frequented New York Harbor between 1873 and 1919. It is believed that he painted more than 6,000 portraits."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his commissions came from sea captains, and Jacobsen was chosen both for the accuracy of his work and his low fee.&lt;ref name=NYT2003&gt;Falkenstein, Michelle, et al. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/01/nyregion/jersey-footlights.html "Jersey Footlights"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 1, 2003. Accessed December 25, 2007. "He won many commissions from sea captains, and may have made as many as 6,000 paintings in his lifetime, historians believe. As a painter of vessels, ''Jacobsen was the most prolific, and the cheapest,'' said Bob Foster, director of the Hoboken Historical Museum, which has a show of his paintings. ''The captains really loved his work. It was not a romanticized version&amp;nbsp;– it was the way the ship really looked.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions and collections==
[[File:Prinz AlbertC Jacobsen.jpg|thumb|''"The Prinz Albert,"'' 1897, [[Rehs Galleries, Inc.]], New York City]]

Exhibitions of Jacobsen's work include a 1996 showing of 45 of his paintings at the [[National Museum of American History]].&lt;ref&gt;Burchard, Hank. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-775395.html "Painted Ships On a Canvas Sea"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 31, 1996. Accessed December 25, 2007. "The Maritime Hall is alight with 45 works by Antonio Jacobsen (1850–1921), our most prolific ship portraitist."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[Mariners' Museum]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] held an exhibition that included 80 paintings by Jacobsen. In conjunction with the exhibition, the museum published a volume by Harold S. Sniffen, the museum's curator emeritus, whose biography titled ''Antonio Jacobsen's Painted Ships on Painted Oceans'', includes some 100 color pictures of the artist's ship paintings.&lt;ref name=VaPilot/&gt;

[[File:Independence Seaport Museum 151.JPG|thumb|left|Schooner [[Thomas Winsmore (schooner)|''Thomas Winsmore'']], [[Independence Seaport Museum]]]]
The public rooms of [[The Griswold Inn]] in [[Essex, Connecticut]], the oldest continuously run tavern in the United States, features the largest privately held collection of Jacobsen's paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bill. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/22/nyregion/which-inn-is-older-well-it-depends.html "Which Inn Is Older? Well, It Depends…"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 22, 1992. Accessed December 25, 2007. "The inn's public rooms make up a giant gallery for maritime paintings, including the largest private collection of the works of Antonio Jacobsen, a major painter of ships in the early part of this century."&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McMullen (engineer)|John McMullen]], a naval architect and marine engineer (and former owner of the [[New Jersey Devils]]), had a collection that included 75 paintings by Jacobsen, the first two of which were found in the 1940s in the offices of the family ship repair business.&lt;ref name=NYT2003/&gt;

On February 19, 2006, ''Fetching The Mark'', an unsigned painting of the racing yacht ''Dreadnought'' attributed to Jacobsen, was sold at auction for $281,000, more than triple the highest price previously paid for one of Jacobsen's works. The piece had been brought to an ''[[Antiques Road Show]]'' event in [[Tampa, Florida]], and had originally been thought to be a work of Jacobsen's contemporary [[James E. Buttersworth]], until further research led to a conclusion that it was by Jacobsen.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;Fairbanks, Jonathan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9088">'''''Bad Girls''''' was a 1994 exhibition curated by [[Marcia Tucker]]. The show opened at [[The New Museum]], in [[New York City]], January 14, 1994. It was presented in two parts, part 1 lasting from January 14 – February 27, 1994, and part 2 from March 5 – April 10, 1994.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archive.newmuseum.org/print-ephemera/7211 |title=The New Museum, Annual Report, 1992-1994 |year=1994 |website=New Museum Digital Archive |publisher=New Museum |language=en |access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bad Girls'' was a humorous and transgressive look at gender and feminist issues. It featured work from artist across many media, including photo, painting, sculpture, performance, film, comics, advertisements, writings and more. The show was accompanied by film screenings, performances, and events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The exhibition had mixed reviews at the time and has continued to vex many critics, however, it is now seen as a crucial piece in a lineage of third-wave feminist exhibitions.

== Style ==
''Bad Girls'' brought together works spanning many diverse styles and media. The common thread being humor. Within that category works tended to be avant-garde eschewing more traditional forms of even traditional media like painting and sculpture. Many works combined found objects. See ''Pink Project'' by Portia Munson, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archive.newmuseum.org/images/4560|title=Pink Project, 1994 |website=New Museum Digital Archive |access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive exhibits by the Guerilla Girls, Sybil Sage, Nancy Dwyer and Amy Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bad Girls (Part I) |url=https://archive.newmuseum.org/images/4550|website=New Museum Digital Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheer size of the exhibition may have led critics to see it as a feminist survey, however, the conspicuous absence of many renowned feminist names would speak otherwise. “The show includes drawings for feminist cartoons like Lynda Barry's ''God's Gift''  and Jennifer Camper's ''If Men Got Pregnant.'' It has a reading area with books like ''The Four Elements,'' by Roz Chast, ''Bad Girls Do It: An Encyclopedia of Female Murderers,'' by Michael Newton, and the comic book anthology ''Twisted Sisters: A Collection of Bad Girl Art.”'' &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/arts/review-art-a-raucous-caucus-of-feminists-being-bad.html|title=Review/Art; A Raucous Caucus Of Feminists Being Bad|last=Smith|first=Roberta|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
The show was conceived of by two curators. Marcia Tucker and Marcia Tanner. The latter having curated a sister show ''Bad Girls West'' at the UCLA Wight Gallery in Los Angeles. Tanner contributed significantly to the project and wrote one of several essays in the show's catalogue by the same name.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Bad girls |date=1994 |publisher=New Museum of Contemporary Art |isbn=0262700530 |location=New York, NY |oclc=30897735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both curators were influenced heavily by humorous takes on feminism. Marcia Tucker writes, “The work that particularly fascinated me and pushed me to rethink a lot of old issues had two characteristics in common. It was funny, really funny, and it went ‘too far’.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Carnival is also frequently cited in the show's catalogue as a major influence. The ability of a carnavalesque sensibility to subvert norms and to turn the world on end can be a powerful weapon in feminist critiques and artworks and was used as such in the ''Bad Girls'' Exhibition. It had the added benefit of turning observers into participants and therefore creating a sense of community especially among a diverse audience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The show challenged an often prevailing view that feminist shows must be comprised strictly by women, another way in which it turned the common narrative on its head. It contained works by several men speaking about feminist ideas. In an interview in ''Paradoxa,'' Marcia Tucker stated, “I decided to open up the territory usually assigned to “Bad Girls” to include men whose work also resists power and authority, and subverts social and cultural stereotypes in a feminist way. In my opinion, laughter is the first and finest form of self-criticism, and, when used by artists as a feminist tool, it can very effectively challenge even the biases which feminism itself sometimes constructs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mobile fidelities : conversations on feminism, history and visuality |last=Pachmanová |first=Martina |date=2006 |publisher=KT Press |isbn=0953654117 |location=London |oclc=75713053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists represented in the show are seen as heirs to a lineage of “Bad Girl Mothers”. Irreverent and transgressive artists having paved a path for their “daughters” allowing them to “produce critiques of the patriarchal construction of gender, but also to produce works that circumvent paternal constructs all together”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nixon, Mignon: ''Bad Enough Mother,'' “''October,”'' Vol. 71, feminist issues (Winter, 1995), pp. 70-92. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''Bad Girls'' received scathing reviews from many critics. Roberta Smith writing for the New York Times states, “Disappointment awaits anyone who approaches "Bad Girls" for a reasonably accurate view of the new, angrily ironic feminist art – made by women, not children or men.” She goes on to chastise many of the artists' specific pieces as derivative, and compares them to stale one-liners.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The show received plenty of criticism for omitting many prominent feminists. It is important to note however that ''Bad Girls'' was not conceived of as a retrospective or comprehensive survey. The so-called “gaps” or “empty spaces” seem to be tactical, leaving opportunities for debate and conversation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another major criticism of the show was its title. A number of publications saw the use of the word ''girls'' as demeaning and problematic on many fronts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Satin, Leslie, ''Girls GIrls Girls, “Women and Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory”'' Vol. 7, Issue 1 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the abundant negative reviews many critics praised the work for taking on a subject which had not yet been tackled by any of the larger museums, and in a unique and novel way.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Influence ==
While its initial reception was mixed at best, Bad Girls has become an influential piece of 3rd wave feminism. It is often seen now, in conjunction with many other early 90’s feminist exhibitions, as a stepping stone on the way to more contemporary feminist shows and ideas. It was sited in ''Feminist Curating and the “Return” of Feminist Art,''  in a conversation between curators Connie Butler, Amelia Jones, and Maura Reilly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The feminism and visual culture reader |date=2010 |publisher=Routledge |last=Jones |first=Amelia |isbn=0415543703 |edition=2nd |location=London |oclc=435731525}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bad Girls'' is seen as a precursor to shows like ''Wack!'' And ''Sexual Politics'' curated by Connie Butler and Amelia Jones respectively, which while focusing on art predating the ''Bad Girls'' show took cues from Marcia Tucker in their curation. The show was also a precursor to ''Daughters of Bad Girls'' which took place June 18, 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |editor=Editors |title=Daughter of Bad Girls |magazine=Art in America |year=2014 |url=https://www.artinamericamagazine.com/exhibitions/daughter-of-bad-girls/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is also cited by Mignon Nixon in the article ''Bad Enough Mother,'' where is seen as a “Profoundly liberating display of mother taught subversion”,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and by Susan Richmond in her article, "Sizing up the Dildo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Richmond |first=Susan |title=Sizing up the Dildo: 1974 Artforum Advertisement as a Feminist Icon |magazine=Paradoxa |volume=15 |date=Jan 2005 |pages=24–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barrie Weaver''' is an [[industrial designer]] living in London.

==Early life==
Born in Kent, Weaver spent his early years in the Middle East where his father was posted as a director of [[ICAO]]. Returning to London to complete his education, he gained a BA in Industrial Design Engineering at the [[Central School of Art]].

==Work==
Weaver's professional career began with [[Terence Conran]] creating products for [[Habitat]] shops before moving to [[Pentagram (design studio)|Pentagram Design]]'s London office, mentored by [[Kenneth Grange]] and [[Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)|Alan Fletcher]], both of whom he cites as powerful influences.

His independent career started by joining forces with Jos Roberts, a fellow Central student, to form Roberts Weaver Design. Early commissions included the UK's first mass-produced computer terminal for Newbury Labs (part of the [[Grundy NewBrain]] project) and the Implanter 9000 for [[Applied Materials]].

Integrating computers into the workplace became a key focus with dealing rooms for Banks worldwide, the [[Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station]], and with [[Nixdorf Computer AG|Nixdorf]], New York City's first touch-screen voting booth.

Notably, Weaver spotted the potential of [[Jonathan Ive]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MR+MAC%3B+MEET+THE+MAN+WHO+IS+THE+DAVID+BECKHAM+OF+DESIGN.-a0102785514 Jonathan Ive's first job]&lt;/ref&gt; and gave him his first job. Ive became the Senior Vice President of Industrial Design at [[Apple Inc]] and is internationally renowned as the principal designer of the iMac, iPod and the iPhone.

In the UK Weaver obtained commissions from [[BT Group]], [[Amstrad]], [[Marks &amp; Spencer]], [[Marconi Company|Marconi]], [[Boots]], [[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies|Ransomes]] and [[KEF]] before venturing East to land projects with [[Hitachi]], [[Panasonic]], [[Samsung]], [[Nissan]], [[Subaru]], [[LG]], [[Zebra]].
 
Under Weaver's guidance the team has won numerous [[Design Council]], [[iF product design award]], [[Red Dot]], and [[Norwegian Design Council]] awards.
 
In 1990, Weaver received the [[Prince Philip Designers Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-us/Prince-Philip-Designers-Prize/19891998/ Prince Philip Designer Prize] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411183308/http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-us/Prince-Philip-Designers-Prize/19891998/ |date=April 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of his work. Weaver is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] and a Fellow of the [[Chartered Society of Designers]]. He served on the [[Design Council]] from 1989 to 1995.

'''''Basta't Kasama Kita''''' ({{literal translation|"As Long As I'm with You"}}) is a 1995 Philippine [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Rory B.

A '''beta reader''' is usually an unpaid test reader of an unreleased work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karen Hellekson|first=Kristina Busse|title=Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet: New Essays|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786454962|pages=15, 43, 172–179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgZsi_DOKoQC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=%22Beta+reader%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=seZYUtvkIqHA4AOL34HgAg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Beta%20reader%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; of literature or other writing (similar to [[Beta tester|beta testing]] in software), who gives feedback from the point of view of an average reader to the author.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-beta-reader.htm|title=What Is a Beta Reader? (with picture)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A beta reader is not a professional and can therefore provide advice and comments in the opinions of an average reader&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cocowordcraft.com/menu.html/], Beta Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. This feedback is used by the writer to fix remaining issues with plot, pacing, and consistency. The beta reader also serves as a [[sounding board]] to see if the book has had the intended emotional impact.

== Origin ==
"Beta reader" is an English term originally borrowed from the information technology/software industry where [[Beta tester|beta testers]] try to identify problems in [[Software|a piece of computer software]] before its release.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it differs from other roles ==
A "proofreader" usually only looks at grammar and spelling and is a paid professional. A "critique partner" is a trained writer who "test reads" from the perspective of an author, unlike a beta reader who has little or no experience with writing. A beta reader can also serve as an "alpha reader" when reading a book draft that is still without an ending or is completely unrevised. Typically, a beta reader reviews a draft that has gone through at least one revision.

'''''Blam''''' (sometimes '''''Blam!''''') is a 1962  painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] falling within the [[pop art]] idiom. It is one of his military comic book derivatives and was one of the works presented at his first solo exhibition. The work is in the collection at the [[Yale University Art Gallery]].

==History==
[[File:Blam source.jpg|thumb|left|The source for ''Blam'' was All American Men of War #89 (January–February 1962)]]
The painting is based on [[Russ Heath]]'s art in the [[comic book]] ''[[All-American Men of War]]'' issue #89 (January-February 1962), published by [[DC Comics|National Periodical Publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image-duplicator.com/main.php?work_id=0213&amp;year=1964&amp;decade=60|title=Ohhh&amp;nbsp;... Alright&amp;nbsp;... |accessdate=May 20, 2012|publisher=Lichtenstein Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting depicts a pilot ejecting from an exploding plane.&lt;ref name=PAACH/&gt;  The same issue was the inspiration for several other Lichtenstein paintings, ''[[Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!]]'', ''[[Brattata]]'', ''[[Whaam!]]'' and ''Tex!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4381129|title=High &amp; Low: Modern Art &amp; Popular Culture: Searching High and Low|author= Armstrong,  Matthew|volume=2|issue=6|date=Autumn 1990|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|pages=4–8, 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The graphite pencil sketch, ''[[Jet Pilot (Roy Lichtenstein)|Jet Pilot]]'' was also from that issue.&lt;ref name="ID 3163"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://image-duplicator.com/main.php?work_id=3163&amp;year=1962&amp;decade=60# | title = Jet Pilot | accessdate = June 24, 2013 | publisher = LichtensteinFoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lichtenstein had his first solo show at The [[Leo Castelli Gallery]] in February 1962, it sold out before opening.  ''Blam'' sold for $1000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1962}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), according to one source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Mural With Blue Brushstroke|author=Tomkins, Calvin|isbn=0-8109-2356-4|page=25|date=1988|publisher=[[Harry N.

==Details==
[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
Lichtenstein began his war imagery efforts with single frame pictures such as ''Blam''.&lt;ref name=PAACH&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Continuing History|author=Livingstone, Marco|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]]|isbn=0-8109-3707-7|date=1990|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blam'' uses quintessential war imagery. Although the text is limited to one four-letter word, the narrative is unnecessary owing to the eminent realism presented.  The canvas is loaded with images surrounding the focal figure, of the aircraft under attack.&lt;ref name=RLDW&gt;{{cite book|title= Roy Lichtenstein|author=Waldman, Diane|date=1993|publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]|page=95|isbn=0-89207-108-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is regarded, along with ''Takka Takka'' as "successful in their combination of brilliant color and narrative situation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Alloway, Lawrence|isbn=0-89659-331-2|publisher=[[Abbeville Press]]|date=1983|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blam'' is a jest with the viewer that uses an exclamation without narrative context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gardner's Art Through The Ages|edition=tenth|publisher=[[Harcourt Brace College Publishers]]|author=Tansey, Richard G. and Fred S. Kleiner|page=1116|isbn=0-15-501141-3|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Blang'' (1962) and ''Varoom'' (1963), ''Blam'''s [[onomatopoeia]] explodes "like a violent central sun over the entire composition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lichtenstein|editor=Boatto, Alberto and Giordano Falzoni|edition=International|publisher=Fantazaria|page=56|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein has revised the original source so that the aircraft and its explosion are the joint foci from which the painting radiates. Unlike the original, which had substantive narrative content, Lichtenstein's version has more formality and a linear pattern, but a more simplified surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Pop Art|author=Alloway, Lawrence|date=1974|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc.]]|isbn=0-02-627700-X|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5095">'''Book folding''' is the stage of the [[book]] production process in which the [[page (paper)|page]]s of the book are folded after [[printing]] and before [[bookbinding|binding]].&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Book in Canada|editor=Patricia Lockhart Fleming and Yvan Lamonde|chapter=The Binding Trades|author=Patricia Lockhart Fleming|pages=101|volume=2: 1840–1918|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2004|isbn= 978-0-8020-8012-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the middle of the 19th century, book folding was done by hand, and was a trade.  In the 1880s and 1890s, book folding machines by Brown and Dexter came onto the market, and by the 1910s hand-folding was rare, with one publisher declaring them to be "practically obsolete" in 1914.&lt;ref name=Fleming /&gt;

The folding process is also necessary to produce print products other than books—for instance mailings, magazines, leaflets etc.
==Hand folding==
{{empty section|date=August 2018}}

==Folding machines==
{{main|folding machine}}
Two main types of mechanisms are commonly employed in [[folding machine]]s: '''buckle folders''' and '''knife folders'''.&lt;ref name="ip"&gt;{{cite web |title=Folding |website=International Paper Knowledge Center |publisher=International Paper Company |url=http://glossary.ippaper.com/default.asp?req=knowledge/article/213 |access-date=7 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515035954/http://glossary.ippaper.com/default.asp?req=knowledge%2Farticle%2F213 |archive-date=15 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicole Howard|title=The book: the life story of a technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WwdMJKXzhEC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=8 January 2012|date=September 2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33028-5|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GonnellaNavetta2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rose Gonnella|author2=Christopher J. Navetta|title=Comp It Up: A Studio Skills Foundation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTvDQgijeSkC&amp;pg=SA3-PA74|accessdate=8 January 2012|date=2 July 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4283-2235-6|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buckle folder===
In a '''buckle folder''', the paper is first passed through 2 spinning rollers, which feed the paper into a pair of guide plates that redirect the paper at a slight angle, bending the paper. At the far end of the guide plates is a "paper stop". As the rollers continue to spin, the paper continues to slide in between the guides until it hits the paper stop, then, having nowhere else to go, buckles at the interface between the rollers and the angled guides. As the rollers continue to spin, the buckle increases, until it is eventually caught by a pair of "nip" rollers, which pull the buckle in and compresses and flattens it into a neat crease.

Adjusting the paper stop in a buckle folder determines where the fold will be placed. Also, a buckle folder may contain only 3 rollers, with one shared by both the input rollers and the nip rollers.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

Although buckle folders are fast, simple, efficient, and have small folding tolerances, they are not suitable for substrate of very low (&lt;40g/m²) or very heavy paper grammage (&gt;120g/m²).{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Knife folder===
In a '''knife folder''', a sheet of paper is fed horizontally over 2 unpowered rollers until it hits a paper stop, at which point a dull blade pushes down on the paper and in between the 2 rollers to create the fold.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

Although the knife folder is slower than buckle folders, it is more precise&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt; and can handle extreme grammages very well.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} It also has small folding tolerances, but is a more complex machine.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Folding variants==
[[File:Folding.svg|thumb|300px|
{{ordered list
| Letter Fold / C-Fold / Tri-Fold
| Tri-Fold / Gate Fold
| Double Gate Fold / Roll Fold
| Z-Fold / Accordion (6-page)
| Double Fold / Double Parallel Fold
| French Fold / Double Right-Angle Fold
}}&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;
]]

===Parallel folds===
Folding a paper more than once in the same direction (i.e. with parallel creases) is called '''parallel folding'''. Common examples of this are the '''half fold''', '''letter fold''', '''gate fold''', and '''Z-fold'''.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

===Cross folds===
A '''cross fold''' is when a paper is folded once, then rotated [[90 degrees]] and folded again. The creases therefore cross each other at right angles. The most basic cross fold is the '''French fold''', or '''right-angle fold'''. Other examples include the '''16-page broadside''' and the '''12-page letter'''.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

'''Book store shoplifting''' is a problem for book sellers and has sometimes led stores to keep certain volumes behind store counters.

[[Shoplifter]]s at [[book store]]s, also known as book shops, may be either amateur or professional thieves. Professionals target high-priced books and books that are easily resold, such as college textbooks.

In addition to shoplifting, thievery also has been due to pilfering by shipping personnel and burglary. Book stores also are victimized by thefts of merchandise and other items aside from books. At Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena, California, someone attempted to steal a security camera. At the Boulder Bookshop in Boulder, Colorado, prints hung in the bathroom and plants have been stolen.&lt;ref name=mrstb&gt;Rabb, Margo, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/books/review/Rabb-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=review&amp;pagewanted=print "Steal These Books"], essay, ''The New York Times Book Review'', December 20, 2009, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns of independent book sellers==
Owners of small, independent book stores have said they find shoplifting particularly bothersome. According to Paul Constant, a Seattle book-store employee, "I know a few booksellers who have literally been driven a little bit crazy at the thought of their inventory evaporating out the door, and with good reason: An overabundance of shoplifters can put bookstores out of business. One local bookstore owner can famously talk about shoplifters with total strangers for hours, with the detail and passion that some people reserve for sexual conquests."&lt;ref name=pcfos&gt;Constant, Paul, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=520472 "Flying Off the Shelves: The Pleasures and Perils of Chasing Book Thieves"], ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', February 26, 2008, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shoplifting is a particular problem," said Patricia Van Osdol, owner of Wellington Books in Portland, Oregon. "It can be disastrous in a small store like this."&lt;ref&gt;Federman, Stan, "Book Shop Like Candy Store to Its Owner", article, ''The Oregonian'' of Portland, Oregon, April 9, 1992, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books frequently stolen==
According to several sources, in the United States certain books, or books by certain authors, are much more likely to be stolen than others, although there are no hard statistics on the subject.&lt;ref name=mrstb/&gt;

Ron Rosenbaum, an author and ''[[New York Observer]]'' columnist, wrote in 1999 that [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] had a list of these authors whose books are the most frequently stolen from that book-store chain (or perhaps the [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] store in the chain, where his source, "a helpful clerk", worked): [[Martin Amis]], [[Paul Auster]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Jeanette Winterson]], but none more frequently than books by [[Charles Bukowski]].&lt;ref name=rrs&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron, [http://www.observer.com/node/42023 "Shoplift Lit: You Are What You Steal"], column, ''[[The New York Observer]]'', September 26, 1999, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=otmsb&gt;[http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2005/12/23/08 "Book Stealing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613075317/http://onthemedia.org/transcripts/2005/12/23/08 |date=2010-06-13 }}, segment transcript, ''[[On the Media]]'', December 23, 2005, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Constant gave this list, which he called "pretty much the authoritative top five, the New York Times best-seller list of stolen books": Bukowski, [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]], [[Philip K. Dick]], and Burroughs, along with "any graphic novel". Constant wrote that other popular targets are books by Hunter S. Thompson and the Beats, [[Chuck Palahniuk]], [[Haruki Murakami]], and [[Mark Z. Danielewski]], and the most-stolen books tend to be a steady group with little variation over time.&lt;ref name=pcfos/&gt; As of late 2009, Danielewski's ''House of Leaves'' was the most frequently stolen book from Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena, California, according to a store manager there.&lt;ref name=mrstb/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, ''[[The Virgin Suicides]]'' by [[Jeffrey Eugenides]] was the most-shoplifted book, according to a January 2008 article in ''The Telegraph''.&lt;ref name=mbjeel&gt;Brown, Mick, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3670336/Jeffrey-Eugenides-Enduring-love.html "Jeffrey Eugenides: Enduring love"], ''The Telegraph'', January 5, 2008, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Mark's Bookshop]] (which closed in 2016) in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] of Manhattan, like Barnes &amp; Noble, used to move frequently-stolen titles behind the counter. At that bookstore, as of late 2009, the books behind the counter included works by Amis, Bukowski, Burroughs, Raymond Carver, Don DeLillo and Jack Kerouac. Sometimes the staff moves books back to the shelves with the idea that a book's popularity for theft may lessen over time. "Amis went out and came right back," a store manager told a writer for ''The New York Times.&lt;ref name=mrstb/&gt;

According to Rosenbaum, "[I]f you look at who's actually doing the shoplifting, they're not really down-and-out, lower-depths types but like to pose as being down and out, and shoplifting is part of the aura."&lt;ref name=otmsb/&gt; Constant wrote, "[F]iction that young white men read, and self-satisfied young white men, the kind who love to ''stick it to [[The Man|the man]]'', are the majority of book shoplifters."&lt;ref name=mrstb/&gt;&lt;ref name=pcfos/&gt;

===In comparison with books stolen from public libraries===
{{Main|Library theft}}
Public libraries have a much different set of frequently stolen books. In the United States, how-to books are more often the targets of thieves, as are books about witchcraft, the occult, UFOs or astrology, according to Larra Clark, a spokeswoman for the American Library Association, who asked members which books were most often stolen. Of the 70 libraries across the United States who responded to her query in 2001, none mentioned books by [[Charles Bukowski]]. An official from a [[prison library]] responded that dictionaries and poetry were the most frequently stolen types of books at that institution.&lt;ref name=otmsb/&gt;

==Theft by professionals==
According to Tom Cushman, a New York book-store manager interviewed in 2005, factors influencing book thefts included high resale value and whether or not the book was displayed in an area difficult for the store clerks to watch. When [[Harry Potter]] books were new and popular items in book stores, they were among the top targets of thieves, he said.&lt;ref name=otmsb/&gt;

Brian Zimmerman, associate general manager at the San Francisco State University book store, said thieves there were much more likely to be students, but professional thieves took more books and targeted volumes with higher prices.&lt;ref name=nc&gt;Codd, Nathan, [http://xpress.sfsu.edu/archives/news/013510.html "Theft an ongoing issue for bookstore"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701172234/http://xpress.sfsu.edu/archives/news/013510.html# |date=2010-07-01 }}, ''SFXpress'', September 16, 2009, retrieved December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Thieves have been known to take whole stacks of books at once.&lt;ref name=otmsb/&gt; According to a 1991 article in ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'',
studies showed that the "casual thief", defined as "not a professional but more than a one-timer", accounted for 70 to 75 percent of shoplifting.&lt;ref name=crpcbbs&gt;Romano, Carlin, "The Problem of Catching and Booking the Book Shoplifters", ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', June 26, 1991, retrieved via Newsbank.com, December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that thieves were so brazen in New York City that just outside St. Mark's Bookshop, "sidewalk peddlers openly ply books – many of them still bearing St. Mark's telltale stamp – at half off the prices inside the store.''&lt;ref&gt;Rivenburg, Roy, "Thieves Rip Off Book Stores in Growing Volume", ''Buffalo News'', "Lifestyles" section, p E1 (story reprinted from ''The Los Angeles Times''), October 25, 1992; retrieved via Newsbank website, December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, book store owners in New York and California accused second-hand book stores of organizing theft rings to shoplift titles for resale. Drama Book Shop in Manhattan lost 533 books with a total sales price of $10,873 from January 1 to May 8, 1991. One thief told store officials that a ring organized by a second-hand store had been assigned to steal books from the Drama Book Shop, according to Rozanne Seelan, co-owner of the victimized store.&lt;ref name=crpcbbs/&gt;

==Countermeasures==
Book stores at San Francisco State University and City College of San Francisco train their employees who are examining books being returned or sold to the stores to look for price tag stickers, books that don't seem to have been used, and anyone offering to sell multiple copies of a single title. When store employees approach customers to ask whether they need help, they also discourage theft, according to Zimmerman.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;

==Reactions of authors==
Jeffrey Eugenides and Paul Auster both laughed when journalists asked them about being some of the authors whose books are most shoplifted. "It's one of those things authors argue about" among themselves, Eugenides said, adding that he and Auster had discussed their status as authors of frequently stolen books.&lt;ref name=mrstb/&gt;&lt;ref name=mbjeel/&gt;

[[Abbie Hoffman]] wrote ''[[Steal This Book]]'' in 1970 and published in 1971. While largely about rebelling against authority, it includes a section on shoplifting.

'''Bush Barrow''' is a site of the early [[British Bronze Age]] (c. 2000 BC), at the western end of the [[Normanton Down Barrows]] cemetery. It is among the most important sites of the [[Stonehenge]] complex, having produced some of the most spectacular [[grave goods]] in Britain. It was excavated in 1808 by  [[William Cunnington]] for Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. The finds, including worked gold objects, are displayed at [[Wiltshire Museum]] in [[Devizes]].

Bush Barrow is situated around 1 kilometre southwest of [[Stonehenge]] on Normanton Down. It forms part of the [[Normanton Down Barrows]] cemetery.&lt;ref name="ps"&gt;{{PastScape |mnumber=943060 |mname=Bush Barrow |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving earthworks have an overall diameter of {{convert|49|metres|ft}} and comprise a large mound with breaks in the slope suggesting three phases of development.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt; The barrow currently stands 3.3 metres high and its summit measures 10.5 metres in diameter.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

The barrow is one of the "associated sites" in the [[World Heritage Site]] covering [[Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites]] (Cultural, ID 373, 1986).&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/373 UNESCO website]&lt;/ref&gt; The Normanton Down round barrow cemetery comprises some 40 barrows strung out along an east-west aligned ridge. Bush Barrow (so named by Cunningham because it had bushes on it) is towards the western end of the line of barrows, sited at the highest point of the ridge.&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Kate|last2=Bowden|first2=Mark| title=Stonehenge World Heritage Site – Landscape Project: Normanton Down: Archaeological Survey Report|publisher=English Heritage|series=Research Department Report Series|volume= 90-2010|year=2010|url=http://services.english-heritage.org.uk/ResearchReportsPdfs/090-2010WEB.pdf|pages=11, 32|access-date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The barrow was excavated in 1808 by [[William Cunnington]] for Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]].&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt; It contained a male skeleton with a collection of funerary goods that make it 'the richest and most significant example of a Bronze Age burial monument not only in the Normanton Group or in association with Stonehenge, but arguably in the whole of Britain'.&lt;ref name=Barrett /&gt; The items date the burial to the early Bronze Age, 1900-1700BC, and include a large 'lozenge'-shaped sheet of gold, a sheet gold belt plate, three bronze daggers, a bronze axe, a stone macehead and bronze rivets, all on display at the [[Wiltshire Museum]], Devizes.&lt;ref name=wiltshire&gt;[http://www.wiltshireheritage.org.uk/galleries/index.php?Action=3&amp;obID=89&amp;prevID=9 Wiltshire Museum Galleries: Bush Barrow]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bush Barrow Lozenge ===
The design of the artifact known as the ''Bush Barrow Lozenge'', and the smaller lozenge, has been shown to be based on a hexagon construction. Both the shape and the decorative panels appear to have been created by repeating hexagons within a series of three concentric circles (each framing the series of smaller decorative panels).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony, ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma'' pp 182-185 (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precision and accuracy displayed by the work demonstrates both a sophisticated tool kit and a sound knowledge of geometric form. A similar gold lozenge from [[Clandon Barrow]], in Dorset, used a decagon in its design.

=== Daggers ===
Two of the bronze daggers have the largest blades of any from their period, whilst a third had a {{convert|30|cm|in}} long wooden hilt originally decorated with up to 140,000 tiny gold studs forming a herringbone pattern. The studs are around {{convert|0.2|mm|in}} wide and {{convert|1|mm|in}} in length with over a thousand studs embedded in each square centimetre.&lt;ref name=indy&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/stonehenges-most-intricate-archaeological-finds-were-probably-made-by-children-9738993.html#gallery|title=Stonehenge's most intricate archaeological finds were 'probably made by children'|work=The Independent|date=17 September 2014|author=David Keys}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_j6Py7x_ctIC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=bush+barrow+pins+dagger#v=onepage&amp;q=bush%20barrow%20pins%20dagger&amp;f=false|page=96|title=The Druids and King Arthur: A New View of Early Britain|isbn=978-0-7864-6005-2|author1=Melrose|first1=Robin|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
David Dawson, Director of Wiltshire Heritage Museum has stated that: "The gold studs are remarkable evidence of the skill and craftsmanship of Bronze Age goldsmiths – quite rightly described as 'the work of the gods'"&lt;ref name=teleg /&gt; Optician Ronald Rabbetts has said that "Only children and teenagers, and those adults who had become myopic naturally or due to the nature of their work as children, would have been able to create and manufacture such tiny objects."&lt;ref name=indy /&gt;

It is thought that the gold came from Ireland, and the dagger was made in Brittany. The hilt lay forgotten for over 40 years from the 1960s, having been sent to [[Richard J. C. Atkinson|Professor Atkinson]] at Cardiff University, and found by one of his successors in 2005.&lt;ref name=teleg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3242724/Britains-most-important-archeological-discovery-found-in-desk-drawer.html|title=Britain's 'most important archeological' discovery found in desk drawer|first=Urmee|last=Khan|work=Daily Telegraph|date= 22 Oct 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stone mace ===
An unusual stone mace head, shaped into a  made out of a rare flecked fossilized corel stone, originating in Devon. It had a wooden handle,from which bone zig-zag decorations survive, reminiscent of items from Greece and Spain.&lt;ref name=wiltshire /&gt;

=== Antique knife ===
Some fragments of bronze rivets and other scraps of bronze have been identified as the remains of a knife that would have been at least 200 years older than the rest of the items. This dates the knife to being contemporary with the construction of the Stonehenge trilithons, and suggests a treasured antique or heirloom, buried along with the rich new items of the occupant of the barrow.&lt;ref name=wiltshire /&gt;

== Wider context ==
It is not known why this barrow contained such rich grave goods compared to those around it. It occupies the highest point, but is not the tallest barrow, and is not obviously marked out as the principal barrow in the cemetery. In particular it is not known if other barrows in the vicinity have simply had such goods plundered long ago. Numerous finds have been made in other barrows, both by Cunnington and subsequently, but nothing to compare to these. According to Barrett and Bowden, "absence of evidence does not necessarily imply evidence of absence".&lt;ref name=Barrett /&gt;

'''''Cadence''''' (also known as Stockade) is a 1990 film directed by (and starring) [[Martin Sheen]], in which [[Charlie Sheen]] plays an [[inmate]] in a [[United States Army]] [[military prison]] in [[West Germany]] during the 1960s.  Sheen plays alongside his father [[Martin Sheen]] and brother [[Ramon Estevez]]. The film is based on a novel by [[Gordon Weaver]].

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=June 2016}}
Franklin Bean (Charlie Sheen) is shown in flashback with his father, a [[postal worker]] at his high school. His poor performance is attributed to a lack of discipline which a school officials assures the elder Bean can be fixed with a stint in the Army. Then, in present day, [[Private First Class|PFC]] Bean is attending his father's funeral before returning to his duty station in Germany. In his state of grief he gets [[drunk]], punches an [[Military police|MP]] and breaks through a plate-glass window in a local bar. Bean's army lawyer secures a plea deal, struck by his attorney Captain Ramon Garcia (Abraham), in lieu of a court martial which involves him removing unauthorized tattoos from his hands (obtained during his drunken rampage), paying for a broken window and serving 90 days in the camp [[stockade]]. He is met at the gates by a decorated Korean War veteran Master Sergeant named Otis McKinney (Martin Sheen). 

McKinney explains that the stockade is fairly small and, as a result, he is in complete charge of the compound while being supported by two guards; Corporals Harold Lamar and Gerald Gessner. Bean finds a sympathetic ear in stockade guard Corporal Lamar after learning he is just as afraid of McKinney and only "serving his own time." Gessner is a somewhat spineless lackey to McKinney whom he clearly admires and respects. 

Bean is introduced to his fellow prisoners, all of them black and led by section leader Roosevelt Stokes (Fishburne). Stokes is serving an unspecified sentence for larceny and, despite his conviction, apparently retains his rank of [[Corporal]]. Bean resists McKinney by refusing to refer to him as [[sergeant]] and refusing most military customs and courtesies. The prisoner detail is regularly trucked to a nearby farm where they perform manual labor such as digging ditches and building fences. While there, Bean becomes obsessed with a nonfunctional and off-limits [[windmill]]. He requests permission to repair the windmill from MSgt McKinney through Corporal Lamar but his request is denied. Bean submits a written request to the commanding officer, secretly bypassing McKinney by passing his request through Lamar, who grants him permission to work on the windmill only during meal breaks. 

Bean challenges fellow inmate Webb, a Harlem born boxer, to a pickup game of basketball after suffering a humiliating loss to him in a fist fight which was initiated after Bean accused Webb of stealing his gold [[zippo]] lighter. Bean agrees to pay Webb $10 if he loses and Webb agrees to help Bean with his windmill project if Bean wins. Bean wins the game and begins building trust and credibility among the other prisoners. Bean begins to connect with the others and learns of some of their crimes. He soon shares a bunk with Bryce (Mankuma), who was convicted of murder despite his pleas to the contrary. Bryce advises that he expects his appeal to fail and to eventually be shipped out of the stockade to be hanged. Lawrence (Toles-Bey), a fellow prisoner who harbors sympathetic views toward the Nation of Islam, reveals that he was convicted of rape and sentenced to seven years though he denies his crime. Among the prisoners is also the largely silent Harry "Sweetbread" Crane (Stewart) who is an inspiring vocalist who sings at church services and leads the prisoners' soulful marching cadence.

In the meantime, McKinney becomes increasingly irritated with Bean's refusal to submit to his authority. It is revealed that he is estranged from his son, whom he states is roughly Bean's age. When McKinney calls his (presumed) ex-wife on his birthday hoping to speak to his son he is told that his son is unavailable, sending McKinney into a drunken bender in the enlisted club. In the middle of the night he tries to break into the prisoner compound to confront Bean while yelling challenges to him. The noise rouses both Lamar and Gessner. Lamar threatens to arrest McKinney and refuses to comply with his order to open the gates. Gessner, however, makes a move to comply but is stopped by Lamar. A fellow sergeant and friend of McKinney arrives on the scene and is warned by Lamar that he will arrest McKinney unless he takes him away immediately and gets him to bed. During a Sunday visit with a friend from his unit, Bean is informed that they are being sent to Vietnam and that he will likely join them there after he is released from the stockade.

McKinney decides to try to use tact with Bean and invites him to his office to talk through their differences while plying him with chocolates, which Bean refuses. Bean states that McKinney is a bully and he hates everything he stands for. McKinney dismisses him and is visibly angry. The next day, while Bean and Webb are nearly finished with the windmill repair, McKinney arrives on the scene with a written order from a Colonel in the Army Corps of Engineers to cease all work on the windmill and placing it off limits for all personnel. When McKinney isn't present Webb and Bean return to the windmill to activate it despite the loud protestations from Gessner. 

In the middle of a rainy night, McKinney arrives at the prisoner barracks in rain gear and a combat helmet while holding a rifle. He orders the prisoners into the yard and summons Gessner. He writes up all of the prisoners, and Gessner, for appearing in formation out of uniform as they are all still in their underwear. He orders the men into the back of a [[deuce-and-a-half]] and orders Gessner to drive them to the farm where they normally work. Upon arrival he dismisses Gessner and orders him back to his quarters. When Gessner questions the order, McKinney strikes him sending him face down into the mud. He departs and McKinney begins to march the prisoners in the deep mud, quickly finding that he is unable to keep up with the younger men in the harsh conditions. He orders the prisoners into formation, throws the ammunition clip from his rifle behind him, and tells the men they should run to escape. He then draws his service pistol and begins firing toward the men while shouting incoherently. "Sweetbread" Crane begins wandering toward the windmill and climbing it. McKinney scrambles for his clip, murmuring "help me" as he tries to load his rifle. All the while the prisoners plead with Sweetbread to return and explain to McKinney that he has a tendency to wander off and isn't trying to escape. Sweetbread climbs down from the windmill and begins moving toward McKinney. Bean leaps toward him to try to protect him from McKinney's rifle fire but Sweetbread is struck in the head. Bean removes his shirt to try to stop the bleeding as the other prisoners subdue McKinney, but the wound is fatal. 

It is revealed that the remainder of Bean's sentence has been commuted by the commanding officer. McKinney is court-martialed for the shooting of Crane and is represented by Captain Garcia. Stokes testifies against McKinney and whispers to Bean, as he leaves the witness stand, that they have McKinney "on the gallows." Garcia elicits from Bean the testimony that McKinney said "help me" as he was loading his weapon. He argues that it couldn't possibly have been a muttering to himself as Bean would not have heard it from his distance and that this was actually a call for the prisoners to assist him with Crane. This, he argues, constitutes a "warning shot" and that the killing was lawful. McKinney is presumably cleared, though it is never explicitly stated. Garcia confronts Bean after the proceedings smiling as he tells Bean that he had no choice but to tell the truth otherwise he would have committed perjury. He then assures Bean that he knows how he feels. Bean replies "No sir, you don't" before saluting and attempting to visit the prisoners. Lamar informs him that they don't want to meet with him though he leaves gifts which Lamar promises to convey.

Bean visits McKinney, who despite his acquittal is committed to the base psychiatric unit. McKinney sits motionless in his room in a state of undress and refuses to speak to Bean. When Bean attempts to initiate conversation, McKinney slowly turns in his chair to face away from him. 

As Bean prepares to leave camp to ship to Vietnam to join his unit, he makes peace with Gessner and receives best wishes from Lamar as they march the prisoners. Webb breaks ranks and tosses the stolen lighter to Bean advising him to stick close to the brothers in Vietnam and they'll keep him safe. The prisoners then call the [[chain gang]] cadence that Sweetbread used to call, turning to face Bean in an apparent reconciliation. Bean tearfully joins in the movements and cadence while observing the formation before saluting the men and departing for Vietnam.

The '''Center for the Study of Political Graphics''' ('''CSPG''') is a [[United States]] [[non-profit]], educational and research [[archive]] that collects, preserves, documents, and circulates domestic and international political posters relating to historical and contemporary movements for [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=If there is a value in radical archives, archival practice, or archival content, what is it and how do you achieve and maintain it?

She has also organized over 100 poster exhibitions.

==About the archive==
The CSPG archive currently contains more than 85,000 [[poster]]s and has the largest collection of post-[[World War II]] [[social justice]] posters in the United States and the second largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheff|first1=Harry|title=The Center for the Study of Political Graphics|url=http://www.utne.com/community/thecenterforthestudyofpoliticalgraphics|website=Utne Reader|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media and techniques represented include [[Offset printing|offset]], [[lithography]], [[linocut]], [[Woodcut|woodblock]], [[silkscreen]], [[stencil]], and [[photocopy]]. All prints are catalogued to aid researchers. CSPG also loans out prints to other institutions for exhibit. Portions of the collection are available through the Online Archives of California, an initiative of the [[California Digital Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for the Study of Political Graphics|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8959k7m/|website=Online Archives of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major article in the LA Weekly in 2015 said: "Protest posters of every kind are preserved in the center's archives, along with thousands of bumper stickers and political buttons. Online, at politicalgraphics.org, the center features a poster of the week, such as one recognizing the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Malcolm X."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Futch|first1=David|title=85,000 of the World's Angriest Political Posters Are Sitting in Culver City|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/85-000-of-the-worlds-angriest-political-posters-are-sitting-in-culver-city-5426721|website=L.A.

CSPG depends upon the donation of posters to make this resource as representative as possible of the many historical and ongoing struggles. CSPG has also received grants from the [[Getty Trust]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists, Institutions Receive Getty Trust Grants|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/19/entertainment/ca-9441|website=L.A.

A fundraiser is held annually called "Celebrating the Art of Resistance." Three honors are awarded each year-- Aris &amp; Carolyn Anagnos Culture of Liberation Award, The Art as a Hammer Award, and The Historian of the Lions.

==Exhibitions==
In the wake of the 2006 [[Great American Boycott]], CSPG organized a labor-themed exhibition. In the last seventeen years, CSPG exhibitions has created toured exhibitions to more than 280 venues worldwide. They are mounted at various galleries institutions, and are accompanied by translations. Exhibition Guides are usually published and contain excellent scholarly writing on the subjects. CSPG’s traveling exhibitions (available for rental) are presented from a multi-issue and [[multicultural]] perspective, and tend to focus on current issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Protest|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-14/news/ci-637_1_protest-art|website=L.A. Times|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, upon the death of [[Ronald Reagan]], CSPG mounted an exhibition of anti-Reagan posters.

"Art Against Empire: Graphic Responses to U.S. Interventions Since World War II" was exhibited at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political posters make bold statements|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/14/entertainment/la-et-posters-20100414|website=L.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2663">[[File:WV23 by Mutnedjmet.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Burial chamber of an Egyptian pharaoh]]
A '''chamber tomb''' is a [[tomb]] for [[burial]] used in many different [[culture]]s. In the case of individual burials, the chamber is thought to signify a higher status for the interree than a simple [[grave (burial)|grave]]. Built from [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or sometimes [[wood]], the chambers could also serve as places for storage of the dead from one family or social group and were often used over long periods for multiple burials. 

Most chamber tombs were constructed from large stones or [[megalith]]s and covered by [[cairn]]s, [[tumulus|barrows]] or earth. Some chamber tombs are [[rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] [[monument]]s or wooden-chambered tombs covered with [[long barrow|earth barrows]]. [[Grave good]]s are a common characteristic of chamber tomb burials.

In [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[Europe]], stone-built examples of these burials are known by the generic term of [[megalithic tomb]]s. Chamber tombs are often distinguished by the layout of their chambers and entrances or the shape and material of the structure that covered them, either an earth barrow or stone cairn. A wide variety of local types has been identified, and some designs appear to have influenced others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2904">The '''chorus of the elderly in classical Greek drama''' is a common [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theater of that period]]. Out of the thirty or so plays that are extant from the classical period, seven have choruses that consist of elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner, Thomas M. ''The Poetics of Old Age in Greek Epic, Lyric and Tragedy''.Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1995.242&lt;/ref&gt; Choruses in ancient drama often provided some moralizing lesson to the protagonist, especially in tragedy. However, the figures of the elderly chorus often seem to imply a traditional way of thinking that has become outdated with time, or, in some cases, provide a model of inefficacy. As history progressed from the early stages of Greek drama (with Aeschylus) the chorus became more integrated with the happenings on stage, rendering the chorus a messenger between the world of the audience and that of the actors.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. D. F. Kitto|Kitto, H.D.F.]] ''Greek Tragedy'' London: Methuen, 1939. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tragedy ==
The chorus of the elderly within tragedy is often used as an exemplar of old social mores.  They are often ineffectual at admonishing main actors or interfering with the main plot. Sophocles in ''Oedipus at Colonus'' uses the chorus to relate to the aging protagonist, who has wandered to the town for safety. A common trope is that the elderly chorus provides sympathy and empathy for those in need as they too are in a deteriorating state, nearing their doom.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus of elders not only attempt to protect Oedipus but fail miserably; while the chorus speaks aggressively it is well known that they are too frail to attempt any sort of defense of the protagonist from physical harm. Similar outcomes of choral interference with onstage happenings occur in many other plays, including Agamemnon. Falkner notes that in tragedy the elderly are presented as [[Quixotism|quixotic]] and obsessed with the prospect of doom inherent in old age; he also notes that often the elderly are presented as mourners within plays, perhaps relating to the number of sorrows old age allows one to accrue in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comedy ==
Aristophanes uses the chorus of the elderly for varying reasons within his comedies. For example, the chorus of the elderly within ''The Wasps'' plays both a comedic role and also serves as a political counterfoil to the young, cosmopolitans of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Wencis, Leonard. ''The Social Significance of Youth in New Comedy'' Ann Arbor: University Microfilms, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plays  ==
*''[[The Wasps]]''
*''[[Lysistrata]]''
*''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]''
*''[[The Suppliants (Euripides)|The Suppliants]]''
*''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]''
*''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]''
*''[[Heracleidae (play)|Heracleidae]]''

[[File:NigerEmbassies emblems.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Comparisons of the official coat of arms of Niger, as used in two Embassies of the Republic of Niger (to Canada and to the United States of America). Note the differences in both scale and shield colour with the seal used on documents of the President and National Assembly of the Republic of Niger.]]
The '''coat of arms of [[Niger]]''' shows a four-part flag draping in the national colors orange, white, and green.  In the middle, the state seal is arranged.  On a white or gold shield the four golden symbols are shown.  In the middle, there is a [[Sun (heraldry)|sun]], to the left there is a vertical [[spear]] with two crossed [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] [[sword]]s, to the right are three [[pearl millet]] heads and underneath is the frontal view of a [[zebu]] head.  Under the coat of arms, there is a ribbon bearing the name of the country in French: ''Republique du Niger''. While the constitution of Niger stipulates the color of the symbols upon the shield, there is no uniformity on the color of the shield. The 1999 Constitution reproduces the text of earlier constitutions, making a distinction between the Seal of State (''Le Sceau de l'État'') for which no shield colour is stipulated and the Coat of Arms of the Republic (''Les Armoiries de la République'') for which [[Sinople (heraldry)|Sinople]] is stipulated as the shield colour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_de_la_R%C3%A9publique_du_Niger Constitution de la République du Niger, Adoptée le 18 juillet 1999 et promulguée par le décret n°99-320/PCRN du 9 août 1999]. Titre premier : De l’État et de la souveraineté. Article premier (''First Section, First Article'')&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sinople'' is analogous to ''[[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]]'' (Green) in heraldry, but official buildings and documents do not display green shields.  Embassies and official documents use white, with gold emblems.  The website of the [[President of Niger]] uses gold or yellow with dark gold or black emblems.  The [[National Assembly of Niger]] meets below a large coat of arms with the shield coloured gold and the emblems in a darker gold.&lt;ref&gt;See description and images at [http://www.presidence.ne/symboles.php The Presidency of Niger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030062655/http://www.presidence.ne/symboles.php |date=2007-10-30 }} and images of the Assembly chamber at [http://www.assemblee.ne/ The official site of the National Assembly].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see Article 1 of the first section of the 1999 constitution: [http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/CAFRAD/UNPAN002961.pdf Constitution Du Niger Du 18 Juillet 1999 (Promulguée par décret N° 99-320 / PCRN du 09 Août 1999)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002081815/http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/CAFRAD/UNPAN002961.pdf |date=2008-10-02 }}, and the website of the Presidency of Niger [http://www.presidence.ne/symboles.php Symboles du Niger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030062655/http://www.presidence.ne/symboles.php |date=2007-10-30 }}, (consulted 2008-07-25).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning of the colors and symbols ==
There have been several meanings proposed for the colours of the Nigerien nation, but there is no constitutional reference to these meanings.  Commonly, these meanings are described as
* Orange: stands for the [[Sahara Desert]] on the northern border of the country.
* Green: stands for the grass plains in the south and west, which the [[Niger River]] flows through.
* White: stands for [[hope]].  For the Niger State it additionally symbolizes the [[Savanna]] region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7546">'''Dacian art''' is the art associated with the peoples known as [[Dacians]] or North Thracians; The Dacians created an art style in which the influences of Scythians and the Greeks can be seen. They were highly skilled in gold and silver working and in pottery making. Pottery was white with red decorations in floral, geometric, and stylized animal motifs. Similar decorations were worked in metal, especially the figure of a horse, which was common on Dacian coins.{{sfn| Waldman| Mason |2006|p=208}}  

==Background ==
[[File:Daci Terra Getarum cf Strabo.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dacians regions cf. [[Strabo]] (ca. 20 AD) by Muller (1877) {{sfn|Müller|1877|loc=tabulae XV}}]]
[[File:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic2.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dacian gold bowl found in Transylvania (Vienna Museum)]]

The Geto-Dacians lived in a very large territory, stretching from the [[Balkans]] to the northern [[Carpathians]] and from the [[Black Sea]] and the river [[Tyras]] to the [[Tisza|Tisa]] plain, sometimes even to the [[Middle Danube]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=25}} Between 15th-12th century, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}



Dacian civilization went through several stages of development, from the Thracian stage in the Bronze Age to the classical period of the Geto-Dacians (the first century BC to the first century AD).{{sfn|Giurescu|Nestorescu|1981|p=47}} In the [[Bronze Age]], proto-Thracian populations emerged from the fusion of the local [[Eneolithic|Eneolithic (Chalcolithic)]] stock with the intruders of the transitional [[Indo-Europeanization Period]]. From these proto-Thracians, in the [[Iron Age]], there were developed the Dacians of the [[Danubian-Carpathian Area]] on the one hand and the Thracians of the eastern [[Balkan Peninsula]] on the other.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|1982|p=53}}

==Pre-Dacian periods==
North Thracian population was chiefly an Early Bronze Age mix of the descendants of intrusive stockbreeding people and of survivors of the autochthonous Chalcolithic culture that the newcomers had destroyed. In this ethnic synthesis which gave birth to the Thracian people, the former predominated but, especially in the more mountainous areas, vestiges of Chalcolithic traditions survived through the Early and into the Middle Bronze Age.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=52}}

The local, Daco-Thracian art should not be mistaken for the art of the Thracians south of the Balkans although mutual influences had undoubtedly appeared.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=62}}


Thracian art was typically geometric in its decoration, a taste which was a remnant of Late Bronze Age traditions.{{sfn|Farkas|1981|p=37}} While the Thracian tribes adopted-no doubt from the Scythians-some aspects of mounted nomadism in the first millennium B.C., they also preserved many traditions of the European Bronze Age and belonged more to the world of European cultures than to that of the East.{{sfn|Farkas|1981|p=33}}

==Classical Dacian periods==

The 1st century BC silver work from the lower Danube region consists mostly of bracelets and fibulae alongside of a small number of decorative disks, plaques, and bowls. To distinguish it from earlier Thracian silver work, one might label this later silver work as Geto-Dacian or Geto-Thracian depending on whether is found above or below the lower Danube.{{sfn|Olmsted|2001|p=22}}


The design of Geto-Dacian helmets (i.e. Ciumesti, Iron Gate) is sufficiently unusual in ancient art to offer the opportunity to trace it to its origin, and, thereby, provide some insight into the Scythian elements that went into the formation of early Dacian art and the means by which ancient Oriental motifs survived and were transmitted into Europe{{sfn|Goldman|1970|p=904}} Almost identical in decoration and details of craftsmanship are the two silver beakers, now in Bucharest and New York and unquestionably were made in the same metalsmith shop as the helmet.{{sfn|Goldman|1970|p=904}}

'''''Eve, the Serpent and Death''''' (or '''''Eve, the Serpent, and Adam as Death''''') is a painting by   the [[German Renaissance]] artist [[Hans Baldung]], housed in the [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]]. The date of the  picture is debated, with proposals ranging from the early 1510s to between 1525 and 1530.   Its four main elements are the biblical [[Eve]], a male figure personifying [[Death (personification)|death]] and generally likened to [[Adam]], a [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]], and a tree trunk.

==History==
The painting was in the collection of British politician [[William Angerstein]] before being auctioned in 1875 at [[Christie's]] as a work of [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], though in fact the work offers a great contrast to Cranach's many Adam and Eve's, from which only the pose of Eve is borrowed.   Almost a century later, it was determined to be a Baldung work by the Scottish branch of [[Sotheby's]], where it was auctioned in 1969. 

The buyer sold it to the National Gallery of Canada of Ottawa in 1972, where it has since been cleaned and restored.

==Description==
Baldung treated [[Fall of Man|the Fall]] in a number of [[woodcut]]s and paintings, which he signifies by the apple and the bite of the serpent; his [[iconography]] is often as original and arresting as in this work.  In this panel, the bodies are grand in scale and fill essentially the entire space, and pale foreground colors are used against a dark background. The main elements are intertwined; the serpent is coiled around the tree trunk and also around Death, who he holds to the tree. Death's right arm extends upward to grasp the apple. The serpent, which has red eyes and a [[weasel]]-like head, closes its jaws around the wrist of Death's left arm, which is at the same time grasping the left arm of Eve. Eve's left hand holds part of the serpent's tail, while her right hand holds an apple behind her back. Among Baldung's treatments of the Fall, the new element in ''Eve, the Serpent and Death'' is the active role of the snake; Adam's decrepit condition, halfway between nude and skeleton,  suggests the work of poison, as if from the serpent, and the snake's grip on Adam recalls the biting of the apple in the Fall. The apple that each of the figures holds is the symbolic origin of the present scene, in which "everything is dependent on and implicated in everything else".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Koerner|Koerner, Joseph Leo]] (1993). ''The Moment of Self-portraiture in German Renaissance Art.'' University of Chicago Press, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the background is a dense forest while two more tree trunks, slim, angled, and parallel, occupy the middle ground. A marguerite, probably an [[oxeye daisy]] (Hieatt), sits at the roots of the main tree trunk, in front of Death's right heel.

The '''national flag of the United Kingdom''' is the '''Union Jack''', also known as the '''Union Flag'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flaginstitute.org/wp/british-flags/the-union-jack-or-the-union-flag/ The Flag Institute]: "It is often stated that the Union Flag should only be described as the Union Jack when flown in the bows of a warship, but this is a relatively recent idea. From early in its life the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use, and in 1902 an Admiralty Circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially. Such use was given Parliamentary approval in 1908 when it was stated that 'the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag'."&lt;/ref&gt;

The current design of the Union Jack dates from the [[Act of Union 1800|union of Ireland and Great Britain]] in 1801. It consists of the [[St George's Cross|red cross]] of [[Saint George]] ([[patron saint]] of [[England]]), edged in white, superimposed on the [[Saint Patrick's Flag|Cross of]] [[St Patrick]] (patron saint of [[Ireland]]), which are superimposed on the [[Flag of Scotland|Saltire]] of [[Saint Andrew]] (patron saint of [[Scotland]]). [[Wales]] is not represented in the Union Flag by Wales's patron saint, [[Saint David]], as at the time the flag was designed Wales was part of the [[Kingdom of England]].

The flag's standard height-to-length proportions are 1:2.&lt;ref name="Flag propartions"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/614768/United-Kingdom-flag-of-the/ United Kingdom, flag of the], for flag ratio see flag caption&lt;/ref&gt; The [[war flag]] variant used by the [[British Army]] modifies the proportions to 3:5 and crops two of the red diagonals.

The earlier [[flag of Great Britain]] was established in 1606 by a [[proclamation]] of [[James I of England|King James VI and I]] of [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scotland]] and [[List of English monarchs|England]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies|A.C. Fox-Davies]], ''[[The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclopædia of Armory]]'' (1904, reprinted 1986, {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}), p. 399: "By the King: Whereas, some differences hath arisen between Our subjects of South and North Britaine travelling by Seas, about the bearing of their Flagges: For the avoiding of all contentions hereafter. We have, with the advice of our Council, ordered: That from henceforth all our Subjects of this Isle and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Kingdome of Great Britaine]], and all our members thereof, shall beare in their main-toppe the [[Flag of England|Red Crosse]], commonly called [[St George's Cross|St George's Crosse]], and the [[Flag of Scotland|White Crosse]], commonly called [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Crosse]], joyned together according to the forme made by our [[herald]]s, and sent by Us to our Admerall to be published to our Subjects: and in their fore-toppe our Subjects of South Britaine shall weare the Red Crosse onely as they were wont, and our Subjects of North Britaine in their fore-toppe the White Crosse onely as they were accustomed"|James VI and I|[[Orders in Council]]; Official creation of the Union Flag – 1606."&lt;/ref&gt; The new flag of the United Kingdom was officially created by an [[Order in Council]] of 1801, reading as follows:
{{Quote|The Union Flag shall be [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], the Crosses [[saltire]] of Saint Andrew and Saint Patrick quarterly per saltire, counter-changed, [[argent]] and [[gules]], the latter [[fimbriation|fimbriated]] of the [[argent|second]], surmounted by the Cross of Saint George of the [[gules|third]] fimbriated as the saltire.&lt;ref&gt;Max Cryer, ''Curious English Words and Phrases: The Truth Behind the Expressions We Use'' (2012), p. 395: "When Britain's official flag settled down in 1801, its exact design and colouring were meticulously written out by Order of Council which described it as 'the Union Flag'... The correct formal wording of the Order of Council, 1801, was..." &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Flying the flag==

&lt;div class="magnify"&gt;[[Template:Union Jack evolution|Bigger Render]]&lt;/div&gt;
Evolution of the Union flag.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The Union Flag can be flown by any individual or organisation in Great Britain on any day of their choice. Legal regulations restrict the use of the [[Union Jack|Union Flag]] on Government buildings in [[Northern Ireland]]. Long-standing restrictions on Government use of the flag elsewhere were abolished in July 2007.&lt;ref name="dcms"&gt;[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]: ''[http://www.culture.gov.uk/flagflying/ Flag Flying]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gob"&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm71/7170/7170.pdf The Governance of Britain], for flying the Union Flag, see pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upside-down===
While the flag appears symmetric, the white lines above and below the diagonal red are different widths. On the side closer to the flagpole (or on the left when depicted on paper), the white lines above the diagonals are wider; on the side farther from the flagpole (or on the right when depicted on paper), the converse is true. Thus, no change will be apparent when rotating the flag 180 degrees, but if mirrored the flag will be upside-down.

Placing the flag upside down is considered [[lèse majesté]] and is offensive to some.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Tempest and agencies  [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jan/19/northernireland.devolution Paisley to stand down as MEP], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 January 2004. "After receiving almost 30% of the overall Northern Ireland vote in the 1979 European election, [[Ian Paisley]] became the first MEP to speak in the parliament when he protested that the Union Flag was flying upside down."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/29213.stm Defence Secretary apologises for flag blunder] BBC News, 13 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be flown upside down as a distress signal. While this is rare, it was used by groups under siege during the [[Boer War]] and during campaigns in India in the late 18th century.

===St Patrick's saltire===
The reason that the UK flag is not symmetrical is because of the relative positions of the saltires of St Patrick and St Andrew. The red saltire of St Patrick is offset such that it does not relegate the white saltire of St Andrew to a mere border. St Andrew's saltire has the higher position at the hoist side with St Patrick's saltire in the higher position on the opposite side.

===Half-mast===
The Union Flag is flown from Government buildings at [[half-mast]] in the following situations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/flagflying/faqs.html ''FAQ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016132137/http://www.culture.gov.uk/flagflying/faqs.html |date=16 October 2008 }} [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*from the announcement of the death of the [[British monarch|Sovereign]] &lt;!-- until when, indefinitely? --&gt; (an exception is made for [[Proclamation Day]] – the day the new Sovereign is proclaimed, when the Flag is flown at full mast from 11&amp;nbsp;am to sunset)
*the day of the funeral of a member of the [[British Royal Family]]
*the funeral of a foreign Head of State
*the funeral of a former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]]

The Sovereign sometimes declares other days when the Union Flag is to fly at [[half-mast]]. Half-mast means the flag is flown two-thirds of the way up the flagpole with at least the height of the flag between the top of the flag and the top of the flagpole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/flagflying/faqs.html#3 ''FAQ: What is half mast?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016132137/http://www.culture.gov.uk/flagflying/faqs.html |date=16 October 2008 }} [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flying from public buildings ==
Until July 2007, the Union Flag was only flown on Government buildings on a limited number of special days each year. The choice of days was managed by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS).&lt;ref name="dcms" /&gt; Government buildings are those used by civil servants, [[the Crown]], or the armed forces. They were not applicable to private citizens, corporations, or local authorities.&lt;ref name="dcms" /&gt;

On 3 July 2007, the [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] laid a [[green paper]] before Parliament entitled ''The Governance of Britain''.&lt;ref name="gob" /&gt; Alongside a range of proposed changes to the constitutional arrangements of the UK was a specific announcement that there would be consultation on whether the rules on flag-flying on Government buildings should be relaxed.

Two days later, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] announced that with immediate effect the Union Flag would fly from the flag pole above the front entrance of [[10 Downing Street]] on every day of the year. The intention was to increase feelings of [[British national identity]]. Other Government departments were asked to follow this lead, and all Government buildings in Whitehall did so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007300940,00.html We're all proud to fly the flag] ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', 5 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page12378.asp Morning Press Briefing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809013048/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page12378.asp |date=9 August 2007 }} by [[Prime Minister's Spokesman]], 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/07/nflag107.xml Union flag already flying all year round] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' 7 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6276280.stm Brown lifts ban on national flag] BBC News, 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2007/07/06/brown_flies_flag_for_britain.html Brown flies flag for Britain] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2034055.ece "Union Jack will fly over No 10 permanently 'to show values'"]. ''[[The Times]]'' 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23403148-details/Whitehall+flies+the+flag+in+boost+for+Britishness/article.do "Gordon orders Whitehall to fly the flag in boost for Britishness"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819090145/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23403148-details/Whitehall+flies+the+flag+in+boost+for+Britishness/article.do |date=19 August 2009 }} ''[[Evening Standard]]'' 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Purnell]], [[Culture Secretary]] from June 2007 to January 2008 in Brown's administration, subsequently concurred with the abolition of the restrictions – pending consultation on longer term arrangements.

===Flag days===
The flag days directed by the DCMS include birthdays of members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], the wedding anniversary of the Monarch, [[Commonwealth Day]], [[Accession Day]], [[Coronation Day]], [[Queen's Birthday|The Queen's official birthday]], [[Remembrance Sunday]] and on the days of the [[State Opening of Parliament|State Opening]] and [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogation]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].

Since the beginning of 2013, the relevant days have been:

* 9 January: birthday of [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|The Duchess of Cambridge]]
* 20 January: birthday of [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|The Countess of Wessex]]
* 6 February: anniversary of [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]]'s accession in 1952
* 19 February: birthday of [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Duke of York]]
* Second Sunday in March: [[Commonwealth Day]]
* 10 March: birthday of [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|The Earl of Wessex]]
* 21 April: The Queen's birthday
* 9 May: [[Europe Day]]
* 2 June: anniversary of The Queen's 1953 [[Coronation Day|coronation]]
* 10 June: birthday of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]
* A Saturday in June: [[Queen's Birthday|The Queen's Official Birthday]]
* 21 June: birthday of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]]
* 17 July: birthday of [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|The Duchess of Cornwall]]
* 15 August: birthday of [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]]
* Second Sunday in November: [[Remembrance Sunday]]
* 14 November: birthday of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]]
* 20 November: anniversary of the wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh

In addition, the flag should be flown in the following areas on the specified days:
* [[Wales]] – 1 March: [[Saint David's Day]]
* [[Northern Ireland]] – 17 March: [[Saint Patrick's Day]]
* [[England]] – 23 April: [[Saint George's Day]]
* [[Scotland]] – 30 November: [[Saint Andrew's Day]]
* [[Greater London]]: The day of the opening or proroguing of Parliament

Some non central government bodies still continue to follow the flag days.

In Scotland, the [[Scottish Government]] has decreed that the [[Flag of Scotland]] ("the Saltire") will fly on all its buildings every day from 8&amp;nbsp;am until sunset, but there is no specific policy on flying the Union Flag and as such it is sometimes flown alongside the Saltire and sometimes omitted. An exception is made for "national days". On these days, the Saltire shall be lowered and replaced with the Union Flag. These are the same as the flag days noted above with the exception of:
* 3 September: [[Merchant Navy]] Day

Another difference is that on [[Saint Andrew's Day]], the Union Flag can only be flown if the building has more than one flagpole – the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag if there is only one flagpole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/royal-ceremonial "Royal and ceremonial"] [[Scottish Government]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland===
In [[Northern Ireland]], the Union Flag is flown from buildings of the [[Northern Ireland Office]] as decreed by Regulations published in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/sr/sr2000/20000347.htm |title=The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulations were amended in 2002 to remove the requirement to fly the flag on the birthdays of [[Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]] who both died that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Sr/sr2003/20030553.htm |title=The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) 2002 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current flag days are now the same as the United Kingdom government days noted above with the exception of the Duchess of Cornwall's birthday, which was only added to the UK flag days after her wedding to the Prince of Wales in 2005, and has not yet been extended to Northern Ireland.

The [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] is the only body in the United Kingdom that is not permitted to fly the Union Flag, and is only permitted to fly its service flag or the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]] in the event of a visit by the Sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Sr/sr2002/20020023.htm |title=Police Emblems and Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed redesigns==

=== Suggested incorporation of the Welsh dragon ===
[[File:Union Flag (including Wales).svg|thumb|One suggested redesign of the Union Jack with the red dragon from the [[flag of Wales]] added in the centre]]
In November 2007 the then culture minister [[Margaret Hodge]] said she would consider a redesign of the Union Flag to incorporate the [[Welsh dragon]], during a debate in the House of Commons on the frequency with which the flag flies above public buildings. The issue was initially raised by [[Ian Lucas]], another [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP, who complained that the flag introduced in 1606 following the accession of [[James VI of Scotland]] to the English throne as James I combined the cross of St George and the saltire of St Andrew. This principle continued in 1801 when the St Patrick cross was incorporated following the [[Union with Ireland Act 1800]]. Lucas claimed the identity of [[Wales]] had been suppressed ever since the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]]. In the debate, [[Albert Owen]] MP said that "we in Wales do not feel part of the union flag because the dragon or the [[Flag of Saint David|cross of St David]] is not on it."&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;Wintour, Patrick (28 November 2007). [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/nov/28/uk.britishidentity  "Minister proposes a redesign for the union flag"], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Stewart Jackson]] described the comments as "eccentric".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;Cleland, Gary (27 November 2007). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/1570613/Union-Jack-should-include-Welsh-flag-says-MP.html "Union Jack should include Welsh flag, says MP"], ''Daily Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scottish independence ===
As of 2013, numerous proposals were made about how the Union Flag might be altered to create a flag for the union of England, Wales and Northern Ireland after possible [[Scottish independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25205017|title=What would the union jack look like if the Scottish bit was removed?|publisher=BBC News|author=Sam Judah|date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[College of Arms]] stated that there would be no need to change the flag in those circumstances, and the existing flag could continue to be used if desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2013-11-26/no-plans-to-change-union-flag/|title=Union Flag: What happens if Scotland wins independence?|date=27 November 2013|publisher=ITV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the removal of Scottish heraldic features from the Union Flag, the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] stated in 2012 that "[that] would be speculation at this stage, and we could only cross that bridge if we came to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/would-the-blue-have-to-be-taken-out-of-union-1128610|title=Would the blue have to be taken out of Union flag if Scotland became independent?|publisher=Daily Record|date=7 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gray Foy''' (1922–2012) was a mid twentieth-century American artist who created a visionary body of drawings from 1941 to 1975. His drawings are generally divided into two phases. First, from 1941–48, the artist drew figurative  [[Surrealist]] landscapes and interiors. Then beginning in the late 1940s, he concentrated on botanical subject matter, both naturalistic and imagined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Quaintance |first1=Don |title=Gray Foy: Drawings 1941–1975 |url=http://www.grayfoydrawings.com/#/exhibition |website=Gray Foy: Drawings 1941–1975 |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography and Education==
Born in 1922 in Dallas, Texas, Foy spent his youth in Los Angeles and attended Los Angeles City College studying art and theater design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Haynes |first1=Lincoln M. |title=Soft-spoken Artist Designs Sets |agency=''Collegian'' |publisher=Los Angeles City College |date=May 8, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1946 he moved back to Dallas and enrolled at Southern Methodist University (SMU) for a year, then transferred in Spring of 1947 to Columbia University, New York City. In 1948, he met [[Leo Lerman]] (a writer and editor for various [[Condé Nast]] magazines and for ''[[Playbill]]'' magazine), who became his lifelong mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pascal |first1=[Leo Lerman].

== Early career ==
When Foy first painted seriously in the early 1940s—just after entering college—his opaque watercolors and oils were patterned after such Surrealists as [[Max Ernst]] and [[Salvador Dalí]]. In compressed perspectives, stagelike scenes of deserted cityscapes evoke a sense of dislocation and menace.

Beginning in 1943, Foy worked as a shipping expediter at the defense plant Lockheed [[Vega Aircraft Corporation]] in Burbank, California. Using standard-issue No. 2 pencils, he drew on procurement forms, depicting humanoid figures that emerge from rocky outcroppings and are coincident with the carnage of WWII.&lt;br&gt;
 
Late in WWII, Foy began making larger format drawings. These hallucinatory scenes became his first cohesive visions. After atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, Foy responded by depicting human and animal inhabitants that reveal the instability of their molecular basis. In his largest drawing of this period, ''Dimensions'' (ca. 1945–46, Museum of Modern Art, New York),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Foy |first1=Gray |title=Gray Foy. ''Dimensions''. c.1945–46, {{!}} MoMA |url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/94298?classifications=any&amp;date_begin=Pre-1850&amp;date_end=2018&amp;locale=en&amp;page=1&amp;q=gray+foy&amp;with_images=1 |website=www.moma.org |publisher=Museum of Modern Art, New York |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; disparate figures and body parts, interior furnishings, vegetation, and geometric shapes pulsate through a dense three-dimensional space where the spatial trickery evokes that of [[M. C. Escher]]. When exhibited in 2008, the ''New York Times'' wrote of ''Dimensions'' that "A pencil drawing by Gray Foy, a little-known American artist born in 1923, is ... a scrambled, congested, Dalí-like composition of body parts, still-life, architecture, and landscape made with unbelievable refinement and microscopic detailing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Ken |title=‘Glossolalia: Languages of Drawing’ Opens at the Museum of Modern Art |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/arts/design/30glos.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Foy’s midcentury universe, when humans seek the comfort of familiar spaces they discover instead amorphousness, velocity, and weightlessness. The pictures also reflect an affinity with the work of [[American Realist]]s such as [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] and [[John Steuart Curry]], whose tropes include the overlapping vignettes of mural painting, often  populated by figures whose bodies are contoured or distorted to mimic their immediate setting.&lt;br&gt;
 
Foy himself referred to his imagery as “hyper-realism,” stating in 1948 "I may turn out to be a realist. After all, hyper-realism actually becomes the supernatural.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Artist, 25, Adds a Time Element to His Pictures |publisher=''New York Herald Tribune'' |date=May 21, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; A realist direction was fostered when his wartime employment ended and he moved back to Dallas to renew his art studies at Southern Methodist with his teachers [[Jerry Bywaters]] and Otis Dozier, both referred to as Lone Star Regionalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pace |first1=Margaret |title=Promising Talent Exhibited in SMU Art Show Tuesday |agency=''SMU Campus'' |issue=May 25, 1946 |publisher=Southern Methodist University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dallas Morning News'' said Foy's "provocative Surrealist pencil drawings are the sensation of the current year-end exhibit at SMU."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Peggy Louise |title=Local Gallery Hangs Exhibit by Two Artists |publisher=''Dallas Morning News'' |date=May 26, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, on his first trip to New York, the twenty-four-year-old Foy took his portfolio to the influential art and literary publication ''View'' magazine. In the fall of 1946, ''View'' published ''Untitled [Courtyard with Morphing Figures]'' (1946), a seamless mix of the marvelous and the monstrous and its appearance launched Foy’s career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ford |first1=Charles Henri |title=Page Found in a Drawing Book by Gray Foy |journal=View |date=Fall 1946 |volume=VII |issue=1 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Foy moved to New York in spring 1947, enrolling at Columbia University to study studio art and art history, as well as anatomy and botany, two fields that underpin much of his imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Artist, 25, Adds a Time Element to His Pictures |publisher=''New York Herald Tribune'' |date=May 21, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, as in [[Pavel Tchelitchew]]’s work, Foy began his own explorations merging plant life with human features.

Foy sought gallery representation, and R. Kirk Askew became his first and only dealer at Durlacher Bros. on 57th Street. Reviewers noted the rigor of Foy’s scrutiny, describing his “microscopic vision”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Miers |first1=Virgil |title=Dallas Artist Becoming a National Figure |publisher=''Dallas Times Herald'' |date=June 3, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “infinitesimal details glossed over by the average vision.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coates |first1=Robert M. |title=Whitney Annual |journal= ''The New Yorker'' |date=April 28, 1956 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by the time of his first one-person exhibition at Durlacher’s in April 1951, Foy had nearly abandoned Surrealist imagery and began concentrating instead on the depiction of botanical organisms undergoing transitional states. The ''New York Time'''s critic Stuart Preston wrote: "Foy's pencil and brush spin out a tissue of delicacy and transparency, light enough to seem to have settled on the paper like frost, strong enough to have netted in its gossamer texture enough visual data about the plant forms to astound a botanist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Preston |first1=Stuart |title=Diverse New Shows, Drawings by Modigliani, Newman, Foy Wells |publisher=''New York Times'' |date=April 29, 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mature Work ==
At his second one-person exhibition at Durlacher’s in 1957, his observations of nature had matured, as evidenced by the intricate biological invention in such works as ''Uprooted Plants'' (1955, Whitney Museum of American Art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Foy |first1=Gray |title=Whitney Museum of American Art: Gray Foy: Uprooted Plants |url=http://collection.whitney.org/object/1981 |website=collection.whitney.org |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;). As his work evolved through the 1950s, the artist developed an understanding of constant change in nature and honed his ability to depict such metamorphosis.

In the three decades Foy was active, he found a way to convey his fertile awareness of nature’s disorder as well as its order by refining his technical prowess. Achieved by a delicate feathering technique, the edges of the depicted organic matter gradually disappear as lighter and lighter pencil pressure traverses the sheet.&lt;br&gt;
 
About 1957 Foy began a series of related still lifes that involve leaves or branches wrapped by human hands into clusters or sheaves, or assembled by birds into nests. With its inner pinkish radiance and veined leaf surfaces, ''Cluster of Leaves'' (ca. 1957), for example, quivers with the power of an incubating egg. These drawings are metaphors for efforts to control the untamed sprawl of natural vegetation.

In one group of works, Foy developed an additional illustrative mechanism, preparing the drawing paper with a teeming texture, introducing earthy tones and chlorophyll-like colorations. The activated surfaces simulate organic matter such as soil incrustation, moldy walls, lichen-covered rocks, or pond scum. In his book ''The Language of Ornament'', art historian James Trilling described the effect: "Gray Foy’s drawing evokes the richness of a living coral reef, or the cheerfully haunted rocks that provide a background 
to some of the finest Persian miniatures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trilling |first1=James |title=The Language of Ornament |date=2001 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |isbn=978-0500203439 |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving a career-affirming John Simon Guggenheim grant in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Foy |first1=Gray |title=John Simon Guggenheim Fellows |url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/gray-foy/ |website=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foy concentrated on his largest drawing, ''The Third Kingdom'' (1961–62), in which monochromatic greenish-umber tones convey the pro-longed activity of organic upheaval. Working on fibrous Japanese paper, Foy spent a year trying to illustrate elemental rock forms.&lt;br&gt;
 
Such mature drawings focus on botanical and geological forms in the act of transformation. They presage a modern-day concentration on ecological concerns by excavating the progression of natural processes. Curator Stephen C. Wicks explained: "The rich array of textures serves as a seductive skin beneath which the artist’s plant forms appear to germinate, writhe, and wither. The resulting effect underscores Gray Foy’s ability to create surrealist compositions of uncommon craftsmanship and visionary form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wicks |first1=Stephen C. |title=Lines of Discovery : 225 years of American drawings, the Columbus Museum |date=2006 |publisher=Columbus Museum |location=Columbus, Ga. |isbn=978-1904832126 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist's mature compositions are his spirited attempts to render on paper the mysteries of the biomass and origins of the life force.

== Illustrations ==
To supplement the limited income he received from his fine art pursuits, Foy was actively involved in designing and illustrating magazine features in ''Mademoiselle'' magazine, book jackets for numerous publishers, and album covers for Long-Playing Records for Columbia Masterworks and Epic. Noteworthy book jackets include first editions of J. R. Salamanca's ''Lilith'' (1961) and Ray Bradbury's ''Something Evil This Way Comes'' (1962). Foy's design of the cover for [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s recording of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''Le sacre du printemps'' (1957) was of such renown that it was reprinted on the hundredth-anniversary commemorative DVD edition (2013). A selection of such commercial illustrations is listed below.

&lt;!-- first para – definition, science and nature--&gt;
'''Green''' is the color between [[blue]] and [[yellow]] on the [[visible spectrum]]. It is evoked by light which has a [[dominant wavelength]] of roughly 495{{ndash}}570 [[Nanometre|nm]]. In [[subtractive color]] systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and [[cyan]]; in the [[RGB color model]], used on television and computer screens, it is one of the [[additive primary colors]], along with [[red]] and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is [[chlorophyll]], the chemical by which plants [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as [[camouflage]]. Several [[minerals]] have a green color, including the [[emerald]], which is colored green by its [[chromium]] content.

&lt;!-- 2nd para – history and culture --&gt;
During [[Post-classical history|post-classical]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe, green was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. For this reason, the costume of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and the benches in the British [[House of Commons]] are green while those in the [[House of Lords]] are red.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=98}} It also has a long historical tradition as the color of [[Ireland]] and of [[Gaelic culture]]. It is the historic color of [[Islam]], representing the lush vegetation of [[Paradise]]. It was the color of the banner of [[Muhammad]], and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=94-98}}

&lt;!-- 3rd para – symbolism and associations--&gt;
In surveys made in [[Americas|American]], European, and [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]], green is the color most commonly associated with [[nature]], [[life]], [[health]], [[youth]], [[spring (season)|spring]], [[hope]] and [[envy]].{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=87–104}} In the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]], green is also sometimes associated with [[toxicity]] and poor health,{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=96-97}} but in China and most of Asia, its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=87–104}} Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the [[environmental movement]]. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the [[Green politics|Green movement]], some naming themselves [[Green party|Green parties]]. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or [[environmentally friendly]], products. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] permits permanent residence in the United States.

== Etymology and linguistic definitions ==
[[File:Leavessnipedale.jpg|thumb|right|The word ''green'' has the same Germanic root as the words for ''grass'' and ''grow'']]

The word ''green'' comes from the [[Middle English]] and [[Old English]] word ''grene'', which, like the German word ''grün'', has the same root as the words ''grass'' and ''grow''.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', The World Publishing Company, New York, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is from a [[Common Germanic]] ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/grōniz|*gronja]]-'', which is also reflected in [[Old Norse]] ''grænn'', [[Old High German]] ''gruoni'' (but unattested in [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]]), ultimately from a [[PIE root]] ''*{{PIE|ghre-}}'' "to grow", and root-cognate with ''[[:wikt:grass|grass]]'' and ''[[:wikt:grow|to grow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Harper| first =Douglas| title =Online Etymology Dictionary| date =November 2001| url =http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=green&amp;searchmode=none| accessdate = November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first recorded use of the word as a color term in Old English dates to ca. AD 700.&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul (1930). ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York: McGraw-Hill p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Latin]] with ''[[:wikt:viridis|viridis]]'' also has a genuine and widely used term for "green". Related to ''virere'' "to grow" and ''ver'' "spring", it gave rise to words in several [[Romance languages]], French ''vert'', Italian ''verde'' (and English ''[[wikt:vert|vert]]'', ''[[:wikt:verdure|verdure]]'' etc.).&lt;ref name="Pastoureau"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pastoureau|first=Michel |title=Green: The History of a Color|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=2014|pages=20–21|isbn=978-0-691-15936-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eRHWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=green+colour#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20colour&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the [[Slavic languages]] with ''[[:wikt:зелёный|zelenъ]]''. [[Ancient Greek]] also had a term for yellowish, pale green – [[:wikt:χλωρός|χλωρός]], ''chloros'' (cf. the color of chlorine), cognate with χλοερός "verdant" and χλόη "the green of new growth".

Thus, the languages mentioned above (Germanic, Romance, Slavic, Greek) have old terms for "green" which are derived from words for fresh, sprouting vegetation.
However, [[comparative linguistics]] makes clear that these terms were coined independently, over the past few millennia, and there is no identifiable single [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] or word for "green". For example, the Slavic ''zelenъ'' is cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''[[hari]]'' "yellow, ochre, golden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=/data/ie/vasmer&amp;text_number=++4332&amp;root=config |title=Vasmer's dictionary of Slavic etymology |publisher=Starling.rinet.ru |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Turkic languages]] also have ''jašɨl'' "green" or "yellowish green", compared to a Mongolian word for "meadow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Calt%5Cturcet&amp;first=1&amp;off=&amp;text_proto=&amp;method_proto=substring&amp;ic_proto=on&amp;text_meaning=&amp;method_meaning=substring&amp;ic_meaning=on&amp;text_rusmean=&amp;method_rusmean=substring&amp;ic_rusmean=on&amp;text_atu=&amp;method_atu=substring&amp;ic_atu=on&amp;text_krh=&amp;method_krh=substring&amp;ic_krh=on&amp;text_trk=&amp;method_trk=substring&amp;ic_trk=on&amp;text_tat=&amp;method_tat=substring&amp;ic_tat=on&amp;text_chg=&amp;method_chg=substring&amp;ic_chg=on&amp;text_uzb=&amp;method_uzb=substring&amp;ic_uzb=on&amp;text_uig=&amp;method_uig=substring&amp;ic_uig=on&amp;text_sjg=&amp;method_sjg=substring&amp;ic_sjg=on&amp;text_azb=&amp;method_azb=substring&amp;ic_azb=on&amp;text_trm=&amp;method_trm=substring&amp;ic_trm=on&amp;text_hak=&amp;method_hak=substring&amp;ic_hak=on&amp;text_shr=&amp;method_shr=substring&amp;ic_shr=on&amp;text_alt=&amp;method_alt=substring&amp;ic_alt=on&amp;text_khal=&amp;method_khal=substring&amp;ic_khal=on&amp;text_chv=&amp;method_chv=substring&amp;ic_chv=on&amp;text_jak=&amp;method_jak=substring&amp;ic_jak=on&amp;text_dolg=&amp;method_dolg=substring&amp;ic_dolg=on&amp;text_tuv=&amp;method_tuv=substring&amp;ic_tuv=on&amp;text_tof=&amp;method_tof=substring&amp;ic_tof=on&amp;text_krg=&amp;method_krg=substring&amp;ic_krg=on&amp;text_kaz=&amp;method_kaz=substring&amp;ic_kaz=on&amp;text_nogx=&amp;method_nogx=substring&amp;ic_nogx=on&amp;text_bas=&amp;method_bas=substring&amp;ic_bas=on&amp;text_blkx=&amp;method_blkx=substring&amp;ic_blkx=on&amp;text_gagx=&amp;method_gagx=substring&amp;ic_gagx=on&amp;text_krmx=&amp;method_krmx=substring&amp;ic_krmx=on&amp;text_klpx=&amp;method_klpx=substring&amp;ic_klpx=on&amp;text_sal=&amp;method_sal=substring&amp;ic_sal=on&amp;text_qum=&amp;method_qum=substring&amp;ic_qum=on&amp;text_reference=&amp;method_reference=substring&amp;ic_reference=on&amp;text_any=green&amp;method_any=substring&amp;sort=proto&amp;ic_any=on |title=Sergei Starostin, Turkic etymology |publisher=Starling.rinet.ru |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some languages, including old [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], old [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the same word can mean either blue or green.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kay and Luisa Maffi, "Color Appearance and the Emergence and Evolution of Basic Color Lexicons", ''American Anthropologist'', March 1999 [http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/color.app.evol.ps]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese character]] [[wikt:青|青]] (pronounced ''qīng'' in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], ''[[Ao (color)|ao]]'' in Japanese, and ''[[wikt:thanh|thanh]]'' in [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]]) has a meaning that covers both [[Distinguishing blue from green in language|blue and green]]; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of "[[wikt:青|青]]". In more contemporary terms, they are [[wikt:藍|藍]] (''lán'', in Mandarin) and [[wikt:綠|綠]] (''lǜ'', in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, [[wikt:緑|緑]] (''midori'', which is derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb ''midoru'' "to be in leaf, to flourish" in reference to trees) and グリーン (''guriin'', which is derived from the English word "green"). However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have the same colors as other countries have, the green light is described using the same word as for blue, ''aoi'', because green is considered a shade of aoi; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green ''[[perilla|shiso]]'' (as opposed to red apples and red shiso) will be described with the word ''aoi''. Vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green, ''[[wikt:xanh|xanh]]'', with variants such as ''xanh da trời'' (azure, lit. "sky blue"), ''lam'' (blue), and ''lục'' (green; also ''xanh lá cây'', lit. "leaf green").

"Green" in modern European languages corresponds to about 520–570&amp;nbsp;nm, but many historical and non-European languages make other choices, e.g. using a term for the range of ca. 450–530&amp;nbsp;nm ("blue/green") and another for ca. 530–590&amp;nbsp;nm ("green/yellow").{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In the comparative study of [[color term]]s in the world's languages, green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors (white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue), or more rarely in systems with five colors (white, red, yellow, green, and black/blue).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution |first=Brent |last=Berlin |author2=Paul Kay |edition=new, revised  |location=Stanford, Cal. |publisher=CSLI Publications |series=The David Hume Series of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences Reissues |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-57586-162-3 |oclc=807758450 |pages=2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See distinction of green from blue)&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Paul and Martha Ratliff (2001). ''Linguistic Fieldwork''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-66937-5}}. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; These languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote "green", but these terms are recognizable as recent adoptions that are not in origin color terms (much like the English adjective [[:wikt:orange|orange]] being in origin not a color term but the name of a fruit). Thus, the [[Thai language|Thai]] word เขียว ''kheīyw'', besides meaning "green", also means "rank" and "smelly" and holds other unpleasant associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Search for 'เขียว' |website=English: Thai Dictionary OnLine| publisher =4M System| year =2007| url=http://english-thai-dictionary.com/index.php?q=%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A7&amp;sa=Dictionary-search&amp;fields%5B%5D=related&amp;siteurl=english-thai-dictionary.com%2Findex.php| accessdate = November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Celtic languages]] had a term for "blue/green/grey", [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*glasto-'', which gave rise to [[Old Irish]] ''glas'' "green, grey" and to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''glas'' "blue". This word is cognate with the Ancient Greek γλαυκός "bluish green", contrasting with χλωρός "yellowish green" discussed above.

In modern Japanese, the term for green is [[:wikt:緑|緑]], while the old term for "blue/green", {{Nihongo|blue|青|Ao}} now means "blue". But in certain contexts, green is still conventionally referred to as 青, as in {{Nihongo|''blue [[traffic light]]''|青信号|ao shingō}} and {{Nihongo|''blue [[leaves]]''|青葉|aoba}}, reflecting the absence of blue-green distinction in old Japanese (more accurately, the [[Traditional colors of Japan|traditional Japanese color terminology]] grouped some [[shades of green]] with blue, and others with yellow tones).

The [[Persian language]] is traditionally lacking a black/blue/green distinction. The Persian word سبز ''sabz'' can mean "green", "black", or "dark". Thus, Persian erotic poetry, dark-skinned women are addressed as ''sabz-eh'', as in phrases like سبز گندم گون ''sabz-eh-gandom-gun'' (literally "''dark'' wheat colored") or سبز مليح ''sabz-eh-malih'' ("a ''dark'' beauty").&lt;ref&gt;[[F. Steingass]], ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'' s.v. سبز&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Sudanese Arabic]], dark-skinned people are described as أخضر ''akhḍar'', the term which in [[Standard Arabic]] stands unambiguously for "green".&lt;ref name="Greenness in the Field"&gt;Carla N.

In optics, the [[perception]] of green is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a [[wavelength]] of roughly 495{{ndash}}570{{nbsp}}[[Nanometre|nm]]. The sensitivity of the dark-adapted human eye is greatest at about 507{{nbsp}}nm, a blue-green color, while the light-adapted eye is most sensitive about 555{{nbsp}}nm, a yellow-green; these are the peak locations of the rod and cone (scotopic and photopic, respectively) [[luminosity function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympusmicro.com/primer/lightandcolor/humanvisionintro.html | title = Human Vision and Color Perception | website = Olympus Microscopy Resource Center | accessdate = September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception of greenness (in opposition to redness forming one of the [[opponent process|opponent]] mechanisms in human [[color vision]]) is evoked by light which triggers the medium-wavelength ''M'' [[cone cell]]s in the eye more than the long-wavelength ''L'' cones. Light which triggers this greenness response more than the yellowness or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green. A green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487{{ndash}}570&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;More specifically, "blue green" 487–493 nm, "bluish green" 493–498 nm, "green" 498–530 nm, "yellowish green" 530–559 nm, "yellow green" 559–570 nm {{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = Kenneth L. | year = 1943 | title = Color Designations for Lights | url = | journal = [[Journal of the Optical Society of America]] | volume = 33 | issue = 11| pages = 627–32 | doi=10.1364/josa.33.000627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human eyes have color receptors known as cone cells, of which there are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause [[color blind]]ness, including the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as [[deuteranopia]] or red{{ndash}}green color blindness.&lt;ref name = brit&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica''. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2002. {{ISBN|0-85229-787-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Donald A. "Fatigue: Public Enemy Number One: What It Is and How to Fight It." ''The American Journal of Nursing'' (Sep 1933) 33.9 pp. 835–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[subtractive color]] system, used in painting and color printing, green is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and [[cyan]]; in the [[RGB color model]], used on television and computer screens, it is one of the [[additive primary colors]], along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors.    On the [[HSV color space|HSV color wheel]], also known as the [[:File:RBG color wheel.svg|RGB color wheel]], the [[Complementary color|complement]] of green is [[magenta]]; that is, a color corresponding to an equal mixture of [[red]] and [[blue]] light (one of the [[purple]]s). On a traditional color wheel, based on subtractive color, the complementary color to green is considered to be red.&lt;ref name = wheel&gt;{{cite web| title =Glossary Term: Color wheel| publisher =Sanford Corp.| year =2005| url =http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html| accessdate = November 22, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021215/http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html|archivedate=September 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In additive color devices such as computer displays and televisions, one of the [[primary colors|primary]] light sources is typically a narrow-spectrum yellowish-green of dominant wavelength ~550{{nbsp}}nm; this "green" primary is combined with an orangish-red "red" primary and a purplish-blue "blue" primary to produce any color in between{{snds}}the RGB color model. A [[unique hues|unique green]] (green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish) is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary.

=== Lasers ===
[[Laser]]s emitting in the green part of the spectrum are widely available to the general public in a wide range of output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532{{nbsp}}nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state ([[DPSS]]) technology to create the green light.&lt;ref name="laserglow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/page/greenlaserpointer |title=Laserglow – Green Lasers |publisher=Laserglow.com| accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An infrared [[laser diode]] at 808{{nbsp}}nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-[[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064&amp;nbsp;nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532{{nbsp}}nm ("green").&lt;ref name="Sams Laser FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://donklipstein.com/laserssl.htm |title=Sams Laser FAQ |publisher=Sam Goldwasser |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501&amp;nbsp;nm to 543&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="laserglow2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/int-labOEM.htm |title=Laserglow – DPSS Lasers |publisher=Laserglow.com| accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green wavelengths are also available from [[gas laser]]s, including the [[helium–neon laser]] (543{{nbsp}}nm), the Argon-[[ion laser]] (514{{nbsp}}nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521{{nbsp}}nm and 531{{nbsp}}nm), as well as liquid [[dye laser]]s. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, [[laser light shows]], [[spectroscopy]], [[interferometry]], [[fluorescence]], [[holography]], [[machine vision]], [[non-lethal weapons]] and [[bird control]].&lt;ref name="laserglow3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/page/golfcoursebirdcontrol |title=Laserglow – Green lasers for Bird Control / Abatement |publisher=Laserglow.com| accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of mid-2011, direct green laser diodes at 510{{nbsp}}nm and 500{{nbsp}}nm have become generally available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laserpointerforums.com/f45/review-510nm-direct-green-diodes-build-photos-dgh-n1-dgh-n2-69678.html|title=Review: 510nm Direct Green Diodes / Build Photos (DGH-N1, DGH-N2) – Laser Pointer Forums – Discuss Laser Pointers|date=|website=laserpointerforums.com|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the price remains relatively prohibitive for widespread public use. The efficiency of these lasers (peak 3%){{citation needed|date=August 2013}} compared to that of DPSS green lasers (peak 35%){{citation needed|date=August 2013}} may also be limiting adoption of the diodes to niche uses.

=== Pigments, food coloring and fireworks ===
[[File:Chicago River dyed green, focus on river.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Chicago River]] is dyed green every year to mark [[St. Patrick's Day]]]]

Many minerals provide [[pigment]]s which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through [[luminescent]] or [[phosphorescent]] qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the [[emerald]], which is colored green by trace amounts of [[chromium]] and sometimes [[vanadium]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurlbut, Cornelius S. Jr, &amp; Kammerling, Robert C., 1991, ''Gemology'', p. 203, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium(III) oxide (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is called [[Chromium(III) oxide|chrome green]], also called [[viridian]] or institutional green when used as a pigment.&lt;ref name="Academic Press 2001" /&gt; For many years, the source of [[amazonite|amazonite's]] color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to [[copper]] because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of [[lead]] and water in the [[feldspar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hoffmeister and Rossman | title=A spectroscopic study of irradiation coloring of amazonite; structurally hydrous, Pb-bearing feldspar | journal=Am. Mineral. | year=1985 | volume=70 | pages=794–804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper is the source of the green color in [[malachite]] pigments, chemically known as basic [[copper(II) carbonate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/malachite.html | title = Malachite | publisher = WebExhibits | year = 2001 | accessdate = December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Verdigris]] is made by placing a plate or blade of copper, brass or bronze, slightly warmed, into a vat of fermenting wine, leaving it there for several weeks, and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal. The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. It was used by the Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable [[chrome green]].{{sfn|Varichon|2000|pp=214–15}} Viridian, also called chrome green, is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate, was patented in 1859. It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic. [[Vincent van Gogh]] used it, along with [[Prussian blue]], to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting [[Cafe terrace at night]].&lt;ref name="Academic Press 2001" /&gt;

[[Green earth]] is a natural pigment used since the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. It is composed of clay colored by [[iron oxide]], [[magnesium]], [[aluminum silicate]], or [[potassium]]. Large deposits were found in the South of France near [[Nice]], and in Italy around [[Verona]], on [[Cyprus]], and in [[Bohemia]]. The clay was crushed, washed to remove impurities, then powdered. It was sometimes called Green of Verona.{{sfn|Varichon|2000|pp=210–11}}

Mixtures of oxidized [[cobalt]] and [[zinc]] were also used to create green paints as early as the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/cogreen.html | title = Cobalt green | publisher = WebExhibits | year = 2001 | accessdate = December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cobalt green]], sometimes known as [[Cobalt green#Rinman's green|Rinman's green]] or zinc green, is a translucent green pigment made by heating a mixture of cobalt (II) oxide and zinc oxide. [[Sven Rinman]], a Swedish chemist, discovered this compound in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;'''Green Pigment Spins chip promise.''' August 2006, news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4776479.stm&lt;/ref&gt;
Green chrome oxide was a new synthetic green created by a chemist named Pannetier in Paris in about 1835. Emerald green was a synthetic deep green made in the 19th century by hydrating chrome oxide. It was also known as Guignet green.&lt;ref name="Academic Press 2001"&gt;A. F. Holleman and E. Wiberg "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press, 2001, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Green is common in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll, which is involved in [[photosynthesis]]. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = If the sun's light peaks in the green, why do plants prefer to reflect green light (giving them their green color)?

Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using [[bacteriorhodopsin]]. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, A.

Animals typically use the color green as [[camouflage]], blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name = brit /&gt; Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. [[Turacoverdin]] is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially.&lt;ref name = brit /&gt; Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of [[porphyrin]] pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are [[flavins]] (lychochromes) and hemanovadin.&lt;ref name = brit /&gt; Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include [[biliverdin]], the green pigment in [[bile]], and [[ceruloplasmin]], a [[protein]] that carries copper [[ion]]s in [[chelation]].

There is no green pigment in green eyes; like the color of blue eyes, it is an optical illusion; its appearance is caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of the [[Stroma of cornea|stroma]], given by a low or moderate concentration of [[melanin]], with the blue tone imparted by the [[Rayleigh scattering]] of the reflected light.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Denis Llewellyn (1979).

== In history and art ==
===Prehistoric history===

[[Neolithic]] cave paintings do not have traces of green pigments, but neolithic peoples in northern Europe did make a green dye for clothing, made from the leaves of the [[birch]] tree. It was of very poor quality, more brown than green. Ceramics from ancient [[Mesopotamia]] show people wearing vivid green costumes, but it is not known how the colors were produced.&lt;ref name="Anne Vachiron 2000 pg. 196"&gt;Anne Vachiron (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient history ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Ancient Egypt]], green was the symbol of regeneration and rebirth, and of the crops made possible by the annual flooding of the Nile. For painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus, Egyptian artists used finely ground malachite, mined in the west Sinai and the eastern desert; a paintbox with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of King [[Tutankhamun]]. They also used less expensive green earth pigment, or mixed yellow ochre and blue [[azurite]]. To dye fabrics green, they first colored them yellow with dye made from [[saffron]] and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the [[woad]] plant.&lt;ref name="Anne Vachiron 2000 pg. 196" /&gt;

For the ancient Egyptians, green had very positive associations. The [[hieroglyph]] for green represented a growing [[papyrus]] sprout, showing the close connection between green, vegetation, vigor and growth. In wall paintings, the ruler of the underworld, [[Osiris]], was typically portrayed with a green face, because green was the symbol of good health and rebirth. Palettes of green facial makeup, made with malachite, were found in tombs. It was worn by both the living and the dead, particularly around the eyes, to protect them from evil. Tombs also often contained small green amulets in the shape of [[scarab beetles]] made of malachite, which would protect and give vigor to the deceased. It also symbolized the sea, which was called the "Very Green."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Vachiron (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient Greece, green and blue were sometimes considered the same color, and the same word sometimes described the color of the sea and the color of trees. The philosopher [[Democritus]] described two different greens: ''cloron'', or pale green, and ''prasinon'', or [[leek]] green. [[Aristotle]] considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.{{sfn|Gage|1993|p=12}}

The Romans had a greater appreciation for the color green; it was the color of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the goddess of gardens, vegetables and vineyards. The Romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]], [[Lyon]], [[Vaison-la-Romaine]], and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Vachiron (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.{{sfn|Gage|1993|pp=11–27}}

File:Pietro Perugino cat67a.jpg|In this 1503 painting by [[Perugino]], malachite pigment was used to paint the bright green garments of the worshippers, while the background greens were painted in green earth pigments.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the color of clothing showed a person's social rank and profession. Red could only be worn by the nobility, brown and gray by peasants, and green by merchants, bankers and the gentry and their families. The [[Mona Lisa]] wears green in her portrait, as does the bride in the Arnolfini portrait by [[Jan van Eyck]].

Unfortunately for those who wanted or were required to wear green, there were no good vegetal green dyes which resisted washing and sunlight. Green dyes were made out of the [[fern]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]], [[buckthorn]] berries, the juice of [[Urtica|nettles]] and of [[leeks]], the [[digitalis]] plant, the [[broom (shrub)|broom]] plant, the leaves of the [[fraxinus]], or ash tree, and the bark of the [[alder]] tree, but they rapidly faded or changed color. Only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced, by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad, and then yellow with ''[[Reseda luteola]]'', also known as yellow-weed.{{sfn|Varichon|2000|p=128}}

The pigments available to painters were more varied; monks in monasteries used verdigris, made by soaking copper in fermenting wine, to color medieval manuscripts. They also used finely-ground malachite, which made a luminous green. They used green earth colors for backgrounds.

During the early Renaissance, painters such as [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] learned to paint faces first with a green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.&lt;ref&gt;Pigments Through the Ages, http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/antiquity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
==== In the 18th and 19th century ====

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The 18th and 19th century brought the discovery and production of synthetic green pigments and dyes, which rapidly replaced the earlier mineral and vegetable pigments and dyes. These new dyes were more stable and brilliant than the vegetable dyes, but some contained high levels of [[arsenic]], and were eventually banned.

In the 18th and 19th century, green was associated with the [[romantic movement]] in literature and art. The French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] celebrated the virtues of nature, The German poet and philosopher [[Goethe]] declared that green was the most restful color, suitable for decorating bedrooms. Painters such as [[John Constable]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] depicted the lush green of rural landscapes and forests. Green was contrasted to the smoky grays and blacks of the Industrial Revolution.

The second half of the 19th century saw the use of green in art to create specific emotions, not just to imitate nature. One of the first to make color the central element of his picture was the American artist [[James McNeil Whistler]], who created a series of paintings called "symphonies" or "noctures" of color, including ''Symphony in gray and green; The Ocean'' between 1866 and 1872.

The late nineteenth century also brought the systematic study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as Vincent van Gogh. Describing his painting, The ''Night Cafe'', to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens."&lt;ref&gt;Vincent van Gogh, ''Corréspondénce general'', number 533, cited by John Gage, ''Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In the 20th and 21st century ====
In the 1980s green became a political symbol, the color of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party in Germany]] and in many other European countries. It symbolized the [[environmental movement]], and also a new politics of the left which rejected traditional socialism and communism. (See ''Politics'' section below.)

== Symbolism and associations ==
=== Safety and permission ===

[[File:Feuvert2.jpg|thumb|left|110px|A green light is the universal symbol of permission to go]]
[[File:John Deere, 9560R.jpg|thumb|left|An agriculture company chooses green and yellow for their products. Three wheels on each hub enables this tractor to work wetter land.]]

Green can communicate safety to proceed, as in traffic lights.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Green and red were standardized as the colors of international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 in front of the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both [[Health (gaming)|health]] and completed objectives, opposite red.

=== Nature, vivacity, and life ===
Green is the color most commonly associated in Europe and the U.S. with nature, vivacity and life.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp. 90. 47 percent of respondents surveyed associated green with ''nature'' and ''natural'', 18 percent choosing white. 32 percent associated green with ''vivacity'' (20 percent chose yellow), and 40 percent with  ''good health'' (20 percent with red)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the color of many environmental organizations, such as [[Greenpeace]], and of the [[Green Parties]] in Europe. Many cities have designated a garden or park as a green space, and use green trash bins and containers. A green cross is commonly used to designate pharmacies in Europe.

In China, green is associated with the east, with sunrise, and with life and growth.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Hong-Key. ''The Culture of Feng-Shui in Korea.'' Lexington: Lexington Books, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7391-1348-8}} p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, the color green is considered [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] for those born on a Wednesday day (light green for those born at night).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Springtime, freshness, and hope ===
Green is the color most commonly associated in the U.S. and Europe with springtime, freshness, and hope.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=91–92}}{{efn|1= 62 percent of respondents surveyed associated green with ''springtime'', (18 percent choosing yellow); 27 percent associated green with ''freshness'' (24 percent choosing blue.)   48 percent associated green with ''hope'' (18 percent choosing blue){{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=91–92}} }} Green is often used to symbolize rebirth and renewal and immortality. In Ancient Egypt; the god Osiris, king of the underworld, was depicted as green-skinned.&lt;ref name="deVries76"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Vries |first=Ad |title=Dictionary of Symbols and Imagery |year=1976 |pages=226–28|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-7204-8021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green as the color of hope is connected with the color of springtime; hope represents the faith that things will improve after a period of difficulty, like the renewal of flowers and plants after the winter season.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=94}}

=== Youth and inexperience ===
Green the color most commonly associated in Europe and the U.S. with youth. It also often is used to describe anyone young, inexperienced, probably by the analogy to immature and unripe fruit.&lt;ref name = diction&gt;{{cite web| title =Results for "green"| website =Dictionary.com| publisher =Lexico Publishing Corp.| year =2007| url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/green| accessdate = November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=92}}{{efn|1= 22 percent of respondents surveyed associated green with ''youth'', (16 percent choosing yellow){{sfn|Heller|2009|p=92}} }} Examples include [[green cheese]], a term for a fresh, unaged cheese, and [[Cowboy#Symbolism|greenhorn]], an inexperienced person.

=== Calm, tolerance, and the agreeable ===
Surveys also show that green is the color most associated with the calm, the agreeable, and tolerance. Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, is the color of neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Science Faculty building, UTS]].&lt;/ref&gt; Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=90}}

=== Jealousy and envy ===
Green is often associated with [[jealousy]] and [[envy]]. The expression "green-eyed monster" was first used by [[William Shakespeare]] in [[Othello]]: "it is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on." Shakespeare also used it in the [[Merchant of Venice]], speaking of "green-eyed jealousy."&lt;ref name=hendrickson&gt;{{cite book | last = Hendrickson | first = Robert  | title = Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins | publisher =Facts on File Inc. | year = 1999 | location = | page = 6 | isbn = 978-0-8160-3266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Love and sexuality ===
Green today is not commonly associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality,{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=42, 55}} but in stories of the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] it sometimes represented love&lt;ref name = span&gt;Chamberlin, Vernon A.

''[[College English]].'' 20.2 (Nov 1958) pp. 61–65 {{DOI|10.2307/372161}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the color of the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]] who caused the downfall of [[Adam and Eve]]. However, for the [[troubadours]], green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=92–93}}

In Persian and Sudanese poetry, dark-skinned women, called "green" women, were considered erotic.&lt;ref name="Greenness in the Field" /&gt; The Chinese term for [[cuckold]] is "to wear a green hat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Sommer| first = Matthew Harvey| title = Sex, Law, and Society in Late Imperial China| publisher = Stanford University Press| year = 2002| location = Stanford| page = 218| url = https://books.google.com/?id=E6ClbegXuWUC| isbn = 978-0-8047-4559-8| accessdate = July 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because in ancient China, prostitutes were called "the family of the green lantern" and a [[prostitute|prostitute's]] family would wear a green headscarf.{{sfn|Varichon|2000|p=205}}

In [[Victorian England]], the color green was associated with [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pflagdetroit.org/story_of_the_rainbow_flag.htm | title=The Story of the Rainbow Flag | website=HALO Newsletter | accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dragons, fairies, monsters, and devils ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In legends, folk tales and films, [[fairies]], [[dragons]], [[monsters]], and the devil are often shown as green.

In the Middle Ages, the devil was usually shown as either red, black or green. Dragons were usually green, because they had the heads, claws and tails of reptiles.

Modern [[Chinese dragons]] are also often green, but unlike European dragons, they are benevolent; Chinese dragons traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, hurricane, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck. The Emperor of China usually used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial power and strength. The [[dragon dance]] is a popular feature of Chinese festivals.

In [[Irish folklore]] and [[English folklore]], the color was sometimes was associated with witchcraft, and with [[faeries]] and spirits.&lt;ref name=evil&gt;Williams, Margaret. The Pearl Poet, His Complete Works. Random House, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of Irish fairy known as a [[leprechaun]] is commonly portrayed wearing a green suit, though before the 20th century he was usually described as wearing a red suit.

In theater and film, green was often connected with monsters and the inhuman. The earliest films of Frankenstein were in black and white, but in the poster for the 1935 version ''[[The Bride of Frankenstein]]'', the monster had a green face. Actor [[Bela Lugosi]] wore green-hued makeup for the role of [[Dracula]] in the 1927–1928 Broadway stage production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Skal | first= David J. |year = 1990| title = Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of Dracula from Novel to Stage to Screen| page = 85 | publisher = Andre Deutch| isbn= 978-0-233-98766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Why The Devil Wears Green'', D.

=== Poison and sickness ===
Like other common colors, green has several completely opposite associations. While it is the color most associated by Europeans and Americans with good health, it is also the color most often associated with [[toxicity]] and poison. There was a solid foundation for this association; in the nineteenth century several popular paints and pigments, notably verdigris, vert de Schweinfurt and vert de Paris, were highly toxic, containing copper or arsenic.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=96}}{{efn|1=In a survey cited, 45 percent of respondents associated green with toxicity, while 20 percent associated yellow.{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=96}} }} The intoxicating drink [[absinthe]] was known as "the green fairy".

A green tinge in the skin is sometimes associated with nausea and sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Mark. Self Improvement of Relationship Skills through Body Language. City: Llumina Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-932303-79-0}} p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The expression 'green at the gills' means appearing sick. The color, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, John S. "Gawain and the Green Knight." ''College English.'' 21.1 (Oct 1959) pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; In some Far East cultures the color green is used as a symbol of sickness or nausea.&lt;ref&gt;Kalb, Ira.

=== Social status, prosperity and the dollar ===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200px"&gt;

File:United States one dollar bill, reverse.jpg|The reverse of the [[United States one-dollar bill]] has been green since 1861, giving it the popular name greenback.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Green in Europe and the United States is sometimes associated with status and prosperity. From the Middle Ages to the 19th century it was often worn by bankers, merchants country gentlemen and others who were wealthy but not members of the nobility. The benches in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], where the landed gentry sat, are colored green.

In the United States green was connected with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle the pictures on the front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.&lt;ref&gt;"Currency Notes" on the website of the U.S. [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more notable uses of this meaning is found in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. The [[Emerald City]] in this story is a place where everyone wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, [[L. Frank Baum]], to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Bruce G.; Sarah Babb. "The Color of Money and the Nature of Value: Greenbacks and Gold in Postbellum America." ''The American Journal of Sociology.'' (May 1996) 101.6 pp. 1556–91&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded green party was a political faction in [[Constantinople]] during the 6th century [[Byzantine Empire]]. which took its name from a popular [[chariot racing]] team. They were bitter opponents of the blue faction, which supported Emperor [[Justinian I]] and which had its own chariot racing team. In 532 AD rioting between the factions began after one race, which led to the massacre of green supporters and the destruction of much of the center of Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Edward Gibbon 1960, pg. 553-559"&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Abridgement of D.M. Low, Harcourt Brace and Company, 1960, pp. 553–59&lt;/ref&gt;  (See [[Nika Riots]]).

Green was the traditional color of [[Irish nationalism]], beginning in the 17th century. The green harp flag, with a traditional [[gaelic harp]], became the symbol of the movement. It was the banner of the [[Society of United Irishmen]], which organized the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], calling for Irish independence. The uprising was suppressed with great bloodshed by the British army. When Ireland achieved independence in 1922, green was incorporated into the national flag.

In the 1970s green became the color of the third biggest Swiss Federal Council political party, the [[Swiss People's Party]] SVP. The ideology is Swiss nationalism, national conservatism, right-wing populism, economic liberalism, agrarianism, isolationism, euroscepticism. The SVP was founded on September 22, 1971 and has 90,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCIdX54gWym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809190734/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t%2Clnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCIdX54gWym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A-- |date=August 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s green became the color of a number of new European political parties organized around an agenda of [[environmentalism]]. Green was chosen for its association with nature, health, and growth. The largest green party in Europe is Alliance '90/The Greens (German: Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) in Germany, which was formed in 1993 from the merger of the German Green Party, founded in West Germany in 1980, and Alliance 90, founded during the Revolution of 1989–1990 in East Germany. In the 2009 federal elections, the party won 11% of the votes and 68 out of 622 seats in the [[Bundestag]].

Green parties in Europe have programs based on [[ecology movement|ecology]], [[grassroots democracy]], [[nonviolence]], and [[social justice]]. Green parties are found in over one hundred countries, and most are members of the [[Global Greens|Global Green Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Global Greens Charter| publisher =Global Greens Conference| year =2001| url =http://www.global.greens.org.au/charter.htm| accessdate =November 22, 2007| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071012081813/http://www.global.greens.org.au/charter.htm| archivedate =October 12, 2007| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenpeace]] is a non-governmental environmental organization which emerged from the anti-nuclear and peace movements in the 1970s. Its ship, the [[Rainbow Warrior (2011)|Rainbow Warrior]], frequently tried to interfere with nuclear tests and whaling operations. The movement now has branches in forty countries.

The Australian Greens party was founded in 1992. In the 2010 federal election, the party received 13% of the vote (more than 1.6 million votes) in the Senate, a first for any Australian minor party.

== Controversy ==
The Akademi is an autonomous body empowered by its constitution to elect its chairman through a [[Electoral system|voting process]] by the 41 members of the general body.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bharat Mehta returns state Akademi award | website=The Indian Express | date=2015-11-04 | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/bharat-mehta-returns-state-akademi-award/ | access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akademi did not have a chairman from 2003 to 2015 as the government did not held an election.&lt;ref name=AGSI/&gt; It was run by the registrar in-charge and the secretary of the sports, youth and cultural activities department; ex-offcio. In April 2015, the state government appointed Bhagyesh Jha, a Gujarati writer and retired [[Indian Administrative Services|IAS]] officer, as the new chairman of the Akademi without any election.&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes2017"/&gt; This resulted in the Autonomous Academy Agitation (''Swayatta Akademi Andolan'') led by [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]], the oldest literary institute in Gujarat and several Gujarati writers including Manishi Jani, [[Shirish Panchal]], [[Dhiru Parikh]], [[Chandrakant Topiwala]], Bharat Mehta, Paresh Naik and Raju Solanki.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title=Writers demand autonomy for Sahitya Academy | website=The Indian Express | date=2011-06-06 | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/writers-demand-autonomy-for-sahitya-academy/ | access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parishad boycotted the activities of the Akademi in protest. In March 2016, the Gujarati poet [[Harsh Brahmbhatt]] declined the award which had been conferred to him by the Akademi for his book.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Writer declines award from ‘non-autonomous’ Academy | website=The Indian Express | date=2016-03-29 | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/writer-declines-award-from-non-autonomous-academy/ | access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Bhagyesh Jha and two other writers [[Chinu Modi]] and [[Vinod Bhatt]], said to be the supporter of Jha, used the word ''[[Taliban]]'' for the writers like [[Dhiru Parikh]] and [[Niranjan Bhagat]], who had supported the agitation. [[Pravin Pandya]] returned the award he had received in 2004 in protest.&lt;ref name="The Times of India 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Writer returns award to Gujarat Sahitya Parishad | website=The Times of India | date=2016-01-15 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Writer-returns-award-to-Gujarat-Sahitya-Parishad/articleshow/49613917.cms | access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Gujarati writer and literary critic, Bharat Mehta, returned the award which he had received in 2008.&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2015"/&gt; Dhiru Parikh, along with other writers, submitted a [[public interest litigation]] to the [[Gujarat High Court]].&lt;ref name="The Indian Express 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Times of India 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes2017"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4616">'''(Elsie) Helen Knight''' (née Weil, 24 November 1899 – 1984) was a British [[philosopher]]. She was one of few women active in the early days of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zeglin Brand|first=Peggy|title=Feminism and Tradition in Aesthetics|year=2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271043968|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Helen Knight, Moral Science Club, 1953.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Knight, 1936]]

==Life and education==
Knight was born in Swiss Cottage, London and attended Fremarch School, Hampstead. She began her BA at [[Bedford College, London]], before coming to [[Cambridge University]] in 1921 where she took Part II Moral Sciences in 1923 and obtained a first class degree. From 1923 to 1925 she was a Research Student at [[Newnham College]]. She married psychologist [[Arthur Rex Knight|Rex Knight]] on 30 January 1926 (they divorced in 1936), and then appears to have taken a break from academic philosophy until 1932 when she returned to Newnham as Sarah Smithson Research Fellow. She obtained her PhD in 1935.  
During the war she was Principal at the [[Board of Trade]], a position that had been temporarily filled by fellow philosopher [[Margaret MacDonald (philosopher)|Margaret MacDonald]]. She also taught English at an independent girls boarding school, [[North Foreland Lodge]] in Kent from 1942 to 1949.&lt;ref&gt;''Newnham College Roll Card''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Knight was one of a select group to whom [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] dictated his [[Blue and Brown Books]] in the 1930s, which outline the transition in Wittgenstein's thought between his two major works, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' and ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klagge|first=James|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: Public and Private Occasions|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=0742512703|page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight became a member of the [[Aristotelian Society]] in 1922, acting in its Executive Committee for several terms. Between 1935 and 1941 she was a researcher in Aesthetics at Cambridge. During this time she published occasional papers on aesthetics for different philosophical journals (''Mind'', ''Philosophy'' and others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waithe|first=Ellen|title=A History of Women Philosophers Vol. 4|year=1995|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 she addressed the [[Aristotelian Society]] talking about the Women’s Graduate Club in Cambridge. “Judging by the calibre of co-presenters, discussants and commentators of her papers, her work was admired and taken seriously.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waithe|first=Ellen|title=A History of Women Philosophers Vol. 4|year=1995|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Knight emigrated to Australia where she was a tutor in English Literature at Janet Clarke Hall, [[University of Melbourne]] until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oppy|first=Graham|title=The Antipodean Philosopher|year=2011|publisher=Lexington|isbn=9780739127339|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in Melbourne, Australia aged 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Births, Deaths and Marriages|url=https://online.justice.vic.gov.au/bdm/indexsearch.doj|website=Family History Search|publisher=State Government of Victoria|accessdate=23 November 2015|ref=6427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Although she published scantly, her work was well received and continues to be included in modern anthologies of aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beardsley|first=Monroe|title=Aesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism|year=1981|publisher=Hackett|isbn=0915145081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HildegardeSixDaysCreation.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Representation of the six days of creation.]]

The term '''Hexameron''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Ἡ Ἑξαήμερος Δημιουργία ''Hē Hexaēmeros Dēmiourgia'') refers either to the genre of theological treatise that describes God's work on the six days of [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] or to the six days of creation themselves. Most often these theological works take the form of commentaries on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis I]]. As a genre, hexameral literature was popular in the early church and medieval periods. The word derives its name from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] roots ''[[hexa-]]'', meaning "six", and ''hemer-'', meaning "day".

Using the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] account as a template, the days of creation are claimed as follows:
# Light
# The firmament of [[Heaven]]
# Separation of water and land, created plant life;
# Sun, moon, and stars
# Marine life and birds
# Land animals, and man and woman.
# The seventh day is reserved for rest ([[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]]), and so is not counted.

Based on this framework, Christian and Jewish authors have written treatises that cover a wide variety of topics, including cosmology, science, theology, theological anthropology, and God's nature.

[[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]] wrote an early and influential series of homilies around 370 AD which figure as the earliest extant Hexameron. Basil originally performed the work as a series of [[sermons]], and later collected them into a written work which was influential among early church leaders.

Among the [[Latin Fathers#Latin Fathers|Latin Fathers]], Ambrose and Augustine wrote some of the earliest extant hexameral literature.  Ambrose's Hexameron is heavily influenced by Basil's work of the same name. In contrast, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote several works that serve as commentaries on the Genesis narrative, including the final section of ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|The Confessions]]'' and ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (published in 416).&lt;ref&gt;St. Augustine on Genesis, translated with notes by Edmund Hill, O. P., New City Press, 2002.  Technically, Augustine wrote three commentaries on Genesis: ''On Genesis: A Refutation of the Manichees'' (c.388/389); ''An Unfinished Literal Commentary on Genesis'' (393-395); and ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (begun c. 400, published 416).  See Hill, pp. 13-15, 165 for more information on the dating of and relationship between these books.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more influential elements of Augustine's writings is his argument that God created the world all at once. At the same time, this instantaneous creation included a progression of events. Thus, creation happened over six days and in one single event.

Following these figures, medieval writers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Robert Grosseteste]]  wrote hexameral literature.

==Hexameral literature==
'''Hexameral literature''' is the medieval Christian literature based on the [[Genesis creation myth|creation narratives]] found in the first two chapters of the ''[[Book of Genesis]]''. It was commentary or elaboration, sometimes taking on encyclopedic scope, regarding the [[cosmological]] and [[theological]] implications of the world or universe created in six days.

It was [[didactic]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Kendrick, ''Milton: A Study in Ideology and Form'' (1986), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach continued in an important literary role until the seventeenth century.

===Terminology===
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' recognizes a difference between ‘hexaemeric’, pertaining to a ‘hexaemeron’ or six-day creation (or commentary thereon); and ‘hexameral’, meaning simply in six parts. This distinction is often slurred.

Not every ‘Hexameron’ or ‘Hexaemeron’ is actually part of the genre, since Genesis commentaries can have various themes. Hexameral historical theories, of six or seven eras, date back at least to the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' of [[Augustine of Hippo]].

===History===
This literary genre was founded by the ''Hexaemeron'' of [[Basil of Caesarea]]; though it has been said that [[Philo]] started it.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence J. Glacken, ''Traces on the Rhodian Shore'' (1967), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include:

*[[Ambrose]], ''Hexaemeron'', in Latin and the most influential&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Augustine of Hippo, ''De Genesi ad litteram'', 401-415,&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Works of St. Augustine  of Hippo}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by [[Plato]] and Greek biology&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Venerable Bede, In Genesim. 
*[[Anastasius Sinaita]], ''Hexaemeron''
*[[Henry of Langenstein]] (1385), ''Lecturae super Genesim''&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas H. Steneck (1976), ''Science and creation in the Middle Ages. Henry of Langenstein (d. 1397) on Genesis''&lt;/ref&gt;

It extended into [[early modern]] times with the ''Sepmaines'' of [[Du Bartas]], and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' by [[John Milton]]. According to [[Alban Forcione]]&lt;ref&gt;''Cervantes’ Night-Errantry: The Deliverance of the Imaginatio''n, in Jeremy Robbins, Edwin Williamson, E. C. Riley (editors), ''Cervantes: Essays in Memory of E. C. Riley'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century saw ‘hexameral theatre’, and in particular the visionary holism represented by the ''De la creación del mundo'' (1615) of [[Alonso de Acevedo]]. There is a cusp between Du Bartas, very influential in his time, and Milton: Milton's different approach marks the effective literary end of the genre.

[[Image:John Day00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;'''''[[Anguloa]] clowesii''''' Lindley 1844&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''John Day''' (1824–1888) was an English orchid-grower and collector, and is noted for producing some 4000 illustrations of orchid species in 53 scrapbooks over a period of 15 years. These scrapbooks were donated to [[Kew Gardens|The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] in 1902 by his sister, Emma Wolstenholme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/exhibitions/johnday/learn/johnday.html Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: Exhibitions: John Day Scrapbooks:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901024533/http://www.kew.org/exhibitions/johnday/learn/johnday.html |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day was born in the [[City of London]] in 1824, the son of a wealthy wine merchant. He bought his first collection of orchids in 1852 at an auction of the stock of [[Loddiges]] nursery upon its closure. At an average price of £1 each, he acquired 50 tropical orchids, not the more common Cymbidiums, but Dendrobiums from India, Odontoglossums from tropical America, Lycastes, and Cattleyas, which he grew under ideal conditions in an orchid house built with an exemplary heating system, in the grounds of his home at High Cross, Tottenham.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20110629050238/http://ftp.rbgkew.org.uk/exhibitions/johnday/learn/johnday.html Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: Exhibitions: John Day Scrapbooks:]&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1863 and 1888 at the height of [[Orchidelirium|orchid mania]] in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, John Day painted and sketched orchids from his own collection in [[Tottenham]], London nurseries, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and visited the tropics to see orchid habitat at first hand. A large number of his illustrations depict plants he had coaxed into flower and are the first-known images of species. He maintained close links with [[Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach]], the orchid taxonomist at the [[University of Hamburg]].

In 2004 [[Thames and Hudson]] published a collection of John Day's artwork in ''A Very Victorian Passion: The Orchid Paintings of John Day'' by Phillip Cribb and Michael Tibbs, two leading authorities on [[Orchidaceae]], who provide a detailed review of the history, background, and botany of the orchids depicted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24891">The '''[[Cheap Repository Tracts]]''' were a series of moral, religious and political pamphlets first published between 1795 and 1817. Only British first editions are listed except where a new edition contains an amended text or a new title (in which case the amended titles are given a new entry). 

The entries are grouped according to the series in which they were first issued, and then in the order given by Spinney (1939) or Stoker (2017). The numbers in the first column are those allocated by Spinney (1-187) and running numbers thereafter. They do not necessarily reflect the order in which they were published.

'''''Maine Coast''''' is an 1896 painting by American artist [[Winslow Homer]]. It is part of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11126 |title=Winslow Homer &amp;#124; Maine Coast &amp;#124; The Met |website=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is a seaward view from the cliffs at [[Prouts Neck]], Scarborough, Maine on a stormy day. A powerful wave is about to crash onto the black rocks below in a mass of white foam.

The work is on view in the Metropolitan Museum's Gallery 767.

'''''Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming''''' is a 2010 non-fiction book by American [[History of science|historians of science]] [[Naomi Oreskes]] and [[Erik M. Conway]]. It identifies parallels between the [[global warming controversy]] and earlier controversies over [[tobacco smoking]], [[acid rain]], [[DDT]], and the [[ozone depletion|hole in the ozone layer]]. Oreskes and Conway write that in each case "keeping the controversy alive" by spreading doubt and confusion after a scientific consensus had been reached, was the basic strategy of those opposing action.&lt;ref name = stek&gt;{{cite news |author=Steketee, Mike |title=Some sceptics make it a habit to be wrong |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/some-sceptics-make-it-a-habit-to-be-wrong/story-fn59niix-1225956414538 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=November 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they say that [[Fred Seitz]], [[Fred Singer]], and a few other [[contrarian]] scientists joined forces with conservative [[think tank]]s and private corporations to challenge the scientific consensus on many contemporary issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Naomi |last1=Oreskes |first2=Erik M. |last2=Conway |title=Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpMh3nh3JI0C&amp;pg=PP4 |year=2010 |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |isbn=978-1-59691-610-4 |page=6 |ref=harv}} [http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/index.html merchantsofdoubt.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George C. Marshall Institute]] and Fred Singer, two of the subjects, have been critical of the book. Other reviewers have been more favorable. One reviewer said that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is exhaustively researched and documented, and may be one of the most important books of 2010. Another reviewer saw the book as his choice for best [[science book]] of the year.&lt;ref name=Mckie8/&gt; It was made into a film, ''[[Merchants of Doubt (film)|Merchants of Doubt]]'', directed by [[Robert Kenner]], released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sonyclassics.com/merchantsofdoubt/ | title=Merchants of Doubt | publisher=Sony Pictures Classics | accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:S Fred Singer 2011.jpg |thumb|right |[[Fred Singer]] (2011), a prominent opponent of greenhouse gas regulation.]]
Oreskes  and Conway write that a handful of [[Conservatism in the United States|politically conservative]] scientists, with strong ties to particular industries, have "played a disproportionate role in debates about controversial questions".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; The authors write that this has resulted in "deliberate obfuscation" of the issues which has had an influence on [[Public opinion on climate change|public opinion]] and [[Climate change policy of the United States|policy-making]].&lt;ref name=pk&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kitcher, Philip |authorlink=Philip Kitcher |title=The Climate Change Debates |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=328 |issue=5983 |pages=1231–2 |date=June 4, 2010 |doi=10.1126/science.1189312 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/328/5983/1230-a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book criticizes the so-called Merchants of Doubt, some predominantly American science key players, above all [[William Nierenberg|Bill Nierenberg]], [[Fred Seitz]], and [[Fred Singer]]. All three are physicists: Singer was a [[rocket scientist]], whereas Nierenberg and Seitz worked on the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name=sb&gt;{{cite news |author=Brown, Seth |title='Merchants of Doubt' delves into contrarian scientists |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/books/reviews/2010-06-01-deathmerchants01_ST_N.htm |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=May 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been active on topics like acid rain, tobacco smoking, global warming and pesticides. The book claims that these scientists have challenged and diluted the [[scientific consensus]] in the various fields, as of the [[dangers of smoking]], the effects of acid rain, the existence of the ozone hole, and the existence of [[anthropogenic climate change]].&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; Seitz and Singer have been involved with institutions such as [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] and [[George C. Marshall Institute]] in the United States. Funded by [[corporation]]s and conservative [[Foundation (United States law)|foundations]], these organizations have opposed many forms of [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]] or regulation of U.S. citizens. The book lists similar tactics in each case: "discredit the science, disseminate false information, spread confusion, and promote doubt".&lt;ref name=rm/&gt;

The book states that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and [[Robert Jastrow]] were all fiercely [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and they viewed government regulation as a step towards [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. The authors argue that, with the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives.&lt;ref name=ocmerch/&gt; Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more likely it is that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and [[market fundamentalism|market fundamentalists]] most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence, contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded.&lt;ref name=ocmerch&gt;{{harvnb|Oreskes|Conway|2010|pp=248–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science.&lt;ref name ="RG" /&gt; The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: "small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power".&lt;ref name=rm&gt;{{cite news |author=McKie, Robin |title=A dark ideology is driving those who deny climate change |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/01/climate-change-robin-mckie |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main conclusion of the book is that there would have been more progress in policymaking, if not for the influence of the contrarian "experts", which tried on ideological reasons to undermine trust in the science base for regulation.&lt;ref name="RG"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grundmann|first1=Reiner|title=Debunking sceptical propaganda|journal=BioSocieties|date=29 August 2013|volume=8|issue=3|pages=370–374|doi=10.1057/biosoc.2013.15|url=https://www.academia.edu/4754580/Debunking_skeptical_propaganda_Book_review_of_Oreskes_Conway_Merchants_of_Doubt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar conclusions were already drawn, among others on [[Frederick Seitz]] and [[William Nierenberg]] in the book ''[[Requiem for a Species|Requiem for a Species: Why We Resist the Truth about Climate Change]]'' (2010) by Australian academic [[Clive Hamilton]].

==Reception==

[[Philip Kitcher]] in ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' says that Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway are "two outstanding historians".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; He calls ''Merchants of Doubt'' a "fascinating and important study". Kitcher says that the apparently harsh claims against Nierenberg, Seitz, and Singer are "justified through a powerful dissection of the ways in which prominent climate scientists, such as [[Roger Revelle]] and [[Ben Santer]], were exploited or viciously attacked in the press".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt;

In ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', Will Buchanan says that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is exhaustively researched and documented, and may be one of the most important books of 2010. Oreskes and Conway are seen to demonstrate that the doubt merchants are not "objective scientists" as the term is popularly understood. Instead, they are "science-speaking mercenaries" hired by corporations to process numbers to prove that the corporations’ products are safe and useful. Buchanan says they are salesmen, not scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Will (June 22, 2010). [http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2010/0622/Merchants-of-Doubt Merchants of Doubt: How “scientific” misinformation campaigns sold untruths to consumers] ''The Christian Science Monitor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bud Ward published a review of the book in ''The Yale Forum on Climate and the Media''. He wrote that Oreskes and Conway use a combination of thorough scholarly research combined with writing reminiscent of the best investigative journalism, to "unravel deep common links to past environmental and public health controversies".&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, Bud (July 8, 2010). [http://www.yaleclimatemediaforum.org/2010/07/merchants-of-doubt/ Reviews: Leaving No Doubt on Tobacco, Acid Rain, Climate Change], ''The Yale Forum on Climate and the Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of climate science, the authors' leave "little doubt about their disdain for what they regard as the misuse and abuse of science by a small cabal of scientists they see as largely lacking in requisite climate science expertise".&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt;

Phil England writes in ''[[The Ecologist]]'' that the strength of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: [[Jim Hoggan]]’s ''Climate Cover-Up'', [[George Monbiot]]’s ''Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning'' and [[Ross Gelbspan]]’s ''The Heat is On'' and ''Boiling Point''. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which [[Exxon Mobil]] has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting [[climate change denial]] and doubt.&lt;ref&gt;England, Phil (September 10, 2010). [http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/592288/merchants_of_doubt.html Merchants of Doubt] ''[[The Ecologist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in ''[[The Economist]]'' calls this a powerful book which articulates the politics involved and the degree to which scientists have sometimes manufactured and exaggerated environmental uncertainties, but opines that the authors fail to fully explain how environmental action has still often proved possible despite countervailing factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16374460 All guns blazing: A question of dodgy science], (June 17, 2010), ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert N. Proctor]], who coined the term "[[agnotology]]" to describe the study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt, wrote in ''[[American Scientist]]'' that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is a detailed and artfully written book. He set it in the context of other books which cover the "history of manufactured ignorance":&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;Proctor, Robert (September–October 2010). [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/manufactured-ignorance Book Review: Manufactured Ignorance], ''[[American Scientist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Michaels (epidemiologist)|David Michaels]]’s ''[[Doubt is their Product]]'' (2008), [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]]’s ''[[The Republican War on Science]]'' (2009), [[David Rosner]] and Gerald Markowitz’s ''[[Deceit and Denial]]'' (2002), and his own book ''[[Cancer Wars]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="Proctor" /&gt;

Robin McKie in ''[[The Guardian]]'' states that Oreskes and Conway deserve considerable praise for exposing the influence of a small group of [[Cold War]] ideologues. Their tactic of spreading doubt has confused the public about a series of key scientific issues such as global warming, even though scientists have actually become more certain about their research results. McKie says that ''Merchants of Doubt'' includes detailed notes on all sources used, is carefully paced, and is "my runaway contender for best science book of the year".&lt;ref name=Mckie8&gt;McKie, Robin (August 8, 2010). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/08/merchants-of-doubt-oreskes-conway "Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M Conway".] ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]]'s review in ''[[BioSocieties]]'' journal, acknowledges that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in a black and white manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of [[knowledge policy]], because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides ''all the (formal) hallmarks of science'', Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.&lt;ref name="RG" /&gt;

William O’Keefe and Jeff Kueter from the [[George C. Marshall Institute]], which was founded by Seitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Begley|first1=Sharon|title=Global Warming Deniers: A Well-Funded Machine|url=http://www.newsweek.com/global-warming-deniers-well-funded-machine-99295|website=Newsweek|date=4 August 2007|quote=...a central cog in the denial machine: the George C. Marshall Institute, a conservative think tank.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  say that although ''Merchants of Doubt'' has the appearance of a scholarly work, it discredits and undermines the reputations of people who in their lifetime contributed greatly to the American nation. They say that it does this by questioning their integrity, impugning their character, and questioning their judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=O’Keefe | first= William |last2= Kueter| first2=Jeff | date=June 2010 | url=http://marshall.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/OKeefe-and-Kueter-Clouding-the-Truth-A-Critique-of-Merchants-of-Doubt.pdf |title=Clouding the Truth: A Critique of Merchants of Doubt |publisher=[[George C.

The '''Multiverse''', within [[DC Comics]] publications, is a "cosmic construct" collecting many of the fictional universes in which the published stories take place. The worlds in this multiverse share a space and fate in common, and its structure has changed several times in the history of DC Comics.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Alternate Earths | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages=20–21 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[London]] | date=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Golden Age ===
The concept of a universe and a multiverse in which the fictional stories take place was loosely established during the Golden Age. With the publication of ''[[All-Star Comics]]'' #3 in 1940, the first crossover between characters occurred with the creation of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA), which presented the first superhero team with characters appearing in other publications (comic strips and anthology titles) to bring attention to less-known characters. This established the first shared "universe", as all these heroes now lived in the same world. Prior to this publication, characters from the different comic books seemingly existed in different worlds.

Later, ''Wonder Woman'' #59 (May 1953) presented DC Comics's first story depicting a parallel "mirror" world. [[Wonder Woman]] is transported to a twin Earth where she meets Tara Terruna who is exactly like her. Tara Terruna means "Wonder Woman" in the native language of that world. Wonder Woman describes this world as being a twin world existing alongside Earth with duplicates of everyone but with a different development. The concept of different versions of the world and its heroes was revisited in the pages of ''Wonder Woman'' a few times later.

=== Silver Age ===
Led by editor Julius Schwartz and writer Gardner Fox, DC Comics's super heroes were given a "reboot" with the publication of ''Showcase'' #4 in 1956, where a new version of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] made his first appearance. The success of this new Flash led the creation of new incarnations of the Golden Age characters who only shared the names and powers but had different secret identities, origins and stories. Later, new versions of other heroes, [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and Wonder Woman, were also restarted by retelling their origins but keeping their secret identities.
Gardner Fox, who worked before in the creation of the JSA, where other heroes met for the first time, created the story "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]" in ''The Flash'' #123, where Barry Allen, the new Flash, is transported to the Earth where the original Flash, Jay Garrick, existed. To Allen, Jay Garrick's world was a work of fiction as it was in the real world. This story not only presented the encounter of two worlds and the existence of the Multiverse for the first time, it also presented key features of the Multiverse: all the universes vibrate at a specific frequency which keeps them separated; these "barriers" could be trespassed by "tuning" to that vibration. Because people could also "tune-in" these worlds in dreams, some people wrote comic books with the stories from those worlds they dreamed, which explained why Barry Allen knew about Jay Garrick as a fictional character.

The success of this story led to the first team crossover between the new [[Justice League of America]] (JLA) and the Golden Age JSA, in the stories '''"Crisis on Earth-One"''' (''Justice League of America'' #21) and '''"Crisis on Earth-Two"''' (''Justice League of America'' #22). This story arc started the tradition of a yearly crossover between the JLA and the JSA, and established firmly the concept of a Multiverse and the designation of names, Earth-One being the JLA reality and Earth-Two the JSA reality. The success of these crossovers spawned publications telling the further stories of the Golden Age heroes in the present day parting from many of the stories told, thus, establishing a more defined continuity for every Universe.

This concept of parallel Earths with differences in locations, persons and historical events became a very important ingredient within DC Comics' publications. It helped (among other things) to explain continuity errors, to retell and [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] stories, and to incorporate foreign elements that could actively interact with everything else and allow them to have an "existence". Continuity flaws between the established Earth-Two and several stories from the Golden Age were given separate Earths. "Imaginary" stories and some time divergences of Earth-One were given also separate realities (such as Earth-B and Earth-A). In addition to the stories appearing mainly in the pages of ''JLA'' that created new Earths, the acquisition of other comic book companies and characters by DC Comics incorporated these new properties as Earths in the Multiverse which would interact several times with the "main" Earths, One and Two; two of the most notable being Earth-S for the [[Fawcett Comics]] characters, and Earth-X for the Quality Comics characters. By the 1970s, everything that was published or related officially to DC Comics' titles could become part of the Multiverse, although much of it remained largely uncatalogued.

The names of the worlds were usually in the format ''Earth, hyphen, spelled numeral/letter/name''. In the case of worlds with numerals, the "rule" of spelling the number was not always followed, even within the pages of the same issue.

=== ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
As the 50th anniversary of DC Comics drew near, major events were proposed for the celebration: an encyclopedia (''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'') and a crossover of the ages, characters, and worlds appearing in DC's comics. As told in the letter section of ''[[Crisis On Infinite Earths]]'' #1, as the research started in the late 1970s, it became evident that there were many flaws in continuity. The way used to circumvent some of these errors was the "Multiple Earths", which also showed a chaotic nature that brought even more continuity problems that were not easily explained or were simply left unexplained. Examples of this included: 1) Black Canary of Earth-One being the daughter of the original Black Canary of WWII even though the original Black Canary was a resident of Earth-Two, and 2) the existence of Golden Age comic books on Earth-One and the people not noticing that some of the characters in those comic books existed in "real-life". In addition, many universes had multiple alternate timelines, such as Kamandi and the Legion of Super-Heroes, both being from Earth-One.

Writer [[Marv Wolfman]] took this crossover event as an opportunity to reform all the fictional universe of DC Comics to avoid further continuity errors and update the DC characters to modern times. The whole Multiverse is destroyed except for five Earths (Silver Age Earth-One, Golden Age Earth-Two, Charlton Comics' Earth-Four, Fawcett Comics' Earth-S and Quality Comics' Freedom Fighters' Earth-X). Later, the universe is recreated as one single universe from those five.

The ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' (2015) crossover event officially retconned the events of ''Crisis'' after heroes in that series went back in time to prevent the collapse of the Multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/24643-major-spoilers-dc-s-convergence-concludes-undoes-crisis.html|title=MAJOR SPOILERS: DC's CONVERGENCE Concludes, Undoes [Redacted]|author=|date=|website=newsarama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Age ===

==== DC Comics ====
After the conclusion of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the concept of a single Universe containing most elements of the "surviving Earths" was established and heavily enforced to avoid the continuity problems of the Multiverse. However, alternate realities that affected the new DC Universe appeared very quickly. In ''Superman'' Vol. 2 #8, a Universe inside the Universe was revealed to have been created to preserve the Legion of Super Heroes' 30th century in New Earth. This world was used to allow [[crossover (comics)|crossovers]] with certain characters of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and recreate characters that otherwise could not exist in the new continuity (such as [[Kryptonian]]s, as in the New Earth [[Superman]] was the only survivor of Krypton). Alternate timelines were also used, the most notable event being ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' in 1991. An [[Antimatter]] Universe existed as well, which had some "reversed" events in a similar way as the former Earth-Three. The Earth within this Universe was called "Earth 2". In addition, there was a Limbo, where some heroes and characters that could not be brought back to "existence" after the Crisis on Infinite Earths lived outside the Universe.

An important rule in the new DC Universe was that there could only be one timeline, so any change caused by time travelers caused the destruction of their timelines of origin. Changes in the past were often "fixed" or have to comply with the present to prevent continuity errors.

Nonetheless, continuity errors appeared. The retold origin of [[Hawkman]] presented errors regarding the existence of the Golden Age version ([[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]]) and the Silver Age version ([[Katar Hol]]) in the same continuity without a good explanation. The interaction of "possible timelines" also created continuity holes. This led to a new crisis to address the problem: the [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]. The resulting universe had a slightly re-written story with no continuity errors even though it was acknowledged that reality-shattering events did happen (including the Crisis on Infinite Earths). This Universe kept the concept of one universe, one timeline. Such timeline was "mapped" from beginning to present (1994) at the back cover of ''Zero Hour'' #0, that also included certain key dates in the future.

The need to publish stories outside the strict DC Universe continuity led to the creation of certain DC [[Imprint (trade name)|imprints]]. Stories that set DC characters in different situations after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, were published by DC Comics under the '''[[Elseworlds]]''' imprint. None of these stories were ever intended to be included in the "real" continuity of the DC Universe.

Certain characters were reinvented in a mature context and were published under the '''[[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]]''' imprint. Most of the times, the characters depicted within the Vertigo imprint had no relation to the original DC Universe's versions, nor did the events have influence over the new Universe.

Later, under a special publishing deal with [[Milestone Media]], DC Comics published a new series of comic books that told the stories of the heroes living in [[Dakota City (comics)|Dakota City]], formed mostly by African-American superheroes and other minorities. These characters lived in a universe separated from the DC Universe (known as the Dakotaverse or Milestone Universe). The event known as  ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'' presented one of the first modern intercompany crossovers within the established continuity of the Universes instead of being "imaginary" and showed that there could be other universes or even multiverses outside the new DC Universe.

In a similar way to ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'', the crossover event ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' showed another in-continuity crossover with another reality completely separated from the DC Universe and that has a Multiverse of its own: the universe of Earth-616 of the Marvel Multiverse.

The universes were rarely referred to with specific names within the stories but were named in the "Real World" (both officially and unofficially) using the name of the editorial, imprint or even an element in particular. While in the comic books the concept of a "real" Multiverse was avoided, the Multiverse played an important role in cartoon series and live-action shows (see [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Other versions|Other versions]]).

In summary, from 1986 to 1999, everything not happening in the "mainstream" continuity appearing in DC comics was either an "apocryphal" story or happened in a completely different and separate reality/universe/multiverse.

In 1999, the unexpected and overwhelming success of Elseworlds's ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' and other stories, led to the creation of the concept known as [[Hypertime]] in order to publish crossovers with those characters and the mainstream continuity. This structure gave "existence" to alternate timelines, stories in Elseworlds, appearances in other media and any other appearance of DC characters in the past. The main timeline or "Central Timeline" was like a river and all of the alternate stories were branches of it. Hypertime was similar to the former Multiverse as it allowed each and every reality ever published to co-exist and interact as most branches tend to return to the original stream (explaining some retcons as well as crossovers). However, all realities existed within only one Universe.

==== WildStorm ====
Originally, the stories appearing in WildStorm Productions' comic books occurred in a Universe that was part of the [[Image Comics|Image Universe]] along with other characters appearing in Image Comics publications. It was separated from it during the event called '''''Shattered Image''''' consolidating the separate WildStorm Universe which had its own multiversal structure. After the purchase of WildStorm by DC Comics, crossovers occurred with the new DC Universe, which were still separated just like Milestone and Marvel.

=== 21st century ===

==== ''52'' ====
{{Main|52 (comics)}}

In 2005, a new universal crisis story arc was published as a way to update once more the super heroes of DC Comics, bring together other "realities" (namely, Milestone and Wildstorm) and bring back the Multiverse, this time with a limited number of Earths instead of infinite.

During the event ''Infinite Crisis'', the Universe was "splintered" and the original Multiverse was restored briefly, showing that the entire Hypertime and many other appearances of the DC characters were part of the original Multiverse, including [[Tangent Comics]] which were published 12 years after the Multiverse was no more. In the end of ''Infinite Crisis'', the multiverse is merged back as a New Earth with a new continuity with many stories re-written and many others from the Modern Age still happening.

In parallel, ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' tells the story of how Captain Atom of the DC Universe causes the recreation of the Wildstorm Universe upon its destruction (and possibly its Multiverse as well). The recreated universe became part of the newly recreated DC Universe.

The aftermath of ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' (''52'', ''Countdown to Final Crisis'' and ''Final Crisis'') showed that a new Multiverse was created. The new Multiverse consisted of 52 positive matter universes, an Antimatter Universe and a Limbo. The main continuity still occurred in New Earth (also called Earth-0), Earths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 resembled Earths One, Two, Three, Four, S, and X of the original Multiverse respectively. Earths 13 and 50 were Vertigo and the rebooted Wildstorm Universe, while Earth-17 became the world of a revived [[post-apocalypse]] [[Atomic Knights]] after a mid-80s [[World War III]] once more. Many important stories from the Elseworlds imprint were later also given their own alternate Earths within this new Multiverse.

In the miniseries, ''Milestone Forever'', in a similar fashion as ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'', the events that led to the end of the Dakotaverse and its integration to the new DC continuity are revealed. Most of the stories that were told in Milestone Comics publications now occurred in New Earth and the Dakotaverse ceased to exist as a separated Universe.

A naming convention was established and followed this time in the format ''Earth, hyphen, numeral'', from Earth-0 to Earth-51.

Even with a new Multiverse, not every published or related work had an "Earth" within the 52 and there were no in-continuity intercompany crossovers.

Taking advantage of the fact that many of these universes were mostly unchronicled or merely glimpsed and that ''Final Crisis'' also changed the Multiverse slightly, many stories featuring alternate worlds and their interactions were published, which led certain inconsistencies and retcons to appear, such as Earth-1 being originally a "mirror" of Earth-One and later being the reality of [[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s ''[[Superman: Earth One]]'' or Earth-16 being the home of an alternate Superman/[[Chris Kent (comics)|Christopher Kent]], the home of the ''[[Super-Sons]]'', and later the reality of the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' TV series. Also, some universes appearing in the new continuity were never given a proper place within the 52 Universe, such as Prime-Earth.

==== ''The New 52'' ====
{{Main|The New 52}}

The new restored universe with only 52 worlds opened myriad possibilities for new stories and crossovers with different versions of heroes interacting with the main versions of heroes as well as the stories resulting from the new integrated characters from Milestone and Wildstorm. However, it became chaotic in just five years. Many stories and situations of other Universes were not followed well. The number designations could be completely disregarded from story to story and some universes were recreated over and over. In addition, as most of the history of the Modern Age was still being the main continuity, younger readers could not follow the stories of the mainstream versions of the DC heroes, just as had happened prior to the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.

In order to overcome these new problems, a new event was created to restart the DC Comics's Universe. In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries (May–September 2011), the Flash alters the timeline of Earth-0 creating a ripple effect that affected several past events, Earth-13 (Vertigo Universe) and Earth-50 (new Wildstorm Universe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifanboy.com/articles/features/the-definitive-guide-to-the-dc-comics-reboot/|title=The Definitive Guide To The DC Comics Reboot|author=|date=|website=ifanboy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the end result of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', a new mainstream Earth is created from the former three, with a whole new history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/08/31/faq-dc-comics-new-52 The New 52 FAQ: Answering Your Questions about the Relaunched DC Universe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126043701/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/08/31/faq-dc-comics-new-52 |date=2012-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stories have been retold anew but certain events of New Earth remain (such as Batgirl being crippled by the Joker). Since it was established after ''Infinite Crisis'' that if something ever happened to the main Universe, the whole Multiverse could be affected as well, a new Multiverse of 52 worlds was also recreated. This new Multiverse is called ''The New 52''.

This time, not all universes were revealed right away, only a couple were revealed in the first two years of ''The New 52''. In addition, in a similar fashion as the Elseworlds logo would appear in comics that did not occur in the "real" continuity, the logo ''THE NEW 52!'' would only appear in publications with stories occurring in the new continuity, while those taking place outside of this new continuity (such as ''Smallville: Season 11'' or the ''Batman Beyond'' universe) would not bear this distinction. At first it seemed that there was not going to be a naming convention for the Earths as it happened with the 52. The mainstream continuity was known as Prime Earth, although it was not a similar world to the real world as Earth-Prime was. [[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s re-envisioning of classic Batman and Superman stories was released as part of a series called ''Earth One''. In Grant Morrison's ''[[The Multiversity]]'' (2014–2015), the Earths are named in the same format as in the former 52 Multiverse (Earth-6, Earth-7, Earth-8 etc.) Morrison intended for ''[[The Multiversity]]'' to reveal remaining universes of The New 52 multiverse, and the underlying structure for the multiverse was revealed in a detailed map in the back of several comic books, for which an interactive online version is being maintained and updated on the DC Comics website. In addition, the sixth issue of ''The Multiversity'' constituted a 'guidebook' to the worlds of the current DC multiverse and was published in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;''Multiversity Guidebook'' (January 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Convergence'' and ''DC Rebirth'' ====
{{Main|Convergence (comics)}}

On October 2, 2011, Dan DiDio posted on his Facebook page that in The New 52, the three previous "crises" did not occur in this new continuity, but other events such as ''Zero Hour'' still happened, without ending in a crisis/reboot.&lt;ref&gt;Lichman, John (October 4, 2011) [http://www.ugo.com/the-goods/dc-new-52-timeline-so-far.html "DC New 52 Timeline So Far"]. UGO.&lt;/ref&gt; However, writers continued to make references to the crises, and the full history of the structure of the DC Multiverse, detailing previous crisis events, was given in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[The Multiversity]]'' (2014–2015) limited series.

The ''Convergence'' (2015) crossover event later explored this concept within the DCU. This miniseries brought back several heroes from the ages of DC Comics that were obliterated by the crisis events. They were trapped by a godlike incarnation of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] outside of time (or Vanishing Point as this "place" is called). At the end of the crossover, Brainiac sent these heroes back to their own timelines, and also successfully sent ''Zero Hour'' Hal Jordan, pre-''Flashpoint'' Superman and other heroes back to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' so that the collapse of the Multiverse could be averted.

From July 2015 onwards, The New 52 marking ended with the continuation of several publications and new others that did not necessarily take place within ''The New 52'' multiverse. Advertised as ''DC YOU'' (a pun of DCU or DC Universe and the phrase "it's about you, the fans" appearing in the advertisements), DC now has an "open doors" policy to continuity, granting writers greater freedom to explore stories set outside the established New 52 Multiverse continuity, as well as to revisit other characters and concepts from DC's history as the conclusion of ''Convergence'' suggested that although the core 52 universe that now exists is the evolution of the multiverse, all the worlds still exist in some form. This was confirmed by ''Convergence'' writer Jeff King, as he stated that the reconstituted DC Multiverse is now infinite and there might be more than one Multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/05/27/decoding-convergence-with-jeff-king-the-finale/|title=Decoding Convergence With Jeff King: The Finale|author=|date=|website=comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' initiative returned the original Wally West to Earth from the Speed Force and reveals that time has been stolen from his friends' memories, and the Superman of the pre-''Flashpoint'' world, stranded in the new timeline following ''Convergence'', assumes the role of that Earth's Superman. In ''Action Comics'' #976, the pre-''Flashpoint'' and ''New 52'' Supermen's histories are merged. [[Peter J. Tomasi]] explains that "The events of ''Action'' #976 reset and reshape the entire Superman timeline. Where there had been two Superman, their realities have now been fused into one timeline with just one of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/superman-reborn-recap/|title=Everything Changed Forever!

== Fictional history, structure and worlds of the DC Multiverse ==
{{See also|List of DC Multiverse worlds}}

=== Infinite Multiverse ===
As told in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7, the DC Universe was a single positive matter Universe until a scientist named Krona from the planet Oa altered the very moment of the creation of the Universe, causing it to split into countless similar universes and an antimatter universe. Oa, however, had no duplicates in the Multiverse but did have a twin in the antimatter universe: Qward. A satellite on each of these planets was created in the cataclysm and it was there where the embodiments of the Multiverse were born: the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor]]. The two battled to a standstill and eventually rendered one another comatose.

The Multiverse had countless&lt;ref&gt;Marv Wolfman, the writer of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', estimated that the original Multiverse had consisted of about 3,000 universes.&lt;/ref&gt; duplicates of planet Earth. Every Earth had a different history from one another but they always developed heroes and inspired heroic ages (which, according to Harbinger, it somehow made them a focal point among all the worlds in every universe). Some of the heroes of Earth knew about other Earths and their own counterparts and fought side by side on many occasions.

Later, a scientist from one universe named Kell Mossa (known initially only as [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]]) created another device that would allow him to attempt the same thing Krona had attempted before. His actions accidentally awakened the Anti-Monitor, who then devoured Pariah's entire universe (aside from Pariah himself) and began to do the same to other universes (Pariah originally believes that the opposite is true; that his experiment destroyed the universes, which awakened the Anti-Monitor, until the truth is revealed to him). The time period of Earth when this takes place or the name of this Earth are never revealed.

The Monitor is awakened by the destruction of the positive matter universes and starts a plan to save the Multiverse but his efforts, and later those of his protégé, Harbinger, with the help of the heroes of the Multiverse, only manage to save five universes. In a desperate effort to save all existence, heroes and villains unite in order to stop Krona from splitting the Universe and stop the Anti-Monitor from altering the moment of creation and make the Antimatter Universe the only one. They succeed in saving all existence but in the process, the Multiverse, its countless duplicate worlds and its history ceased to exist. The five universes that were saved were folded together into a single universe, placing all the heroes and villains into a single timeline. For example, Justice Society of Earth-Two instead became a team active in the 1940s that inspired the Justice League to form decades later. And in the event of any duplicate characters, the original Earth-One version would take precedence.

All the universes existed within the same space but had a unique vibration that kept them separated. Only by "tuning" to the specific frequency of a universe could a person leap to another Earth, as Barry Allen discovered as he tried to perform a disappearing act by vibrating his molecules at super speed (''Flash'' #123). The "speedster" later developed a machine called the "Cosmic Treadmill", which, when it was used by people who controlled the [[Speed Force]], it allowed the users to trespass the "vibrational barriers". Magic and cosmic incidents also made many people to travel to other universes.

Every universe could have its own dimensions, such as the Fifth Dimension (where Mr. Mxyztplk (Earth-Two), Mr. Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite (both Earth-One) came from), alternate timelines (Kamandi and the 30th Century of Earth-One) and realms (Hell, Heaven, Gemworld, etc.). In addition to the unique Antimatter Universe, the dimension of the New Gods (the Fourth World) was also believed unique, although there is evidence that there could have been alternate versions of them (as those appearing in Earth-17 and Earth-Crossover).

Even though the interaction between multiple Earths was common in the 20th century with relative safety and ease, most of the population of Earth was unaware of the Multiverse until the Crisis on Infinite Earths.

The following is a short list of the most notable universes in the Multiverse.

=== DC Universe and Megaverse ===
{{Main|DC Universe}}

15 billion years ago, a single universe with a single timestream was created. 4.4 billion years ago, Krona, the renegade Maltusian (a race of highly evolved beings) creates the Antimatter Universe and releases entropy in the universe by linking the beginning and the end of the timeline in his attempts to reveal the secrets of the creation of the universe.

In this single universe, the timeline was destroyed in the early 1990s by Hal Jordan (possessed by Parallax) and created a slightly changed timeline (''Zero Hour'', 1994). It was later revealed that this ''Central Timeline'' was like a river with branches. These branches were like different realities, the history of Earth was different in every branch and everything could be possible in them. They could affect the Central Timeline as they return to the mainstream and the heroes could encounter with different versions of themselves. However, they were somewhat ephemeral as the Central Timeline is the only one that could prevail (''The Kingdom'', 1999).

After ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', there was no place for alternate realities, although they could exist in the form of ephemeral timelines (Hypertime), dimensions (such as the fifth dimension or the Fourth World) or universes inside the Universe (such as the Legion of Super-Heroes' pocket universe or the Amalgam Universe).

However, there was contact with realities that existed outside the Universe such as those from Marvel, Milestone and Wildstorm. The collection of universes, multiverses and others that are unrelated, is most of the time called the Megaverse. Some{{Who|date=October 2015}} also call it the Omniverse, but tend to include the Real World when using this denomination.

The contact of these worlds usually brought cataclysms, the one being the most common, amalgamation. Traveling between these realities was extremely hard, only two characters were capable of doing so with natural abilities: Rift, who existed in both the DC and Milestone Universes, and Access, who had the task of keeping the DC and Marvel Universes separated to prevent amalgamation.

Most of the time, these events were either forgotten (as shown in the ''Unlimited Access'' miniseries as Access has the power to annul or restore the memories of heroes) or believed to be "dreams" (as shown in ''DC/Milestone: Worlds Collide'' and ''DC/Wildstorm: Dreamwar''), which in the end left few traces of the events in the respective continuities.

The Wildstorm Universe was part of a larger multiverse but was separated after a multiversal cataclysm, forming a multiverse of its own (''Shattered Image''). Organizations known as [[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]] and the Authority were capable of traveling across the Multiverse and were also able to map it. Its structure was described as a web of 196,833 universes arranged in a pattern resembling a [[snowflake]], each universe separated from its neighbors by a medium called the [[Bleed (comics)|Bleed]]. The Bleed prevented the Universes from colliding and was inhabited by "fauna" that despised all different Earths.

=== ''52'' ===
Alexander Luthor Jr. of Earth-Three and Superboy of Earth-Prime grew tired of their exile. After successfully escaping their prison, they seek to restore their worlds and search for a perfect new world, as they believe the happenings at New Earth after the Crisis make it a flawed reality. The whole Multiverse is restored, but with great instability that could cause the end of all existence (''Infinite Crisis''). Parallel to these events, Captain Atom arrives in a different multiverse, jeopardizing its very existence. Void destroys the now-corrupted universe in order to recreate it (''Captain Atom: Armageddon'').

The heroes of Earth manage to merge back the Multiverse into a single universe, but it could not hold so much energy. 52 identical worlds are created to liberate such energy. Mister Mind, finally in his ultimate form, has the power to devour parts of the time continuum, literally eating parts of the Earths' history and creating major differences between each other (''[[52 (comics)|52]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504180243/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004448945.cfm|title=Wizard Entertainment|author=|date=4 May 2007|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="countdownarena"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124768 |title=WW: Chicago '07: Dan DiDio on 'Countdown: Arena' |work=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011131246/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124768 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Universe where the city of Dakota existed, a man known as Dharma foresaw the final demise of Earth and searched for a way to avert it. His very efforts were responsible for the apocalypse he tried to prevent. He managed to salvage the remains of his Earth by merging them to the main Earth of the new Multiverse that was reformed after the death of the New Gods (''Milestone Forever'', ''Final Crisis'').

This Multiverse consisted of only 52 worlds, 51 resting upon Earth-0. According to Rip Hunter in ''52 #52'', every universe occupied the same space, each on a different vibrational plane (as it was in the original Multiverse). However, it was stated later that the universes were also separated by a fluid known as the Bleed (just like in the former Wildstorm Universe). The Bleed is interconnected to the Source Wall (which separates existence from the force that created it or "the Source") and the Multiversal Nexus, where the 52 Monitors watched over the Multiverse and had the task of avoiding contacts between the universes that could cause cataclysms. If Earth-0 should be destroyed, it would cause a chain reaction, destroying the rest of the 51 universes and leaving the opposite Antimatter Universe solely in existence. Each of the alternate universes have their own parallel dimensions, divergent timelines, microverses, etc., branching off them.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=128569 |title=Baltimore Comic-Con '07: DC Nation Panel Report |work=Newsarama |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911033901/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=128569 |archivedate=September 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monitors originated in a world called Nil and were a sort of descendants of the original Monitor, who was created by Overvoid, a limitless intelligence who investigated the Multiverse at the beginning of time. Nix Uotan, the Monitor of Earth-51 erased the Monitors, as they self-proclaimed themselves the judges of what happened in the worlds of the Multiverse.

=== ''The New 52'' ===
The Flash wakes up in an altered timeline. As he tries to find the cause, he discovers that he was responsible for the alteration and attempts to fix it. In doing so, it is revealed that the timelines of Earth-0, Earth-13 and Earth-50 were originally one, but were splintered. The result is a new timeline formed by those three and along with it came a new history for the other 52 worlds within the Multiverse (''Flashpoint'', 2011). It is later revealed that, in actuality, the current timeline was created when a mysterious being (implied to be Doctor Manhattan from ''Watchmen'') entered the Multiverse while the timeline was resetting due to Barry Allen preventing the Flashpoint event and extracted ten years from continuity (''DC Universe: Rebirth'', 2016)

Years later, the Harbinger Program at the House of Heroes gathers several superheroes of the "Orrery of Worlds" to fight against a force known as the "Gentry" who has already decimated Earth-7 and threatens the rest of the worlds of the Multiverse. As the story unfolds, Earths within the Orrery are visited and reveal the new nature of them after the Flashpoint event. Also, mysterious comic books published by DC and Major Comics appear and are believed to be cursed or to be messages from parallel Earths (''[[The Multiversity]]'' (2014)).

Several stories and even the structure of the entire Multiverse have been retold after the events of ''Flashpoint''. As it has been revealed so far, most of the 52 worlds suffered drastic changes such as Earth-2 which is now a reboot in the present day of the heroes that formed the Justice Society or Earth-3 which reverted to be the opposite of the main Earth (Earth-0 in this case), instead of the opposite of Earth-Two. Others retain most of what they were in the 52 multiverse such as Earth-5, Earth-10, or Earth-23. In addition, seven Earths remain undisclosed in composition or purpose, other than their creation by the Monitors for unknown reasons-Earths 14, 24, 25, 27, 28, 46 and 49.

The Monitors are now described as a race of countless members and only 52 remained after the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' event, suggesting that there were Monitors for every world in the original Multiverse instead of just one. Several elements that have appeared across the history to what now is DC Comics have also been actively incorporated in the new structure, such as the Source Wall (''The New Gods''), the Bleed (Wildstorm's ''The Authority''), the Speed Force and the vibrational barriers (''The Flash'') and the Rock of Eternity (''Shazam!'').

This new Multiverse has a sphere-like structure with several levels (or vibrational realms) as described in the map''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.dcentertainment.com/sites/default/files/Multiversity_Map_2400_53ee6b4c22d9a9.11031355.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612031510/http://media.dcentertainment.com/sites/default/files/Multiversity_Map_2400_53ee6b4c22d9a9.11031355.jpg |archivedate=2015-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''The Source Wall''': the limit of existence, beyond lies the ''Source'' and the ''Unknowable''. The ''Overvoid'' is shown in the map to exist outside it as well.
*'''The Monitor Sphere''': the origin of the ''Monitors'', a race who preserves and studies the universes.
*'''Limbo''': "where matter and memory break down"; the place where the lost and forgotten go.
*'''The Sphere of the Gods''': within it, the realms of old and new gods, demons and even dreams exist.
*'''The Speed Force Wall''': also known as the Speed of Light and is the limit to matter. Within it is the Orrery of Worlds and certain worlds exist in it (such as KRAKKL the Defender's world).
*'''The Orrery of Worlds''': the realm where the 52 universes exist in the same space, vibrating at different frequencies, within the ''Bleed''. In the center of it are the ''Rock of Eternity'' and the ''House of Heroes''.

=== Multi-Multiverse ===
An infinitely powerful and god-like version of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] abducted multiple superheroes and their core cities from various alternate Earths and eras of the Multiverse and pitted them against one another. Because of the heroes' efforts for the survival of reality during this event, the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and ''Zero Hour'' were averted and there is once more an infinite Multiverse beyond the core 52 universes which have made up the local Multiverse since ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''Flashpoint''. The original Multiverse coexists along with the collapsed Earth, the core 52 worlds, and all other versions of the Multiverse that have ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Convergence'' #8 (May 2015): DC Comics: New York&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dark Multiverse ===
In the ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]'' storyline, it is revealed that each reality of the Multiverse has a negative counterpart created by the fears of a universe's people. These Dark Universes are explained to be temporary realities, which motivate the Dark Knights to invade the Multiverse so that they can save their dying realities. Forthcoming "Dark Multiverse" stories will revisit this realm, with mutated versions of [[Superman]], [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Lois Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.criticalhit.net/comics-toys/dc-just-getting-started-dark-multiverse-nightmarish-silver-age-designs-revealed-sideways/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other versions ==

=== ''Super Friends'' ===
{{Main|Super Friends}}

In the animated television series ''Super Friends'', the superhero team has encounters with other universes, including the world of Qward. In the episode "Universe of Evil", a freak accident causes [[Superman]] to switch places with his evil counterpart.

=== DC animated universe ===
{{Main|DC animated universe}}
The DC animated universe (DCAU) has depicted the Multiverse many times. Several characters from the main DCAU have visited parallel universes that were similar to the DCAU.

* In the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Brave New Metropolis", [[Lois Lane]] fell into a parallel Earth where she had died in the car bombing orchestrated by Intergang. As a result, Superman had nothing to keep his morality from becoming corrupted. A much more serious Superman teamed with [[Lex Luthor]] and took over [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], turning it into a fascist police-state where the Daily Planet and S.T.A.R. Labs were shut down and a rebellion, which Jimmy Olsen is a part of, was started, though Superman was unaware of what Lex Luthor was doing with Metropolis until Lois showed him the truth, which was enough for Superman to turn against Luthor.
* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Legends", several members of the League were accidentally sent to a parallel universe where [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]'s comic book idols, a [[pastiche]] of the [[Justice Society of America]] named the [[Justice Guild of America]], live. Justice Guild member Tom Turbine hypothesized that there are an infinite number of parallel dimensions.
* In the ''Justice League'' episode "A Better World", the Justice League were held captive by their authoritarian counterparts from another universe, the "[[Justice Lords]]". In this universe, Lex Luthor had risen to the U.S. Presidency and had started a war which had killed the Flash, sparking the Lords' takeover of the world, starting with this Superman killing President Luthor. In this world, the Justice Lords labotomized their former enemies, leaving them as harmless workers at Arkham. Later in the series, the regular Lex Luthor ran for President solely to enrage Superman for his amusement.
* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Question Authority", the [[Question (comics)|Question]] is surfing through [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]]'s files on a computer. One of the files is titled "Multiverse" and another file shows footage from the episode "A Better World" where the alternate Superman murders Lex Luthor. Ironically, after viewing files on the Justice Lords, he initially believes that instead of looking at an alternate universe, he is looking at the future of the universe in which the League lives. The exact means by how Cadmus came into possession of footage from the death of President Luthor seen in "A Better World" remains unknown.

=== ''Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman'' ===
{{Main|Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman}}

In ''Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman'', the show's primary protagonists, Lois Lane and [[Clark Kent]], encountered an alternative version Clark Kent from a parallel universe in the episodes "Tempus, Anyone?" and "Lois &amp; Clarks". In the episode "Tempus, Anyone?", the dimension included these differences:

* Clark Kent had not assumed the identity of Superman and was engaged to [[Lana Lang]] (prior to the events of "Tempus, Anyone?").
* Lois Lane had been lost on assignment in the Congo and presumed dead since 1993 (prior to the events of "Tempus, Anyone?" and "Lois &amp; Clarks").
* [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]] died when Clark was a child.
* [[Jimmy Olsen]] owns the [[Daily Planet]] and is also [[Perry White]]'s campaign manager for his mayoral election.
* Both [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Charlton Heston]] were elected as [[President of the United States of America]] (not to mention Elvis being alive and well).

The primary version of Lois, who was abducted by the villain Tempus and taken to this dimension, helped the alternate Clark become Superman, only to have Tempus expose his secret identity to the world on television. Despite Clark's alien origin, the world embraces him as their champion.

Later in the episode "Lois &amp; Clarks", the alternate Clark visits the primary ''L&amp;C'' dimension to aid Lois in stopping Tempus while the Clark Kent of her world is trapped in a time vortex. After Tempus' defeat, it is implied that the alternate Clark would travel to the past with [[H.G. Wells]] and take his reality's Lois Lane to his own time thus, under a [[predestination paradox]], explaining her disappearance.

=== Amalgam Comics ===
{{Main|Amalgam Comics}}

* Some issues in the two series from April 1996 and June 1997 (such as ''Spider-Boy Team-Up'' #1) state that a Crisis event known as the Secret Crisis of the Infinity Hour occurred and was related to alternate realities and timelines. The event is an amalgam of four major DC and Marvel crossover events (''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'', ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', ''The Infinity Gauntlet'' and ''Zero Hour: Crisis in Time'').
* In ''Challengers of the Fantastic'' #1, Reed "Prof" Richards is seen watching the parallel Universe-Two. It is hinted that this universe is an amalgam of DC's Earth-Two and Marvel's New Universe.
* ''Unlimited Access'' #4 shows glimpses of many amalgamated universes.
* The fictional letters in the letter sections of the April 1996 Amalgam Comics issues hint to an Amalgam Prime Earth, where the editor Stan Schwartz (an amalgam of Stan Lee and Julie Schwartz) and the film company Fox Bros. (an amalgam of 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros.) both exist.

=== ''Planetary'' ===
{{Main|Planetary (comics)}}

The [[WildStorm]] comic book series ''Planetary'' also introduced the concept of a multiverse, drawing upon the mathematical concept known as the [[Monster group]] for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://warren-ellis.livejournal.com/2678.html | title =Mar. 27th, 2005 | accessdate =2006-11-10 | author =Warren Ellis | authorlink =Warren Ellis | date =2005-03-27 | work =Warren Ellis' Live Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multiverse is described as "a theoretical snowflake existing in 196,833 dimensional space",&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer =Warren Ellis  | Artist =John Cassaday | Title =Planetary | Issue =#2  | Date = April, 1999 | Publisher = DC Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the visualization method used by some mathematicians when describing the Monster group.

=== ''Smallville'' ===
{{Main|Smallville}}
&lt;!-- DESCRIPTION FOR THIS SECTION REQUIRES INFORMATION FROM THE FOLLOWING STORYLINES: ALIEN, LANTERN, CHAOS AND CONTINUITY. REFERENCES WILL BE NECESSARY.--&gt;

The live-action television series ''Smallville'' also featured the Multiverse concept. In the season 5 episode "Lexmas", Lex Luthor visits an alternate timeline where Lionel cuts Lex out of the family fortune while Lex is married to Lana and has a son named Alexander. Clark Kent is a reporter with the Daily Planet, Chloe is publishing a book exposing LuthorCorp with Lex's help, and Jonathan Kent is a state senator.

In the season 7 episode "Apocalypse," Clark is taken to an alternate timeline where his counterpart had not arrived in Smallville and is killed by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. In that dimension, Clark Kent encounters another version of himself who is a human biological son of Martha and Jonathan and never met Lana Lang (who is a cheerleader with a different group of friends). Also in this dimension, Chloe Sullivan is engaged, Lana Lang is a married woman living in Paris, Sheriff Nancy Adams left Smallville and works as a member of the government, and Lex Luthor became President of the United States. While this dimension's Earth is destroyed by President Luthor, Clark travels back in time and sends his infant self to Earth, thus restoring his timeline.

In the season 10 episode "Luthor", Clark Kent travels to an alternate universe dubbed Earth-2 with the help of a Kryptonian mirror box. There, Lionel Luthor is his adopted father instead of Jonathan Kent. Clark is a bloodthirsty tyrant whose persona is [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]]. He has a relationship with his adopted sister, Tess. Clark Luthor killed his adoptive brother Lex. When Clark Kent travels to the alternate earth, his counterpart, Clark Luthor, travels to his. Lois Lane is engaged to [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]], who bought land in Smallville for its kryptonite. Lionel lures Clark into Oliver's kryponite trap and beats him. With the help of Oliver (who closes the kryponite portal), Clark uses the mirror box and returns to his world. Unbeknownst to him, Lionel comes with him.

Earth-2 is featured again later in the season in the episode "Kent", as Clark Luthor returns to his counterpart's world once more, and Clark Kent meets Earth-2's Jonathan Kent.  After Clark Kent interacts with his deceased adoptive father's counterpart, he returns to his own world and lures Clark Luthor to the Fortress of Solitude, where he sends his counterpart back to his world.

In the fourth issue of the television series' comic book continuation ''Smallville Season 11'', an alternative version of [[Chloe Sullivan]] from Earth-2 arrives to Clark Kent's world and reveals that her universe is destroyed before her death.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11'' vol. 1 #4 (August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  In issue #11, it is reveals that the Monitors are responsible for Earth-2's destruction.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11'' vol. 1 #10 (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Across this multiverse, there are other Earths featured in the series including:

*; Earth-9: This Earth was destroyed when it was torn asunder by collision with Earth-37, toppling into one another, because of a Bleed quake caused by a Monitor who did not follow the protocol.
*; Earth-13: This Earth was a parallel universe that co-existed as one with the Earth of the main Smallville universe. Not much is known about this universe as it was never shown, only merely mentioned. Its main feature was that its version of Clark Kent was a normal human and a wannabe hero, rather than a Kryptonian with superpowers, and Bruce Wayne, instead of being a superhero, is actually a psychopathic killer. Like many other universes, this Earth was also decimated. Earth-13 was destroyed when Earths-9 and -37 were torn asunder by collision, toppling into one another and shattering reality on Earth-13, because of a Bleed quake caused by a Monitor who did not follow the protocol. Its version of Clark managed to travel to the main Earth of Smallville. Unfortunately, he was followed by Bruce and he was killed by him there. Bruce Wayne remains the last survivor of his Earth, as he is held prisoner on Mars.
*; Earth-37: This Earth was destroyed when it was torn asunder by collision with Earth-9, toppling into one another, because of a Bleed quake caused by a Monitor who did not follow the protocol.
*; Earth-Majestic: This Earth is a parallel universe that co-exists as one with the Earth of the main Smallville universe. It is referred to as Earth-Majestic and its designation is unknown. It derives this name from its greatest superhero Mister Majestic, the alternate version of Superman. This Earth is the latest target of the Monitors, as they have already started the process to decimate it. It was later destroyed like the other Earths before it with the consciousness of Jor-El being the last survivor of this universe.
*; Earth-Omega: This Earth is a parallel universe that co-exists as one with the Earth of the main Smallville universe. It is referred to as Earth "Omega" and its designation is unknown. It derives this name from the Omega symbol, which is used by Darkseid. This Earth was attacked and seized by Apokolips and the two planets have collided with each other. Among the ruins are several fallen ships that belonged to the Monitors, wrecked Manhunters and skeletons of dead people. This Earth has not been destroyed entirely yet, because when the Monitors arrived there, Darkseid had already conquered that world. A catastrophic battle followed between the two parts, destroying almost everything around them. However, the Monitors, who, even though they suffered many casualties, succeeded in breaking Darkseid. After Superman made a deal with Darkseid, he gave him the crystal shard that contains the presence of Jor-El from Earth-Majestic. Darkseid threw the shard into the distance and a Fortress of Solitude formed, with Darkseid saying it could be a new beginning, a "'''New Genesis'''."

=== ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' ===
{{Main|Batman: The Brave and the Bold}}

In ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'', a kind of "multiverse" is referenced in the episodes "Deep Cover for Batman!" and "Game Over for Owlman!", which feature several references to alternate incarnations of DC Comics heroes and villains, including the [[Batman]] and the [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]. The Multiverse is briefly revisited in "Night of the Batmen!", with a large group of Batmen gathered from across various Earths coming together to help an injured Bruce Wayne protect Gotham. The army of Multiverse Batmen contained various iterations of the Batman from different media adaptions, such as from ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', the DC Animated Universe, the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, and ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.

=== ''Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths'' ===
{{Main|Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths}}

The direct-to-video feature ''Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths'' deals with the Multiverse as part of its story. The main story deals with a good Lex Luthor from his Earth (based on the Pre-''Crisis'' [[Earth-Three]]) coming to the Earth where the Justice League are located to help fight their counterparts, the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]. While the two Earths inhabited by the Justice League and Crime Syndicate are not named, names of other Earths are mentioned. These names are not from the official Pre-''Crisis'' nor post-''Infinite Crisis'' Multiverse, but are nods to a degree. Examples include: "Gamma F-1", "Theta-Alpha", "Zeta-Pi", which are all Greek numbers. [[Earth-Prime]] is featured in the film, but is not the same Earth-Prime from the comics, where it was "our" Earth. In the film, Earth-Prime is shown to be the cornerstone of all reality, and that decisions made by humankind on this world caused alternate Earths where the opposite decision was made to come into being. This world is shown to be a desolate barren wasteland of a planet, with ruins as far as the eye can see. It is unknown what exactly caused its desolation, though the Owlman reasons that it was [[Omnicide|mankind who destroyed itself]]. There was also an unnamed Earth that is mostly covered in ice. It was destroyed when the Owlman allowed the bomb to detonate with himself still on it.

=== ''DC Universe Online'' ===
{{Main|DC Universe Online}}

In the video game ''DC Universe Online'', [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] decides to conquer New Earth in order to know the secret of the multiverse. After he was defeated, the heroes have to face the Council of Luthors, who wants to take control of the Nexus of Reality and rule existence through the achievement of ultimate power. But the Council of Batmen wishes to stop the Luthors and undo the damage that has been done.

=== ''Green Lantern: The Animated Series'' ===
{{Main|Green Lantern: The Animated Series}}
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}

=== ''Injustice'' ===
{{Main|Injustice: Gods Among Us|Injustice 2}}

The storyline of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' features an alternate reality where the Joker has tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane and their unborn son and destroying Metropolis with a nuclear explosion. This tragedy completely ruins Superman's moral compass to the point of no return and the Kryptonian murders the Joker in retaliation. As time passes, he establishes a new world order, with himself as the High Councilor. Soon enough, Superman's iron-fisted rule triggers a war between the Regime and those allied with the Batman's Insurgency. High Councilor Superman begins a relationship with Wonder Woman who becomes one of his most devoted followers. Damian Wayne eventually sides with Superman against his father and kills Victor Zsasz. Cyborg also joins the Regime due to sharing his anger over the destruction of Metropolis. Dick Grayson is accidentally killed by Damian Wayne, which creates an even further rift between himself and his father, who mourns the death of his adopted son while Damian eventually adopts Dick's mantle of Nightwing. Harley Quinn leads a group called the Joker Gang who idolizes the Joker and fights alongside the Insurgency against the Regime. Both Black Adam and Billy Batson (Shazam) join the Regime. Hal Jordan becomes Yellow Lantern after joining the Sinestro Corps. which has allied itself with Superman's Regime against the Green Lantern Corps. The Green Arrow is killed by the Regime, leaving behind the Black Canary who is pregnant with their son Connor. The Black Canary is saved by Doctor Fate who transports her to an alternate Earth where Oliver Queen is still alive, though he has lost his Black Canary. Five years into the war, the Insurgency discovers an alternate universe where the Joker's plan did not succeed and transports several of its superheroes (Wonder Woman, the Batman, Aquaman, the Green Arrow, and Green Lantern) to their world in order to help them defeat the Regime. Unfortunately, the Joker of this universe is brought to the Regime universe and is killed. Also in this universe, Lex Luthor never becomes a criminal and instead he is a selfless businessman, best friend of this world's Superman and cares for the people of Metropolis, though he secretly sides with the Batman against the tyrannical Superman, only to be killed in battle. Together with the alternate universe Justice League and the Regime Flash, who defects from the Regime after Superman murders Shazam when he objects to Superman's plans to attack cities, the Regime Superman is defeated and imprisoned in the Red Son prison along with fellow Regime members Cyborg and Damian Wayne (Nightwing). Hal Jordan and Sinestro are imprisoned on Oa by the Guardians. The Flash allows himself to be taken into custody to face charges for his role in the Regime. After the Regime's fall, Bruce Wayne works to rebuild the world after the fall of the Regime. The alternate Justice League return to their universe.

The ''Injustice'' universe is featured at the beginning of ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' as one of the many realities affected by [[Arak (comics)|Telos]]' Blood Moon.

In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', it is revealed that Krypton in this universe was attacked by Brainiac who collects the city of Kandor and destroys Argo City, which Kara Zor-El barely survives. Her mother saves her from Brainiac's Betas and reveals that Brainiac has destabilized the planet's core. Kara is tasked with watching over her baby cousin Kal-El and flees Krypton in a spaceship at the behest of her mother; however, her ship is damaged and knocked off course by the planet's explosion, which puts her into suspended animation. She is later found drifting through space by Black Adam, who takes her to Kahndaq where he and Wonder Woman have been hiding out since Superman was imprisoned. Black Adam and Wonder Woman train her in the hopes that her strength will give them the edge to free Kal-El. A flashback shows how Robin (Damian Wayne) joins Superman after killing the remorseless serial killer Victor Zsasz (which retcons the nature and timing of Damain's murder of Zsasz from the ''Injustice'' prequel comics). In the present, Damian Wayne and Cyborg are also incarcerated with Superman, while Aquaman has distanced himself away from the Regime to protect Atlantis. Meanwhile, Bruce is busy with the rebuilding the world after the Regime, forcing him to enlist other heroes such as the Black Canary, her husband the Green Arrow (from the alternate universe that the Black Canary was sent to by Doctor Fate), Firestorm and the Blue Beetle/Jaime Reyes as well as Harley Quinn, the Flash (who had been pardoned due to his role in taking down the Regime after the murder of Billy Batson by Superman) and Hal Jordan, who was reinstated as Green Lantern by the Guardians of the Universe, who managed to rehabilitate him. The Batman also constructs [[Brother Eye]] to monitor Earth for the Regime, the Society, and other potential threats. The Batman tasks the Black Canary, the Green Arrow, and Harley to deal with the Society, a group of supervillains formed by Gorilla Grodd after the fall of the Regime. During their confrontation with the Society in Gorilla City, they learn of an even greater threat posed by Brainiac which leads to the three being captured, though Harley escapes thanks to the intervention of the Catwoman, who had infiltrated the Society as an undercover mole. Brainiac hacks into Brother Eye and demands that Superman be handed over to him, though Bruce suits up and flees from the Batcave. Supergirl informs Wonder Woman and Black Adam of the threat posed by Brainiac and tells them they must get to her cousin before it is too late. This leads Kara and the Regime to break into the Red Son prison to free Superman, Cyborg, and Damian Wayne. However, the Blue Beetle and Firestorm protect the prison, but they are overwhelmed. Firestorm plans to destroy the Regime with a nuclear explosion, but the Batman tells him to stand down and decides that the threat posed by Brainiac is too great, leading the Insurgency and Regime to join forces to battle a common enemy. However, Supergirl begins to question what she had been told when Wonder Woman stabs Harley for trying to stop her from killing the Cheetah. Kara manages to save Harley's life, confronts her cousin and realizes that he has become a ruthless dictator like General Zod. After a brief battle with Robin, Black Adam, and Superman after her attempts to reason with Superman fail, they are interrupted by Brainiac's attack and Superman tells his cousin she must choose a side when it is over. During the battle with Brainiac's Skull Ship, Metropolis is destroyed again and Superman apparently killed. The Batman consoles Kara and tells her about how Superman was his friend once and refuses to accept Brainiac's proposal that he will spare Earth if Kara is handed over to him. She later joins the Batman in infiltrating Brainiac's ship, but Kara is captured, though Superman is revealed to be alive and he teams up with the Batman to stop Brainiac and save Kara. However, after Brainiac's defeat (which frees Kara) and Superman stopping the Skull Ship from crashing, the Regime and Insurgency clashes over how to deal with Brainiac as the Insurgency believes that if they spare Brainiac they will discover how to restore the collected cities and free their inhabitants, while Superman plans to kill Brainiac and restore the Regime, though Supergirl sides with the Insurgency, understanding that the Regime was planning to betray the Insurgency as soon as Brainiac was defeated. The story has two different endings.

* If Batman is selected, Kara works with the Batman and the Insurgency to defeat her cousin, though the Batman apologizes to Kara that she was not able to save Superman from himself. Superman is then imprisoned in the Phantom Zone though he swears to return, while the Batman convinces Kara that she can be a hero like her cousin had once been.
* If Superman is selected, then he confronts the redeemed Hal Jordan and the Flash, defeating them both. He also tells Kara that he is tired of holding back for fear of hurting others as he believes it is that fear that led to Lois' death. Kara laments that she is thankful that his father is not alive to see the person he has become, though Superman says that if his father had been more like Zod, he might have been able to save Krypton. Superman defeats both Kara and the Batman. The Batman, expecting to be killed, goads him to show him what a true villain he has become, though Superman relents, not wanting to make the Batman a martyr, and believes Kara will come around. He kills Brainiac and becomes one with his ship. Kara is imprisoned in Superman's old Red Son prison cell, where Superman shows her he has completely merged with Brainiac's ship and asks her if she will reconsider his offer to rule alongside him as family, before revealing to Kara's horror that he has gained Brainiac's ability to control others, which he demonstrates by showing her the Batman, who has been brainwashed by Superman, and suggests he will do the same to Kara if she refuses. Superman plans to expand his Regime into a Legion by recruiting beings from Brainiac's collection. He plans to use this Legion to bring peace to his universe and the multiverse. In the game's Multiverse Mode, Brother Eye monitors the infinite Multiverse for threats, sending heroes to combat threats or aid allies from other universes.

=== ''Infinite Crisis'' (video game) ===
{{Main|Infinite Crisis (video game)}}

The video game ''Infinite Crisis'' (which is unrelated to the [[Infinite Crisis|comic book of the same name]]) features a multiverse with 52 different worlds. This multiverse is threatened by a sudden assault and all realities stand on the brink of annihilation. Now, the last hope for Earth lies in the powers of the DC legends.

During the events of the tie-in comic book ''Infinite Crisis: Fight for the Multiverse'', it is said that the Monitors were a race of beings native to the world of Nil that resided outside all realities in the Overvoid. Their existence came following the creation of the Multiverse and the Bleed where they watched the infinite Earths and sought to protect the infinite strands of creation. It was claimed that they were a people that cared little about the existence of the inhabitants of these universes and more for the preservation of their grand order. Such was their existence, until one of their kind turned against the others and became the Anti-Monitor. A Crisis emerged as a result whereby many universes were destroyed, but the Anti-Monitor was defeated at the cost of almost the entire Monitor race. From this Crisis, there existed only 52 universes left in the Multiverse that were kept in perfect balance. The only survivor of their race was Nix Uotan, who detected a new Crisis emerging from an unknown menace who made use of corrupted Monitor technology and struck at Earth-48. Nix Uotan returned to his people's home world in order to reactivate the machinery to help contain the damage from the Crisis. As a result, he began to seek out champions and even villains to help combat this menace from across the Multiverse. These individuals would be charged with recovering artifacts from across the many Earths that were being taken by the mysterious enemy to aid in their assault. Among his agents was a human female from Earth-48 who went by the name of Harbinger.

The featured alternate Earths are those of the [[New 52]] DC Multiverse.

* Prime Earth is Earth-0, DC's core alternate universe.
* "Arcane" Earth is Earth-13.
* "Atomic" Earth is the post-apocalyptic Earth-17.
*  "[[Gotham by Gaslight|Gaslight]]" Earth is the [[Edwardian]] analogue [[steampunk]] Earth-19.
* "Nightmare" Earth is the vampiric metahuman-dominated Earth-43.
* "Mecha" Earth is Earth-44, on which robotics scientists created the Metal/Mecha League, analogues of Prime Earth superheroes.

[[Superman]], [[Supergirl]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], the [[Catwoman]],  [[Wonder Woman]], the [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] are featured as player possibilities, each with alternate versions amongst the six featured alternate Earth scenarios.

In this reality, the Monitors had access to energy constructs that were able to record messages and transmit communiques across the Multiverse. They also forged orbs that glowed with light and served as a guide across the alternate universes as well as serve as a communicator with the Monitors. On their homeworld of Nil, there were spatial engines that could be used to help prevent large scale universal breaches that would damage the Multiverse.

=== Arrowverse and DC Extended Universe ===
{{Main|Arrowverse|DC Extended Universe}}

In July 2014, DC CCO [[Geoff Johns]] confirmed that the universe present in the publisher's television series, ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', is separate from the one being built in their films with ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' and ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. In October 2014, Johns explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], saying "We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through...It's just a different approach."

The Multiverse concept is explored during the second season of ''The Flash'', which is pivotal to the conflicts between Barry Allen ([[Grant Gustin]]) and rogue speedster [[Hunter Zolomon]] ([[Teddy Sears]]). The access points to the Multiverse are portals that were created as a result of an exploding singularity over Central City during the season 2 premiere "The Man Who Saved Central City". In the episode "Enter Zoom", it is revealed that Earth-2's version of the [[Green Arrow]] is Robert Queen ([[Jamey Sheridan]]) instead of his son [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Oliver]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who presumably died on the boat accident. In the season 2 finale "The Race of His Life", Zoom reveals that the universe in which that of ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'' and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' sets is positioned in the Multiverse's center, and from there one could travel to any of the other infinite numbers of Earths.  After [[Jay Garrick]] is rescued from Zoom, he reveals that he is from yet another Earth, designated Earth-3. In the Season 3 episode "The New Rogues", the Flash team explore the multiverse in search of a [[Harrison Wells]] doppelganger to replace the Earth-2 version. They encounter four others from various Earths, two of which are named Earth-17 and Earth-19, from which their new recruit, Harrison "H.R." Wells, originates.

The television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' exists as another alternate universe separate from the main Arrowverse continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/02/supergirl-the-flash-crossover-official-in-march-1201695796/|title=Crossover Confirmed: 'The Flash' To Meet 'Supergirl' In March Episode|last=Lincoln|first=Ross A.|date=February 3, 2016|accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed in the ''Supergirl'' episode "[[Worlds Finest]]", when the Flash appears on Supergirl's universe and names heroes from his world (the Green Arrow, the Black Canary, the Atom, Firestorm) that Supergirl does not recognize. In addition, the Flash's allies Dr. Harrison Wells, Caitlin Snow, and Cisco Ramon do not exist in Supergirl's universe, and S.T.A.R. Labs was not founded due to Wells' absence. Barry Allen does note that they do share celebrities, such as singer [[Mariah Carey]] and writer [[Alexandre Dumas]], who wrote ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. Supergirl's universe is coined Earth-38 by Cisco Ramon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/24447-the-flash-supergirl-lives-earth-38-multiverse|title='The Flash' Just Announced That Supergirl Lives on Earth-38|publisher=Inverse|last=Francisco|first=Eric|date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent episodes from ''Legends of Tomorrow,'' ''Supergirl,'' and ''The Flash'' reveal that both Supergirl and Barry's universes also share the existences of the alien races of [[Thanagar]]ians and [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]].

The 2017 crossover event ''[[Crisis on Earth-X]]''- which sees the heroes from all four shows face an invasion from the titular 'Earth-X', as a world where the Nazis won [[World War II]]- establishes that there are 52 known alternate Earths, with the titular 'Earth-X' being the fifty-third Earth, described by Harrison "Harry" Wells of Earth-2, that those who aware of the multiverse as being so dark and horrific that no interdimensional traveler would dare to journey there. Its history is basically the same as Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-38's, except the outcomes of World War II and [[Adolf Hitler]] continued his reign worldwide until his death in 1994. Its inhabitants include counterparts of people from these Earths as well, including Oliver Queen's doppelgänger, who is Hitler's successor as Führer and the villainous archer the Dark Arrow.

=== ''Teen Titans'' ===
{{Main|Teen Titans}}

Issue #48 introduces its own multiverse. Each world pays references to various incarnation of the [[Teen Titans]]. The worlds shown are:

* The majority of the story is set on a world which is menaced by the Teen Tyrants (evil Teen Titans), and is defended by the Brotherhood of Justice (heroic versions of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]). Similar to [[Crime Syndicate of America|Earth-3]].
* Malchior's (from the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' episode "Spellbound") homeworld.
* A world similar to the past from the ''Teen Titans'' episode "[[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] the Barbarian".
* A world containing the teen [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]].
* A world consisting of the animalistic Teen Titans (from the ''Teen Titans'' episode "Bunny [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]").

== Parodies ==
* [[Bongo Comics]] published a comic book series featuring characters from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''Futurama'' titled ''Futurama/Simpsons Infinitely Secret Crossover Crisis''. One of the conventions of DC's Multiverse that the series parodies is the existence of one universe's characters as fictional comic book characters in another.
* [[IDW Publishing|IDW]]'s ''Super Secret Crisis War!'', parodies DC's ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s ''[[Secret Wars|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]'' in their logo as this is a major crossover event featuring several characters and their worlds from their [[Cartoon Network]]-based publications.

'''Narrative art''' is [[art]] that tells a [[narrative|story]], either as a moment in an ongoing story or as a sequence of events unfolding over time. Some of the earliest evidence of human art suggests that people told stories with pictures. 

Although there are some common features to all narrative art, different cultures have developed idiosyncratic ways to discern narrative action from pictures. Prior to the advent of literacy most narrative art was done in a simultaneous narrative style with very little overarching organization. Once literacy developed in different parts of the world pictures began to be organized along register lines, like lines on a page, that helped define the direction of the narrative.  This method of linking scenes together led to other ways of telling stories in the 20th century, namely the [[newspaper]], [[comic strip]]s and [[comic book]]s.

In painting in traditional [[Western art]] since the [[Renaissance]], the concept of [[history painting]] covers most narrative scenes.

== History ==
Though it requires sophisticated conventions to make the narrative clear, narrative art occurs very early in the [[history of art]].  A number of reliefs in the [[European Bronze Age]] [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]] show monscenic narratives of hunting or battle, the former sometimes indicating the movements of hunter or prey with indications of their tracks in a way similar to modern diagrammatic illustrations.  One of the earliest works of [[Ancient Egyptian art]] is the [[Narmer Palette]] relief in the [[Louvre Museum]], which shows a victory of King [[Narmer]] (c. 31st century BC) in several scenes.

Narrative art was employed extensively in the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]]. Most significantly, the walls of the major Assyrian royal palaces (the Northwest Palace of [[Assurnasirpal II]] at [[Nimrud]],&lt;ref&gt;Budge, E.A.W. 1914. ''Assyrian Sculptures in the British Museum: Reign of Ashur-nasir-pal, 885-860 BC''. London: British Museum.
&lt;/ref&gt; the Central Palace of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] at Nimrud,&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Richard D. &amp; Falkner, M. 1960. ''Assyrian Palace Reliefs and Their Influence on the Sculptures of Babylonia and Persia''. London: Batchworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the Palace of [[Sargon II]] at [[Khorsabad]],&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Albenda 1986. ''The palace of Sargon king of Assyria: monumental wall reliefs at Dur-Sharrukin, from original drawings made at the time of their discovery in 1843-1844 by Botta and Flandin''. Paris: Éditions Recherche sur les civilisations.&lt;/ref&gt; the Southwest Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at [[Nineveh]],&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Richard D.; Bleibtreu, Erika; Turner, G. 1998. ''Sculptures from the Southwest Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh''. London: British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and the North Palace of [[Assurbanipal]] at Nineveh&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. Barnett 1976. ''Sculptures from the north palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh (668-627 BC).'' London : British Museum Publications Ltd. for the Trustees of the British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;) were lined orthostats sculpted in low relief with scenes depicting the activitives of the king (hunting, battle, and ritual). Sometimes, scenes were also depicted on glazed bricks or wall paintings (e.g. at [[Til Barsip]]). Bronze bands decorating the doors of Assyrian temples and palaces were also sometimes decorated with scenes of the king's activities in narrative style. The most famous of these are the "[[Balawat Gates]]" commissioned by [[Shalmaneser III]] for his palace at [[Balawat]] (ancient Imgur-Enlil);&lt;ref&gt;King, L.W. 1915. ''Bronze Reliefs from the Gates of Shalmaneser, King of Assyria BC 860-825''. London: Trustees of the British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schachner, Andreas 2007. ''Bilder eines Weltreichs: kunst- und kulturgeschichtliche Untersuchungen zu den Verzierungen eines Tores aus Balawat (Imgur-Enlil) aus der Zeit von Salmanassar III, König von Assyrien''. Turnhout: Brepols.&lt;/ref&gt; additional fragmentary bronze gate bands dating to Assurnasirpal II have been found at Balawat,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, John &amp; Tallis, Nigel 2008. ''The Balawat Gates of Ashurnasirpal II''. London: British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and very poorly preserved fragments from other sites, such as Khorsabad, Nimrud, [[Assur]], and Tell Hadad.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick, Eleanor 2008. “Bronze reliefs from Khorsabad,” in Biggs, R.D., Myers, J. and Roth, M. (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale Held at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, July 18–22, 2005''. Chicago: University of Chicago, pp. 389-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lives of [[Jesus]] and [[Buddha]], the founders of new religions, their followers, and in the case of Buddha also the [[Jataka|former lives]], were to provide new subject-matter for narrative art, as did elements of older religions such as the [[Labours of Hercules]]. [[Trajan's Column]] is an exceptional example of Imperial Roman narrative art.  In [[Christian art]] the [[Life of Christ in art]] and [[Life of the Virgin]] supplied the most common subjects, based around the incidents celebrated in the major feasts of the [[church calendar]], but the lives of saints gave many others. 

[[Book illustration]]s are found from ancient times in several cultures, and are very often narrative in nature. There appear to have been some lavishly illustrated books in Western [[Late Antiquity]], no doubt belonging to wealthy collectors, including both classic literary texts ([[Vergilius Vaticanus]] and [[Vergilius Romanus]]) and [[Bible|biblical]] texts; the [[Quedlinburg Itala fragment]] seems to have had between two and four images facing every text page, and to have been more densely illustrated than any subsequent biblical text in an [[illuminated manuscript]].

Narratives occur in a space and unfold in time. In narrative art, the artist chooses how to portray the story, represent the space, and how to shape time within the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative art can be categorized into various types, also known as modes or styles.  A piece of artwork is not limited to only one type of narrative.  An artwork may have a narrative type as a whole, as well as portions of the artwork itself that depict separate types of narratives. Several of these types are covered below.  A depicted action in itself can suggest a scene or setting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can imagine the Trojan War taking place at Troy without having to depict the actual city of Troy. You can show Achilles dragging Hector’s body around the city of Troy without having to depict the walls of the city. Nonetheless, the idea that each action is limited to a specific place can still pertain, because the Trojan War did take place at Troy and Achilles did drag Hector’s body around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Penny Small  1999, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Simultaneous narrative ==
A simultaneous narrative is a type of narrative that has very little visually discernible organization to those who are not acquainted with its purpose.  It can focus on geometric or abstract designs as well as the placement or arrangement of items within the artwork.  Simultaneous narratives concentrate on repeatable patterns and redundant systems with a focus on dualities.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation of a simultaneous narrative is dependent on the reason for its creation or its creator because this  would convey who would be able to interpret it as it was meant to be.

This type of narrative is common in cultures that are oral in nature rather than literate. This is because simultaneous narratives require human agency in order to be understood as originally intended.  This is common in illiterate societies because of a lack of ways to transpire information from one generation to another without a written language. Thus simple patterns and dualities are used because they can be easily remembered and referenced to by those for whom the piece of art is meant.

== Monoscenic narrative ==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2012}}
A monoscenic narrative is a type of narrative that represents a single scene. There is no repetition of characters and there is only one action taking place.  The scene is one that is easily identifiable in context of the narrative and is of significant importance.

Under this definition, most art that is usually not considered a narrative would fit under the monoscenic narrative type. Narrative art is art that tells a story, either as a moment in an ongoing story or as a sequence of events unfolding over time. This in retrospect makes a good portion of art narrative art. Landscapes and portraits however do not meet the criteria of the definition provided, though they might be, depending on the artist’s intention.

===Achilles kills Penthesilea (amphora) by Exekias===
Exekias was an ancient Greek vase-painter and potter. A good portion of his vase work included scenes from Greek mythology. He was known for his ability to capture the most critical points of a story and illustrate them into one simple scene. The amphora portraying Achilles killing Penthesilea is such an example.

This monoscenic narrative illustrated on this amphora exemplifies a vital part of the Trojan saga. It is the moment in which Achilles and Penthesilea fall in love. In the heat of battle, Achilles battles Penthesilea and with a fatal blow, causes her helmet to be pushed back. When their eyes meet, it is said that they fall in love. This is ruined by Achilles’ inability to control his bloodlust.  Due to this tragedy, Achilles refuses to fight and from this many consequences arise that eventually could be linked to his demise.

===British art tradition===
A line of development of narrative art begins with [[William Hogarth]], the English painter. His monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in a narrative were taken up in the 19th century by other British painters. The Victorian terms applied to this style were "subject painting" or "anecdotic" painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela M. Fletcher|title=Narrating Modernity: The British Problem Picture, 1895-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvT_0aOkOSkC&amp;pg=PA146|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3568-0|page=146 note 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuous narrative ==
[[File:Relief Kolumna Trajana.jpg|left|thumb|150px| [[Trajan's Column]] is an example of a continuous narrative]]
A continuous narrative is a type of narrative that illustrates multiple scenes of a narrative within a single frame. Multiple actions and scenes are portrayed in a single visual field without any dividers. The sequence of events within the narrative is defined through the reuse of the main character or characters.  It emphasizes the change in movement and state of the repeating characters as indicators of scene or phase changes in the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Column of Trajan ===
The Column of Trajan depicts one event:  the Dacian Wars. This continuous narrative can be broken down into a series of events. These events flow from one scene to another without any physical indicators such as vertical lines. Because of how the narrative is read, from standing in front of the column, it seems to ebb right to left and then left to right which is common in continuous narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Penny Small  1999, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative becomes rather hard to read as the column gets higher.  Research suggests that the column was originally planned to be read while walking a circular staircase around the column itself .&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Penny Small  1999, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt; The story then would not ebb and continue on in a sequential manner.

=== Bayeux Tapestry ===
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|thumb|Section of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]
The '[[Bayeux Tapestry]]' (a misnomer as it is really an [[embroidery]] not a [[tapestry]]) tells the story of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of England in 1066. The theme of the Bayeux Tapestry is treason and deception.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell 1966, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative reflects a partisan Norman view of the events of the conquest of England.  Though the tapestry seems to be framed because it is separated by registers, horizontal lines, it is still a continuous narrative.  Registers are needed in order to separate a story to fit within a certain area.  If cut up and placed next to each other, a continuous narrative would exist.  A continuous narrative does not have any separation between scenes and actions.

== Synoptic narrative ==
A synoptic narrative depicts a single scene in which a character or characters are portrayed multiple times within a frame to convey that multiple actions are taking place.  This causes the sequence of events to be unclear within the narrative.  Synoptic narratives typically provide visual cues that convey the sequence, but still might be difficult to decipher for those unfamiliar with the story.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaddanta Jataja, Amaravati ===
An instance of a synoptic narrative is one represented in a medallion from the stupa at Amaravati.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; It, like many synoptic narratives,  can be difficult to interpret.  The medallion is meant to present the reader with the story of Buddha’s previous birth as the elephant Chaddanta.  The center of the medallion has only decorative carving, which is a visual cue on how the medallion is meant to be interpreted; which is in a circular pattern.  Other than that subtle visual cue the artist leaves very little indication of the order.

[[File:Chaddanta Jataja Amaravati.jpg|thumb|300px| Illustrates how the medallion is meant to be read.]]
The medallion can be separated into 3 episodes:
*  1 - Chaddanta presents his chief queen with lotus.
* 2 - Junior queen in offended.
* 3 – She, the junior queen, leaves to be on her own.
* 4 – She lays dying, hoping for revenge.
* 5 – A hunter aims an arrow at Chaddanta.
* 6 – The hunter saws off Chaddanta’s tusks.
* 7- The hunter is seen departing with the tusks. (This isn’t numbered but is at the very top center)&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panoptic narrative ==
[[File:006MAD Frieze.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the north frieze of the [[Siphnian Treasury]] at [[Delphi]]]]
A panoramic narrative is a narrative that depicts multiple scenes and actions without the repetition of characters.  Actions may be in a sequence or represent simultaneous actions during an event.

=== Siphnian Treasury North Frieze ===
The [[Siphnian Treasury]] at [[Delphi]] has four marble [[frieze]]s, one for each cardinal direction. These four friezes depict panoramic narratives through the use of carvings of the marble. The north frieze is an illustration of a battle between the Olympic gods and the giants. In the far left two giants attack Zeus in his chariot, who is no longer visible due to deterioration. [[Hera]] is seen finishing off a giant to the right of [[Zeus]] with [[Athena]] behind her (further right) fighting two giants. To the right of Athena is her brother [[Ares]] who is fighting two other giants with one already dead at his feet. There are multiple narratives taking place with each combatant in varying scenes. The dead giant at Ares' feet was downed by Athena but Ares is depicted as moving forward in the narrative by stepping over the corpse.&lt;ref&gt;Petrakos 1977, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progressive narrative ==
[[File:Toepffer Cryptogame 13.png|right|thumb|A page by [[Rodolphe Töpffer]]]] 
A progressive narrative portrays a single scene in which characters do not repeat. However, multiple actions are taking place in order to convey a passing of time in the narrative. A progressive narrative is not to be interpreted as a group of simultaneous events but rather a sequence that is dependent on its location.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Penny Small  1999, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;  Actions displayed by characters in the narratives compact present and future action into a single image.

== Sequential narrative ==
A sequential narrative is very much like a continuous narrative with one major difference. A sequential narrative focuses on enframement to develop temporal progression.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; Each scene and action is represented within its frame as a unit. Each frame is a particular scene during a particular moment.  A sequential narrative is the type of narrative generally used in [[comic]]s and [[manga]].

[[File:GUGG Still Life Flowers.jpg | thumb]]
'''''Still Life: Flowers''''' ('''''Nature morte: fleurs''''') is an oil on canvas by Pierre Auguste Renoir in the Thannhauser Collection at the Guggenheim Museum, New York.    

This 1885 painting is similar to ''Still Life: Flowers and Prickly Pears'' believed to be painted a year earlier, but Renoir did not include the fruit and table cloth, plus was more restrained in the color. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Vivian Edicott|last2=Krens|first2=Thomas|title=Guggenheim Museum Thannhauser Collection|publisher=The Solomon R.

Published posthumously in France, develops an original concept of “[[criticism of translation]]” and a methodology to anchor the practice of this criticism. The work of translation is a critical process as well as a creative one. Moving away from nonsystematic evaluative approaches that focus on the shortcomings of translations or the normative approaches that study the cultural and literary systems into which the translations are inserted, Berman applies the notion of [[ethics]] he developed in his earlier works, calling for a translation that is nonethnocentric and stipulating that the creativity required by translation be focused on the re-creation of the original in the other language without being over-determined by the personal poetics of the writer-translator.&lt;ref name="kenney"/&gt;

The book is divided into two parts, each focused on one element of the ethics of translation: theory (reflection) and practice (experience). In the first part Berman presents what he calls a general “productive criticism,” while in the second part he applies the general theoretical principles of this criticism to the analysis of the translations of [[John Donne]]’s work into French and Spanish.&lt;ref name="kenney"/&gt;

This book has been influential in the field of [[translation studies]] in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erudit.org/revue/ttr/2001/v14/n2/000575ar.pdf ''L’impact d’Antoine Berman sur la traductologie en Amérique latine : une enquête''], par Georges L.

A '''stamp catalog''' (or '''stamp catalogue''') is a catalog of [[postage stamp]] types with descriptions and prices.

The stamp catalog is an essential tool of [[philately]] and [[stamp collecting]]. Stamp catalogs are part of [[philatelic literature]].

== History ==
The first stamp catalog was published in France by [[Oscar Berger-Levrault]] on 17 September 1861 and the first illustrated catalog by [[Alfred Potiquet]] in December 1861 (based on the earlier work).

The first catalogs in Great Britain were published in 1862 by [[Frederick Booty]],&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;Phillips, Stanley. ''Stamp Collecting: A guide to modern philately'', revised edition, Stanley Gibbons, London, 1983, p.243. {{ISBN|0-85259-047-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Brown (philatelist)|Mount Brown]],&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt; and Dr. [[John Edward Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5YDAAAAQAAJ&amp;ots=fXq6jrKBT0&amp;dq=A%20hand%20catalogue%20of%20postage%20stamps&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  John Edward Gray, ''A hand catalogue of postage stamps for the use of collectors,'' London, Robert Hardwicke, 1862]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Early Postage Stamp Catalogs" by George B. Sloane in ''Stamps'', 13 July 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The first in the United States was ''The Stamp Collector's Manual'' by A.C. Kline (a pseudonym for John William Kline), also 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Trenchard and George T. Turner, "John William Kline America's First Philatelic Author", in ''Philatelic Literature Review'', Vol. 42, No. 1, pp. 24-41, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally catalogs were just [[Stamp dealer|dealer]]s' price lists, though today that is less common.  The catalogs of some major publishers continue to serve as an official price list for the publisher.  For example, Stanley Gibbons in the United Kingdom specifically states in the catalog that the price listed is the estimated selling price by Stanley Gibbons Ltd.  On the other had, Scott in the United States does not sell stamps.  Rather, the Scott catalog serves as a reference document for expected prices used by buyers and sellers.  Over time, as [[philately]] developed, catalogs tended to accumulate additional supporting details about the stamps, such as dates of issue, color variations, and so forth. As their use by collectors became widespread, the catalogs came to define what was and was not a legitimate stamp, since many collectors would avoid stamps not described in the catalog. In recent years, the [[Internet]] has become a common resource for information about stamps. Some catalogs have an on-line version while others are available only on-line.

== Current catalogs ==
The following catalogs have a worldwide coverage:
*[[Michel catalog|Michel]] - printed, software and online
*[[Scott catalog|Scott]] - printed, pdf-format and online
*[[Stanley Gibbons#Stamp catalogues|Stanley Gibbons]] - printed and online
*[[Yvert et Tellier]] - printed only

These are large undertakings, since there are thousands of new stamps to describe each year, and the prices of all stamps may go up or down. For publishers that are not dealers, the prices are estimated by data from dealers and auctions.

In addition, the catalog publishers usually put out specialized volumes with additional details, generally by nationality: Michel has a specialized German catalog, Scott a specialized US catalog, and so forth.

Many countries have their own "national catalogs", typically put out by a leading publisher or dealer in that country. Postal administrations may themselves put out catalogs, although they tend to be aimed at less-experienced collectors, and rarely provide fully detailed stamp data. Some notable country catalogs include:

*ABDA (Philippines)
*Aerophil (Switzerland)
*[[AFA catalog|AFA]] (Denmark)

{{about|the literary device|the prewriting technique|Free writing}}

In [[literary criticism]], '''stream of consciousness''' is a [[narrative mode]] or method that attempts to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. (Harmondsworth, Penguin Books,1984), pp. 660-1).&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[William James]] in 1890 in his ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', and in 1918 the novelist [[May Sinclair]] (1863–1946) first applied the term stream of consciousness, in a literary context, when discussing [[Dorothy Richardson]]'s (1873–1957) novels. ''[[Pointed Roofs]]'' (1915), the first work in Richardson's [[novel sequence|series]] of 13 semi-autobiographical novels titled ''[[Pilgrimage (novel sequence)|Pilgrimage]]'',&lt;ref name="Winning2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEz_3E-SnA0C|title=The Pilgrimage of Dorothy Richardson|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-299-17034-9|author=Joanne Winning}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first complete stream of consciousness novel published in English. However, in 1934, Richardson comments that "[[Proust]], [[James Joyce]], [[Virginia Woolf]] &amp; D.R. ... were all using 'the new method', though very differently, simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to the bookseller and publisher [[Sylvia Beach]] ''Windows of Modernism: Selected Letters of Dorothy Richardson, ed. Gloria G. Fromm Athens, Georgia, University of Georgia Press, 1995, 282.&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, many earlier precursors and the technique is still used by contemporary writers.

==Definition==
Stream of consciousness is a [[narrative device]] that attempts to give the written equivalent of the character's [[thought process]]es, either in a loose interior monologue (see below), or in connection to his or her actions.  Stream of consciousness writing is usually regarded as a special form of interior monologue and is characterized by associative leaps in thought and lack of some or all punctuation.&lt;ref&gt;For example, both [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]] and [[James Joyce|Joyce]] omitted full stops and paragraph breaks, but while Joyce also omitted apostrophes, Beckett left them in.&lt;/ref&gt; Stream of consciousness and interior monologue are distinguished from [[dramatic monologue]] and [[soliloquy]], where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person, which are chiefly used in [[poetry]] or [[drama]]. In stream of consciousness the speaker's thought processes are more often depicted as overheard in the mind (or addressed to oneself); it is primarily a [[fictional device]].
The term "stream of consciousness" was coined by [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]] [[William James]] in  ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890):
{{quote|consciousness, then, does not appear to itself as chopped up in bits ... it is nothing joined; it flows. A 'river' or a 'stream' are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described. {{em|In talking of it hereafter, let's call it the stream of thought, consciousness, or subjective life.}}&lt;ref&gt;(I, pp.239-43) quoted in Randall Stevenson, ''Modernist Fiction: An Introduction''. (Lexington, Kentucky: University of Kentucky, 1992), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:UlyssesCover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (first edition, 1922), considered a prime example of stream of consciousness writing styles.]]
In the following example of stream of consciousness from James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Molly seeks sleep:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office the alarmlock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so that I can get up early &lt;ref&gt;Joyce p. 642 (Bodley Head edition (1960), p. 930).&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interior monologue==
{{See also|Internal monologue}}

While many sources use the terms stream of consciousness and interior monologue as synonyms, the ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'' suggests, that "they can also be distinguished psychologically and literarily. In a psychological sense, stream of consciousness is the subject‐matter, while interior monologue is the technique for presenting it". And for literature, "while an interior monologue always presents a character's thoughts 'directly', without the apparent intervention of a summarizing and selecting narrator, it does not necessarily mingle them with impressions and perceptions, nor does it necessarily violate the norms of grammar, or logic- but the stream‐of‐consciousness technique also does one or both of these things."&lt;ref&gt;ed. Chris Baldick, Oxford: Oxford U.P.,  2009, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', while agreeing that these terms are "often used interchangeably", suggests, that "while an interior monologue may mirror all the half thoughts, impressions, and associations that impinge upon the character's consciousness, it may also be restricted to an organized presentation of that character's rational thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/290310/interior-monologue "interior monologue." ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 24 Sep. 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Beginnings to 1900===
While the use of the narrative technique of stream of consciousness is usually associated with modernist novelists in the first part of the twentieth-century, a number of precursors have been suggested, including [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[psychological novel]] ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' (1757).&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984), p. 661; see also Robert Humphrey, ''Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel'' (1954). University of California Press, 1972, fn. 13, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" (1843) foreshadows this literary technique in the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1785800/The-Tell-Tale-Heart|title=The Tell-Tale Heart - story by Poe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's story is a [[first person narrative]], told by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of his sanity, while describing a murder he committed. and it is often read as a [[dramatic monologue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eapoe.org/index.htm|title=Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore - The Life and Writings of Edgar Allan Poe|website=www.eapoe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; George R. Clay notes that [[Leo Tolstoy]] "when the occasion requires it ... applies Modernist stream of consciousness technique" in both ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1869) and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' (1878).&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy'', edited Donna Tussing Orwin. Cambridge University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
The short story "[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]" (1890) by another American author, [[Ambrose Bierce]], also  abandons strict linear time to record the internal consciousness of the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Khanom, Afruza. "Silence as Literary Device in Ambrose Bierce's 'The Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.' ''Teaching American Literature: A Journal of Theory and Practice.'' Spring 6.1 (2013): 45-52. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his renunciation of chronology in favor of free association, [[Édouard Dujardin]]'s ''[[Les Lauriers sont coupés]]'' (1887) is also an important precursor. Indeed, [[James Joyce]] "picked up a copy of Dujardin's novel ... in Paris in 1903" and "acknowledged a certain borrowing from it".&lt;ref&gt;Randell StevensonJ ''Modernist Fiction''. Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992, p. 227, fn 14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also those who point to [[Anton Chekhov]]'s short stories and plays (1881-1904)&lt;ref&gt;James Wood, "Ramblings". ''London Review of Books''. Vol.22, no. 11, 1 June 2000, pp. 36-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Knut Hamsun]]'s ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]'' (1890), and ''[[Mysteries (novel)|Mysteries]]'' (1892) as offering glimpses of the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative technique at the end of the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n23/wood02_.html James Wood. "Addicted to Unpredictability." November 26, 1998. ''London Review of Books''. November 8, 2008 ]&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Hunger'' is widely seen as a classic of world literature and a groundbreaking modernist novel, ''Mysteries'' is also considered a pioneer work. It has been claimed that Hamsun was way ahead of his time with the use of stream of consciousness in two chapters in particular of this novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamsunsenteret.no/en/component/author/page/107-hamsun's-modernism|title=Martin Humpál: Hamsun’s modernism - Hamsunsenteret - Hamsunsenteret|website=hamsunsenteret.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;[https://tv.nrk.no/serie/guddommelig-galskap-knut-hamsun/PRTR64006207/13-12-2009#t=19m59s Interview with Robert Ferguson in the second episode of the documentary television series ''Guddommelig galskap - Knut Hamsun'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; British author Robert Ferguson said: “There’s a lot of dreamlike aspects of ''Mysteries''. In that book ... it is ... two chapters, where he actually invents stream of consciousness writing, in the early 1890s. This was long before Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.” &lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; [[Henry James]] has also been suggested as a significant precursor, in a work as early as ''[[Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1881).&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1999), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that he influenced later stream of consciousness writers, including [[Virginia Woolf]], who not only read some of his novels but also wrote essays about them.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (March 2003)''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pn9OzR4AYdsC&amp;pg=PA40 A Writer's Diary: Being Extracts from the Diary of Virginia Woolf]''. Harcourt.  pp. 33, 39–40, 58, 86, 215, 301, 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has also been argued that [[Arthur Schnitzler]] (1862-1931), in his short story '"Leutnant Gustl" ("None but the Brave", 1900), was in fact the first to make full use of the stream of consciousness technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133295/stream-of-consciousness|title=stream of consciousness - literature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Twentieth century===
But it is only in the twentieth-century that this technique is fully developed by modernists. [[Marcel Proust]] is often presented as an early example of a writer using the stream of consciousness technique in his novel sequence ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]'' (1913–1927) (''In Search of Lost Time''), but Robert Humphrey comments, that Proust "is concerned only with the reminiscent aspect of consciousness" and, that he "was deliberately recapturing the past for the purpose of communicating; hence he did not write a stream-of consciousness novel".&lt;ref&gt;''Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel'' (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles: University of California, 1954), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[John Cowper Powys]] also argues that Proust did not use stream of consciousness: "while we are told what the hero thinks or what Swann thinks we are told this rather by the author than either by the 'I' of the story or by Charles Swann."&lt;ref&gt;"Proust". ''Enjoyment of Literature'', New York: Simon and Schuster, , p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;

Let us go then, you and I,
 When the evening is spread out against the sky
 Like a patient etherized upon a table;
 Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
 The muttering retreats
 Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
 And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
 Streets that follow like a tedious argument
 Of insidious intent
 To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
 Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"
 Let us go and make our visit.

 In the room the women come and go
 Talking of Michelangelo.
&lt;/poem&gt;|source =T. S. Eliot, "The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock"&lt;br /&gt;1915}}

The term was first applied in a literary context in ''The Egoist'', April 1918, by [[May Sinclair]], in relation to the early volumes of [[Dorothy Richardson]]'s [[novel sequence]] ''Pilgrimage''. Richardson, however,  describes the term as an 'lamentably ill-chosen metaphor".&lt;ref&gt;"Novels", ''Life and Letters'', 56, March 1948, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Joyce]] was a major pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness. Some hints of this technique, are already present in ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916), along with [[interior monologue]], and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Deming, p. 749.&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce began writing ''A Portrait'' in  1907 and it was first serialised in the English literary magazine ''[[The Egoist]]'' in 1914 and 1915. Earlier in 1906 Joyce, when working on ''Dubliners'', considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''Ulysses''. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Serial publication of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in the magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'' began in March 1918. ''Ulysses'' was finally published in 1922. While ''Ulysses'' represents a major example of the use of stream of consciousness Joyce also uses "authorial description" and Free Indirect Style to register Bloom's inner thoughts. Furthermore the novel does not focus solely on  interior experiences: "Bloom  is constantly shown ''from'' all round; from inside as well as out; from a variety of points of view which range from the objective to the subjective".&lt;ref&gt;Randell Stevenson. ''A Reader's Guidw to the Twentieth-Century Novel in Britain''. University of Kentucky Press, 1993, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In his final work ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939) Joyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in, which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns.

Another early example is the use of [[interior monologue]] by [[T. S. Eliot]] in his poem "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]" (1915), a [[dramatic monologue]] of an urban man, stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action,"&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Kathleen, and Harlan, Judith. ''English Literature From 1785'' (New York: HarperCollins, 1992), 265–66. {{ISBN|006467150X}}&lt;/ref&gt; a work probably influenced by the narrative poetry of [[Robert Browning]], including "[[Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister]]".&lt;ref&gt;William Harmon &amp; C. Holman, ''A Handbook to Literature'' (7th edition). (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1996), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1923 to 2000===

Prominent uses in the years that followed the publication of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'', include [[Italo Svevo]], ''[[Zeno's Conscience|La coscienza di Zeno]]'' (1923),&lt;ref&gt;[untitled review], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/478649 Beno Weiss, ''Italica'', Vol. 67, No. 3 (Autumn, 1990), p. 395.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Woolf]], ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' (1925), ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' (1927), and [[William Faulkner]] in ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929).&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Randell Stevenson suggests, that "interior monologue, rather than stream of consciousness, is the appropriate term for the style in which [subjective experience] is recorded, both in ''[[The Waves]]'' and in Woolf's writing generally.&lt;ref&gt;''Modernist Fiction''. Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992, p. 55; ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout ''Mrs Dalloway'' Woolf blurs the distinction between [[Direct speech|direct]] and [[indirect speech]], freely alternating her [[Narrative mode|mode of narration]] between [[Third-person omniscient|omniscient description]], [[free indirect discourse|indirect]] [[interior monologue]], and [[soliloquy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dowling |first=David |title=Mrs Dalloway: Mapping Streams of Consciousness |page=46 |year=1991 |publisher=Twayne Publishers |isbn=978-0-8057-9414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malcolm Lowry]]'s novel ''[[Under the Volcano]]'' (1947) resembles ''Ulysses'', "both in its concentration almost entirely within a single day of [Its protagonist] Firmin's life ... and in the range of interior monologues and stream of consciousness employed to represent the minds of [the] characters".&lt;ref&gt;Randall Stevenson, pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Beckett]], a friend of James Joyce, uses interior monologue in novels like [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951), ''Malone meurt'' (1951; ''[[Malone Dies]]'') and ''L'innommable'' (1953: ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]''). and the short story "[[From an Abandoned Work]]" (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Karine Germoni, '"From Joyce to Beckett: The Beckettian Dramatic Interior Monologue'". ''Journal of Beckett Studies'', Spring 2004, Vol. 13, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique continued to be used into the 1970s in a novel such as [[Robert Anton Wilson]]/[[Robert Shea]] collaborative ''[[Illuminatus!]]'' (1975),  with regard to which ''[[The Fortean Times]]'' warns readers, to "[b]e prepared for streams of consciousness in which not only identity but time and space no longer confine the narrative".&lt;ref&gt;''The Fortean Times'', issue 17 (August 1976), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish writer [[James Kelman]]'s novels are known for mixing stream of consciousness narrative with [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] vernacular. Examples include ''[[The Busconductor Hines]]'', ''[[A Disaffection]]'' and ''[[How Late It Was, How Late]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/minds-are-the-strangest-thing Giles Harvey, "Minds Are The Strangest Thing". ''The New Yorker'', May 20, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[Salman Rushdie]] one critic comments, that "[a]ll Rushdie's novels follow an Indian/Islamic storytelling style, a stream-of-consciousness narrative told by a loquacious young Indian man".&lt;ref&gt;John C. Hawley, ''Encyclopedia Of Postcolonial Studies'' (Westport: Greenwood, 2001), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers who use this narrative device include [[Sylvia Plath]] in ''[[The Bell Jar]]'' (1963)&lt;ref&gt;''American Literature'', Vol. 65, No. 2, Jun. 1993, 
p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Irvine Welsh]] in ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Keating, "Tales from the Other Side of the Track". ''Irish Times'' 3 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of consciousness continues to appear in contemporary literature. [[Dave Eggers]], author of ''[[A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius]]'' (2000), according to one reviewer, "talks much as he writes – a forceful stream of consciousness, thoughts sprouting in all directions".&lt;ref&gt;"The agony and the irony", Stephanie Merritt. ''The Observer'', Sunday 14 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist John Banville describes [[Roberto Bolaño]]'s novel ''[[Amulet (novel)|Amulet]]'' (1999), as written in "a fevered stream of consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;"Amulet by Roberto Bolaño", John Banville. ''The Guardian'', Saturday 12 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century=== 
The twenty-first century brought further exploration, including [[Jonathan Safran Foer]]'s ''[[Everything is Illuminated]]'' (2002) and many of the short stories of American author [[Brendan Connell]].&lt;ref&gt;"A nine-year-old and 9/11", Tim Adams
''The Observer'', Sunday 29 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Connell, ''The Life of Polycrates and Other Stories for Antiquated Children''. Chomu Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The History of Middle-earth''''' is a 12-volume series of books published between 1983 and 1996 that collect and analyse material relating to the fiction of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], compiled and edited by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The series shows the development over time of Tolkien's conception of [[Middle-earth]] as a fictional place with its own peoples, [[languages invented by Tolkien|languages]], and history, from his earliest notions of a "mythology for England" through to the development of the stories that make up ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It is not a "history of Middle-earth" in the sense of being a chronicle of events in Middle-earth written from an in-universe perspective; it is instead an out-of-universe history of Tolkien's creative process. In 2000–01, the twelve volumes were republished in three limited edition omnibus volumes. Non-deluxe editions of the three volumes were published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/gallery.php?subsection=81 |title=The History of Middle-earth |website=An Illustrated Tolkien Bibliography |publisher=TolkienBooks.net |date=2014 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Some of the content consists of earlier versions of already published works, while other portions are new material. These books are extremely detailed, often analysing a scrap of paper to provide the full evolution of two or even three different versions of a passage that were rewritten over each other. Despite the great amount of material in the twelve volumes, numerous unpublished texts are still known to exist in the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] and [[Marquette University]] libraries, and in other papers held by individuals or organizations, such as the [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]].

The first five books track the early history of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and related texts.  Books six to nine discuss the development of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; book nine also discusses the [[Númenor]] story in the form of [[The Notion Club Papers]]. Books ten and eleven focus on material from the ''Silmarillion'' that Tolkien worked on after ''The Lord of the Rings'' was published, including the ''Annals of [[Beleriand]]'' and the ''[[Annals of Aman]]''. Book twelve discusses the development of the Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'' and examines assorted writings from the last years of Tolkien's life.

Christopher Tolkien made the decision not to include any material related to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in ''The History of Middle-earth'' because it was not originally intended to form part of [[Tolkien's legendarium|the mythology]], but was a children's story and originally not set in Middle-earth, but was revised during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' was published separately, in two volumes, in 2007 and was  edited by [[John D. Rateliff]]

'''''The Icebergs''''' is an 1861 oil painting by American painter [[Frederic Edwin Church]]. It was inspired by his 1859 voyage to the [[North Atlantic]] around [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Considered one of Church's "Great Pictures"—measuring {{convert|1.64|x|2.85|m|ft|abbr=off}}&lt;ref name="dma"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Icebergs |url=https://collections.dma.org/artwork/4171219 |publisher=Dallas Museum of Art |accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the painting depicts one or more [[iceberg]]s in the afternoon light of the [[Arctic]]. It was first displayed in New York City in 1861, where visitors paid 25 cents' admittance to the one-painting show. Similar exhibitions in Boston and London followed. The unconventional landscape of ice, water, and sky generally drew praise, but the [[American Civil War]], which began the same year, lessened critical and popular interest in New York City's artistic happenings. 

The painting became popular within Church's oeuvre and inspired other landscape artists' interest in the Arctic, but its apparent lack of narrative or allegory perplexed some viewers. Between exhibitions in the US and England, Church added the ship mast, providing some sign of life, and retitled the work from its original ''The North''. He eventually sold the painting in England, where it disappeared from the art-world's awareness after the buyer's death in 1901. In 1979, the painting, which a number of New York City galleries were now hunting, was rediscovered in a home in [[Manchester]], England, where it had remained for most of the intervening 78 years. It was soon put to auction in New York City, drawing significant interest as its sale coincided with renewed critical interest in Church, who had been largely forgotten in the 20th century. ''The Icebergs'' was auctioned for US$2.5 million, the most of any American painting to that point. The buyers, later identified as businessman [[Lamar Hunt]] and his wife Norma, donated the canvas to the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], where it remains today.

==Background==

[[File:Frederic Edwin Church - final study for The Icebergs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|In Church's final study for the painting, a stranded ship appears in place of the boulder. In the original version of the finished painting, no portion of a ship appeared at all, reducing the narrative possibilities of the picture.{{sfn|Raab|2015|p=119}}{{refn|group=note|In December 2013 the study, which measures 10 x 18 1/8 inches, was auctioned by [[Sotheby's]] New York for $905,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frederic Edwin Church, 1826 – 1900: ''FINAL STUDY FOR THE ICEBERGS'' |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/american-art-n09048/lot.13.html |publisher=[[Sotheby's]] |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}]]

Church painted ''The Icebergs'' at a time of general interest in [[Arctic exploration]]. The disappearance of the expedition of British explorer [[John Franklin]], who planned to navigate the [[Northwest Passage]], had been a popular press topic for years. In 1856 the American explorer [[Elisha Kane]] published an account of his own expedition to locate Franklin's. [[Francis Leopold McClintock]] finally uncovered [[Franklin's lost expedition|the fate of Franklin and his crew]], which he described in an 1859 book. Church too was interested in the Arctic, and in science and geography. He was a member of the [[American Geographical Society|American Geographical and Statistical Society]], where the Arctic explorer and friend of Church [[Isaac Israel Hayes]] had lectured, and in 1859 journeyed to the Arctic himself.{{sfn|Howat|Church|2005|p=91}}{{refn|group=note|Hayes named an Arctic peak at the [[Kennedy Channel]] after Church in the summer of 1861. Church's Peak is still so-named and has an elevation of {{conv|2540|ft}}. Its coordinates are {{Coord|81|16|N|65|35|W}}.{{sfn|Howat|Church|2005|p=120}}}} As Church scholar David C. Huntington wrote, "By going north in 1859 Church was both following and leading the public mind.... Church had a democratic genius for embodying the archetype of the immediate and immediately present. His artistic hand responded to the moment's aggregate curiosity."{{sfn|Huntington|1966|p=84}}

In June 1859 Church, accompanied by his friend Louis Legrand Noble, took a steamship from [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]]. For about a month they traveled, in the area of [[Cape Race]] and along the [[Avalon Peninsula]].{{sfn|Howat|Church|2005|p=92}} They chartered a schooner to approach the [[sea ice]], and Church used a rowboat to get close to the [[iceberg]]s, making sketches in pencil and oil while enduring sea-sickness. He produced about one hundred sketches, ranging from small studies in pencil to full renderings of sky, sea, and ice in oils. Returning to New York, he painted ''[[Twilight in the Wilderness]]'' (1860) before committing to ''The Icebergs'', which took about six months, in the winter of 1860.&lt;ref name="dma"/&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=46 ''ff''}} By then Church was at the height of his fame, and newspapers regularly updated the public on the progress of the painting.{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|pp=88–90}} Noble documented their voyage in his book ''After Icebergs with a Painter'', which was published to coincide with the exhibition of ''The Icebergs''.

Church produced a number of advanced studies as he searched for the most favorable composition, relying on intuition. A landscape depicting just ice, water, and sky was unconventional and its composition a "hazardous experiment", wrote contemporary art historian Henry Tuckerman, with "little scope for general effect" Church told his agent that he was pleased with the canvas as he neared completion.{{sfn|Carr|1980|p=72}}

Shortly before the first exhibition, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began. Church decided to call the painting ''The North'', a title with a double meaning: a picture of the Arctic and a patriotic reference to the northern [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Advertisements for the exhibition noted that the admission proceeds would be donated to the Patriotic Fund, which supported Union soldiers' families.

==Description==
[[File:The Iceberg (Church) ad.png|thumb|[[Broadside]] for ''The North'', Boston, 1862]]

The painting is one of Church's composite views, like his popular ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'' (1859), in which he combined elements from many sketches with his imagination to convey the essential character of the setting.{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=57}} This approach to landscape painting accorded with the aesthetic ideas of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], the popular naturalist and science writer, and [[John Ruskin]], the famous English art critic. The challenge to the painter was to make a grand landscape from an environment so limited in form, color, and living things. American art historian Gerald L. Carr writes, "By standards of its day, the composition was virtually abstract. Much was left to the imagination."{{sfn|Carr|1980|p=83}}
 
A [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] was prepared for the edification of exhibition visitors, which described the scene in largely objective terms. Given its lack of figurative language, it may have been written by Church himself, as opposed to Louis LeGrand Noble, for example, who wrote effusively about ''The Heart of the Andes''.{{sfn|Raab|2015|p=99}} Orienting the viewer to this icy, unfamiliar landscape, the broadside begins:

{{quote|The spectator is supposed to be standing on the ice, in a bay of the berg. The several masses are parts of one immense berg. Imagine an amphitheatre, upon the lower steps of which you stand, and see the icy foreground at your feet, and gaze upon the surrounding masses, all uniting in one beneath the surface of the sea. To the left is overhanging, precipitous ice; to the right is a part of the upper surface of the berg. To that succeeds an inner gorge, running up between Alpine peaks. In front is the main portion of the berg, exhibiting ice-architecture in its vaster proportions. Thus the beholder has around him the manifold forms of the huge Greenland glacier after it has been launched upon the deep, and subjected, for a time, to the action of the elements—waves and currents, sunshine and storm.{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=30}}}}

The play of light is highly detailed, with the sun somewhere at left casting shadows in blues, purples, and pinks, and the ice and water interacting in complex reflections, especially by the grotto. The viewer's eye is less likely to move vertically, from foreground to background, as it would in most landscape paintings, than to zig-zag. The likely starting point, the ship's mast, seems to point to the boulder and grotto at right, which in turn is oriented toward the large iceberg dominating the background. The boulder and ice around the grotto are painted with [[impasto]], while Church otherwise conceals his brushstrokes. This relatively turbulent area with its variety of color creates a "material play between surface and depth", according to art historian Jennifer Raab.{{sfn|Raab|2015|pp=109–110, 114}}

A boulder rests on the shelf at right and stains the ice a rust color above the grotto. It is a reminder that the iceberg once made contact with land, and stands as a reference to the geological notions of the day, such as [[Louis Agassiz]]'s theory of the [[ice age]], and [[Charles Lyell]]'s theory of "continental lift". The general topic of unusually placed ("erratic") boulders was a matter of significant debate at the time.{{sfn|Raab|2015|p=111}} Art historian Timothy Mitchell writes that "''The Icebergs'' is an exultant tribute to time's slow changes. But ... the scientific ideas that informed ''The Icebergs'' have long since been discounted by geologists and forgotten by the public. As a consequence, [the painting's] association with the geological process is often overlooked."{{sfn|Mitchell|1989|p=6}}

The shapes in the ice sometimes form profiles of human-like faces, most pronounced in the "[[repoussoir]]" of ice on the left. As described by Carr, there are also intentional "vague humanoid profiles" on the right, "skull-like" ice blocks in the foreground, and a "floating ice-'siren'" near the grotto.{{sfn|Carr|1980|p=82}} In the foreground, melted water is a light blue, and at upper left a small waterfall deposits water into a patch of emerald beneath. Church observed that freshly frozen water within the cracks of icebergs produced a striking blue color; these veins of sapphire are illustrated at left. In the distance, the largest iceberg shows old waterlines, indicating its continuing ascent, and the foreground appears wetter, having risen from the ocean more recently. Church's signature is on the block of ice to the left of the mast, which was painted in later, and may be seen to form a crucifix. Carr notes that the water level in the grotto is not consistent with that of the rest of the painting.{{sfn|Carr|1980|p=82}}

==Reception==
Like Church's previous major paintings, ''The Icebergs'' received a single-painting exhibition with an admission fee of 25 cents. It debuted in New York City at [[Goupil &amp; Cie|Goupil's]] from April 24 to July 9, 1861, and moved to the [[Boston Athenæum]] the next year. The exhibition rooms were prepared theatrically; the painting, itself {{convert|1.64|x|2.85|m|ft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="dma"/&gt; had a massive carved frame, and the room had emerald carpet and maroon [[Divan (furniture)|divan]]s and cloths over the walls.{{sfn|Raab|2015|pp=87–98}} The outbreak of the Civil War put a damper on exhibition attendance, as ''[[New York World]]'' observed on April 29: "Upon ordinary occasions a new picture by Mr. Church would be for a time an object of central attention to the cultivated community of New York. At present the war excitement absorbs every other, and the picture of the 'Icebergs' has been placed on view at Goupil's without attracting special attention. Last year the announcement of such a work would have packed the gallery from morning till night for weeks; now so intense and eager is the interest concentrated upon the capital, the movements of forces, and the pageantry wherein the town has draped itself, that we doubt if any considerable number of our citizens are aware of its exhibition..."{{sfn|Carr|1980|p=79}}

Church's paintings were greatly anticipated, any many critics responded positively to ''The Icebergs''. The ''New-York Daily Tribune'' called it "the most splendid work of art that has as yet been produced in this country.... It is an absolutely wonderful picture, a work of genius that illustrates the time and the country producing it."{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=61}} While ''The Icebergs'' was well received,{{sfn|Howat|Church|2005|p=106}} some critics had difficulty relating to the painting. Some resorted to the imaginative, suggesting the cavern or grotto was the "haunt" of fairies, sirens, or mermaids.{{sfn|Raab|2015|p=111}} In its original form, as seen in the US, the [[ship's mast]] had not yet been painted in; thus the painting had no narrative possibility or easily observed meaning. The ''Albion'' warned that "ordinary observers ... may perhaps experience some slight disappointment when they miss all familiar objects and find no trace whatever of human association ... no connecting link of any sort between themselves and the canvas."{{sfn|Raab|2015|pp=115–116}} The ''New York World'' wrote, "We shall be surprised if those of acute sensibilities do not look upon it at first with a positive feeling of pain, akin to that which we sometimes feel in the presence of the terrible visions of sleep.... The picture is above and beyond criticism ... We think it will require some time to get even on speaking terms with the 'Icebergs.'"{{sfn|Raab|2015|pp=90, 99}}

Jennifer Raab writes that what disturbed viewers of ''The Icebergs'' was its emptiness. Church's previous landscapes related nature with humanity, whether pastorally or with a sense of conquest. A picture of barren ice could offer only solitude—"not Romantic solitude, but rather nature apart from man, shaped by gravity and entropy, resistant to symbolism. This was nature 'uncaring'; this was Darwin's nature."{{sfn|Raab|2015|p=102}} In Raab's analysis of the picture, its limited use of symbols leaves the viewer unable to resort to allegorical readings like those found in the work of [[Thomas Cole]], Church's teacher. Even the addition of the ship's mast is not enough to establish a narrative, according to Raab: "''The Icebergs'' sets us up to construct a story, and yet the picture is more like Church's broadside: an [[ekphrastic]] description in which details are not treated hierarchically in terms of their value for the narrative."{{sfn|Raab|2015|p=121}}

Church did not find an American buyer, so the work sat in his [[Tenth Street Studio Building|Tenth Street studio]] for some time after the east-coast exhibitions. Thus the promotional methods that Church had adopted for his earlier "Great Pictures" were less successful with ''The Icebergs''.{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=45–46}}

Before the canvas went to London in June 1863, Church renamed it ''The Icebergs'', and added the ship's mast.{{sfn|Raab|2015|pp=87–98}} The mast provides a sense of scale and is a concession to viewers who found the painting lacking in symbolism; English viewers might now have seen it as a tribute to Franklin's expedition. A [[chromolithograph]] was made in 1864; Church had put off this reproduction in the US based on the painting's reception. The canvas was well-received in London. Attending a preview for the painting were scientists and luminaries of Arctic expedition such as [[John Tyndall]], [[Jane Franklin]] (second wife of the deceased [[John Franklin|John]]), [[Francis McClintock]], [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]], [[George Back]], [[Edward Belcher]], and [[Richard Collinson]].{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=66}}

''The Icebergs'' was purchased by [[Edward Watkin]], a British [[member of parliament]] and businessman who played a role in the development of a trans-continental North American railroad. The asking price is unknown, but was probably somewhere in the range of $10,000 to $11,500.{{sfn|Carr|1980|pp=84, 85 n.21}} Watkin hung the painting at his home, [[Rose Hill, Northenden|Rose Hill]], now part of [[Manchester]], England.{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=20}} This was the first and only time that Church found a British patron, although he had tried before.

===As artistic influence===
Huntington, whose writing in the 1960s sought to explain the 19th-century fascination with a then-forgotten artist, explained Church's intentions and the meaning of a landscape of icebergs to an American audience: "These grand, mysterious, elemental creatures of the forces were Church's [[Moby-Dick|Moby Dycks]] [sic]. But, as anyone who has read [[Herman Melville|Melville]] will realize, there is a fundamental difference between the two men. The writer sought to tell his fellow-men that their powers were finite. The painter sought to tell his fellow-men that their powers were infinite. It is the difference between profound Irony and profound Hope.... In 1859, Church's posture before the world was one of absolute confidence."{{sfn|Huntington|1966|p=83}}

Other artists were encouraged by the popular exhibition of ''The Icebergs'' to create their own Arctic pictures. In the US, marine artist [[William Bradford (painter)|William Bradford]] travelled to the North Atlantic a number of times beginning in 1861. Bradford was already interested in the Arctic, but Church's painting became an impetus for his career as an Arctic explorer, lecturer, and artist.{{sfn|Carr|1980|p=103}} His Arctic and iceberg paintings were exhibited in the US, England, and Germany. [[Albert Bierstadt]] made a number of iceberg paintings into the 1880s, and  [[Thomas Moran]] produced ''Spectres of the North'' in 1891.{{sfn|Carr|1980|pp=101–105}} The exhibitions of ''The Icebergs'' in England probably influenced [[Edwin Landseer]]'s 1864 painting, ''[[Man Proposes, God Disposes]]'', which depicts two polar bears tearing at a wreckage that would evoke the lost Franklin expedition.{{sfn|Carr|1980|p=104}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Moore |first=Andrew |date=2009 |title=Sir Edwin Landseer's ''Man Proposes, God Disposes'': And the fate of Franklin |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41614838 |journal=The British Art Journal |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=32–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, Church himself returned to the northern theme in a major painting, ''[[Aurora Borealis (painting)|Aurora Borealis]]'', which, together with ''Cotopaxi'' and ''Chimborazo'', was shown in London that year in a three-painting Church exhibition.{{sfn|Carr|1980|p=101}}{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=69}} In 1863 he produced a smaller canvas of ''The Icebergs'', then called ''To Illumine the Iceberg'' (29 × 47 cm), for patron [[Samuel Hallett]], who paid $300; it is likely the same painting known as ''The Iceberg'' and now in the collection of the [[Mattatuck Museum]], Waterbury, Connecticut.{{sfn|Carr|1980|pp=85–87}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mattatuckcollections.org/Obj4234?sid=63841 |title=Icebergs |website=Mattatuck Museum |access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss, rediscovery, and auction===
Following the death of Watkin in 1901, ''The Icebergs'', as art historian [[Eleanor Jones Harvey|Eleanor Harvey]] put it, "more or less sank from sight for three quarters of a century".{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|pp=18–20}} Rose Hill had become a boys' home, where the painting remained hanging all the while in a little-visited upper landing—but for a six year gap when the painting was donated to a church, which eventually returned it after it obstructed a local drama club's production—while the American art market lost interest in Church and the [[Hudson River School]].{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=69–72}}{{sfn|Carr|1980|p=106}} As interest increased again in the 1970s, at least two American art dealers began to search for Church's "lost" painting, the lithograph of which had appeared on the cover of a 1966 book about Church in case it might help locate the painting. Both dealers came very close to locating it—some confusion arose from an 1867 report by [[Henry Tuckerman]], a writer and contemporary of Church, that a "Mr. ''Watson'', M.P." had purchased the painting, which was "corrected" to "Watkin''s''" by a Boston paper in 1890; these were all valid surnames of potential M.P.s. One investigator ended their journey at a wrong nearby house, and another identified Rose Hill as a likely location, but she was discouraged from trying to access the facility. Instead, she spoke by phone with the matron, Mair Baulch, who did not know about the painting in the home. The next year, the matron independently investigated the painting when she was looking to raise £14,000 for another property. She inquired by letter to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], which she had once visited, and got as far as negotiating a price. The [[Manchester City Council]] by this time intervened, identifying the painting as city property, and refused the Art Institute's first offer. Instead, a city manager contacted [[Sotheby's]] in London, and the painting was transferred to the [[Manchester City Art Gallery]]. The gallery wanted to keep the painting, which was now confirmed to be city property, but Sotheby's estimate of $500,000 was too significant to ignore.{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=71–76}}

The painting was shipped to Sotheby's in New York City, where it was confirmed to be in excellent condition, needing only cleaning with soap and water, removal of [[varnish]], and adjustments to the stretchers.&lt;ref name="tm"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Ennis |first=Michael |date=April 1980 |title=Would You Pay $2.5 Million For That Painting? |magazine=Texas Monthly |pages=106–108, 196–200 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ci4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA106}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the painting drew more sellers to Sotheby's planned auction, hoping to capitalize on the increasing interest in the semi-annual event.  On October 25, 1979, eight to ten bidders participated in the Church auction, which lasted almost four minutes. Two telephone bidders remained at the $2 million mark, with the winning bid coming at $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="tm"/&gt;  Not only was the amount the most ever paid at auction for an American painting—which had been set the year before, with $980,000 for [[George Caleb Bingham]]'s ''[[:commons:File:George Caleb Bingham - 'The Jolly Flatboatman', 1877-78, oil on canvas, Terra Foundation.JPG|The Jolly Flatboatmen]]—''but it was the third-highest amount paid for any painting at auction. The two higher amounts belonged to [[Diego Velazquez]]'s ''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]'' ($5.24 million) and [[Titian]]'s ''[[The Death of Actaeon]]'' ($4 million). ''The Icebergs''' record for an American painting stood until 1985, when [[Rembrandt Peale]]'s ''[[Rubens Peale with a Geranium]]'' sold for $3.7 million.{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|pp=79–80}} The anonymous buyers of ''The Icebergs'' put it on long-term loan with the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], and soon donated it outright. The buyers were identified in 2010 as businessman [[Lamar Hunt]] and his wife Norma,&lt;ref name="dma"/&gt; who had been equivocal on the subject in 1979, although contemporary reporting was quite certain.&lt;ref name="tm"/&gt; According to a 1980 magazine piece Mair Baulch did not receive any of the sale proceeds to improve her facility,&lt;ref name="tm"/&gt; although Harvey, writing in 2002, noted that the council "eventually" purchased the property that Baulch was interested in.{{sfn|Harvey|Church|2002|p=80}}

The American press was sometimes critical of the painting and its price. In ''Time'' magazine, art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] disparaged Church while commenting on the escalating prices paid for artworks: "If art was once expected to provoke ''un nouveau frisson'', a new kind of shudder, its present function is to become a new type of bullion. Thus, we are told by art industry flacks, people now respect art. They flock to museums to see it; its spiritual value has been confirmed, for millions, by its wondrous convertibility into cash. You can't argue with it. It means something if somebody pays $2.5 million for a lummocking spread of icebergs by Frederic Church, a salon machine whose pedestrian invocations of the sublime are not worth one square foot of a good [[J.M.W. Turner|Turner]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Hughes |first=Robert |date=1979-12-31 |title=Confusing Art With Bullion |magazine=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tm"/&gt;

==''The Iceberg'' (1891)==
[[File:Frederic Edwin Church - Der Eisberg - 1891.jpeg|thumb|Church, ''The Iceberg'' (1891). Oil on canvas; {{conv|50.8x76.2|cm|in|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Howat|Church|2005|p=182}}]]

Nine years before his death in 1900 and stricken with arthritis in his painting hand, Church again painted an iceberg, one of his last paintings. ''The Iceberg'' (1891) is a simpler and less striving composition than his 1861 picture. Describing the ''The Iceberg'', Huntington notes the changes in Church's style and outlook: "Church was seldom more charming than in this late painting. Gone is the compulsive striving to say the last word about his subject, the passion to know and master the universe.  The later painting seems, rather, the pensive memory of an experience.... The physically inactive man of sixty-five seems to be content to stand still and not to say, but only to suggest all. He was no longer moving forward 'with the momentum of mankind', impelled by a national enthusiasm of the hour. ''The Iceberg'' of 1891 is the lonely confrontation of a lonely man who sees himself on that ship of yesterday sailing for safety from a strangely drifting, isolated and indifferent white creature of the elements.... Instead of 'restlessness' and 'exhilaration' and 'wild ungovernableness', there is quiet beauty and mystery. There is no world prophecy here but instead the introspection of a man cut off from his time, yet somehow still believing in himself."{{sfn|Huntington|1966|pp=110–111}} Church was pleased with the painting, writing to a friend that it was "the best I ever painted and the truest".{{sfn|Huntington|1966|p=110}}{{sfn|Howat|Church|2005|p=184}} It is now in the collection of the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]] in [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://collection.cmoa.org/objects/41e067c7-90fc-4163-a0b0-572c33b7de1b |title=The Iceberg |website=Carnegie Museum of Art |access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Kongouro from New Holland''''' is an oil painting by [[George Stubbs]]. Depicting a [[kangaroo]], it is the first depiction of an Australian animal in [[Western Art]], along with a painting of a [[dingo]]—''[[Portrait of a Large Dog]]''—also by George Stubbs. It is part of the collection of the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum/save-our-stubbs/|title=Stubbs saved for the nation|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103003244/http://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum/save-our-stubbs/|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was commissioned by [[Joseph Banks]] and based on the inflated skin of an animal he had collected from the east coast of Australia in 1770 during [[First voyage of James Cook|Lieutenant James Cook's first voyage of discovery]].&lt;ref name=artscouncil/&gt; It depicts the animal sitting on a rock and looking over its shoulder with a backdrop of trees and mountains. The two were the only two paintings that Stubbs did not draw from a live subject.&lt;ref name=artscouncil&gt;{{cite web|title=Case 13 2012/13:two paintings by George Stubbs, The Kongouro from New Holland (The Kangaroo) and Portrait of a Large Dog (The Dingo) – Expert adviser's statement|publisher=Arts Council |url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/media/uploads/ea_statement_stubbs.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first exhibited by the Society of Artists in London in 1773 together with his painting of the dingo, ''[[Portrait of a Large Dog]]''.&lt;ref name=artscouncil/&gt; Subsequent exhibitions were held at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in Liverpool in 1951 and the [[Whitechapel Gallery|Whitechapel Art Gallery]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=artscouncil/&gt; The painting has also been on view in recent years at Palham House during public openings.&lt;ref name=artscouncil/&gt;

[[David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]], who had led a campaign to keep both portraits in Britain, remarked that it was "exciting news that these two pictures, so important in the history of zoological discovery, are to remain where they were commissioned and painted".&lt;ref name=Malvern/&gt; The [[National Gallery of Australia]] had expressed a strong desire to purchase the portraits.&lt;ref name=Malvern&gt;{{cite web|author=Malvern, Jack|title=Australia loses tussle over iconic art works after campaign to keep them in Britain|work=The Australian|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/australia-loses-tussle-over-iconic-art-works-after-campaign-to-keep-them-in-britain/story-fnb64oi6-1226754056818#|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013 it was announced that a £1.5million donation from the [[Eyal Ofer]] Family Foundation will enable the [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich, London to acquire the two paintings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmg.co.uk/about/press/stubbs-kangaroo-and-dingo-paintings-saved-for-the-nation&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Russian Ship of the line "Asow" and a Frigate at Anchor in the roads of Elsinore''''' is a painting by the Danish painter, [[C. W. Eckersberg]]. It was painted in 1828.

The work is not an accurate rendition of the scene but a construction, using more than one event as the basis for the painting.&lt;ref name=smk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smk.dk/udforsk-kunsten/kunsthistorier/vaerker/vis/det-russiske-linieskib-assow-og-en-fregat-til-ankers-paa-helsingoer-red/ |title=Flere russiske flådebesøg |last1=Monrad |first1=Kasper |last2= |first2= |date=2 February 2013 |work= |publisher=National Gallery of Denmark |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Eckersberg moved the scene from [[Copenhagen]] where he had inspected such ships to [[Helsingør|Elsinore]] as is evident in the picture as [[Kronborg]] is seen in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smk.dk/udforsk-kunsten/kunsthistorier/vaerker/vis/det-russiske-linieskib-assow-og-en-fregat-til-ankers-paa-helsingoer-red/ |title=Flere oplevelser samlet i ét maleri|last1=Monrad |first1=Kasper |last2= |first2= |date=2 February 2013 |work= |publisher=National Gallery of Denmark |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eckersberg was very meticulous in preparing the painting, however. He studied these ship types beforehand, borrowing technical drawings from the naval dockyard. The process is documented in Eckersberg's diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smk.dk/udforsk-kunsten/kunsthistorier/vaerker/vis/det-russiske-linieskib-assow-og-en-fregat-til-ankers-paa-helsingoer-red/ |title=Grundigt forarbejde |last1=Monrad |first1=Kasper |last2= |first2= |date=2 February 2013 |work= |publisher=National Gallery of Denmark |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uberfic''' (short for '''uber fanfic''', '''uberXena''') or simply '''uber''', '''über''', or '''ueber''' (from {{lang-de|über-}}, for 'over-' or 'supra-') is a genre of [[Alternate universe (fan fiction)|alternate universe]] [[fan fiction]] in which characters or events are portrayed somewhat closely to original [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] but usually in a different time period, place, or reality, many times featuring the [[ancestors]], [[Kinship|descendants]], or [[reincarnation]]s of canon characters, known as uber-characters. The uber-characters' names are never{{Cn|date=August 2015}} [[canon (fiction)|canon]].  The term originated in ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' fandom, coined in 1997 by Kym Taborn, the webmaster of the fansite Whoosh.org.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.whoosh.org Whoosh.org - The International Association of Xena Studies (IAXS)]&lt;/ref&gt;  This sort of story was used by the series itself, beginning with the second season episode "[[The Xena Scrolls]]".&lt;ref name="lunacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lunacyreviews.com/terms.shtm#Uber-Xena |title=Definitions |accessdate=2007-02-04 |author=Lunacy |date=2006-02-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127090906/http://www.lunacyreviews.com/terms.shtm#Uber-Xena &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common trend in Xena fanfics was to write Uber stories in which the characters' analogues discover that they are soulmates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genders.org/g34/g34_hamming.html Whatever Turns You On: Becoming-Lesbian and the Production of Desire in the Xenaverse]&lt;/ref&gt;
