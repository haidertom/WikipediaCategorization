'''Advesha''' (Sanskrit; Pali: ''adosa''; Tibetan Wylie: ''zhes sdang med pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "non-aggression"  or "non-hatred". It is defined as the absence of an aggressive attitude towards someone or something that causes pain.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 538-539.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is advesha? It is the absence of the intention to harm sentient beings, to quarrel with frustrating situations, and to inflict suffering on those who are the cause of frustration. It functions as a basis for not getting involved with unwholesome behavior.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

First, the predators approach their potential prey. Predators bite or try to swallow the hagfishes, but the hagfishes have already projected jets of slime (arrows) into the predators' mouths. Choking, the predators release the hagfishes and gag in an attempt to remove slime from their mouths and gill chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zintzen | first1=Vincent | last2=Roberts | first2=Clive D. | last3=Anderson | first3=Marti J. | last4=Stewart | first4=Andrew L. | last5=Struthers | first5=Carl D. | last6=Harvey | first6=Euan S. | title=Hagfish Slime as a Defense Mechanism against Gill-breathing Predators | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=1 | page=2011 | doi=10.1038/srep00131| year=2011 | bibcode=2011NatSR...1E.131Z | pmid=22355648 | pmc=3216612}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Anti-predator adaptations''' are mechanisms developed through [[evolution]] that assist [[prey]] organisms in their constant struggle against [[predator]]s. Throughout the animal kingdom, adaptations have evolved for every stage of this struggle, namely by avoiding detection, warding off attack, fighting back, or escaping when caught.

The first line of defence consists in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as [[camouflage]], [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerade]], [[apostatic selection]], living underground, or [[nocturnal]]ity. 

Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in [[aposematism]], by [[mimicry|mimicking]] animals which do possess such defences, by [[deimatic behaviour|startling]] the attacker, by [[signalling theory|signalling to the predator]] that pursuit is not worthwhile, by [[distraction display|distraction]], by using defensive structures such as spines, and by [[social animal|living in a group]]. Members of groups are at [[selfish herd theory|reduced risk of predation]], despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the likelihood that the predator will attack some other individual.

Some prey species are capable of fighting back against predators, whether [[autohaemorrhaging|with chemicals]], through [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|communal defence]], or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. 

Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by [[autotomy|sacrificing certain body parts]]: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.

==Avoiding detection==

===Staying out of sight===
{{main article|Nocturnality}}
[[File:Seychelles Fruit Bat - Pteropus seychellensis.jpg|thumb|[[Fruit bat]]s forage [[nocturnality|by night]] to avoid predators.]]

Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether [[Troglobite|in caves]], [[Fossorial|underground]], or by being [[nocturnality|nocturnal]].&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cott, H.B. |date=1940 |title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals |publisher=Methuen |location=London |pages=330–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duverge | first1=P.L. | last2=Jones | first2=G | last3=Rydell | first3=J. | last4=Ransome | first4=R. | date=2000 | title=Functional significance of emergence timing in bats | journal=Ecography | volume=23 | pages=32–40 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.2000.tb00258.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Daly | first1=M. | last2=Behrends | first2=P.R. | last3=Wilson | first3=M. | last4=Jacobs | first4=L. | date=1992 | title=Behavioural modulation of predation risk: moonlight avoidance and crepuscular compensation in a nocturnal desert rodent, Dipodomys merriami | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=44 | pages=1–9 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80748-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called [[crypsis]] used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating [[bats]]. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from [[bat hawk]]s and [[bat falcon]]s. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"/&gt;
Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in [[kangaroo rat]]s, which avoid moonlight. They forage in relatively open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"/&gt;

[[File:Phrynosoma mcallii.jpg|thumb|right|[[Camouflage]] illustrated by the [[flat-tail horned lizard]], its flattened, fringed and [[disruptively patterned]] body eliminating shadow]]

===Camouflage===
{{main article|Camouflage}}

[[Camouflage]] uses any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, [[disruptive coloration]], shadow elimination by [[countershading]] or [[counter-illumination]], self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and colour.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=35–60}} Animals such as the [[flat-tail horned lizard]] of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and blend in with the ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. In addition, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117&gt;{{cite book | author=Sherbrooke, W. C. |date=2003 | title=Introduction to horned lizards of North America | publisher=University of California Press |pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masquerade===
[[File:Kallima inachus qtl1.jpg|thumb|''[[Kallima inachus]]'' [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as a dead leaf]]

Animals can hide in plain sight by [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as inedible objects. For example, the [[potoo]], a South American bird, habitually perches on a tree, convincingly resembling a broken stump of a branch,{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=53–55}} while a butterfly, ''[[Kallima]]'', looks just like a dead leaf.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=318–320}}

===Apostatic selection===

Another way to remain unattacked in plain sight is to look different from other members of the same species. Predators such as [[Parus|tits]] selectively hunt for abundant types of insect, ignoring less common types that were present, forming [[search image]]s of the desired prey. This creates a mechanism for negative [[frequency-dependent selection]], [[apostatic selection]].{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=61–65}}

==Warding off attack==
[[File:Gottesanbeterin Abwehr.JPG|thumb|A Mediterranean [[mantis]], ''[[Iris oratoria]]'', attempting to startle a predator with [[deimatic behaviour]]]]

Many species make use of behavioral strategies to deter predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper |first1=William E |title=Antipredatory Behavior |url=http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/antipredatory_behavior_1/story.htm |website=IDEA |publisher=University of California, Riverside |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Startling the predator===
{{main article|Deimatic behaviour}}

Many weakly-defended animals, including [[moth]]s, [[butterflies]], [[Mantidae|mantises]], [[Phasmidae|phasmids]], and [[cephalopods]] such as octopuses, make use of patterns of threatening or [[deimatic behaviour|startling behaviour]], such as suddenly displaying conspicuous [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]], so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. In the absence of toxins or other defences, this is essentially bluffing, in contrast to aposematism which involves honest signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006810 |author=Stevens, Martin |authorlink=Martin Stevens (biologist) |title=The role of eyespots as anti-predator mechanisms, principally demonstrated in the Lepidoptera |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |date=2005 |pages=573–588 |pmid=16221330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/86053.html | title=Deimatic Behavior | publisher=Springer | date=2012 | accessdate=31 December 2012 | author=Edmunds, Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.conchsoc.org/node/6014 | title=Octopus vulgaris. Dymantic display | publisher=The Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland | date=3 December 2012 | accessdate=1 January 2013 | author=Smith, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pursuit-deterrent signals===
{{further information|Signalling theory}}
[[File:Stotting gazelle.jpg|thumb|An [[impala]] [[stotting]], [[signalling honestly]] to the predator that the chase will be unprofitable]]

Pursuit-deterrent signals are behavioral signals used by prey that convince predators not to pursue them. For example, [[gazelle]]s [[stotting|stot]], jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators that they have a high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to outrun them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caro, T. M. |authorlink=Tim Caro |date=1986 |title=The functions of stotting in Thomson's gazelles: Some tests of the predictions |journal=Animal Behaviour |issue=3 |pages=663–684 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80052-5 |volume=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[White-tailed deer]] and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous (often black and white) tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bildstein |first1=Keith L. |title=Why White-Tailed Deer Flag Their Tails |journal=The American Naturalist |date=May 1983 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=709–715 |doi=10.1086/284096 |jstor=2460873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warning calls given by birds such as the [[Eurasian jay]] are similarly [[honest signal]]s, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed that it has been detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bergstrom |first=C. T. |last2=Lachmann |first2=M. |year=2001 |title=Alarm calls as costly signals of antipredator vigilance: the watchful babbler game |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=535–543 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Getty |first=T. |year=2002 |title=The discriminating babbler meets the optimal diet hawk |journal=Anim. Behav. |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=397H. Carl 402 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playing dead===
{{main article|apparent death}}
[[File:Heterodon platirhinos 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eastern hog-nosed snake]] [[Apparent death|playing dead]]]]

Another pursuit-deterrent signal is [[apparent death|thanatosis or playing dead]]. Thanatosis is a form of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, [[deception|feigning]] death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pasteur | first1=G | date=1982 | title=A classificatory review of mimicry systems | url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=13 | pages=169–199 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of this is seen in white-tailed deer fawns, which experience a drop in heart rate in response to approaching predators. This response, referred to as "alarm bradycardia", causes the fawn's heart rate to drop from 155 to 38 beats per minute within one beat of the heart. This drop in heart rate can last up to two minutes, causing the fawn to experience a depressed breathing rate and decrease in movement, called tonic immobility. Tonic immobility is a reflex response that causes the fawn to enter a low body position that simulates the position of a dead corpse. Upon discovery of the fawn, the predator loses interest in the "dead" prey. Other symptoms of alarm bradycardia, such as salivation, urination, and defecation, can also cause the predator to lose interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alboni | first1=Paolo | last2=Alboni | first2=Marco | last3=Bertorelle | first3=Giorgio | date=2008 | title=The origin of vasovagal syncope: to protect the heart or to escape predation? | journal=Clinical Autonomic Research | volume=18 | issue=4| pages=170–8 | doi=10.1007/s10286-008-0479-7| pmid=18592129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distraction===
[[File:Charadrius vociferus tx1.jpg|thumb|A [[killdeer]] plover, [[distraction display|distracting a predator]] from its nest by feigning a broken wing]]
{{main article|phagomimicry|distraction display}}

Marine [[mollusc]]s such as [[sea hare]]s, [[cuttlefish]], [[squid]] and [[octopus]]es give themselves a last chance to escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may [[phagomimicry|mimic food]] or otherwise confuse predators.&lt;ref name="Mason 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2005/03/sea-hares-lose-their-lunch |title=Sea Hares Lose Their Lunch |author=Inman, Mason |date=29 March 2005 |website=Sciencemag.org |accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Derby&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Derby |first1=Charles D. |title=Escape by Inking and Secreting: Marine Molluscs Avoid Predators Through a Rich Array of Chemicals and Mechanisms |journal=The Biological Bulletin |date=December 2007 |volume=213 |issue=3 |pages=274–289 |doi=10.2307/25066645|jstor=25066645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a predator, animals in these groups release [[cephalopod ink|ink]], creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.&lt;ref name="Mason 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Derby, Kicklighter et al (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115142409/http://www2.gsu.edu/~biocdd/Publications/Reprints/2007/Derby%20et%20al%20joun%20chem%20eco%202007.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2009 |url=https://www2.gsu.edu/~biocdd/Publications/Reprints/2007/Derby%20et%20al%20joun%20chem%20eco%202007.pdf |title=Chemical Composition of Inks of Diverse Marine Molluscs Suggests Convergent Chemical Defenses |author=Derby, Charles D. |author2=Kicklighter, Cynthia E. |author3=Johnson,  P.

[[Distraction display]]s attract the attention of predators away from an object, typically the nest or young, that is being protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barrows, Edward M. |date=2001 |title=Animal behavior |publisher=CRC Press |edition=2nd |page=177 | isbn=0-8493-2005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distraction displays are performed by some species of birds, which may feign a broken wing while hopping about on the ground, and by some species of fish.{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|page=198}}

===Mimicry and aposematism===
{{main article|mimicry|aposematism}}
[[File:BatesMimButter.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|alt=Viceroy and monarch butterflies illustrate Müllerian mimicry|[[Viceroy butterfly|Viceroy]] and [[monarch butterfly|monarch]] are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]], similar in appearance, unpalatable to predators.]]

[[Mimicry]] occurs when an organism (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This results in the mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Endler, J. A. |title=An overview of the relationships between mimicry and crypsis |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |date=1981 |volume=16 |pages=25–31 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1981.tb01840.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve [[aposematic]] [[animal coloration|coloration]]&lt;!--this means a pattern of more than one color--&gt;, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.&lt;ref name=HolmgrenEnquist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritland1/&gt;

In [[Batesian mimicry]], a palatable, harmless prey species mimics the appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack.&lt;ref name=HolmgrenEnquist&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holmgren, H. | author2=Enquist, M. | title=Dynamics of mimicry evolution | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | date=1999 | volume=66  | pages=145–158 | doi=10.1006/bijl.1998.0269}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of mimicry is seen in many [[insect]]s. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colours and markings, including Batesian mimics, which are in effect parasitic on the chemical or other defences of the unprofitable models.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bates | first1=H.

===Defensive structures===

Many animals are protected against predators with armour in the form of hard shells (such as most [[mollusc]]s), leathery or scaly skin (as in [[reptile]]s), or tough chitinous exoskeletons (as in [[arthropod]]s).{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|page=198}}

A [[spine (zoology)|spine]] is a sharp, needle-like structure used to inflict pain on predators. An example of this seen in nature is in the [[Sohal surgeonfish]]. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine on the front of each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Craig. Scott, Susan. (1997). ''All Stings Considered''. University of Hawaii Press. pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish.&lt;ref name="Vincent1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Vincent | first1=J. F.

Many species of slug caterpillar, [[Limacodidae]], have numerous protuberances and stinging spines along their dorsal surfaces.

==Safety in numbers==
{{further information|Social animal}}

Group living can decrease the risk of predation to the individual in a variety of ways,{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=202–207}} as described below.

===Dilution effect===

A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group "dilute" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] and [[W.D. Hamilton]] proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in [[Camargue horse]]s in Southern France. The [[horse-fly]] often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duncan | first1=P. | last2=Vigne | first2=N. | date=1979 | title=The effect of group size in horses on the rate of attacks by blood-sucking flies | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=27 | pages=623–625 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(79)90201-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water striders]] are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Foster | first1=W.A. | last2=Treherne | first2=J.E. | date=1981 | title=Evidence for the dilution effect in the selfish herd from fish predation on a marine insect | journal=Nature | volume=295 | pages=466–467 | doi=10.1038/293466a0| bibcode=1981Natur.293..466F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domain of Danger Graphic.jpg|thumb|In a group, prey seek central positions in order to reduce their domain of danger. Individuals along the outer edges of the group are more at risk of being targeted by the predator.]]

===Selfish herd===

{{main article|Selfish herd theory}}

The selfish herd theory was proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton]] to explain why animals seek central positions in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Hamilton | authorlink=W. D. Hamilton | first1=W. | title=Geometry for the selfish herd | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=31 | issue=2 | pages=295–311 | date=1971 | pmid=5104951 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory's central idea is to reduce the individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual is more likely to be attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals are predicted to strive constantly to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied [[brown fur seal]] predation from [[great white shark]]s. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.&lt;ref name="De Vos ORiain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=De Vos | first=A. | last2=O'Riain | first2=M.

===Predator satiation===
[[File:White cicada.jpg|thumb|left|A newly emerged [[Magicicada|periodical cicada]]: millions emerge at once, at long intervals, likely to [[predator satiation|satiate predators]].]]

{{main article|Predator satiation|Periodical cicada}}

A radical strategy for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill a large majority of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the [[periodical cicadas]], which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so [[predator satiation]] is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams, K.S. |author2=C. Simon |last-author-amp=yes |date=1995 |title=The ecology, behavior, and evolution of periodical cicadas |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |volume=40 |pages=269–295 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.40.010195.001413 |url=http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/projects/cicada/resources/reprints/Williams%26Simon_1995.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chlorocebus pygerythrus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chlorocebus pygerythrus|Vervet monkeys]] have different [[alarm signal]]s that warn of attacks by [[eagle]]s, [[leopard]]s and [[snake]]s.]]

===Alarm calls===

{{main article|Alarm signal}}

Animals that live in groups often give [[alarm signal|alarm calls]] that give warning of an attack. For example, [[vervet monkey]]s give different calls depending on the nature of the attack: for an [[eagle]], a disyllabic cough; for a [[leopard]] or other cat, a loud bark; for a [[python (genus)|python]] or other snake, a "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look up and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1=John|author1link=John Maynard Smith|last2=Harper|first2=David|title=Animal Signals|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19852-685-8|pages=113–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improved vigilance===

[[File:Circus hudsonius Recurvirostra americana.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4&lt;!--width for low image--&gt;|A raptor, a [[Circus hudsonius|northern harrier]], chases up an alert flock of [[Recurvirostra americana|American avocets]].]]

In the improved vigilance effect, groups are able to detect predators sooner than solitary individuals.{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=115–149}} For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, [[Common wood pigeon|wood pigeon]] flocks are preyed upon by [[goshawk]]s. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, the more likely it is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(73)90184-7|pmid=4734745|author=Pulliam, H. R.|title=On the advantages of flocking|volume=38|year=1973|journal=J. Theor. Biol.|pages=419–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild [[ostrich]]es in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises its head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1016/S0003-3472(80)80030-3|title=Vigilance and group size in ostriches|journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=28|issue=1|pages=278–286|author=Bertram, Brian C. |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zebras Serengeti.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|A single [[zebra]] is hard to catch amongst a herd.]]

===Predator confusion===

Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The [[zebra]] has been suggested by the zoologist [[Martin Stevens (biologist)|Martin Stevens]] and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering [[motion dazzle]] effect in the eye of the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-9-81|title=Motion dazzle and camouflage as distinct anti-predator defenses|pmid=22117898 | volume=9|pmc=3257203|year=2011|journal=BMC Biol.|pages=81 | last1 = Stevens | first1 = M | last2 = Searle | first2 = WT | last3 = Seymour | first3 = JE | last4 = Marshall | first4 = KL | last5 = Ruxton | first5 = GD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighting back==

Defensive structures such as spines may be used both to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator.&lt;ref name="Vincent1986"/&gt; Methods of fighting back include chemical defences,{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|pages=64–69}} mobbing,&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; defensive regurgitation,&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt; and suicidal altruism.&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"/&gt;

Some prey animals are able to eject noxious materials to deter predators actively.

[[File:MuskOxen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7&lt;!--size for very low image--&gt;|Group of [[muskox]]en in defensive formation, horns ready, and highly alert]]

In communal defence, prey groups actively defend themselves by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing themselves to be passive victims of predation. [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|Mobbing]] is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, [[red colobus]] monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by [[chimpanzees]], a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stanford | first1=Craig B | title=The influence of chimpanzee predation on group size and anti-predator behavior in red colobus monkeys | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=49 | issue=3| pages=577–587 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)90033-0| year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fieldfares]] are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies.

It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading to the loss of flying ability and the loss of water repellency.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt; This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from [[hypothermia]] when diving for food.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt;

[[European roller]] chicks vomit a bright orange, foul smelling liquid when they sense danger. This repels prospective predators and may alert their parents to danger: they respond by delaying their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Parejo | first1=D | last2=Avilés | first2=JM | last3=Peña | first3=A | last4=Sánchez | first4=L | last5=Ruano | first5=F | display-authors=etal  | date=2013 | title=Armed Rollers: Does Nestling's Vomit Function as a Defence against Predators? | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=8 | issue=7| page=e68862 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068862 | pmid=23874791 | pmc=3707886| bibcode=2013PLoSO...868862P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous insects utilize defensive regurgitation. The [[eastern tent caterpillar]] regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peterson, Steven C., Nelson D. Johnson, and John L. LeGuyader|title=Defensive Regurgitation of Allelochemicals Derived From Host Cyanogenesis By Eastern Tent Caterpillars|jstor=1939211|doi=10.2307/1939211|journal=Ecology|volume= 68|issue=5 |year=1987|pages= 1268–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, larvae of the [[noctuid moth]] regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and irritant properties that help to deter predator attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedley, Scott R., Elizabeth Ehrhardt, and Thomas Eisner|title=Defensive Regurgitation by a Noctuid Moth Larva (''Litoprosopus futilis'')|journal=Psyche: A Journal of Entomology |volume=100|issue=3–4 |year=1993|pages=209–21|doi=10.1155/1993/67950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicidal altruism===
{{further information|Autothysis}}

An unusual type of predator deterrence is observed in the [[Camponotus saundersi|Malaysian exploding ant]]. Social [[hymenoptera]] rely on [[altruism]] to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony.&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Davidson, D.W. | title=A review on self-destructive defense behaviors in social insects | author2=Salim, K.A. | author3=Billen, J. | date=2011 | journal=Insectes Sociaux | volume=59 | pages=1–10 |doi=10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied [[submandibular glands]],&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"/&gt; expelling corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator.

===Flight===
The normal reaction of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding,&lt;ref name=Corlett&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corlett |first1=Richard T. |title=Tropical rain forests : an ecological and biogeographical comparison |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=2011 |isbn=978-1444332551 |pages=197, 200|edition=2nd |author2=Primack, Richard B. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0j8NROHQi8C&amp;pg=PA197}}&lt;/ref&gt; falling, swimming, running, jumping, [[burrowing]]&lt;ref name=Bromley&gt;{{cite book|author=Bromley, Richard G. |title=Trace Fossils: Biology, Taxonomy and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_kqvIui4IkC&amp;pg=PA69 |year=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-07607-8 |pages=69–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Rotating locomotion in living systems#Rolling|rolling]],&lt;ref name="Krus"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kruszelnicki | first = Karl S. | title = Real Wheel Animals—Part Two | work = Great Moments in Science | publisher = ABC Science | date = August 9, 1999 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/1999/08/09/42510.htm?site=science/greatmomentsinscience | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161001195024/http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/1999/08/09/42510.htm?site=science%2Fgreatmomentsinscience | archivedate = October 1, 2016 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the animal's capabilities.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=145–149}} Escape paths are often erratic, making it difficult for the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as [[snipe]], [[ptarmigan]] and [[black-headed gull]]s evade fast raptors such as [[peregrine falcon]]s with zigzagging or jinking flight.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=145–149}} In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding.&lt;ref name=Corlett/&gt; Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the [[animal echolocation|sonar clicks of bats]].{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=145–149}} Among fish, the [[Gasterosteus|stickleback]] follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating [[merganser]] duck.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=145–149}}

===Autotomy===
{{main article|Autotomy}}
[[File:Lizard tail autotomy.JPG|thumb|[[Lizard]] tail [[autotomy]] can distract predators, continuing to writhe while the lizard makes its escape.]]

Some animals are capable of [[autotomy]] (self-amputation), shedding one of their own [[appendage]]s in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be [[regeneration (biology)|regenerated]] later. Certain [[sea slug]]s discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as [[crab]]s can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among [[vertebrate]]s, many [[gecko]]s and other [[lizard]]s shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=179–181}}

==History of observations==

[[Aristotle]] recorded observations (around 350 BC) of the antipredator behaviour of [[cephalopod]]s in his ''[[History of Animals]]'', including the use of ink as a distraction, camouflage, and signalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |title=The History of Animals |date=1910 |origyear=350 BC |volume=IX |pages=621b-622a |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.9.ix.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, [[Hugh Cott]] wrote a compendious study of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism, ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]''.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}

{{C Standard Library}}
The '''C date and time functions''' are a group of functions in the [[C standard library|standard library]] of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] implementing date and time manipulation operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf  | title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification | at=p. 351, § 7.32.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide support for [[system time|time]] acquisition, conversion between date formats, and formatted output to strings.

==Overview of functions==

The C date and time operations are defined in the &lt;code&gt;time.h&lt;/code&gt; [[header file]] (&lt;code&gt;ctime&lt;/code&gt; header in [[C++]]).

==Example==

The following C source code prints the current time to the [[Standard streams|standard output stream]].
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    time_t current_time;
    char* c_time_string;

    /* Obtain current time. */
    current_time = time(NULL);

    if (current_time == ((time_t)-1))
    {
        (void) fprintf(stderr, "Failure to obtain the current time.\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    /* Convert to local time format. */
    c_time_string = ctime(&amp;current_time);

    if (c_time_string == NULL)
    {
        (void) fprintf(stderr, "Failure to convert the current time.\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    /* Print to stdout. ctime() has already added a terminating newline character. */
    (void) printf("Current time is %s", c_time_string);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:
&lt;source lang="text"&gt;

Current time is Tue Jun  13:00:03 2018
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Civil mobilization''' is the legal compulsion for civilians to work, in distinction to military [[mobilization]].  It has been used on a number of occasions by a number of governments.   This generally makes [[General strike|striking]] illegal for the duration of the mobilization.

==Belgium 1964==
To prevent a doctors strike the Belgium government, in April 1964, issued a civil mobilization order for hospital doctors and [[military doctors]].

==Greece 2010-2015==
In Greece civil mobilization orders were made for dock workers, teachers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2013/05/11/greek-govt-to-issue-86000-civil-mobilization-orders-for-teachers-before-the-strike/&lt;/ref&gt; and power workers .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stopcartel.org/civil-mobilization/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''condensation symbol''' is "a name, word, phrase, or [[maxim (saying)|maxim]] which stirs vivid impressions involving the listener's most basic values and readies the listener for action," as defined by political scientist Doris Graber.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Graber, Verbal Behavior and Politics, University of Illinois Press (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Short words or phrases such as "my country," "[[old glory]]" "[[American Dream]]," "[[family values]]," are all condensation symbols because they conjure a specific image within the listener and carry "intense emotional and effective power."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Helen Palczewski, Rhetoric in Civic Life, State College: Strata Publishing (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Often used to further the meaning of a symbol or phrase, the condensation symbol has a semantic meaning, but through long-term use, it has acquired other connotations that further its symbolic meaning. Doris Graber identified three main characteristics of condensation symbols, as they:
# Have the tendency to evoke rich and vivid images in an audience.
# Possess the capacity to arouse emotions.
# Supply instant categorizations and evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Graber, (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the phrase "[[American Dream]]," the image that tends to come to mind is a successful, self-made American individual who has worked hard in order to obtain a life of financial security, with occasional luxury and minimal privilege, even if the sociological reality varies widely by region, class, place, and time. A closely related concept is the rhetorical concept of the [[Ideograph (rhetoric)|ideograph]].

==Emergence of the term==
With origins in [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[semiotics|semiotic]] research, a condensation symbol is "a single symbol that represents multiple emotions, ideas, feelings, memories, or impulses”. [[Sigmund Freud]] first defined condensation in dreams as "fusing several different elements into one."&lt;ref&gt;"Sigmund Freud." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition, Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; When a listener hears a phrase that is meant to conjure a specific image, their mind should immediately turn to the image that is associated with the phrase, and feel the intended emotion the speaker wishes to present.

[[Edward Sapir]] later applied the term to [[linguistics]] along with his principle of [[linguistic relativity]], which holds that "the structure of language affects the ways in which its speakers conceptualize the world".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sapir, Encyclopedia of the social sciences "Symbolism", Macmillan, (1934).&lt;/ref&gt; Sapir, a [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologist]], gave specificity to the term when stating that "condensation symbols designate no clear referent but serve to 'condense' into one symbol a host of different meanings and connotations which might diverge if more specific referents were attempted." He also posited the condensation symbol as an unconscious release of emotional tension.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sapir, Encyclopedia of the social sciences "Symbolism", Macmillan, (1934).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the field of rhetorical criticism, David Kaufer and Kathleen Carley discuss condensation symbols and their function within political discourse. They describe each condensation symbol as a term "well-connected in its context of meaning".&lt;ref&gt;David S. Kaufer, Kathleen M. Carley, Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, Vol. 26, No. 3, Penn State University Press (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Their paper attempts to prescribe a mathematical relationship between condensation symbols and their rhetorical influence. The authors devise six categories ([[buzzword]]s, pregnant [[placeholder name|place-holders]], [[emblem]]s, standard [[symbol]]s, [[allusion]]s, and [[stereotype]]s) to determine which held the highest rhetorical taxonomy. They concluded by assuming that "connectivity" by various means allows the arguer to conjure emotional symbols in associational patterns through these six devices. The authors also state that condensation symbols “allow group members to compress their image of the problem at the heart of the issue and solutions to it—-often so thoroughly that their decisions about how to decide an issue frequently collapse about how to name it.”&lt;ref&gt;David S. Kaufer, Kathleen M. Carley, Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, Vol. 26, No. 3, Penn State University Press (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
'''Consideration''' is a concept of [[English law|English]] [[common law]] and is a necessity for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by [[deed]]). The concept has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions, including the US.

The court in ''Currie v Misa'' &lt;ref&gt;''Currie v Misa''  (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893&lt;/ref&gt; declared consideration to be a “Right,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility”. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable '''only''' if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.&lt;ref&gt;''Wade v Simeon'' (1846)  2 CB 548&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''White v Bluett''  (1853)  2 WR 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bronaugh R. (1976). [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2434&amp;context=wmlr Agreement, Mistake, and Objectivity in the Bargain Theory of Conflict]. ''William &amp; Mary Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consideration may be thought of as the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into [[contract]]s. Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as "consideration": for example, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the $5,000, and B's consideration is the car.

Additionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's consideration is $500 paid to A. Further, if A signs a contract with B such that A will ''not'' repaint his own house in any other color than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up, there is also consideration. Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything, A did promise ''not'' to do something that he was allowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. A's consideration to B is the ''forbearance'' in painting his own house in a color other than white, and B's consideration to A is $500 per year. Conversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's consideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there is no valid contract. However, if B still gives the title to the car to A, then B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract, it ''is'' a valid [[Gift (law)|gift]].

In [[common law]] it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding. The doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions, although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations. If there is no element of consideration found, there is thus no contract formed.

However, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible recovery under the doctrines of ''[[quantum meruit]]'' (sometimes referred to as a [[quasi-contract]]) or [[Estoppel#Promissory estoppel|promissory estoppel]].

==Legal rules regarding consideration==
There are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in a contract:
# Part payment is not good consideration&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Pinnel's Case]]'' (1602)  5 Co Rep 117a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Jorden v Money]]'' (1854) 5 HLC 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Foakes v Beer]]''  ''([[per incuriam]]?)'' (1884) AC 605&lt;/ref&gt;
# Consideration must move from the promisee but need not flow to the promisor &lt;ref&gt;''[[Tweddle v Atkinson]],, (1861)  1 B&amp;S 393&lt;/ref&gt;
# Consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate &lt;ref&gt;''[[De la Bere v Pearson]]'' [1908]  1 KB 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chappell v Nestlés]]'' [1960]  AC 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Atlantic Baron]]'' [1979]  QB 705  (aka North Ocean Shipping v Hyundai Construction) &lt;/ref&gt; 
# Consideration cannot be illusory 
# Consideration must not be past. Past consideration is not good consideration &lt;ref&gt;''[[Roscorla v Thomas]]'' 	(1842)  3 QB 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re McArdle]]'' 	[1951]  Ch 669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lampleigh v Braithwaite]]'' 	( 1615) Hob 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kennedy v Broun]]''	 (1863)  13 CB (NS) 677&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Casey's Patents]]'' (aka  Stewart v Casey)	[1893] 1 Ch 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pao On v Lau Yiu Long]]'' 	[1980] AC 614 (PC)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Moral consideration is not sufficient&lt;ref&gt;Except for contracts by deed, where "love and affection" is often cited as the (unnecessary) consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Performance of existing duties is not good consideration &lt;ref&gt;''[[Stilk v Myrick (1809)  2 Camp 317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hartley v Ponsonby]]'' (1857)  7 E&amp;B 872&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Glasbrook Bros v Glamorgan CC]]'' [1925]  AC 270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Williams v Roffey]]'' [1990] 2 WLR 1153&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and comparative law==
Systems based on Roman law (including Germany &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p1008 German Civil Code § 311], accessed 15 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and Scotland) do not require consideration, and some commentators consider it unnecessary and have suggested that the doctrine of consideration should be abandoned,&lt;ref&gt; See: [[Harvey McGregor]]'s [[Contract Code]]&lt;/ref&gt; and estoppel used to replace it as a basis for contracts.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. P.S. Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in ''Essays on Contract'' (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that "The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd.]] [1947] KB 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason that both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading scholars to be the result of the combining by 19th century judges of two distinct threads: first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of [[assumpsit]], which had grown up in medieval times and remained the normal action for breach of a simple contract in England and Wales until 1884, when the old forms of action were abolished; secondly, the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems, was promoted by the 18th century French writer Pothier in his ''Traite des Obligations'', much read (especially after translation into English in 1805) by English judges and jurists. The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time, especially [[John Stuart Mill]]'s influential ideas on free will, and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed and authoritative account of this process, see [[A. W. B. Simpson]], ''A History of the Common Law of Contract: The Rise of the Action of Assumpsit'', ([[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] systems take the approach that an exchange of promises, or a concurrence of wills alone, rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis. So if A promises to give B a book, and B accepts the offer without giving anything in return, B would have a legal right to the book and A could not change her mind about giving it to B as a gift. However, in [[common law system]]s the concept of ''[[culpa in contrahendo]]'', a form of [[estoppel]], is increasingly used to create obligations during [[pre-contractual negotiations]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 582&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1988|litigants=[[Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher]] |parallelcite=(1988) 164 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Estoppel is an [[Equity (law)|equitable doctrine]] that provides for the creation of legal obligations if a party has given another an [[wikt:assurance|assurance]] and the other has relied on the assurance to his [[detriment (law)|detriment]].

==Monetary value of consideration==
Generally, courts do not inquire whether the deal between two parties was monetarily fair&amp;mdash;merely that each party passed some legal obligation or duty to the other party.&lt;ref&gt;''Thomas v Thomas'' (1842)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woollen Mills HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|20|1954|litigants=Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth |parallelcite=(1954) 92 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 424 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dispositive issue is presence of consideration, not adequacy of the consideration. The values between consideration passed by each party to a contract need not be comparable.

For instance, if A offers B $200 to buy B's mansion, luxury sports car, and private jet, there is still consideration on both sides. A's consideration is $200, and B's consideration is the mansion, car, and jet. Courts in the United States generally leave parties to their own contracts, and do not intervene. The old English rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave the ''value of a [[peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]]'' to the other party. As a result, contracts in the United States have sometimes have had one party pass nominal amounts of consideration, typically citing $1. Thus, licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all often cite as consideration, "for the sum of $1 and other good and valuable consideration."

However, some courts in the United States may take issue with nominal consideration, or consideration with virtually no value. Some courts have since thought this was a sham. Since contract disputes are typically resolved in state court, some state courts have found that merely providing $1 to another is not a sufficiently legal duty, and therefore no legal consideration passes in these kinds of deals, and consequently, no contract is formed. However, this is a minority position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/historical/2004/dec/030109.htm Supreme Court of Texas (1464-EIGHT, LTD. &amp; MILLIS MANAGEMENT CORP, v. GAIL ANN JOPPICH See section III)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-existing legal duties==
{{main article|Pre-existing duty rule}}
A party that ''already'' has a legal duty to provide money, an object, a service, or a forbearance, does not provide consideration when promising merely to uphold that duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Foakes v Beer |year=1884 |court=UKHL |num=1 |courtname=auto}}; See also {{cite AustLII|NSWSC|1390|2010|litigants=Andrew Hennessey v Architectus Group Holdings Pty Ltd |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|court=EWHC |division=KB |year=1809 |num=J58 |litigants=Stilk v Myrick |parallelcite=(1809) 170 ER 1168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wigan v Edwards'' (1973) 1 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 497.&lt;/ref&gt; That legal duty can arise from law, or obligation under a previous contract.

The prime example of this sub-issue is where an uncle gives his seven-year-old nephew (a resident of the US) the following offer: "if you do not smoke cigarettes or marijuana until your 18th birthday, then I will pay you $500". On the nephew's 18th birthday, he tells the uncle to pay up, and the uncle says no.  In the subsequent lawsuit, the uncle wins, because the nephew, by U.S. criminal law, already had a duty to refrain from smoking cigarettes while under 18, or marijuana at any age.

The same applies if the consideration is a performance for which the parties had previously contracted. For example, A agrees to paint B's house for $500, but halfway through the job A tells B that he will not finish unless B increases the payment to $750. If B agrees, and A then finishes the job, B still only needs to pay A the $500 originally agreed to, because A was already contractually obligated to paint the house for that amount.

An exception to this rule holds for [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]]s, such as an [[accord and satisfaction]].  If a creditor has a credit against a debtor for $10,000, and offers to settle it for $5,000, it is still binding, if accepted, even though the debtor had a legal duty to repay the entire $10,000.

Pre-existing duties relating to [[at-will employment]] depend largely on state law.  Generally, [[at-will employment]] allows the employer to terminate the employee for good or even no reason, and allows the employee to resign for any reason.  There are no duties of continued employment in the future.  Therefore, when an employee demands a raise, there is no issue with consideration because the employee has no legal duty to continue working.  Similarly, when an employer demands a pay-cut, there is also no contractual issue with consideration, because the employer has no legal duty to continue employing the worker.  However, certain states require additional consideration other than the prospect of continued employment, to enforce terms demanded later by the employer, in particular, non-competition clauses.

==Bundled terms==
Contracts where a legally valueless term is bundled with a term that does have legal value are still generally enforceable.

Consider the uncle's situation above. If the same uncle had instead told his 17-year-old nephew the following offer: "if you do not smoke cigarettes and do not engage females before your 18th birthday, then I will pay you $500".  On the nephew's 18th birthday, he asks the uncle to pay up, and this time, in the subsequent lawsuit, the nephew may win.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Although the promise of not smoking was not valuable consideration (it was already legally prohibited), virtually all states allow some sort of engagement by minors.  Even though the engagement by minors is legally restricted, there are circumstances where it is legal, and thus the promise to forbear from it entirely has legal value.  However, the uncle would still be relieved from the liability if his nephew smoked a cigarette, even though ''that'' consideration is valueless, because it was paired with something of legal value; therefore, adherence to the entire, collective agreement is necessary.

==Past consideration==
Generally, past consideration is not a valid consideration and has no legal value. Past consideration is consideration that has already flowed from the promisee to the promisor. That is, the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise. Past consideration therefore cannot be used as a basis when claiming damages.&lt;ref&gt;see {{cite BAILII|court= EWHC |num=J74 |year=1842 |litigants=Roscorla v Thomas |parallelcite=(1842) 114 ER 496}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to this rule is where there is a duty owed to a third party. 	An act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise. For this to hold, three conditions must be satisfied (Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980]):

# The act must have been done at the promisor’s request
# The parties must have understood the act was to be remunerated either by a payment or the conferment of some other benefit 
# Payment/conferment of the benefit must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance

==Option contracts and conditional consideration==
Generally, conditional consideration is valid consideration.

Suppose A is a movie script writer and B runs a movie production company.  A says to B, "buy my script." B says "How about this – I will pay you $5,000 so that you do not let anyone else produce your movie until one year from now.  If I do produce your movie in that year, then I will give you another $50,000, and no one else can produce it.  If I do not produce your movie in that year, then you're free to go."  If the two subsequently get into a dispute, the issue of whether a contract exists is answered.  B had an option contract—he could decide to produce the script, or not. B's consideration passed was the $5,000 down, and the possibility of $50,000.  A's consideration passed was the exclusive rights to the movie script for at least one year.

==In settlements==

Suppose B commits a [[tort]] against A, causing $5,000 in [[compensatory damages]] and $3,000 in [[punitive damages]].  Since there is no guarantee that A would win against B if it went to court, A may agree to drop the case if B pays the $5,000 compensatory damages.  This is sufficient consideration, since B's consideration is a guaranteed recovery, and A's consideration is that B only has to pay $5,000, instead of $8,000.

{{confused|alternate history}}

'''Counterfactual history''', also sometimes referred to as '''virtual history''', is a form of [[historiography]] that attempts to answer "[[wikt:what if|what if]]" questions known as [[counterfactuals]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bunzl, "Counterfactual History: A User's Guide," ''American Historical Review'' (2004) 109#3 pp. 845–858 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/530560 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Black and MacRaild provide this definition: "It is, at the very root, the idea of conjecturing on what did not happen, or what might have happened, in order to understand what did happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy Black|author2=Donald M. MacRaild|title=Studying History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQZeAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=125|isbn=9780230364929}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method seeks to explore history and historical incidents by means of extrapolating a timeline in which certain key historical events did not happen or had an outcome which was different from that which did in fact occur. It has produced a [[literary genre]] which is variously called [[alternate history|alternative history]], [[speculative fiction|speculative history]], or hypothetical history.&lt;ref name = "Arnold" /&gt;

One goal is to estimate the relative importance of a specific event, incident or person. For instance, to the counterfactual claim "What would have happened had [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] drunk [[coffee]] instead of [[tea]] on the afternoon he committed suicide?", the timeline would have remained unchanged—Hitler in all likelihood still would have committed suicide on April 30, 1945, regardless of what he had to drink that afternoon. However, to the counterfactual "What would have happened had Hitler died in the [[20 July plot|July 1944 assassination attempt]]?", all sorts of possibilities become readily apparent, starting with the assumption that the German generals, had they been able to consolidate power over remaining Nazi functionaries such as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], would probably have sued for peace, bringing an early end to [[World War II]]. (Historians generally feel popular support for the Party was still very strong in July 1944, and the party apparatus of Himmler, Goebbels, [[Albert Speer|Speer]], [[Martin Bormann|Bormann]], [[Hermann Göring|Göring]] etc. would survive even an assassination of Hitler.) Thus, the counterfactual brings into sharp relief the question of how important Hitler was as an individual and how his personal fate shaped the course of the war and, ultimately, of world history.

==Development==
Although there are [[Victorian era|Victorian]] examples of counterfactual history, it was not until the very late 20th century that the exploration of counterfactuals in history was to begin in earnest.

An early example is ''[[If It Had Happened Otherwise]]'' (1931) which features a contribution by [[Winston Churchill]] who examined what would have happened had [[Robert E. Lee]] won at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |title=If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg |first=Winston |last=Churchill |authorlink=Winston Churchill |publisher=The Churchill Centre |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105132718/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |archivedate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this volume is notable for featuring imagined histories by serious historians, the histories are presented in narrative form (in most cases with a fairly whimsical tone) without any analysis of the reasoning behind these scenarios, so they fall short of modern standards for serious counterfactual history and are closer to the fictional [[alternate history]] genre.

A significant foray into treating counterfactual scenarios seriously was made by the economic historian [[Robert Fogel]]. In his 1964 book ''[[Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History]]'', Fogel tried to use quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 had there been no railroads.&lt;ref name="eh.net"&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History – Book Reviews ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228010214/http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml |date=2006-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fogel hypothesizes that, in the absence of the railroad, America’s large canal system would have been expanded and its roads would have been improved through pavement; both of these improvements would take away from the social impact of the railroad. He estimates that “the level of per capita income achieved by January 1, 1890 would have been reached by March 31, 1890, if railroads had never been invented.”&lt;ref name="eh.net"/&gt;

Few further attempts to bring counterfactual history into the world of academia were made until the 1991 publication of ''[[Plausible Worlds|Plausible Worlds: Possibility and Understanding in History and the Social Sciences]]'' by the Cambridge sociologist [[Geoffrey Hawthorn]], who carefully explored three different counterfactual scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Frederic |last=Smoler |title=Past Tense |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/past-tense |journal=American Heritage |date=September 1999 |volume=50 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work helped inspire ''[[Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals]]'' (1997), a collection of essays exploring different scenarios by a number of historians, edited by the historian [[Niall Ferguson]]. Ferguson has become a significant advocate of counterfactual history, using counterfactual scenarios to illustrate his objections to deterministic theories of history such as [[Marxism]], and to put forward a case for the importance of contingency in history, theorizing that a few key changes could result in a significantly different modern world. A series of [[What If? (essays)|"What If?"]] books edited by [[Robert Cowley]] presented dozens of essays by historians or prominent writers about "how a slight turn of fate at a decisive moment could have changed the very annals of time."&lt;ref name = "Arnold"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/books/making-books-the-what-ifs-that-fascinate.html?src=pm|title=Making books: The 'What Ifs' that fascinate|last=Arnold|first=Martin|date=December 21, 2000|work=New York Times|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that a counterfactual is not as much a matter of what happened in the past but it is the disagreement about which past events were most significant. For example, William Thompson employs a sequence of counterfactuals for eight lead economies that have driven [[globalization]] processes for almost a thousand years. From [[Song dynasty]] in China to [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], and claims that each actor in succession played an unusually critical role in creating a structure of leadership that became increasingly global in scope across time.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson. W. The Lead Economy Sequence in World Politics (From Sung China to the United States): Selected Counterfactuals. Journal of Globalization Studies. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2010. pp. 6–28 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/126971/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences from alternate history===
Counterfactual history is neither [[historical revisionism]] nor [[alternate history]].

Counterfactual history distinguishes itself through its interest in the very incident that is being negated by the counterfactual, thus seeking to evaluate the event's relative historical importance. Such historians reason arguments for each change, outlining changes in broad terms only, as befits a mere byproduct of the exercise.

An alternate history writer, on the other hand, is interested precisely in the hypothetical scenarios that flow from the negated incident or event. A fiction writer is thus free to invent very specific events and characters in the imagined history.

The line is sometimes blurred as historians may invent more detailed timelines as illustrations of their ideas about the types of changes that might have occurred. But it is usually clear what general types of consequences the author thinks are reasonable to suppose would have been likely to occur, and what specific details are included in an imagined timeline only for illustrative purposes.

The line is further blurred by novelists such as [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], whose alternate-history novel ''[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]'' has a character talking of historians' use of counterfactuals, within the novel's alternate history. He dismisses this as "a useless exercise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/riceandsalt.htm|title=Kim Stanley Robinson: The Years of Rice and Salt – an infinity plus review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Most historians regard counterfactual history as perhaps entertaining, but not meeting the standards of mainstream historical research due to its speculative nature. Advocates of counterfactual history often respond that all statements about [[causality]] in history contain implicit counterfactual claims—for example, the claim that a certain military decision helped a country win a war presumes that if that decision had not been made, the war would have been less likely to be won, or would have been longer.

Since counterfactual history is such a recent development, a serious, systematic critique of its uses and methodologies has yet to be made, as the movement itself is still working out those methods and frameworks.

Aviezer Tucker has offered a range of criticism of this approach to the study of the past both in his review of Ferguson's ''Virtual History in History and Theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/0018-2656.00090 |title=Historiographical Counterfactuals and Historical Contingency |journal=History and Theory |volume=38 |number=2 |pages=264–276 |date=May 1999 |last=Tucker |first=Aviezer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book ''Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1171466/?site_locale=en_GB |title=Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography |last=Tucker |first=Aviezer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-83415-5 |doi=10.2277/0521834155}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has [[Richard J. Evans]] in his book ''Altered Pasts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/altered-pasts-counterfactuals-in-history-by-richard-j-evans/2012202.article|title=Altered Pasts: Counterfactuals in History, by Richard J.

'''Creativity''' (formerly known as '''The Church of the Creator''' and '''World Church of the Creator''') is a [[Naturalistic pantheism|pantheistic]] [[white separatism|white separatist]], [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]], [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] [[Religion|religion]] which has been classified as a [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] [[hate group]] by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/creativity-movement|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=10 February 2017|title=The Creativity Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in [[Lighthouse Point, Florida]] by [[Ben Klassen]] as the Church of the Creator in 1973. The worldview of Creativity is purported to be based on the "survival, expansion and advancement of the White race",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adl.org/education/resources/profiles/creativity-movement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-12/magazine/tm-915_1_hate-groups&lt;/ref&gt; according to the "external laws of nature, the experience of history, on logic and common sense"&lt;ref&gt;Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement&lt;/ref&gt; and members of the movement believe in a "racial holy war"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/creativity-movement-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1999/church-creator-timeline&lt;/ref&gt; between the "white and non-White races" (including [[Jews]], [[black people]] and non-white people of "mixed race").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/297/662/505536/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hate Crimes: Causes, Controls, and Controversies, page 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT: Issues and Tactics, page 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions, page 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration, page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Creativity is promoted by two organizations: the Creativity Alliance (CA – also known as the Church of Creativity) and the Creativity Movement (TCM). The groups have common origins.&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book

==Name==
Adherents of Creativity are known as ''Creators''. The church was originally founded as the ''Church of the Creator'' by Ben Klassen in 1973. [[Matthew F. Hale]] in 1996 formed a separate group known as the ''World Church of the Creator'' which largely supplanted the original Ben Klassen Church. The World Church of the Creator which – as of 2003 – has devolved into ''The Creativity Movement''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adl.org/education/resources/profiles/creativity-movement&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rights to use the name "Church of the Creator" was lost by Hale in the United States to the [[Church of the Creator]], an unaffiliated religious organization based in [[Ashland, Oregon]], in a trademark-infringement case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 3, 2000 |quote=[4] The names "Creativity" and "Creator" are derived from the foreword of the first edition of ''Nature's Eternal Religion'' by Ben Klassen. It states, "We call our religion Creativity, and members thereof, Creators, because, we believe these words, in essence, best describe the characteristic soul of the White Race."A church based in Oregon filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit Tuesday in federal court in Chicago against the World Church of the Creator, led by white supremacist Matthew Hale of Downstate East Peoria. |title=Church Sues Hale's Group Over Trademark |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-05-03/news/0005030331_1_white-supremacist-matthew-hale-world-church-trademark |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klassen |first=Ben |chapter=Foreword |title=[[Nature's Eternal Religion]] |location = Lighthouse Point, FL |publisher=Ken Klassen |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the Creativity movement is restricted to persons whose genetic heritage is "wholly or predominantly" from Europe or members of the white race, regardless of where they reside.&lt;ref name="World Church of the Creator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc3.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |website=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Creator" does not refer to a [[Creator deity|supernatural being]], but to adherents of Creativity and the White Race (which is credited with the creation of civilization).

Following the demise of the World Church of the Creator after Hale's arrest in 2003, there formed two distinct groups known as The Creativity Movement and the Creativity Alliance/Church of Creativity. The two groups are not known to interact with one another.

==Beliefs==
Creators are taught to hate non-whites and to avoid interacting with them socially. Creators are also expected to refute [[homosexuality]], [[miscegenation]], whining or complaining, and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativitymovement.org/creator_library/english/lwb-3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419014254/http://www.creativitymovement.org/creator_library/english/lwb-3.html |archivedate=April 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has sixteen race-based commandments and five fundamental beliefs which members regard as based on the "external laws of nature, the experience of history, on logic and common sense". These include the belief that "race is their religion", that the white race is "nature's finest", belief that race-loyalty is transcendent and that the "survival, expansion and advancement" of the white race on Earth is the "highest virtue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc1.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |website=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] is becoming "more decadent," as evidenced by "black crimes, the growing acceptance of homosexuality, interracial marriage, increasing drug use, and the lack of racial identity among white people".&lt;ref name="religioustolerance1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc1.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Anti-Defamation League]], members believe that [[Jewish people]] are working towards the enslavement of all races, and in particular the "mongrelization of the white race". Creators are encouraged to recite the "five fundamentals" daily.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Klassen encouraged Creators to refer to [[Black people]] as "[[nigger]]s" and openly opposed white supremacists who used more polite terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Baofu |first1 = Peter|year = 2009 |title = The Future of Post-Human Creative Thinking |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fPcYBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing |pages = 225-226 |access-date = 2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 2000s, they were encouraged to move to [[Central Illinois]] in order to establish a Creativity bastion.&lt;ref name="World Church of the Creator"/&gt; 

Creativity promotes a religious diet and health doctrine, called the 14 Points of Salubrious Living (a form of [[Raw veganism|raw-food veganism]]), although it is not a religious requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klassen |first=Ben |title=The Little White Book: Fundamentals of the White Racial Religion Creativity for Daily Reading and Affirmation of the White Faith |editor=Victor Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}}

===Heaven, hell and the supernatural===
Creativity is a non-supernatural religion which rejects the [[supernatural]] while affirming a pantheist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publiceye.org/racism/white-supremacy.html |title=The Website of Political Research Associates |website=PublicEye.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; view of nature, asserting that "everything is in nature" and defining it as "the whole cosmos, the total universe, including its millions of natural laws through space and time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klassen |first=Ben |chapter= The Laws of Nature Are Eternal |title=[[Nature's Eternal Religion]] |location = Lighthouse Point, FL |publisher=Ken Klassen }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Klassen, "A Creator is not superstitious and disdains belief in the supernatural. He will waste no time giving credence to, or playing silly games with imaginary spooks, spirits, gods and demons." Creators do not believe in a supernatural afterlife believing "immortality" to be genetic and memorial with a [[Eternal oblivion|cessation of consciousness]] at death. They believe that they should view [[Biological process|life]] and [[death]] on Earth in a "rational, fearless manner," concentrating on life's positive aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.creativitymovement.org/creator_library/english/wmb-59.html | title = Life, Death and Immortality | publisher = Creativity movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial socialism===
The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies Creativity's ideology as [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]],&lt;ref name=SPLC&gt;{{cite web |title=The Creativity Movement | url =http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/the-creativity-movement-0 |work=splcenter.org |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Klassen, Creativity is not a rehash of Nazism and he listed eight differences between his political ideology and that of the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Little White Book | author = Ben Klassen | date = 1991 | publisher = Church of the Creator | chapter = 13. Creativity Unique}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted the phrase "racial socialism" to describe his political ideology. Klassen was critical of [[democracy]] and advocated [[meritocracy]], believing that effective leaders should rule. Under racial socialism, "whites would work together toward common goals but without the massive economic planning in the style of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Gosplan]]." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Michael |first=George |title = Theology of Hate: a History of the World Church of the Creator |publisher = University Press of Florida |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8130-3350-1}}{{Page needed|date = January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported a limited [[market economy]], believing that social and economic activities should be in the best interests of white people. Klassen criticized "leftist proclivities" to recruit from the white working class: "All [white] members of the national or racial community ... had an important role to play."&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA" /&gt;

Klassen urged Creators to "work feverishly and aggressively to organize politically, to distribute literature on behalf of the White Race, to promote and foster White solidarity, and to get control of the government and the political machinery of the state by legal means if possible. If this is not possible by legal means, then we must resort to the same means as our forefathers used two hundred years ago to defend their liberty, their property, their homes and their families."{{cn|date=February 2017}}

===Activism===
Creativity advocates [[proselytism]]. Its goal is to place 10 million copies of two books, ''Nature's Eternal Religion'' and ''The White Man's Bible'', into the hands of white people as part of its belief in "gird[ing] up for total war".{{cn|date=February 2017}} It teaches the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]] in support of its perception that shifting population demographics is leading to [[miscegenation]].&lt;ref name="Hate Crimes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Barbara|title=Hate Crimes|date=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-275-99569-0|pages=The Victims of Hate Crime 37, Hate Crime Offenders 31}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]], the Creativity Movement opposes illegal activity and violence, believing it to be counterproductive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The church's member handbook threatens expulsion from the church for members who commit crimes or encourage others to do so. Despite this, the church has been connected to multiple religiously and racially inspired violent crimes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc2.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |work=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators view "racial holy war" (Rahowa) as a [[religious war]] of racial self-defense.&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=B. A. |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc3.htm |title=The Creativity Movement: Church Practices |work=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''White Man's Bible'' calls for readers to, "use any means, legal or otherwise, available to us for our own survival," leading to the hunting down and eliminating of "tormentors".&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt;

==Practices==
{{primary|section|date=March 2018}}
===Holidays===
The religion has several holidays. Creators are encouraged to observe them, spending time with their families and friends of the religion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativityalliance.com/creator-calendar/ |title=Creator Calendar – Creativity Alliance |website=Creativityalliance.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonies===
{{anchor|Religious ceremonies}}
Creativity has four sacraments: marriage, pledging for children, confirmation, and eulogizing the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Ben Klassen |title=The Little White Book | publisher = Church of the Creator | date = 1991 | chapter = 25. The Creator Wedding Ceremony," "26. The Creator Child Pledging Ceremony," "27. Ceremony of Confirmation ," "28. The Saying of Goodbyes to our Departed Brethren }}&lt;/ref&gt; All ceremonies are performed by church ministers. At a wedding, the bride and groom exchange vows before Nature. The pledging ceremony is ideally conducted a week after a child's birth, with both parents pledging to raise their child as a "loyal member of the White Race and faithful to the church." The confirmation ceremony may be performed on or after a child's 13th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, B. A |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc3.htm |title=The Creativity Movement |website=religioustolerance.org |publisher= |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministers===
{{anchor|Ordained ministers}}
On a now-defunct website, Klassen stated that anyone could be an ordained minister in his church, provided they were "a legitimate White Man or Woman over the age of 16."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacreator.com/US/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D69%26Itemid%3D79 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426080729/http://www.pacreator.com/US/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=79 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective ministers must demonstrate worthiness and pass written and oral examinations. The written exams consist of 150 questions (requiring a one-paragraph response to each) and an essay. Applicants are encouraged to request recommendations from three established ministers, and the final requirement is the signing of an [[oath]].&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"/&gt;

==Books==
{{anchor|Religious texts|''White Man's Bible''}}
Creativity's founding text is ''Nature's Eternal Religion'', which was written by Klassen in 1973. The book proposes that white people are the "supreme act of creation", and only white people are capable of divine creativity.&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terror_99.pdf | title = Terrorism in the United States | year = 1999 | place = US | publisher = Justice Department, FBI | page = 4 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book critiques [[Christianity]], including the [[Christian Bible]]. Many biblical stories, including those of [[Adam and Eve]], [[Jonah]] and the whale and the [[resurrection of Jesus]], are considered historically unlikely. The [[historicity of Jesus]] is also questioned, with Klassen saying that he can find no independent evidence of his existence.&lt;ref name=compass&gt;{{cite news |title= World Church of Creator founded in 1973 | url= http://helenair.com/news/national/article_5773df3b-088c-5698-85d6-b1cf64811cf5.html |newspaper= Helena Independent Record |date= March 27, 2004 |accessdate=December 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creativity, Christianity is a violent religion which has killed 1,000 fellow Christians for every Christian killed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].&lt;ref name="religioustolerance1"/&gt; Adherents do not believe in the existence of [[Jesus]], rejecting Christian teachings as a "suicidal poison" that was created by Jews and foisted on the white race. They reject the exhortation to love one's enemies, believing that enemies should be hated. Creators also reject the [[Golden Rule]], saying that it does not make "good sense" and at a "closer look" it is a "completely unworkable principle."&lt;ref name="religioustolerance1"/&gt;

Klassen published other books on his white supremacist philosophy, including ''The White Man's Bible'', which called for violence against any perceived threats to white people.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;

=={{anchor|Early years}}History==
Creativity was formed in 1973, when Klassen self-published ''Nature's Eternal Religion''. He attempted to recruit neo-Nazis into the church because, apart from disagreements over religion, there was no fundamental conflict between church doctrine and [[Nazism|National Socialism]]. Klassen developed a rapport with [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] leader [[William Luther Pierce]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Michael | first = George | title = Theology of Hate: a History of the World Church of the Creator | page = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; he met Pierce twice in 1975, and they maintained an "on and off" relationship for the next 18 years. According to Klassen, he "never did understand the logic of what [Pierce] called his [[Cosmotheism]] religion ... it has not been of any significance as far as our common goal of promoting White racial solidarity was concerned."{{cn|date=February 2017}} In ''Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs'', Klassen called Pierce "a great man and an outstanding intellectual thinker, and ... one of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Klassen | first = Ben | title = Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs | page = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Klassen established a Creativity headquarters in [[Otto, North Carolina]]. Although his family expected resistance from local residents, Klassen wrote: "We were not quite prepared for the viciousness of the onslaught by the local paper." Opposition grew, and a May 13, 1982 ''Franklin Press'' headline read: "Pro-Hitler, anti-Christ Leader Headquarters Here".&lt;ref&gt;Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date =July 2013}}

Several years after Klassen's 1993 death, white supremacist Matthew Hale founded the New Church of the Creator (later the World Church of the Creator).

They were stopped by police, who were suspicious that their vehicle had been stolen. According to the report, while being escorted to a nearby police station they detonated a smoke bomb and attempted to escape. Police discovered their abandoned vehicle five miles away; Grobbelaar and  White ambushed them.

===Ron McVan===
Ron McVan, co-founder of the [[Wotansvolk]] [[Neo-völkisch movements|neo-völkisch]] pagan group, was once affiliated with the Church of the Creator for two years as its second-in-command;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/lane.html |title=David Lane |website=Archive.adl.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; McVan contributed articles and artwork to its periodical, ''Racial Loyalty'', and was a martial-arts instructor for the church. Although Klassen and McVan shared anti-Christian beliefs, McVan sought a more spiritual approach and felt that Creativity needed spirituality. He moved to the Pacific Northwest and founded Wotan's Kindred in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1992, saying that the group was rooted in the "genetic character and collective identity" of the white race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodrick-Clarke|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|title=Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaiaM77s6N4C&amp;pg=PA274|year=2003|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-3155-0|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Jeffrey|authorlink=Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|title=Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNWbbhUYv8oC&amp;pg=PA201|year=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-0340-3|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardell|first=Mattias|authorlink=Mattias Gardell|title=Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIwwWSSL5JIC&amp;pg=PA222|year=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3071-7|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

McVan's associate and co-founder of Wotansvolk [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]] drew inspiration from Creativity, particularly ideas of a "racial religion", but didn't agree with Creativity's "atheistic" stance and considered himself [[Deism|deist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dobratz|first1=Betty A.|last2=Shanks-Meile|first2=Stephanie L.|title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!"|date=1997|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801865374|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r59bGyH4lOAC&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Christopher Gibbs===
William Christopher Gibbs, a Church of Creativity adherent in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and a member of the Creativity Alliance, was arrested for possession of the biological toxin [[Ricin#Chemical or biological warfare agent|ricin]]. Gibbs went to a hospital after he accidentally got the ricin on his hands while experimenting with it.&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cleary |first=Tom |url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/02/william-christopher-gibbs-georgia-white-supremacist-ricin-poison-photos-facebook-church-creativity/ |title=William Christopher Gibbs: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know |website=Heavy.com |date=2017-02-09 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 21, 2018, a Federal judge ordered Gibbss' release from Federal custody because of a technicality: ricin had been inexplicably dropped from the list of illegal biological toxins which are known as "select agents" due to changes in the 2004 law and edits to regulations in 2005. The judge did not rule out the possibility that Gibbs could be potentially convicted under another Federal law.  Gibbs continued to be incarcerated in the [[Fannin County, Georgia]] jail under a misdemeanor charge of reckless conduct which stemmed from his 2017 arrest and a probation violation connected to a 2010 conviction for burglary.&lt;ref&gt;Joyner, Chris (October 2, 2018) [https://www.myajc.com/news/crime--law/ricin-charges-dropped-against-georgia-white-supremacist/0GWcj07MLSMvcthfnApsWM/ "Ricin charges dropped against Georgia white supremacist"] ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before and during McCarty's leadership, Creativity was plagued with legal problems; members were arrested for conspiracy, unlawful firearms possession and their association with the July 1993 firebombing of an [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] building in [[Tacoma, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930730&amp;slug=1713586|title=Business {{!}} FBI Says Bombing Of Naacp Just A Start -- Suspects Planned Racial Rampage, Court Papers Allege {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarty struggled to keep the group unified. The lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), seeking damages related to the May 1991 murder of Harold Mansfield, Jr. by Creator George Loeb, finally led to a March 1994 court ruling which fined the Church of the Creator $1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/wcotc.html|title=You are being redirected...|website=archive.adl.org|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also ruled that Klassen's property sale to Pierce shortly before his suicide was collusion to deny payment to Mansfield's family, ordering Pierce to return his $85,000 profit from the resale of the property. With the church unable to pay the outstanding balance, the SPLC sued for its dissolution to settle the remaining damages and McCarty readily agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of State, Document # 237320644&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creativity Movement===
[[File:Trademarked logo of the creativity movement.jpg|thumb|alt=Letter W, crown and halo inside a black circle|Creativity Movement logo]]
Matthew F. Hale founded the New Church of the Creator in 1996 – later renamed the World Church of the Creator. Hale's World Church of the Creator was a new and separate group rather than a direct successor to Ben Klassen's Church of the Creator. Until his arrest in 2003, Hale was the only Pontifex Maximus of the now defunct World Church of the Creator. The current group known as The Creativity Movement is a [[white power skinhead]] oriented direct successor to Hale's World Church of the Creator.

==Leafletting campaigns==
In March 2015, leaflets were posted on doors in southern [[Liverpool]] in the United Kingdom saying: "The white race is nature’s finest". Cailen Cambeul, Creativity minister and then Pontifex Maximus for the Creativity Alliance, said that he was responsible for their distribution. Complaints were made to the police by local councilors. Sarah Jennings of the local [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] denounced Creativity as a "fringe group of blatant racists".&lt;ref name="Echo" /&gt; According to Cambeul, "Any politician claiming disgust at our flyers and seeking to make political gains via our 100-percent-legal message is partaking in an opportunistic abuse of power at the expense of innocent people exercising their rights to speak out against the injustices of a politically correct world."&lt;ref name=Echo&gt;{{cite news|title=Leaflet claiming "the white race is nature's finest" slammed after being delivered in south Liverpool|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/leaflet-claiming-the-white-race-8907506|accessdate=24 March 2015|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, northwest Montana and in particular the [[Flathead Valley]], part-time home of [[Alt-Right]] leader [[Richard B. Spencer]] has seen a "flurry of racist fliers" promoting the Creativity movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://flatheadbeacon.com/2017/11/21/flurry-racist-fliers-prompts-concern/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] listed Creativity Alliance presence in the state in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/active-neo-nazi-groups&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cruelty''' is indifference to [[suffering]] or [[pleasure]] in inflicting suffering. [[Sadomasochism|Sadism]] can also be related to this form of action or concept. Cruel ways of inflicting suffering may involve [[violence]], but affirmative violence is not necessary for an act to be cruel. For example, if a person is drowning and begging for help and another person is able to help with no cost or risk, but is merely watching with disinterest or perhaps mischievous amusement, that person is being cruel—rather than violent.

[[George Eliot]] stated that "cruelty, like every other [[vice]], requires no motive outside itself; it only requires opportunity."&lt;ref name="brainyquote1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/cruelty.html#z9RzI1eSJFMuWO4h.99 |title=Cruelty Quotes |publisher=BrainyQuote |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] stated that "the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists. That is why they invented Hell."&lt;ref name="brainyquote1"/&gt; [[G. K. Chesterton|Gilbert K. Chesterton]] stated that "cruelty is, perhaps, the worst kind of sin. Intellectual cruelty is certainly the worst kind of cruelty."&lt;ref name="brainyquote1"/&gt;

The word has [[metaphor]]ical uses, for example "[[Emyn Muil|The cliffs]] remained cruel." (i.e. unclimbable when they desperately needed to be climbed) in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==Usage in law==
The term ''cruelty'' is often used in [[law]] and [[criminology]] with regard to the treatment of animals, children, spouses, and prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?typed=cruelty%20&amp;type=1 |title=Cruelty |publisher=Law.com |accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[cruelty to animals]] is discussed, it often refers to ''unnecessary suffering.'' In [[criminal law]], it refers to [[punishment]], [[torture]], [[victimology|victimization]], [[wikt:draconian|draconian measures]], and [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=411|title=Cruelty to animals |publisher=Law.com|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/animal-cruelty/|title=Animal Cruelty Law &amp; Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal.com|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[divorce]] cases, many [[jurisdiction]]s permit a [[cause of action]] for [[torture|cruel and inhumane treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/cruel-and-inhuman-treatment/|title=Cruel and Inhuman Treatment Law &amp; Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal.com|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, cruelty is "the infliction of physical or mental distress, especially when considered a determinant in granting a divorce."&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term comes from Middle English, via the Old French term "crualte", which is based on Latin "crudelitas", from "crudelis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cruelty |title=cruelty: definition of cruelty in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defensive programming''' is a form of [[defensive design]] intended to ensure the continuing function of a piece of [[software]] under unforeseen circumstances. Defensive programming practices are often used where high availability, safety or security is needed.

Defensive programming is an approach to improve software and source code, in terms of:
* General quality – reducing the number of [[software bug]]s and problems.
* Making the source code comprehensible – the source code should be readable and understandable so it is approved in a [[code audit]].
* Making the software behave in a predictable manner despite unexpected inputs or user actions.

Overly defensive programming, however, may safeguard against errors that will never be encountered, thus wasting runtime and maintenance costs. There is also the risk that the code traps or prevents too many exceptions, potentially resulting in unnoticed, incorrect results.

== Secure programming ==
{{main|Secure coding}}

Secure programming is the subset of defensive programming concerned with [[computer security]]. That is to say, security is the concern, not necessarily safety or availability (the software may be allowed to fail in certain ways). As with all kinds of defensive programming, avoiding bugs is a primary objective, however the motivation is not as much to reduce the likelihood of failure in normal operation (as if safety was the concern), but to reduce the attack surface – the programmer must assume that the software might be misused actively to reveal bugs, and that bugs could be exploited maliciously.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;int risky_programming(char *input){
  char str[1000+1];  // One more for the null character.
  
  // ...
  
  strcpy(str, input);  // Copy input.
  
  // ...
}&lt;/source&gt;
The function will result in undefined behavior when the input is over 1000 characters. Some novice programmers may not feel that this is a problem, supposing that no user will enter such a long input. This particular bug demonstrates a vulnerability which enables [[buffer overflow]] [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s. Here is a solution to this example:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;int secure_programming(char *input){
  char str[1000+1];  // One more for the null character.

  // ...

  // Copy input without exceeding the length of the destination.
  strncpy(str, input, sizeof(str)); 

  // If strlen(input) &gt;= sizeof(str) then strncpy won't null terminate. 
  // We counter this by always setting the last character in the buffer to NUL,
  // effectively cropping the string to the maximum length we can handle.
  // One can also decide to explicitly abort the program if strlen(input) is 
  // too long.
  str[sizeof(str) - 1] = '\0';

  // ...
}&lt;/source&gt;

== Offensive programming ==
{{main|Offensive programming}}

Offensive programming is a category of defensive programming, with the added emphasis that certain errors should ''not'' be [[graceful degradation|handled defensively]]. In this practice, only errors from outside the program's control are to be handled (such as user input); the software itself, as well as data from within the program's line of defense, are to be trusted in this methodology.

=== Trusting internal data validity ===

;Overly defensive programming
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
const char* trafficlight_colorname(enum trafficlight_color c) {
    switch (c) {
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_RED:    return "red";
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_YELLOW: return "yellow";
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_GREEN:  return "green";
    }
    return "black"; // To be handled as a dead traffic light.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

;Offensive programming
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
const char* trafficlight_colorname(enum trafficlight_color c) {
    switch (c) {
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_RED:    return "red";
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_YELLOW: return "yellow";
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_GREEN:  return "green";
    }
    assert(0); // Assert that this section is unreachable.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Trusting software components ===

;Overly defensive programming
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
if (is_legacy_compatible(user_config)) {
    // Strategy: Don't trust that the new code behaves the same

== Techniques ==
Here are some defensive programming techniques:

=== Intelligent source code reuse ===
If existing code is tested and known to work, reusing it may reduce the chance of bugs being introduced.

However, reusing code is not ''always'' a good practice, because it also amplifies the damages of a potential attack on the initial code. {{clarify span|Reuse in this case may cause serious [[business process]] bugs.|plain=Busy logic bugs and security bugs are different things. The original text here explicitly talked about business logic, and it's still not clear what the problem is with reuse in business logic.|date=December 2016}}

==== Legacy problems ====
Before reusing old source code, libraries, APIs, configurations and so forth, it must be considered if the old work is valid for reuse, or if it is likely to be prone to [[Legacy system|legacy]] problems.

Legacy problems are problems inherent when old designs are expected to work with today's requirements, especially when the old designs were not developed or tested with those requirements in mind.

Many software products have experienced problems with old legacy source code, for example:
* [[Legacy code]] may not have been designed under a defensive programming initiative, and might therefore be of much lower quality than newly designed source code.
* Legacy code may have been written and tested under conditions which no longer apply. The old quality assurance tests may have no validity any more.
** '''Example 1''': legacy code may have been designed for ASCII input but now the input is UTF-8.
** '''Example 2''': legacy code may have been compiled and tested on 32-bit architectures, but when compiled on 64-bit architectures new arithmetic problems may occur (e.g. invalid signedness tests, invalid type casts, etc.).
** '''Example 3''': legacy code may have been targeted for offline machines, but becomes vulnerable once network connectivity is added.
* Legacy code is not written with new problems in mind. For example, source code written about 1990 is likely to be prone to many [[code injection]] vulnerabilities, because most such problems were not widely understood at that time.

Notable examples of the legacy problem:
* [[BIND|BIND 9]], presented by Paul Vixie and David Conrad as "BINDv9 is a [[Rewrite (programming)|complete rewrite]]", "Security was a key consideration in design",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://impressive.net/archives/fogo/20001005080818.O15286@impressive.net|title=fogo archive: Paul Vixie and David Conrad on BINDv9 and Internet Security by Gerald Oskoboiny &lt;gerald@impressive.net&gt;|website=impressive.net|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; naming security, robustness, scalability and new protocols as key concerns for rewriting old legacy code.
* [[Microsoft Windows]] suffered from "the" [[Windows Metafile vulnerability]] and other exploits related to the WMF format. Microsoft Security Response Center describes the WMF-features as ''"Around 1990, WMF support was added... This was a different time in the security landscape... were all completely trusted"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/01/13/417431.aspx|title=Looking at the WMF issue, how did it get there?|work=MSRC|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; not being developed under the security initiatives at Microsoft.
* [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] is combating legacy problems, such as old source code written without addressing concerns of [[SQL injection]] and [[privilege escalation]], resulting in many security vulnerabilities which has taken time to fix and also generated incomplete fixes. This has given rise to heavy criticism from security experts such as [[David Litchfield]], [[Alexander Kornbrust]], [[Cesar Cerrudo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2006/May/0039.html|title=Bugtraq: Oracle, where are the patches???|last=Litchfield|first=David|website=seclists.org|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2006/May/0045.html|title=Bugtraq: RE: Oracle, where are the patches???|last=Alexander|first=Kornbrust|date=|website=seclists.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2006/May/0083.html|title=Bugtraq: Re: [Full-disclosure] RE: Oracle, where are the patches???|last=Cerrudo|first=Cesar|date=|website=seclists.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional criticism is that default installations (largely a legacy from old versions) are not aligned with their own security recommendations, such as [http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/database-security/pdf/twp_security_checklist_database.pdf Oracle Database Security Checklist], which is hard to amend as many applications require the less secure legacy settings to function correctly.

=== Canonicalization ===
Malicious users are likely to invent new kinds of representations of incorrect data. For example, if a program attempts to reject accessing the file "/etc/[[Passwd (file)|passwd]]", a cracker might pass another variant of this file name, like "/etc/./passwd". [[Canonicalization]] libraries can be employed to avoid bugs due to non-[[Canonical form|canonical]] input.

=== Low tolerance against "potential" bugs ===
Assume that code constructs that appear to be problem prone (similar to known vulnerabilities, etc.) are bugs and potential security flaws.  The basic rule of thumb is: "I'm not aware of all types of [[security exploit]]s.  I must protect against those I ''do'' know of and then I must be proactive!".

===Other techniques===
&lt;!-- Please expand this article. These random notes should be changed to a more coherent article. --&gt;
* One of the most common problems is unchecked use of constant-size structures and functions for dynamic-size data (the [[buffer overflow]] problem). This is especially common for [[string (computer programming)|string]] data in [[C (programming language)|C]]. C library functions like &lt;tt&gt;gets&lt;/tt&gt; should never be used since the maximum size of the input buffer is not passed as an argument. C library functions like &lt;tt&gt;scanf&lt;/tt&gt; can be used safely, but require the programmer to take care with the selection of safe format strings, by sanitising it before using it.
* Encrypt/authenticate all important data transmitted over networks.  Do not attempt to implement your own encryption scheme, but use a proven one instead.
* All data is important until proven otherwise.
* All data is tainted until proven otherwise.
* All code is insecure until proven otherwise.
** You cannot prove the security of any code in [[userland (computing)|userland]], or, more canonically: ''"never trust the client"''.
* If data are to be checked for correctness, verify that they are correct, not that they are incorrect.
* [[Design by contract]]
** Design by contract uses [[precondition]]s, [[postcondition]]s and [[Invariant (computer science)|invariants]] to ensure that provided data (and the state of the program as a whole) is sanitized.  This allows code to document its assumptions and make them safely.  This may involve checking arguments to a function or method for validity before executing the body of the function.  After the body of a function, doing a check of object state (in [[object-oriented programming]] languages) or other held data and the return value before exits (break/return/throw/error code) is also wise.
* [[Assertion (computing)|Assertions]]
** Within functions, you may want to check that you are not referencing something that is not valid (i.e., null) and that array lengths are valid before referencing elements, especially on all temporary/local instantiations. A good heuristic is to not trust the libraries you did not write either. So any time you call them, check what you get back from them. It often helps to create a small library of "asserting" and "checking" functions to do this along with a logger so you can trace your path and reduce the need for extensive [[debugging]] cycles in the first place. With the advent of logging libraries and [[aspect oriented programming]], many of the tedious aspects of defensive programming are mitigated.
* Prefer [[Exception handling|exceptions]] to return codes
** Generally speaking, it is preferable to throw intelligible exception messages that enforce part of your [[application programming interface|API]] contract and guide the client [[programmer]] instead of returning values that a client programmer is likely to be unprepared for and hence minimize their complaints and increase robustness and security of your software. {{Dubious|date=June 2015}}

[[File:Simple electromagnet2.gif|thumb|A simple electromagnet consisting of a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core.  A core of ferromagnetic material like iron serves to increase the magnetic field created.&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics" /&gt;  The strength of magnetic field generated is proportional to the amount of current through the winding.&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics" /&gt;]]
[[File:VFPt Solenoid correct2.svg|thumb|Magnetic field produced by a [[solenoid]] (coil of wire).  This drawing shows a cross section through the center of the coil.  The crosses are wires in which current is moving into the page; the dots are wires in which current is moving up out of the page.]]

An '''electromagnet''' is a type of [[magnet]] in which the [[magnetic field]] is produced by an [[electric current]]. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of wire wound into a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]].  A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is concentrated in the hole in the center of the coil.   The wire turns are often wound around a [[magnetic core]] made from a [[ferromagnetic]] or [[ferrimagnetic]] material such as [[iron]]; the magnetic core concentrates the [[magnetic flux]] and makes a more powerful magnet.

The main advantage of an electromagnet over a [[permanent magnet]] is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding. However, unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power, an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.

Electromagnets are widely used as components of other electrical devices, such as [[Electric motor|motors]], [[Electric generator|generators]], [[Solenoid#Applications|electromechanical solenoid]]s, [[relay]]s, [[loudspeaker]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI machines]], scientific instruments, and [[magnetic separation]] equipment.  Electromagnets are also employed in industry for picking up and moving heavy iron objects such as scrap iron and steel.&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt;

The iron was [[varnish]]ed to insulate it from the windings. When a current was passed through the coil, the iron became magnetized and attracted other pieces of iron; when the current was stopped, it lost magnetization. Sturgeon displayed its power by showing that although it only weighed seven ounces (roughly 200 grams), it could lift nine pounds (roughly 4 kilos) when the current of a single-cell battery was applied. However, Sturgeon's magnets were weak because the uninsulated wire he used could only be wrapped in a single spaced out layer around the core, limiting the number of turns.

Beginning in 1830, US scientist [[Joseph Henry]] systematically improved and popularized the electromagnet.&lt;ref name="Cavicchi"&gt;{{cite paper

==Simple solenoid==

{{main|Solenoid}}

A common tractive electromagnet is a uniformly-wound [[solenoid]] and plunger. The solenoid is a coil of wire, and the plunger is made of a material such as soft iron.  Applying a current to the solenoid applies a force to the plunger and may make it move. The plunger stops moving when the forces upon it are balanced. For example, the forces are balanced when the plunger is centered in the solenoid.

The maximum uniform pull happens when one end of the plunger is at the middle of the solenoid. An approximation for the force {{mvar|F}} is&lt;ref name="Marks 105"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F = C A n I / l&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|C}} is a proportionality constant, {{mvar|A}} is the cross-sectional area of the plunger, {{mvar|n}} is the number of turns in the solenoid, {{mvar|I}} is the current through the solenoid wire, and {{mvar|l}} is the length of the solenoid. For units using inches, pounds force, and amperes with long, slender, solenoids, the value of {{mvar|C}} is around 0.009 to 0.010&amp;nbsp;psi (maximum pull pounds per square inch of plunger cross-sectional area).&lt;ref name="Marks 105-6"&gt;{{harvnb|Dawes|1967|loc=p. 15-105–15-106}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 12-inch long coil ({{math|1=''l''=12 in}}) with a long plunger of 1-square inch cross section ({{math|1=''A''=1 in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and 11,200 [[ampere-turn]]s ({{math|1=''n I''=11,200 Aturn}}) had a maximum pull of 8.75 pounds (corresponding to {{math|1=''C''=0.0094 psi}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawes|1967|loc=p. 15-106, Table 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum pull is increased when a magnetic stop is inserted into the solenoid. The stop becomes a magnet that will attract the plunger; it adds little to the solenoid pull when the plunger is far away but dramatically increases the pull when they are close. An approximation for the pull {{mvar|P}} is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawes|1967|loc=p. 15-106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = A n I [(n I / l_\mathrm{a}^2C_1^2) + (C /l)] = (A n^2 I^2 / l_\mathrm{a}^2C_1^2) + (C A n I/l)&lt;/math&gt;
Here {{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the distance between the end of the stop and the end of the plunger. The additional constant {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} for units of inches, pounds, and amperes with slender solenoids is about 2660&lt;!-- units --&gt;. The second term within the bracket represents the same force as the stop-less solenoid above; the first term represents the attraction between the stop and the plunger.

Some improvements can be made on the basic design. The ends of the stop and plunger are often conical. For example, the plunger may have a pointed end that fits into a matching recess in the stop. The shape makes the solenoid's pull more uniform as a function of separation. Another improvement is to add a magnetic return path around the outside of the solenoid (an "iron-clad solenoid").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawes|1967|loc=p. 15-106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Underhill |first=Charles R. |date=1906 |title=The Electromagnet |publisher=D.

[[File:Magnetic field of wire loop.svg|thumb|The magnetic field lines of a current-carrying loop of wire pass through the center of the loop, concentrating the field there]]
An electric current flowing in a wire creates a magnetic field around the wire, due to [[Ampere's circuital law|Ampere's law]] (see drawing below).   To concentrate the magnetic field, in an electromagnet the wire is wound into a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] with many turns of wire lying side by side.&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt; The magnetic field of all the turns of wire passes through the center of the coil, creating a strong magnetic field there.&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt; A coil forming the shape of a straight tube (a [[helix]]) is called a [[solenoid]].&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt;

The side of the magnet that the field lines emerge from is defined to be the ''north pole''.

Much stronger magnetic fields can be produced if a "[[magnetic core]]" of a [[soft magnetic material|soft]]  [[ferromagnetic]] (or [[ferrimagnetic]]) material, such as [[iron]], is placed inside the coil.&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A core can increase the magnetic field to thousands of times the strength of the field of the coil alone, due to the high [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]] μ of the material.&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt; This is called a ferromagnetic-core or iron-core electromagnet. However, not all electromagnets use cores, and the very strongest electromagnets, such as superconducting and the very high current electromagnets, cannot use them due to saturation.

===Ampere's law===
'''For definitions of the variables below, see box at end of article.'''

The magnetic field of electromagnets in the general case is given by [[Ampere's Law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \mathbf{J}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \oint \mathbf{H}\cdot d\mathbf{l}&lt;/math&gt;

which says that the integral of the magnetizing field H around any closed loop of the field is equal to the sum of the current flowing through the loop.  Another equation used, that gives the magnetic field due to each small segment of current, is the [[Biot–Savart law]].  Computing the magnetic field and force exerted by ferromagnetic materials is difficult for two reasons. First, because the strength of the field varies from point to point in a complicated way, particularly outside the core and in air gaps, where ''fringing fields'' and ''[[leakage flux]]'' must be considered.  Second, because the magnetic field B and force are [[nonlinear]] functions of the current, depending on the nonlinear relation between B and H for the particular core material used.  For precise calculations, computer programs that can produce a model of the magnetic field using the [[finite element method]] are employed.

=== Magnetic core ===
The material of a [[magnetic core]] (often made of [[iron]] or steel) is composed of small regions called [[magnetic domains]] that act like tiny magnets (see [[ferromagnetism]]).  Before the current in the electromagnet is turned on, the domains in the iron core point in random directions, so their tiny magnetic fields cancel each other out, and the iron has no large-scale magnetic field.  When a current is passed through the wire wrapped around the iron, its [[magnetic field]] penetrates the iron, and causes the domains to turn, aligning parallel to the magnetic field, so their tiny magnetic fields add to the wire's field, creating a large magnetic field that extends into the space around the magnet. The effect of the core is to concentrate the field, and the magnetic field passes through the core more easily than it would pass through air.

The larger the current passed through the wire coil, the more the domains align, and the stronger the magnetic field is.  Finally, all the domains are lined up, and further increases in current only cause slight increases in the magnetic field: this phenomenon is called [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation]].

When the current in the coil is turned off, in the magnetically soft materials that are nearly always used as cores, most of the domains lose alignment and return to a random state and the field disappears.  However, some of the alignment persists, because the domains have difficulty turning their direction of magnetization, leaving the core a weak permanent magnet.  This phenomenon is called [[hysteresis]] and the remaining magnetic field is called [[remanence|remanent magnetism]]. The residual magnetization of the core can be removed by [[degaussing]]. In alternating current electromagnets, such as are used in motors, the core's magnetization is constantly reversed, and the remanence contributes to the motor's losses.

=== Magnetic circuit – the constant ''B'' field approximation ===
[[Image:Electromagnet with gap.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Magnetic field ''(&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;)'' of a typical electromagnet, with the iron core ''C'' forming a closed loop with two air gaps ''G'' in it.&lt;br /&gt; 
''B'' – magnetic field in the core&lt;br /&gt;
''B&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' – "fringing fields".  In the gaps ''G'' the magnetic field lines "bulge" out, so the field strength is less than in the core:   ''B&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;br /&gt;
''B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''  – [[leakage flux]]; magnetic field lines which don't follow complete magnetic circuit&lt;br /&gt;
''L'' – average length of the magnetic circuit used in eq. 1 below.  It is the sum of the length ''L&lt;sub&gt;core&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the iron core pieces and the length ''L&lt;sub&gt;gap&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the air gaps ''G''.&lt;br /&gt;
Both the leakage flux and the fringing fields get larger as the gaps are increased, reducing the force exerted by the magnet. ]]

In many practical applications of electromagnets, such as motors, generators, transformers, lifting magnets, and loudspeakers, the iron core is in the form of a loop or [[magnetic circuit]], possibly broken by a few narrow air gaps.&lt;ref name=" Merzouki" /&gt;  This is because the magnetic field lines are in the form of closed loops. Iron presents much less "resistance" ([[reluctance]]) to the magnetic field than air, so a stronger field can be obtained if most of the magnetic field's path is within the core.&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt;

Since most of the magnetic field is confined within the outlines of the core loop, this allows a simplification of the mathematical analysis.&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt;  See the drawing at right.  A common simplifying assumption satisfied by many electromagnets, which will be used in this section, is that the magnetic field strength ''B'' is constant around the [[magnetic circuit]] (within the core and air gaps) and zero outside it.  Most of the magnetic field will be concentrated in the core material ''(C)''.  Within the core the magnetic field ''(B)'' will be approximately uniform across any cross section, so if in addition the core has roughly constant area throughout its length, the field in the core will be constant.&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt;  This just leaves the air gaps ''(G)'', if any, between core sections.   In the gaps the magnetic field lines are no longer confined by the core, so they 'bulge' out beyond the outlines of the core before curving back to enter the next piece of core material, reducing the field strength in the gap.&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt;  The bulges ''(B&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;)'' are called ''fringing fields''.&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt;  However, as long as the length of the gap is smaller than the cross section dimensions of the core, the field in the gap will be approximately the same as in the core.  In addition, some of the magnetic field lines ''(B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)'' will take 'short cuts' and not pass through the entire core circuit, and thus will not contribute to the force exerted by the magnet.  This also includes field lines that encircle the wire windings but do not enter the core.  This is called ''[[leakage flux]]''.   Therefore, the equations in this section are valid for electromagnets for which:
# the magnetic circuit is a single loop of core material, possibly broken by a few air gaps
# the core has roughly the same cross sectional area throughout its length.
# any air gaps between sections of core material are not large compared with the cross sectional dimensions of the core.
# there is negligible leakage flux
The main nonlinear feature of [[ferromagnetic]] materials is that the B field [[magnetic saturation|saturates]] at a certain value,&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt; which is around 1.6 to 2 [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]] (T) for most high permeability core steels.&lt;ref name="Pauley"&gt;"''Saturation flux levels of various magnetic materials range up to 24.5 kilogauss''" (2.5 T) p.1  "''Silicon steel saturates at about 17 kilogauss''" (1.7 T) p.3  {{cite journal| last =Pauley| first =Donald E.| title =Power Supply Magnetics Part 1: Selecting transformer/inductor core material| journal =Power Conversion and Intelligent Motion| volume =| issue =| pages =| date =March 1996| url =http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=4396| issn =| doi =| id =| accessdate =September 19, 2014| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141224075136/http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=4396| archivedate =December 24, 2014| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MagneticMaterials"&gt;The most widely used magnetic core material, 3% silicon steel, has saturation induction of 20 kilogauss (2 T). {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The B field increases quickly with increasing current up to that value, but above that value the field levels off and becomes almost constant, regardless of how much current is sent through the windings.&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt;   So the maximum strength of the magnetic field possible from an iron core electromagnet is limited to around 1.6 to 2 T.&lt;ref name="Pauley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Short" /&gt;

=== Magnetic field created by a current ===
The magnetic field created by an electromagnet is proportional to both the number of turns in the winding, ''N'', and the current in the wire, ''I'', hence this product, ''NI'', in [[Ampere (unit)|ampere]]-turns, is given the name [[magnetomotive force]].   For an electromagnet with a single [[magnetic circuit]], of which length ''L''&lt;sub&gt;core&lt;/sub&gt; of the magnetic field path is in the core material and length ''L''&lt;sub&gt;gap&lt;/sub&gt; is in air gaps, Ampere's Law reduces to:&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;NI = H_{\mathrm{core}} L_{\mathrm{core}} + H_{\mathrm{gap}} L_{\mathrm{gap}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;NI = B \left(\frac{L_{\mathrm{core}}}{\mu} + \frac{L_{\mathrm{gap}}}{\mu_0} \right)  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad (1)  \,&lt;/math&gt;
::where
::&lt;math&gt;\mu = B/H\,&lt;/math&gt;  is the [[magnetic permeability]] of the core material at the particular ''B'' field used.
::&lt;math&gt;\mu_0 = 4 \pi (10^{-7}) \ \mathrm{N} \cdot \mathrm{A}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; is the permeability of free space (or air); note that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt; in this definition is [[amperes]].

This is a [[nonlinear equation]], because the [[Magnetic permeability|permeability]] of the core, ''μ'', varies with the magnetic field ''B''.  For an exact solution, the value of ''μ'' at the ''B'' value used must be obtained from the core material [[Hysteresis loop|hysteresis curve]].&lt;ref name="Merzouki" /&gt;  If ''B'' is unknown, the equation must be solved by [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]].  However, if the magnetomotive force is well above saturation, so the core material is in saturation, the magnetic field will be approximately the saturation value ''B&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the material, and won't vary much with changes in ''NI''.  For a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap) most core materials saturate at a magnetomotive force of roughly 800 ampere-turns per meter of flux path.

For most core materials, &lt;math&gt;\mu_r = \mu / \mu_0 \approx 2000 - 6000\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;  So in equation (1) above, the second term dominates.  Therefore, in magnetic circuits with an air gap, the strength of the magnetic field ''B'' depends strongly on the length of the air gap, and the length of the flux path in the core doesn't matter much. Given an air gap of 1mm, a magnetomotive force of about 796 Ampere-turns is required to produce a magnetic field of 1T.

=== Force exerted by magnetic field ===
The force exerted by an electromagnet on a section of core material is:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{B^2 A}{2 \mu_0}   \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad (2)   \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the core.  The force equation can be derived from the [[Magnetic energy|energy stored in a magnetic field]]. [[Energy]] is force times distance. Rearranging terms yields the equation above.

The 1.6&amp;nbsp;T limit on the field&lt;ref name="Pauley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Short" /&gt; mentioned above sets a limit on the maximum force per unit core area, or [[magnetic pressure]], an iron-core electromagnet can exert; roughly:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{F}{A} = \frac {B_{sat}^2}{2 \mu_0}  \approx 1000\ \mathrm{kPa} = 10^6 \mathrm{N/m^2} = 145\ \mathrm{lbf} \cdot \mathrm{in}^{-2}\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--(1.6**2)/(2*4*pi*10**-7)--&gt;
In more intuitive units it's useful to remember that at 1&amp;nbsp;T the magnetic pressure is approximately 4 atmospheres, or kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Given a core geometry, the B field needed for a given force can be calculated from (2); if it comes out to much more than 1.6 T, a larger core must be used.

=== Closed magnetic circuit ===
[[File: Lifting electromagnet cross section.png|thumb|Cross section of lifting electromagnet like that in above photo, showing cylindrical construction. The windings ''(C)'' are flat copper strips to withstand the Lorentz force of the magnetic field.  The core is formed by the thick iron housing ''(D)'' that wraps around the windings.]]

For a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap), such as would be found in an electromagnet lifting a piece of iron bridged across its poles, equation (1) becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{NI\mu}{L}  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad (3)  \,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into (2), the force is:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\mu^2 N^2 I^2 A}{2\mu_0 L^2}  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad (4)  \,&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that to maximize the force, a core with a short flux path ''L'' and a wide cross-sectional area ''A'' is preferred (this also applies to magnets with an air gap).  To achieve this, in applications like lifting magnets (see photo above) and [[loudspeaker]]s a flat cylindrical design is often used.  The winding is wrapped around a short wide cylindrical core that forms one pole, and a thick metal housing that wraps around the outside of the windings forms the other part of the magnetic circuit, bringing the magnetic field to the front to form the other pole.

=== Force between electromagnets ===
The above methods are applicable to electromagnets with a [[magnetic circuit]] and do not apply when a large part of the magnetic field path is outside the core.  An example would be a magnet with a straight cylindrical core like the one shown at the top of this article. For electromagnets (or permanent magnets) with well defined 'poles' where the field lines emerge from the core, the force between two electromagnets can be found using the 'Gilbert model' which assumes the magnetic field is produced by fictitious 'magnetic charges' on the surface of the poles, with pole strength ''m'' and units of [[Ampere (unit)|Ampere]]-turn meter.  Magnetic pole strength of electromagnets can be found from:

&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{NIA}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

The force between two poles is:

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{4\pi r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This model doesn't give the correct magnetic field inside the core and thus gives incorrect results if the pole of one magnet gets too close to another magnet.

==Side effects==
There are several side effects which occur in electromagnets which must be provided for in their design.  These generally become more significant in larger electromagnets.

===Ohmic heating===
[[Image:Current carrying busbars at the LNCMI.jpg|thumb|Large aluminum busbars carrying current into the electromagnets at the [[LNCMI]] (Laboratoire National des Champs Magnétiques Intenses) high field laboratory.]]

The only power consumed in a [[Direct current|DC]] electromagnet under steady state conditions is due to the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the windings, and is dissipated as heat.  Some large electromagnets require cooling water circulating through pipes in the windings to carry off the [[waste heat]].

Since the magnetic field is proportional to the product ''NI'', the number of turns in the windings ''N'' and the current ''I'' can be chosen to minimize heat losses, as long as their product is constant.   Since the power dissipation, ''P = I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R'', increases with the square of the current but only increases approximately linearly with the number of windings, the power lost in the windings can be minimized by reducing ''I'' and increasing the number of turns ''N'' proportionally, or using thicker wire to reduce the resistance.  For example, halving I and doubling N halves the power loss, as does doubling the area of the wire. In either case, increasing the amount of wire reduces the ohmic losses. For this reason, electromagnets often have a significant thickness of windings.

However, the limit to increasing ''N'' or lowering the resistance is that the windings take up more room between the magnet's core pieces.  If the area available for the windings is filled up, more turns require going to a smaller diameter of wire, which has higher resistance, which cancels the advantage of using more turns.  So in large magnets there is a minimum amount of heat loss that can't be reduced.  This increases with the square of the [[magnetic flux]] ''B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''.

===Inductive voltage spikes===
An electromagnet has significant [[inductance]], and resists changes in the current through its windings.  Any sudden changes in the winding current cause large voltage spikes across the windings.  This is because when the current through the magnet is increased, such as when it is turned on, energy from the circuit must be stored in the magnetic field.  When it is turned off the energy in the field is returned to the circuit.

If an ordinary [[switch]] is used to control the winding current, this can cause sparks at the terminals of the switch.  This doesn't occur when the magnet is switched on, because the limited supply voltage causes the current through the magnet and the field energy to increase slowly,  but when it is switched off, the energy in the magnetic field is suddenly returned to the circuit, causing a large voltage spike and an [[Electric arc|arc]] across the switch contacts, which can damage them.  With small electromagnets a [[capacitor]] is sometimes used across the contacts, which reduces arcing by temporarily storing the current.  More often a [[diode]] is used to prevent voltage spikes by providing a path for the current to recirculate through the winding until the energy is dissipated as heat.  The diode is connected across the winding, oriented so it is reverse-biased during steady state operation and doesn't conduct.  When the supply voltage is removed, the voltage spike forward-biases the diode and the reactive current continues to flow through the winding, through the diode and back into the winding. A diode used in this way is called a [[freewheeling diode]] or [[flyback diode]].

Large electromagnets are usually powered by variable current electronic [[power supply|power supplies]], controlled by a [[microprocessor]],  which prevent voltage spikes by accomplishing current changes slowly, in gentle ramps.  It may take several minutes to energize or deenergize a large magnet. 

===Lorentz forces===
In powerful electromagnets, the magnetic field exerts a force on each turn of the windings, due to the [[Lorentz force]] &lt;math&gt;q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\,&lt;/math&gt;   acting on the moving charges within the wire.  The Lorentz force is perpendicular to both the axis of the wire and the magnetic field.  It can be visualized as a pressure between the [[magnetic field lines]], pushing them apart.  It has two effects on an electromagnet's windings:
* The field lines within the axis of the coil exert a radial force on each turn of the windings, tending to push them outward in all directions. This causes a [[tensile stress]] in the wire.
* The leakage field lines between each turn of the coil exert a repulsive force between adjacent turns, tending to push them apart.
The Lorentz forces increase with ''B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''.   In large electromagnets the windings must be firmly clamped in place, to prevent motion on power-up and power-down from causing [[metal fatigue]] in the windings.  In the [[Bitter electromagnet|Bitter]] design, below, used in very high field research magnets, the windings are constructed as flat disks to resist the radial forces, and clamped in an axial direction to resist the axial ones.

===Core losses===
In [[alternating current]] (AC) electromagnets, used in [[transformer]]s, [[inductor]]s, and [[AC motor]]s and [[Electric generator|generators]], the magnetic field is constantly changing.  This causes energy losses in their [[magnetic core]]s that is dissipated as heat in the core.  The losses stem from two processes:
* ''[[Eddy current]]s'': From [[Faraday's law of induction]], the changing magnetic field induces circulating [[electric current]]s inside nearby conductors,  called [[eddy current]]s.  The energy in these currents is dissipated as heat in the [[electrical resistance]] of the conductor, so they are a cause of energy loss.   Since the magnet's iron core is conductive, and most of the magnetic field is concentrated there, [[eddy current]]s in the core are the major problem.  Eddy currents are closed loops of current that flow in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field.  The energy dissipated is proportional to the area enclosed by the loop. To prevent them, the cores of AC electromagnets are made of stacks of thin steel sheets, or [[lamination]]s, oriented parallel to the magnetic field, with an insulating coating on the surface.  The insulation layers prevent eddy current from flowing between the sheets.  Any remaining eddy currents must flow within the cross-section of each individual lamination, which reduces losses greatly.  Another alternative is to use a [[ferrite core]], which is a nonconductor.
* ''[[Hysteresis loss]]es'': Reversing the direction of magnetization of the [[magnetic domain]]s in the core material each cycle causes energy loss, because of the [[coercivity]] of the material.  These losses are called [[hysteresis]].  The energy lost per cycle is proportional to the area of the [[hysteresis loop]] in the ''BH'' graph.  To minimize this loss, magnetic cores used in transformers and other AC electromagnets are made of "soft" low coercivity materials, such as [[silicon steel]] or [[soft ferrite]].
The energy loss per cycle of the AC current is constant for each of these processes, so the power loss increases linearly with [[frequency]].

=== Superconducting electromagnets ===
[[Image:Small small IMG 0836.jpg|thumb|The most powerful electromagnet in the world, the 45 T hybrid Bitter-superconducting magnet at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, Florida, USA]]

{{main|Superconducting magnet}}
When a magnetic field higher than the ferromagnetic limit of 1.6 T is needed, [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnets]] can be used.  Instead of using ferromagnetic materials, these use [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] windings cooled with [[liquid helium]], which conduct current without [[electrical resistance]].  These allow enormous currents to flow, which generate intense magnetic fields.  Superconducting magnets are limited by the field strength at which the winding material ceases to be superconducting. Current designs are limited to 10–20 T, with the current (2017) record of 32 T.&lt;ref name="nationalmaglab"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The necessary refrigeration equipment and [[cryostat]] make them much more expensive than ordinary electromagnets.  However, in high power applications this can be offset by lower operating costs, since after startup no power is required for the windings, since no energy is lost to ohmic heating.  They are used in [[particle accelerator]]s and [[MRI]] machines.

=== Bitter electromagnets ===
{{main|Bitter electromagnet}}
Both iron-core and superconducting electromagnets have limits to the field they can produce.  Therefore, the most powerful man-made magnetic fields have been generated by ''air-core'' nonsuperconducting electromagnets of a design invented by [[Francis Bitter]] in 1933, called [[Bitter electromagnet]]s.&lt;ref name="MagnetLabU"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of wire windings, a Bitter magnet consists of a [[solenoid]] made of a stack of conducting disks, arranged so that the current moves in a helical path through them, with a hole through the center where the maximum field is created.  This design has the mechanical strength to withstand the extreme [[Lorentz force]]s of the field, which increase with ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The disks are pierced with holes through which cooling water passes to carry away the heat caused by the high current. The strongest continuous field achieved solely with a resistive magnet is 37.5 T {{as of|2014|March|31|lc=y}}, produced by a Bitter electromagnet at the [[Radboud University]] High Field Magnet Laboratory in [[Nijmegen, Holland]].&lt;ref name="Dutch record"&gt;{{cite news |title=HFML sets world record with a new 37.5 tesla magnet |url=http://www.ru.nl/hfml/news/news/news-items/hfml-sets-world/ |accessdate=21 May 2014 |publisher=High Field Magnet Laboratory |date=31 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904093407/http://www.ru.nl/hfml/news/news/news-items/hfml-sets-world/ |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record was 35 T.&lt;ref name="MagnetLab"/&gt; The strongest continuous magnetic field overall, 45 T,&lt;ref name="MagnetLabU" /&gt; was achieved in June 2000 with a hybrid device consisting of a Bitter magnet inside a superconducting magnet.

The [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] compresses the magnetic field to values of around 1000 T&lt;ref name="MagnetLabU" /&gt; for a few microseconds. While this method may seem very destructive, it is possible to redirect the brunt of the blast radially outwards so that neither the experiment nor the magnetic structure are harmed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3578">The '''[[Incantation|enchanted]] [[loom]]''' is a famous metaphor for the [[human brain]] invented by the pioneering neuroscientist [[Charles S. Sherrington]] in a passage from his 1942 book ''Man on his nature'', in which he poetically describes his conception of what happens in the cerebral cortex during arousal from sleep:{{Ref label|A|a|none}}

{{quote|The great topmost sheet of the mass, that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved, becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither. The brain is waking and with it the mind is returning. It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance. Swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of subpatterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sherrington |first=C.S. |title=Man on his nature |year=1942 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=178 |isbn=978-0-8385-7701-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "loom" he refers to was undoubtedly meant to be a [[Jacquard loom]], used for weaving fabric into complex patterns. The Jacquard loom, invented in 1801, was the most complex mechanical device of the early 19th century. It was controlled by a [[punch card]] system that was a forerunner of the system used in computers until the 1970s. With as many as thousands of independently movable shuttles, a Jacquard loom in operation must have appeared very impressive. If Sherrington had written a decade later, however, he might perhaps have chosen the flashing lights on the front panel of a computer as his metaphor instead.

According to the neuroscience historian Stanley Finger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Minds Behind the Brain |author=Finger, S. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |pages=1 |isbn=978-0-19-508571-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherrington probably borrowed the loom metaphor from an earlier writer, the psychologist Fredric Myers, who asked his readers to "picture the human brain as a vast manufactory, in which thousands of looms, of complex and differing patterns, are habitually at work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Multiplex personality |author=Myers, F.W.H. |journal=Proc Soc Psych Res |volume=4 |year=1887 |pages=496–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps in part because of its slightly cryptic nature, the "enchanted loom" has been an attractive metaphor for many writers about the brain, and has supplied the title for several books, including the following:

{{Evolutionary biology}}
Many [[scientist]]s and [[Philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] have described '''evolution as fact and theory''', a phrase which was used as the title of an article by [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in 1981. He describes ''fact'' in science as meaning [[data]], not absolute certainty but "confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent". A [[scientific theory]] is a well-substantiated explanation of such facts. The facts of [[evolution]] come from observational evidence of current processes, from imperfections in organisms recording historical [[common descent]], and from transitions in the [[fossil]] record. Theories of evolution provide a provisional explanation for these facts.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay (1981) [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html "Evolution as Fact and Theory"] ''Discover'' 2 (May): 34-37; Reprinted in ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'' New York: W. W. Norton, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o6g2tvN0nJoC&amp;pg=PA253 pp. 253-262.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the words "evolution", "fact" and "theory" has several meanings in different contexts. ''Evolution'' means change over time, as in [[stellar evolution]]. In [[biology]] it refers to observed changes in organisms, to their descent from a common ancestor, and at a technical level to a change in [[gene frequency]] over time; it can also refer to explanatory theories (such as [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]]) which explain the mechanisms of evolution. To a scientist, ''fact'' can describe a repeatable observation that all can agree on; it can refer to something that is so well established that nobody in a community disagrees with it; and it can also refer to the truth or falsity of a proposition. To the public, ''theory'' can mean an opinion or conjecture (''e.g.'', "it's only a theory"), but among scientists it has a much stronger connotation of "well-substantiated explanation". With this number of choices, people can often talk past each other, and meanings become the subject of [[Ordinary language philosophy|linguistic analysis]].

Evidence for evolution continues to be accumulated and tested. The scientific literature includes statements by evolutionary [[biologist]]s and philosophers of science demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact and theory.

==Evolution, fact and theory==
Evolution has been described as "fact and theory"; "fact, not theory"; "only a theory, not a fact"; "multiple theories, not fact"; and "neither fact, nor theory."&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Evolution as theory and fact in the literature|section 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreements among these statements, however, have more to do with the meaning of words than the substantial issues and this controversy is discussed below.

===Evolution===
{{Life timeline}}
{{Main|Introduction to evolution|Evolution}}
Professor of biology [[Jerry Coyne]] sums up biological evolution succinctly:
:''Life on earth evolved gradually beginning with one primitive species—perhaps a self-replicating molecule—that lived more than 3.5 billion years ago; it then branched out over time, throwing off many new and diverse species; and the mechanism for most (but not all) of evolutionary change is natural selection.''{{sfn|Coyne|2009|p=3}}

This shows the breadth and scope of the issue, incorporating the scientific fields of [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[genetics]], [[geology]], and [[paleontology]], among many others.

But the central core of evolution is generally defined as changes in trait or gene frequency in a population of organisms from one generation to the next.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|p=400}} This has been dubbed the standard genetic definition of evolution. Natural selection is only one of several mechanisms in the theory of evolutionary change that explains how organisms historically adapt to changing environments. The principles of heredity were re-discovered in 1900, after Darwin's death, in [[Gregor Mendel]]'s research on the inheritance of simple trait variations in peas.{{sfn|Wright|1984}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Subsequent work into genetics, [[mutation]], paleontology, and [[developmental biology]] expanded the applicability and scope of Darwin's original theory.

According to [[Douglas J. Futuyma]]:
:''Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different [[allele]]s within a population (such as those determining [[blood type]]s) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest [[Obcell|proto-organism]] to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.''{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

The word ''evolution'' in a broad sense refers to processes of change, from stellar evolution to changes in language. In biology, the meaning is more specific: heritable changes which accumulate over generations of a population. Individual organisms do not evolve in their lifetimes, but variations in the genes they inherit can become more or less common in the population of organisms. Any changes during the lifetime of organisms which are not inherited by their offspring are not part of biological evolution.&lt;ref name="Moran_What"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html |title=What is Evolution? |last=Moran |first=Laurence |year=1993 |website=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To [[Keith Stewart Thomson]], the word evolution has at least three distinct meanings:&lt;ref name="Thomson_1982"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=Keith Stewart |authorlink=Keith Stewart Thomson |date=September–October 1982 |title=Marginalia: The meanings of evolution |journal=[[American Scientist]] |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |publisher=[[Sigma Xi]] |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=529–531 |jstor=27851662 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The general sense of ''change over time''.
#All life forms have descended with modifications from ancestors in a process of common descent.
#The cause or mechanisms of these process of change, that are examined and explained by evolutionary theories.

Thomson remarks: "Change over time is a fact, and descent from common ancestors is based on such unassailable logic that we act as though it is a fact. Natural selection provides the outline of an explanatory theory."&lt;ref name="Thomson_1982" /&gt;

Biologists consider it to be a scientific fact that evolution has occurred in that modern organisms differ from past forms, and evolution is still occurring with discernible differences between organisms and their descendants. There is such strong quantitative support for the second that scientists regard common descent as being as factual as the understanding that in the [[Solar System]] the Earth orbits the Sun, although the examination of the fundamentals of these processes is still in progress. There are several theories about the mechanisms of evolution, and there are still active debates about specific mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Moran_fact_theory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html |title=Evolution is a Fact and a Theory |last=Moran |first=Laurence |year=1993 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a fourth meaning for the word ''evolution'' that is ''not'' used by biologists today. In 1857, the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] defined it as "change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous." He claimed (before Darwin) that this was "settled beyond dispute" for organic evolution and applied it to the evolution of star systems, geology and human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spencer |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Spencer |date=January–April 1857 |title=Progress: its Law and Cause |url=http://hsmt.history.ox.ac.uk/hsmt/courses_reading/undergraduate/authority_of_nature/week_3/spencer.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Westminster Review]] |series=New Series |location=London |publisher=[[John Chapman (publisher)|John Chapman]] |volume=11 |page=446 |oclc=26747836 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Spencer by 1865 was admitting that his definition was imperfect,{{sfn|Spencer|1865|p=[https://archive.org/stream/firstprinciples17spengoog#page/n188/mode/2up 176]}} but it remained popular throughout the nineteenth century before declining under the criticisms of [[William James]] and others.{{sfn|James|1911|loc=[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/j/james/william/memories/chapter6.html Chapter 6: "Herbert Spencer's Autobiography"]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.american-philosophy.org/events/documents/2011_Program_files/S_brady_saap_2011_paper.doc |title=Evolutionary Opponents: William James and Herbert Spencer |last=Brady |first=Michael |date=March 12, 2011 |conference=Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy |conference-url=http://american-philosophy.org/events/saap_2011_program.htm |location=Cheney, WA |format=DOC |accessdate=2013-06-10}} Paper presented at the 38th Annual Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact===
{{Main|Scientific fact}}
Fact is often used by scientists to refer to experimental or empirical data or [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] verifiable observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[WordNet]] |title=scientific fact |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=scientific+fact |accessdate=2013-02-21 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |location=Princeton, NJ |quote=(an observation that has been confirmed repeatedly and is accepted as true (although its truth is never final))}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Views of the National Park Service Glossary |title=Fact |url=http://www2.nature.nps.gov/views/System/Glossary.htm#F |accessdate=2013-02-21 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |location=Washington, D.C. |quote=In science, a fact is an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true.' Truth is science, however, is never final, and what is accepted as a fact today may be modified or even discarded at some point in the future. Source: [[National Academy of Sciences]] (1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fact" is also used in a wider sense to mean any theory for which there is overwhelming evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language  (1996) gives a third meaning of the word "fact" as "(3) A truth known by actual experience or observation; something known to be true: ''‘Scientists gather facts about plant growth.’''"&lt;/ref&gt;
:''A fact is a hypothesis that is so firmly supported by evidence that we assume it is true, and act as if it were true.'' &amp;mdash;Douglas J. Futuyma{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}

In the sense that evolution is overwhelmingly validated by the evidence, it is a fact. It is frequently said to be a fact in the same way as the Earth's revolution around the Sun is a fact.{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |last2=Coyne |first2=Jerry |authorlink2=Jerry Coyne |date=September 1, 2005 |title=One side can be wrong |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following quotation from [[Hermann Joseph Muller]]'s article, "One Hundred Years Without Darwinism Are Enough," explains the point.

:''There is no sharp line between speculation, hypothesis, theory, principle, and fact, but only a difference along a sliding scale, in the degree of probability of the idea. When we say a thing is a fact, then, we only mean that its probability is an extremely high one: so high that we are not bothered by doubt about it and are ready to act accordingly. Now in this use of the term fact, the only proper one, evolution is a fact.''&lt;ref name="Muller_1959"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Hermann Joseph |authorlink=Hermann Joseph Muller |date=April 1959 |title=One Hundred Years Without Darwinism Are Enough |url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/evolut/100pcnts.htm |journal=School Science and Mathematics |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=304–305 |doi=10.1111/j.1949-8594.1959.tb08235.x |ref=harv}} Reprinted in: {{harvnb|Zetterberg|1983|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Academy of Sciences]] (U.S.) makes a similar point:

:''Scientists most often use the word "fact" to describe an observation. But scientists can also use fact to mean something that has been tested or observed so many times that there is no longer a compelling reason to keep testing or looking for examples. The occurrence of evolution in this sense is a fact. Scientists no longer question whether descent with modification occurred because the evidence supporting the idea is so strong.''&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 1999|NAS 1999]], [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=28 p. 28]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Jay Gould also points out that "Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments: establishing the fact of evolution, and proposing a theory—natural selection—to explain the mechanism of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1981}}, citing {{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |title=[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]] |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1871 |pages=152–153}} The book is available from [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=165 The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online]. Retrieved 2015-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; These two aspects are frequently confused. Scientists continue to argue about particular explanations or mechanisms at work in specific instances of evolution – but the fact that evolution has occurred, and is still occurring, is undisputed.

A common misconception is that evolution cannot be reliably observed because it all happened millions of years ago and the science therefore is not dependent on facts (in the initial sense above). However, both Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], the co-founders of the theory, and all subsequent biologists depend primarily on observations of living organisms; Darwin concentrated largely on the breeding of domesticated animals whereas Wallace started from the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] distribution of species in the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Malay Archipelago]]. In the early twentieth century, [[population genetics]] had centre stage, and more recently [[DNA]] has become the main focus of observation and experimentation.

Philosophers of science argue that we do not know mind-independent empirical truths with absolute certainty: even direct observations may be "theory laden" and depend on assumptions about our senses and the measuring instruments used. In this sense all facts are provisional.&lt;ref name="Moran_fact_theory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html |title=Evolution and Philosophy: Is Evolution Science, and What Does 'Science' Mean? |year=1997 |last=Wilkins |first=John S. |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
{{Main|Scientific theory}}
The [[Theory#Scientific theories|scientific definition]] of the word "theory" is different from the definition of the word in [[wiktionary:colloquial|colloquial]] use. In the vernacular, "theory" can refer to guesswork, a simple [[conjecture]], an [[opinion]], or a [[Speculative reason|speculation]] that does not have to be based on facts and need not be framed for making testable predictions.

In science, however, the meaning of theory is more rigorous. A scientific theory is "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, [[Scientific law|law]]s, inferences, and tested [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 1999|NAS 1999]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Theories are formed from hypotheses that have been subjected repeatedly to tests of evidence which attempt to disprove or [[falsifiability|falsify]] them. In the case of evolution through natural selection, Darwin conceived the hypothesis around 1839, and made a first draft of the concept three years later in 1842. He discussed this widely with many of his intellectual companions, and conducted further research in the background to his other writings and work. After years of development, he finally published his evidence and theory in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Wyhe |first=John |authorlink=John van Wyhe |date=May 22, 2007 |title=Mind the gap: Did Darwin avoid publishing his theory for many years? |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=1 |journal=[[Notes and Records|Notes and Records of the Royal Society]] |location=London |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=177–205 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2006.0171 |accessdate=2015-01-17 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "theory of evolution" is actually a network of theories that created the [[research program]] of biology. Darwin, for example, proposed five separate theories in his original formulation, which included mechanistic explanations for:
# [[Anagenesis|populations changing over generations]]
# [[Gradualism#Geology and biology|gradual]] change
# [[speciation]]
# [[natural selection]]
# [[common descent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bock |first=Walter J. |date=May 2007 |title=Explanations in evolutionary theory |journal=[[Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=89–103 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2007.00412.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since Darwin, evolution has become a well-supported body of interconnected statements that explains numerous empirical observations in the natural world. Evolutionary theories continue to generate testable predictions and explanations about living and fossilized organisms.&lt;ref name="Fitzhugh_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fitzhugh |first=Kirk |authorlink=Kirk J.

[[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] theory is an example of evolutionary theory. It is based on the evolutionary premise of an ancestral descendant sequence of genes, populations, or species. Individuals that evolve are linked together through historical and genealogical ties. [[Phylogenetic tree|Evolutionary trees]] are hypotheses that are inferred through the practice of phylogenetic theory. They depict relations among individuals that can speciate and diverge from one another. The evolutionary process of speciation creates groups that are linked by [[monophyly|a common ancestor and all its descendants]]. Species inherit traits, which are then passed on to descendants. Evolutionary biologists use [[systematics|systematic]] methods and test phylogenetic theory to [[Talk:Evolution/FAQ#Has evolution ever been observed?|observe]] and explain changes in and among species over time. These methods include the collection, measurement, observation, and mapping of traits onto evolutionary trees. Phylogenetic theory is used to test the independent distributions of traits and their various forms to provide explanations of observed patterns in relation to their evolutionary history and biology.{{sfn|Wiley|Lieberman|2011|p=300}}{{Verify source|type=page number|date=January 2015}}{{sfn|Schuh|2000}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}} The [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]] is used to study evolution as a null model against which tests for natural selection can be applied.

==Evolution as theory and fact in the literature==
The following sections provide specific quotable references from evolutionary biologists and philosophers of science demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact and theory.

===Evolution as fact===
*American zoologist and paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] stated that "Darwin... finally and definitely established evolution as a fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_stat.htm |title=Is the theory of evolution merely a 'theory'? |last=Robinson |first=Bruce A. |website=Religioustolerance.org |publisher=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |location=Kingston, Ontario |accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hermann Joseph Muller wrote, "So enormous, ramifying, and consistent has the evidence for evolution become that if anyone could now disprove it, I should have my conception of the orderliness of the universe so shaken as to lead me to doubt even my own existence. If you like, then, I will grant you that in an absolute sense evolution is not a fact, or rather, that it is no more a fact than that you are hearing or reading these words."&lt;ref name="Muller_1959" /&gt;
*[[Kenneth R. Miller]] writes, "evolution is as much a fact as anything we know in science."{{sfn|Miller|2007}}
*[[Ernst Mayr]] observed, "The basic theory of evolution has been confirmed so completely that most modern biologists consider evolution simply a fact. How else except by the word evolution can we designate the sequence of faunas and floras in precisely dated geological strata? And evolutionary change is also simply a fact owing to the changes in the content of gene pools from generation to generation."{{sfn|Mayr|1988}}

===Evolution as fact ''and'' theory===
"Fact" is commonly used to refer to the observable changes in organisms' traits over generations while the word "theory" is reserved for the mechanisms that cause these changes:

*Writing in 1930, biologist [[Julian Huxley]] entitled the third book of the wide-ranging series ''[[The Science of Life]]'', which dealt with the fossil record and the evidence of plant and animal structures, ''The Incontrovertible Fact of Evolution''. He also says "Natural Selection...is not a theory but a fact. But does it...suffice to account for the whole spectacle of Evolution?...There we come to speculative matter, to theories." But he concludes that "the broad positions of Darwinism re-emerge from a scrutiny of the most exacting sort essentially unchanged."{{sfn|Wells|Huxley|Wells|1931|pp=[http://www.unz.org/Pub/WellsHG-1931-00425?View=PDF 429], [http://www.unz.org/Pub/WellsHG-1931-00600?View=PDFPages 600]}} In 1932, a portion of the book was republished under the title ''Evolution, Fact and Theory''.
*Stephen Jay Gould writes, "...evolution ''is'' a theory. It is also a fact. And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts do not go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of gravitation replaced [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s, but apples did not suspend themselves in mid-air, pending the outcome. And humans evolved from apelike ancestors whether they did so by Darwin's proposed mechanism or by some other, yet to be discovered."{{sfn|Gould|1981}}
*Similarly, biologist [[Richard Lenski]] says, "Scientific understanding requires both facts and theories that can explain those facts in a coherent manner. Evolution, in this context, is both a fact and a theory. It is an incontrovertible fact that organisms have changed, or evolved, during the history of life on Earth. And biologists have identified and investigated mechanisms that can explain the major patterns of change."&lt;ref name="Lenski_2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/lenski.html |title=Evolution: Fact and Theory |last=Lenski |first=Richard E. |authorlink=Richard Lenski |date=September 2000 |website=actionbioscience |publisher=[[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory]] notes, "biologists rarely make reference to 'the theory of evolution,' referring instead simply to 'evolution' (i.e., the fact of descent with modification) or 'evolutionary theory' (i.e., the increasingly sophisticated body of explanations for the fact of evolution). That evolution is a theory in the proper scientific sense means that there is both a fact of evolution to be explained and a well-supported mechanistic framework to account for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gregory |first1=T. Ryan |authorlink=T.

===Evolution as fact and ''not'' theory===

Other commentators – focusing on the changes in species over generations and in some cases common ancestry – have stressed, in order to emphasize the weight of supporting evidence, that evolution is a fact, arguing that the use of the term "theory" is not useful:
*[[Richard Lewontin]] wrote, "It is time for students of the evolutionary process, especially those who have been misquoted and used by the creationists, to state clearly that evolution is ''fact'', not theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewontin  |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard Lewontin |date=September 1981 |title=Evolution/Creation Debate: A Time for Truth |journal=[[BioScience]] |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] on behalf of the American Institute of Biological Sciences |volume=31 |issue=8  |page=559 |doi=10.1093/bioscience/31.8.559 |ref=harv}} Reprinted in: {{harvnb|Zetterberg|1983|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Douglas J. Futuyma writes in ''Evolutionary Biology'' (1998), "The statement that organisms have descended with modifications from common ancestors—the historical reality of evolution—is not a theory. It is a fact, as fully as the fact of the earth's revolution about the sun."{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}
*[[Richard Dawkins]] says, "One thing all real scientists agree upon is the fact of evolution itself. It is a fact that we are cousins of gorillas, kangaroos, starfish, and bacteria. Evolution is as much a fact as the heat of the sun. It is not a theory, and for pity's sake, let's stop confusing the philosophically naive by calling it so. Evolution is a fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |date=December 2005 |title=The Illusion of Design |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/1105/1105_feature1.html |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |publisher=Natural History Magazine, Inc. |volume=114 |issue=9 |pages=35–37 |accessdate=2015-01-19 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Neil Campbell (scientist)|Neil Campbell]] wrote in his 1990 biology textbook, "Today, nearly all biologists acknowledge that evolution is a fact. The term theory is no longer appropriate except when referring to the various models that attempt to explain how life evolves... it is important to understand that the current questions about how life evolves in no way implies any disagreement over the fact of evolution."{{sfn|Campbell|1990|p=434}}

===Evolution as a collection of theories ''not'' fact===
Evolutionary biologist [[Kirk J. Fitzhugh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.org/site/research-collections/polychaetous-annelids/research-studies |title=Recent Research by J. Kirk Fitzhugh, Ph.D. |website=Polychaetous Annelids Research Studies |publisher=[[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] |location=Los Angeles, CA |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that scientists must be cautious to "carefully and correctly" describe the nature of scientific investigation at a time when evolutionary biology is under attack from creationists and proponents of intelligent design. Fitzhugh writes that while facts are states of being in nature, theories represent efforts to connect those states of being by causal relationships:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{"'}}Evolution' cannot be both a theory and a fact. Theories are concepts stating cause–effect relations. Regardless of one's certainty as to the utility of a theory to provide understanding, it would be epistemically incorrect to assert any theory as also being a fact, given that theories are not objects to be discerned by their state of being."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fitzhugh recognizes that the "theory" versus "fact" debate is one of semantics. He nevertheless contends that referring to evolution as a "fact" is technically incorrect and distracts from the primary "goal of science, which is to continually acquire causal understanding through the critical evaluation of our theories and hypotheses." Fitzhugh concludes that the "certainty" of evolution "provides no basis for elevating any evolutionary theory or hypothesis to the level of fact."&lt;ref name="fitzhugh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitzhugh|first1=Kirk|title=Fact, theory, test and evolution|department=Letter to the Editor|journal=Zoologica Scripta|date=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1463-6409.2007.00308.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.nsta.org/publications/press/stopfakingit.aspx Dr William C. Robertson] writing for National Science Teachers Association writes, "I have heard too many scientists claim that evolution is a fact, often in retort to the claim that it is just a theory. Evolution isn’t a fact. Rather than claiming so, I think scientists would be better served to agree that evolution is a theory and then proceed to explain what a theory is -- a coherent explanation that undergoes constant testing and often revision over a period of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roIk6e6yKEEC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=I+have+heard+too+many+scientists+claim+that+evolution+is+a+fact,+often+in+retort+to+the+claim+that+it+is+just+a+theory.+Evolution+isn%E2%80%99t+a+fact.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iTi-EVUsUu&amp;sig=kvJgmQx6NUfoEpFJMI6BDlDTStg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1stWaitnPAhWMWj4KHSBmB2kQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20have%20heard%20too%20many%20scientists%20claim%20that%20evolution%20is%20a%20fact,%20often%20in%20retort%20to%20the%20claim%20that%20it%20is%20just%20a%20theory.%20Evolution%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20fact.&amp;f=false|title=Answers to Science Questions from the Stop Faking It!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3551">'''Experimental tourism''' is a novel approach to [[tourism]] in which visitors do not visit the ordinary [[tourist attraction]]s (or, at least not with the ordinary approach), but allow whim to guide them. It is an alternative form of tourism in which destinations are chosen not on their standard touristic merit but on the basis of an idea or experiment. It often involves elements of [[humor]], [[serendipity]], and [[Randomness|chance]].

There are a number of approaches to experimental tourism:
*[[Aerotourism]] – in which a tourist visits the local airport and explores it without going anywhere.
*[[Alphatourism]] – in which a tourist finds the first street alphabetically on a map, and the last street alphabetically, draws a straight line (or any other figure they desire) between them, and walk the path between the two points.
*[[Alternating Travel]] – in which a tourist leaves their front door, turns right, turns left at the next intersection, turns right at the next, and so on, alternating each direction, until they are unable to continue because of an obstruction.
*[[Blindfolded tourism]] or Cecitourism – in which a blindfolded tourist is escorted through the city by a guide.
*[[Contretourism]] – in which a tourist visits a famous tourist site, but turns their back on the site and takes photos of, or just examines, the view from that direction.
*[[Erotourism]] – in which a couple travels separately to the same city and then tries to find each other.
*[[Monopolytourism]] – in which a tourist takes the local version of a [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board with them and visits places on the board as determined by a roll of the [[dice]].
*[[Nyctalotourism]] – in which the tourist only visits tourist attractions between dusk and dawn.
*[[Sagittatourism]] – in which a [[person]] [[throws]] an [[arrow]] (often a [[dart arrow]]) on a [[map]], and [[travel]]s to the [[Location (geography)|place]] the arrow hit on the map.

Other ideas do not have particular names:

*"Touring" a home town.  Stay at a [[youth hostel]], [[Backpacking (travel)|backpack]] through town, meet new people, do not go home until the vacation is over.
*Taking a map of the town being visited, selecting a random map grid, and exploring every bit of the grid.
*Visiting a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], asking the [[bartender]] where their favorite bar is and what they drink there.  Visit that bar, do the same with the bartender there, and continue.

The concept of experimental travel was developed by writer Joel Henry, the [[France|French]] director of the Laboratory of Experimental Tourism (Latourex).

In 2005, [[Lonely Planet]] published ''The Lonely Planet Guide to Experimental Travel'', which formalised and developed many of Henry's ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">At [[common law]], the '''fleeing felon rule''' permits the [[use of force]], including [[deadly force]], against an individual who is suspected of a [[felony]] and is in clear flight.  According to David Caplan "Immediate stopping of the fleeing felon, whether actually or presumably dangerous, was deemed absolutely necessary for the security of the people in a free state, and for maintaining the "public security." ... "  Indeed, it has been said that the social policy of the common law in this matter was not only to threaten dangerous felons and hence deter them, but was also to induce them to "surrender peaceably" if they dared commit inherently dangerous felonies, rather than allow them to "escape trial for their crimes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Even Deadly Force |url=https://saf.org/journal/12/CAPLAN.htm| accessdate=2009-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. law==
Under [[U.S. law]] the fleeing felon rule was limited in 1985 to non-lethal force in most cases by ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]],'' {{ussc|471|1}}. The justices held that deadly force "may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others."&lt;ref name="robertankony"&gt;Robert C. Ankony, "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', Jul. 2012, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|text=A police officer may not seize an unarmed, nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead...however...Where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.|sign=Justice Byron White|source=&lt;cite&gt;Tennessee v.

Fleeing felons may be followed into places not open to the public without a warrant if the officer is in "[[hot pursuit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

== Legal meaning in the United States ==
Though many fundamental rights are also widely considered human rights, the classification of a right as "fundamental" invokes specific legal tests courts use to determine the constrained conditions under which the United States government and various state governments may limit these rights. In such legal contexts, courts determine whether rights are fundamental by examining the historical foundations of those rights and by determining whether their protection is part of a longstanding tradition. Individual states may guarantee other rights as fundamental. That is, States may add to fundamental rights but can never diminish or infringe upon fundamental rights by legislative processes. Any such attempt, if challenged, may involve a "strict scrutiny" review in court.

== Specific jurisdictions ==

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Charter of Rights and Freedoms}}
In [[Canada]], the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] outlines four Fundamental Freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html |title=Canadian Charter Of Rights And Freedoms |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are freedom of:
* [[Freedom of conscience|Conscience]] and [[freedom of religion|religion]]
* Thought, belief, opinion, and expression, including [[freedom of the press]] and other media of communication
* Peaceful assembly
* Association.

=== European Union ===
{{Main|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}
Europe has no identical doctrine (It would be incompatible with the more restrained role of judicial review in European law.) However, EU law recognizes many of the same human rights and protects them through other means.

See also: [[Copenhagen criteria#Human rights|Copenhagen criteria]], and [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which every member state of the EU has to comply with and for which the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has final appellate jurisdiction.

=== India ===
The Indian fundamental rights, contrasted with such rights contained in the US bill of rights, present several peculiarities.The fundamental rights in India are far more elaborate than in the United States. Thus, for example, the US bill of rights (first ten amendments) only names some rights. The Supreme Court, through the process of judicial review, decides the limitations on these rights.
{{Main|Fundamental Rights in India}}

There are seven main fundamental rights of India:
* right to [[equality before the law|equality]]
* right to freedom, which includes [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of expression|expression]], right to assemble peacefully, freedom to form associations or unions, right to move freely throughout the territory of [[India]], right to reside or settle in any part of the territory of [[India]], right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation. 
* right to [[freedom of religion]]
* right against [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]]
* cultural and [[right to education|educational rights]]
* right to constitutional remedies
* right to vote(but above 18 years)

Newly implemented 7th Fundamental right in India is
* right to education

It was added in the constitution after the 86th amendment in the year 2002 under article 21A. It is the most recently implemented fundamental right. The RTE Act enabled this right in the year 2010.

A recent addition was made to the list of fundamental rights in India in 2017.
* right to privacy.

=== United States ===
In American [[United States constitutional law|Constitutional Law]], ''fundamental rights'' have special significance under the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Those rights enumerated in the U.S. Constitution are recognized as "fundamental" by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. According to the Supreme Court, enumerated rights that are incorporated are so fundamental that any law restricting such a right must both serve a compelling state purpose and be [[narrowly tailored]] to that [[compelling purpose]].

The original interpretation of the [[United States Bill of Rights]] was that only the Federal Government was bound by it. In 1835, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Barron v Baltimore]]'' unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states. During post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] was adopted in 1868 to rectify this condition, and to specifically apply the whole of the Constitution to all U.S. states. In 1873, the Supreme Court essentially nullified the key language of the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment that guaranteed all "[[Privileges and Immunities Clause|privileges and immunities]]" to all U.S. persons, in a series of cases called the [[Slaughter-House Cases|Slaughterhouse cases]]. This decision and others allowed post-emancipation racial discrimination to continue largely unabated.

Later Supreme Court justices found a way around these limitations without overturning the Slaughterhouse precedent: they created a concept called Selective Incorporation. Under this legal theory, the court used the remaining 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment protections for equal protection and due process to [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|"incorporate" individual elements of the Bill of Rights against the states]]. "The test usually articulated for determining fundamentality under the Due Process Clause is that the putative right must be '[[Palko v. Connecticut#Court.27s Decision|implicit in the concept of ordered liberty]]', or '[[Moore v. East Cleveland|deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.]]'" [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14074967920400304312&amp;q=lutz+york&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,48 Compare page 267 Lutz v. City of York, Pa., 899 F. 2d 255 - United States Court of Appeals, 3rd Circuit, 1990].

This set in motion a continuous process under which each individual right under the Bill of Rights was incorporated, one by one. That process has extended more than half a century, with the free speech clause of the [[First Amendment]] first incorporated in 1925 in [[Gitlow v New York]]. The most recent amendment completely incorporated as fundamental was the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] right to possess and [[bear arms]] for personal self-defense, in [[McDonald v Chicago]], handed down in 2010.

Not all clauses of all amendments have been incorporated. For example, states are not required to obey the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s requirement of indictment by [[grand jury]]. Many states choose to use [[preliminary hearing]]s instead of grand juries. It is possible that future cases may incorporate additional clauses of the Bill of Rights against the states.

The Bill of Rights lists specifically enumerated rights. The Supreme Court has extended fundamental rights by recognizing several fundamental rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution, including but not limited to:
* The right to interstate travel
* The right to parent one's children&lt;ref&gt;''[[Troxel v. Granville]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[right to privacy]]&lt;ref&gt;see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=right+to+privacy&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,10&amp;case=12998230422916570030&amp;scilh=0 ''Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford''], 141 U.S. 250 (1891)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right to marriage&lt;ref&gt;''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' &amp; ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right of self-defense  
Any restrictions a government statute or policy places on these rights are evaluated with [[strict scrutiny]].  If a right is denied to everyone, it is an issue of [[substantive due process]]. If a right is denied to some individuals but not others, it is also an issue of [[equal protection]]. However, any action that abridges a right deemed fundamental, when also violating equal protection, is still held to the more exacting standard of strict scrutiny, instead of the less demanding rational basis test.

During the [[Lochner era]], the right to [[freedom of contract]] was considered fundamental, and thus restrictions on that right were subject to [[strict scrutiny]].  Following the 1937 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]'', though, the right to contract became considerably less important in the context of [[substantive due process]] and restrictions on it were evaluated under the [[rational basis]] standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">In [[mathematics]], the '''Gabriel–Popescu theorem''' is an embedding theorem for certain [[abelian category|abelian categories]], introduced by {{harvs|txt|first1=Pierre|last1=Gabriel|author1-link=Pierre Gabriel|first2=Nicolae|last2=Popescu|author2-link=Nicolae Popescu|year=1964}}. It characterizes certain abelian categories (the [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]]) as [[Quotient of an abelian category|quotients]] of [[module categories]].

There are several generalizations and variations of the Gabriel–Popescu theorem, given by {{harvtxt|Kuhn|1994}} (for an [[AB5 category]] with a set of [[Generator (category theory)|generators]]), {{harvtxt|Lowen|2004}}, {{harvtxt|Porta|2010}} (for [[triangulated categories]]).

==Theorem==
Let ''A'' be a [[Grothendieck category]] (an [[AB5 category]] with a generator), ''G'' a generator of ''A'' and ''R'' be the [[endomorphism ring|ring of endomorphisms]] of ''G''; also, let ''S'' be the
[[functor]] from ''A'' to Mod-''R'' (the category of right ''R''-modules) defined by ''S''(''X'') = Hom(''G'',''X''). Then the Gabriel–Popescu theorem states that ''S'' is [[full functor|full]] and [[faithful functor|faithful]] and has an [[exact functor|exact]] [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]].

This implies that ''A'' is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[Serre quotient category]] of Mod-''R'' by a certain [[localizing subcategory]] ''C''. (A localizing subcategory of Mod-''R'' is a full subcategory ''C'' of Mod-''R'', closed under arbitrary [[direct sum]]s, such that for any [[short exact sequence]] of modules &lt;math&gt;0\rarr M_1\rarr M_2\rarr M_3\rarr 0&lt;/math&gt;, we have ''M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''C'' if and only if ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' are in ''C''. The Serre quotient of Mod-''R'' by any localizing subcategory is a Grothendieck category.) We may take ''C'' to be the [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] of the left adjoint of the functor ''S''.

Note that the embedding ''S'' of ''A'' into Mod-''R'' is [[Left exact functor|left-exact]] but not necessarily right-exact: cokernels of morphisms in ''A'' do not in general correspond to the cokernels of the corresponding morphisms in Mod-''R.''

== Origin ==
The horse shoe metaphor was used as early as during the [[Weimar Republic]] to describe the ideology of the [[Black Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Backes|first=Uwe|author-link=Uwe Backes|title=Politischer Extremismus in demokratischen Verfassungsstaaten|trans-title=Political Extremism in Democratic Constitutional States|language=de|location=Wiesbaden|publisher=Springer|date=1989|page=251-252|isbn=978-3-531-11946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
In a 2006 book, political scientist Jeff Taylor wrote: "It may be more useful to think of the Left and the Right as two components of populism, with elitism residing in the Center. The political spectrum may be linear, but it is not a straight line. It is shaped like a horseshoe".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jeff (2006), Where Did the Party Go? (University of Missouri Press), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, the term was used when discussing an alleged resurgent hostility towards Jews and [[new antisemitism]] from both the far-left and the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Tzvi|last = Fleischer|date = 31 October 2006|title = The Political Horseshoe again|url = http://www.aijac.org.au/review/2006/31-11/scribb31-11.htm|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110516212834/http://www.aijac.org.au/review/2006/31-11/scribb31-11.htm|archivedate = 16 May 2011|quote = I think Mr. Loewenstein has done a good job demonstrating why many people believe, as the "political horseshoe" theory states, that there is a lot more common ground between the far left, where Loewenstein dwells politically, and the far right views of someone like Betty Luks than people on the left would care to admit.|work = Australia/Israel Review|publisher = [[AIJAC]]|accessdate = 27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 essay, [[Josef Joffe]] (a visiting fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]], a conservative think tank)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Josef Joffe Distinguished Visiting Fellow| url = http://www.hoover.org/profiles/josef-joffe|}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: {{quote|Will globalization survive the gloom? The creeping revolt against globalization actually preceded the Crash of '08. Everywhere in the West, populism began to show its angry face at mid-decade. The two most dramatic instances were Germany and Austria, where populist parties scored big with a message of isolationism, protectionism and redistribution. In Germany, it was left-wing populism ("Die Linke"); in Austria it was a bunch of right-wing parties that garnered almost 30% in the 2008 election. Left and right together illustrated once more the "horseshoe" theory of modern politics: As the iron is bent backward, the two extremes almost touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = New Year's Essay 2009| date = 2008-12-22| publisher = [[Roland Berger Strategy Consultants]]| url = http://www.rolandberger.com/news/2008-12-22-rbsc-news-NewYearEssay.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054730/http://www.rolandberger.com/news/2008-12-22-rbsc-news-NewYearEssay.html| archivedate = 2009-02-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2015, reformist Muslim [[Maajid Nawaz]] invoked the horseshoe theory while lamenting a common tendency on the far-left and far-right towards the compiling and publishing of "[[Blacklisting|lists of political foes]]",&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news | title = The left's witchunt against Muslims| date = 2015-12-14|publisher= [[The Daily Beast]] | url = http://maajidnawaz.com/the-lefts-witch-hunt-against-muslims/}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding:
{{quote|As the political horseshoe theory attributed to Jean-Pierre Faye highlights, if we travel far-left enough, we find the very same sneering, nasty and reckless bully-boy tactics used by the far-right. The two extremes of the political spectrum end up meeting like a horseshoe, at the top, which to my mind symbolizes totalitarian control from above. In their quest for ideological purity, Stalin and Hitler had more in common than modern neo-Nazis and far-left agitators would care to admit.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

In a recent article for [[Eurozine]] titled "How Right is the Left?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = How Right is the Left?| date = 2018-05-15| publisher = [[Eurozine]]| url = https://www.eurozine.com/how-right-is-the-left/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyrylo Tkachenko wrote about the common cause found recently between the far-left and the far-right in [[Ukraine]]:
{{quote|The pursuit of a common political agenda is a trend discernible at both extremes of the political spectrum. Though this phenomenon manifests itself primarily through content-related overlaps, I believe there are good reasons to refer to it as a red-brown alliance. Its commonalities are based on shared anti-liberal resentment. Of course, there remain palpable differences between far left and the far right. But we should not underestimate the dangers already posed by these left-right intersections, as well as what we might lose if the resentment-driven backlash becomes mainstream.}}

== Criticism ==
The horseshoe theory has been criticized not just by people on both ends of the political spectrum who oppose being grouped with those they consider to be their polar opposites, but also by those who see horseshoe theory as oversimplifying political ideologies and as ignoring fundamental differences between them.

Simon Choat, a senior lecturer in political theory at [[Kingston University]], criticizes horseshoe theory from a leftist perspective. He argues that far-left and far-right ideologies only share similarities in the vaguest sense in that they both oppose the [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] ''[[status quo]]'', but the two sides both have very different reasons and very different aims for doing so. Choat uses the issue of globalization as an example. Both the far-left and the far-right attack [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[globalization]] and its elites, but have conflicting views on who those elites are and conflicting reasons for attacking them: {{quote|For the left, the problem with globalisation is that it has given free rein to capital and entrenched economic and political inequality. The solution is therefore to place constraints on capital and/or to allow people to have the same freedom of movement currently given to capital, goods, and services. They want an ''alternative'' globalisation. For the right, the problem with globalisation is that it has corroded supposedly traditional and homogeneous cultural and ethnic communities – their solution is therefore to ''reverse'' globalisation, protecting national capital and placing further restrictions on the movement of people.&lt;ref name=choat&gt;Choat, Simon (May 12, 2017) [https://theconversation.com/horseshoe-theory-is-nonsense-the-far-right-and-far-left-have-little-in-common-77588 "‘Horseshoe theory’ is nonsense – the far right and far left have little in common"] ''The Conversation''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Choat also argues that although proponents of the horseshoe theory may cite examples of alleged history of collusion between [[Fascism|fascists]] and [[Communism|communists]], those on the far-left usually oppose the rise of far-right or fascist regimes in their countries. Instead, he argues that it has been centrists who have supported far-right and fascist regimes that they prefer in power over socialist ones.&lt;ref name=choat /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1613">'''Indecent assault''' is an offence of [[aggravated assault]] in some common law-based [[jurisdiction]]s. It is characterised as a [[sex crime]] and has significant overlap with offences referred to as [[sexual assault]].

==England and Wales==
Indecent assault was a broadly defined offence under sections 14 and 15 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]]. It was superseded by the new offence of [[sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] under section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. Other aspects of the [[actus reus]] were merged into other offences, including [[rape]] (section 1), whose scope was expanded. Individuals may still be prosecuted for indecent assault under the 1956 Act for offences committed before the new law came into force. 

The [[mens rea]] and actus reus of indecent assault were similar to that for [[Common assault|common law assault and/or battery]]. However, there was an additional element of "indecent circumstances". "Indecent circumstances" were present if a "reasonable person" would believe it indecent, whatever the belief of the accused.

==India==
In India it is punishable under section 354 of the [[Indian Penal Code]].

==Australia==

In [[New South Wales]], the offence of indecent assault is punishable under Section 61L of the [[Crimes Act 1900]].

The [[mens rea]] and [[actus reus]] are the same for the common law offence of assault, the only distinction being that the act committed must have a sexual connotation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6659">In [[intuitionistic type theory]] (ITT), a discipline within [[mathematical logic]], '''induction-recursion''' is a feature for simultaneously declaring a type and function on that type.  It allows the creation of larger types, such as universes, than [[Intuitionistic type theory#Inductive types|inductive types]].  The types created still remain [[Predicativity|predicative]] inside ITT.

An [[inductive definition]] is given by rules for generating elements of a type. One can then define functions from that type by induction on the way the elements of the type are generated. Induction-recursion generalizes this situation since one can ''simultaneously'' define the type and the function, because the rules for generating elements of the type are allowed to refer to the function.&lt;ref name=Dybjer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dybjer|first=Peter|title=A general formulation of simultaneous inductive-recursive definitions in type theory|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=65|issue=2|date=June 2000|pages=525–549|url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/Inductive_Recursive.pdf|doi=10.2307/2586554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Induction-recursion can be used to define large types including various universe constructions. It increases the proof-theoretic strength of type theory substantially. Nevertheless, inductive-recursive recursive definitions are still considered [[Impredicativity|predicative]].

==Background==

Induction-Recursion came out of investigations to the rules of Martin-Löf's [[intuitionistic type theory]].  The type theory has a number of "type formers" and four kinds of rules for each one.  Martin-Löf had hinted that the rules for each type former followed a pattern, which preserved the properties of the type theory (e.g., [[Normalization property (abstract rewriting)|strong normalization]], [[Impredicativity|predicativity]]).  Researchers started looking for the most general description of the pattern, since that would tell what kinds of type formers could be added (or not added!) to extend the type theory.

The "universe" type former was the most interesting, because when the rules were written "à la  Tarski", they simultaneously defined the "universe type" ''and ''a function that operated on it.  This eventually lead Dybjer to Induction-Recursion.

Dybjer's initial papers called Induction-Recursion a "schema" for rules.  It stated what type formers could be added to the type theory.  Later, he and Setzer would write a new type former with rules that allowed new Induction-Recursion definitions to be made inside the type theory.&lt;ref name=DybjerSetzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dybjer|first=Peter|title=A finite axiomatization of inductive-recursive definitions|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=1581|year=1999|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.219.2442}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was added to the Half proof assistant (a variant of [[ALF (proof assistant)|Alf]]).

==The idea==

Before covering Inductive-Recursive types, the simpler case is Inductive Types.  Constructors for Inductive types can be self-referential, but in a limited way.  The constructor's parameters must be "positive":  
* not refer to the type being defined
* be exactly the type being defined, or
* be a function that returns the type being defined.

With Inductive types, a parameter's type can depend on earlier parameters, but they cannot refer to ones of the type being defined.  Inductive-Recursive types go further and parameter's types ''can'' refer to earlier parameters that use the type being defined.  These must be "half-positive":
* be a function depending on an earlier parameter '''if''' that parameter is wrapped in the function being defined.

So, if &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the type being defined and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the function being (simultaneously) defined, these parameter declarations are positive:
* &lt;math&gt;a:A&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;d:D&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;g:A \to Type&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;h:A \to D&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;i:A \to B \to D&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;j: g\ a&lt;/math&gt;  (Depends on earlier parameters, none of which are type &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.)

This is half-positive:
* &lt;math&gt;k : (f\ d) \to D &lt;/math&gt;  (Depends on parameter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; but only through call to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.)

These are '''not''' positive nor half-positive:
* &lt;math&gt;k: D \to A&lt;/math&gt;  (&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter to the function.)
* &lt;math&gt;l: (A \to D) \to A&lt;/math&gt;  (The parameter takes a function that returns &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, but returns &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; itself.)
* &lt;math&gt;m: z\ d&lt;/math&gt;  (Depends on &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, but not through the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.)

== Universe example ==

A simple common example is the Universe à la  Tarski type former.  It creates a type &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.  There is an element of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; for every type in the type theory (except &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; itself!).  The function &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; maps the elements of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to the associated type.

The type &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; has a constructor (or introduction rule) for each type former in the type theory.  The one for dependent functions would be:

&lt;math&gt;constructor_\Pi (u:U) (u' : (x: T(u)) U) : U&lt;/math&gt;

That is, it takes an element &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that will map to the type of the parameter and an element &lt;math&gt;u'&lt;/math&gt; that will map to the return type of the function (which is dependent on the value of the parameter).  (The final &lt;math&gt;:U&lt;/math&gt; says that the result of the constructor is an element of type &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.)

The reduction (or computation rule) says that

&lt;math&gt;T(constructor_\Pi(u, u'))&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\Pi( T(u), (x) T(u'(x)) )&lt;/math&gt;

After reduction, the function &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is operating on a smaller part of the input.  If that holds when &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is applied to any constructor, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; will always terminate.  Without going into the details, Induction-Recursion states what kinds of definitions (or rules) can be added to the theory such that the function calls will always terminate.

==Usage==

Induction-Recursion is implemented in [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]] and [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]].

'''KMA''' is a collaboration between media artists [[Kit Monkman]] and [[Tom Wexler]] (UK). KMA's work is primarily focused on the use of projected light to transform spaces and the interactions of people within those spaces. 

The idea of people gathering after dark to enact and / or watch a drama or ritual lies deep inside us and our ancestral history. It is surely one of the oldest, simplest and most essential of human responses to our fate.

KMA’s work seeks to explore this impulse in the context of the modern city. By combining sophisticated interactive technologies with an emotional narrative the work choreographs pedestrian’s movement; it builds, sustains, and develops complex, physically networked, relations between the body, the individual, the crowd, and the city.

KMA are best known for large scale public interactive works that use projected light and motion tracking technology to create immersive digital 'playgrounds' in existing public spaces. 'Flock' - based on 3 sections of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake - typifies this approach, and was presented at [[Trafalgar Square]], London as a co-commission by the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] and The [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden.

Congregation (2010) was commissioned to represent the UK Pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo.

'''Kitsch''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɪ|tʃ}}; [[loanword]] from [[German language|German]]), also called '''cheesiness''' or '''tackiness''', is art or other objects that appeal to [[popular culture|popular]] rather than [[High culture|high art]] tastes. Such objects are sometimes appreciated in a knowingly [[ironic]] or humorous way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=kitsch American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/kitsch?a=british Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/kitsch Oxford Living Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first applied to artwork that was a response to certain divisions of 19th-century art with [[aesthetics]] that favored what later art critics would consider to be exaggerated [[sentimentality]] and [[melodrama]]. Hence, 'kitsch art' is closely associated with 'sentimental art'. Kitsch is also related to the concept of [[camp (style)|camp]], because of its humorous and [[irony|ironic]] nature.

To brand visual art as "kitsch" is generally [[pejorative]], as it implies that the work in question is gaudy, or that it serves a solely ornamental and decorative purpose rather than amounting to a work of true artistic merit. The term is also sometimes applied to music or literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|authorlink1=Roger Scruton|date=Feb 21, 2014|title=A fine line between art and kitsch|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerscruton/2014/02/21/a-fine-line-between-art-and-kitsch/#7fbd667e3679|website=Forbes|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As a descriptive term, ''kitsch'' originated in the art markets of [[Munich#Capital of reunited Bavaria|Munich]] in the 1860s and the 1870s, describing cheap, popular, and marketable pictures and sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Calinescu, Matei. Five Faces of Modernity. Kitsch, p.&amp;nbsp;234.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Das Buch vom Kitsch'' (''The Book of Kitsch''), [[Hans Reimann (writer)|Hans Reimann]] defines it as a professional expression "born in a painter's studio".

The study of kitsch was done almost exclusively in German until the 1970s, with [[Walter Benjamin]] being an important scholar in the field.&lt;ref name="menninghaus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Menninghaus|first=Winfried|editor=Andrew Benjamin|others=Charles Rice|title=Walter Benjamin and the Architecture of Modernity| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFx1D_BC5tsC&amp;pg=PA40| year=2009| publisher=re.press| isbn=9780980544091| pages=39–58| chapter=On the Vital Significance of 'Kitsch': Walter Benjamin's Politics of 'Bad Taste'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism|Modernist]] writer [[Hermann Broch]] argues that the essence of kitsch is imitation: kitsch mimics its immediate predecessor with no regard to ethics—it aims to copy the beautiful, not the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broch|first=Hermann|title=Geist and Zeitgeist: The Spirit in an Unspiritual Age. Six Essays by Hermann Broch| year=2002| publisher=Counterpoint| isbn=9781582431680|chapter=Evil in the Value System of Art|pages=13–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Walter Benjamin, kitsch is, unlike art, a utilitarian object lacking all critical distance between object and observer; it "offers instantaneous emotional gratification without intellectual effort, without the requirement of distance, without sublimation".&lt;ref name="menninghaus"/&gt;

Kitsch is less about the thing observed than about the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaglestone|first1=Robert|title=The Broken Voice: Reading Post-Holocaust Literature|date=May 25, 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0191084204|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger Scruton]], "Kitsch is fake art, expressing fake emotions, whose purpose is to deceive the consumer into thinking he feels something deep and serious."&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30439633 Scruton, Roger. "A Point of View: The strangely enduring power of kitsch", ''BBC News Magazine'', December 12, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomáš Kulka in ''Kitsch and Art'' starts from two basic facts that kitsch "has an undeniable mass-appeal" and "considered (by the art-educated elite) bad" and then proposes three essential conditions: 
# Kitsch depicts a beautiful or highly emotionally charged subject; 
# The depicted subject is instantly and effortlessly identifiable
# Kitsch does not substantially enrich our associations related to the depicted subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Kitsch and art|last=Tomas|first=Kulka|date=|publisher=Pennsylvania State Univ.

{{Distinguish|Landau principle}}
'''Landauer's principle''' is a [[Principle#Principle as scientific law|physical principle]] pertaining to the lower [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] limit of [[Energy conservation|energy consumption]] of [[computation]]. It holds that "any logically irreversible manipulation of [[Information#As a property in physics|information]], such as the erasure of a [[bit]] or the merging of two [[computation]] paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding [[entropy]] increase in non-information-bearing [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the information-processing apparatus or its environment".&lt;ref name = bennett&gt;{{Citation |arxiv=physics/0210005 |title=Notes on Landauer's principle, Reversible Computation and Maxwell's Demon |authorlink=Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist) |author=Charles H. Bennett |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=501–510 |year=2003 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(03)00039-X|bibcode=2003SHPMP..34..501B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of phrasing Landauer's principle is that if an observer loses information about a [[physical system]], the observer loses the ability to extract work from that system.

A so-called logically-reversible computation, in which no information is erased, may in principle be carried out without releasing any heat.  This has led to considerable interest in the study of [[reversible computing]]. Indeed, without reversible computing, increases in the number of computations-per-joule-of-energy-dissipated must come to a halt by about 2050: because the limit implied by Landauer's principle will be reached by then, according to [[Koomey's law]]. 

At 20&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature, or 293.15&amp;nbsp;K), the Landauer limit represents an energy of approximately 0.0172&amp;nbsp;[[electron volt|eV]], or 2.75&amp;nbsp;[[zeptojoule|zJ]]. Theoretically, room{{nbhyph}}temperature computer memory operating at the Landauer limit could be changed at a rate of one billion bits per second with energy being converted to heat in the memory media at the rate of only 2.85 trillionths of a watt (that is, at a rate of only 2.85 pJ/s).  Modern computers use millions of times as much energy per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tikalon.com/blog/blog.php?article=2011/Landauer |title=Tikalon Blog by Dev Gualtieri |publisher=Tikalon.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomweb.com/nanomagnet-memories-approach-low-power-limit/ |title=Nanomagnet memories approach low-power limit &amp;#124; bloomfield knoble |publisher=Bloomweb.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/landauer-limit-demonstrated |title=Landauer Limit Demonstrated - IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Rolf Landauer]] first proposed the principle in 1961 while working at [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="landauer"&gt;{{Citation |author=Rolf Landauer |url=http://worrydream.com/refs/Landauer%20-%20Irreversibility%20and%20Heat%20Generation%20in%20the%20Computing%20Process.pdf |title=Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=183–191 |year=1961 |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1147/rd.53.0183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He rigorously justified and stated important limits to an earlier conjecture by [[John von Neumann]]. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as being simply the Landauer bound or Landauer limit.

In 2011, the principle was generalized to show that while information erasure requires an increase in entropy, that increase could theoretically occur at no energy cost&lt;ref name="vaccaro"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Joan Vaccaro |author2=Stephen Barnett |title=Information Erasure Without an Energy Cost |journal=Proc. R. Soc. A |date=June 8, 2011 |volume=467 |issue=2130 |pages=1770–1778 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0577 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/early/2011/01/07/rspa.2010.0577.full.pdf |arxiv=1004.5330|bibcode = 2011RSPSA.467.1770V }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, the cost can be taken in another [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved quantity]], such as  [[angular momentum]].

In a 2012 article published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], a team of physicists from the [[École normale supérieure de Lyon]], [[University of Augsburg]] and the [[University of Kaiserslautern]] described that for the first time they have measured the tiny amount of heat released when an individual bit of data is erased.&lt;ref name="berut"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Antoine Bérut |author2=Artak Arakelyan |author3=Artyom Petrosyan |author4=Sergio Ciliberto |author5=Raoul Dillenschneider |author6=Eric Lutz |doi=10.1038/nature10872 |title=Experimental verification of Landauer’s principle linking information and thermodynamics |journal=Nature |volume=483 |issue=7388 |pages=187–190 |date=8 March 2012 |url=http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/eggert/papers/raoul.pdf|bibcode = 2012Natur.483..187B |pmid=22398556|arxiv=1503.06537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, physical experiments tested Landauer's principle and confirmed its predictions.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Yonggun Jun |author2=Momčilo Gavrilov |author3=John Bechhoefer |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.190601 |title=High-Precision Test of Landauer's Principle in a Feedback Trap |journal=[[Phys.

In 2016, researchers used a laser probe to measure the amount of energy dissipation that resulted when a nanomagnetic bit flipped from off to on. Flipping the bit required 15 millielectron volts (3 [[zeptojoule]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hong|first = Jeongmin|last2 = Lambson|first2 = Brian|last3 = Dhuey|first3 = Scott|last4 = Bokor|first4 = Jeffrey|date = 2016-03-01|title = Experimental test of Landauer’s principle in single-bit operations on nanomagnetic memory bits|url = http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501492|journal = Science Advances|language = en|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = e1501492|doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1501492|issn = 2375-2548|pmc = 4795654|bibcode = 2016SciA....2E1492H|pmid=26998519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 article published in [[Nature Physics (journal)|''Nature Physics'']] features a Landauer erasure performed at cryogenic temperatures (T = 1K) on an array of high-spin (S = 10) quantum [[molecular magnets]]. The array is made to act as a spin register where each nanomagnet encodes a single bit of information.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment has laid the foundations for the extension of the validity of the Landauer principle to the quantum realm. Owing to the fast dynamics and low "inertia" of the single spins used in the experiment, the researchers also showed how an erasure operation can be carried out at the lowest possible thermodynamic cost — that imposed by the Landauer principle — and at a high speed.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Rocco Gaudenzi |author2=Enrique Burzuri |author3=Satoru Maegawa |author4=Herre van der Zant |author5=Fernando Luis |doi=10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7 |title=Quantum Landauer erasure with a molecular nanomagnet |journal= Nature Physics |volume=14 |pages= 565–568 |date=19 March 2018 |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

==Rationale==
Landauer's principle can be understood to be a simple [[logical consequence]] of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]—which states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] cannot decrease—together with the definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]]. For, if the number of possible logical states of a computation were to decrease as the computation proceeded forward (logical irreversibility), this would constitute a forbidden decrease of entropy, unless the number of possible physical states corresponding to each logical state were to simultaneously increase by at least a compensating amount, so that the total number of possible physical states was no smaller than it was originally (i.e. total entropy has not decreased).

Yet, an increase in the number of physical states corresponding to each logical state means that, for an observer who is keeping track of the logical state of the system but not the physical state (for example an "observer" consisting of the computer itself), the number of possible physical states has increased; in other words, entropy has increased from the point of view of this observer.

The maximum entropy of a bounded physical system is finite. (If the [[holographic principle]] is correct, then physical systems with finite [[surface area]] have a finite maximum entropy; but regardless of the truth of the holographic principle, [[quantum field theory]] dictates that the entropy of systems with finite radius and energy is finite due to the [[Bekenstein bound]].) To avoid reaching this maximum over the course of an extended computation, entropy must eventually be expelled to an outside environment.

==Equation==
Landauer's principle asserts that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the ''Landauer limit'':

:{{math|''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2,}}
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (approximately 1.38×10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J/K), ''T'' is the temperature of the heat sink in [[kelvin]]s, and ln&amp;#8239;2 is the [[natural logarithm]] of 2 (approximately 0.69315).

For an environment at temperature ''T'', energy ''E'' = ''ST'' must be emitted into that environment if the amount of added entropy is ''S''. For a computational operation in which 1 [[bit]] of logical information is lost, the amount of entropy generated is at least ''k'' ln&amp;#8239;2, and so, the energy that must eventually be emitted to the environment is ''E'' ≥ ''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2.

==Challenges==
The principle is widely accepted as [[physical law]], but in recent years it has been challenged for using [[circular reasoning]] and faulty assumptions, notably in Earman and Norton (1998), and subsequently in Shenker (2000)&lt;ref name="shenker"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000115/ Logic and Entropy] Critique by Orly Shenker (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and Norton (2004,&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001729/ Eaters of the Lotus] Critique by John Norton (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="norton2"&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Waiting_SHPMP.pdf Waiting for Landauer] Response by Norton (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;), and defended by Bennett (2003)&lt;ref name="bennett" /&gt; and Ladyman et al.

{{distinguish|text=the [[Mau-Mau Uprising]] in Kenya (1952–1960) or the [[Maji Maji Rebellion]] in German East Africa (1905–1907). For other uses of the term maimai, see [[Maimai (disambiguation)]]}}
[[File:Mai Mai Katanga.jpg|thumb|Mai-Mai fighters surrendering their weapons to United Nations personnel in Northern Katanga, 2006]]
The term '''Mai-Mai''' or '''Mayi-Mayi''' refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), formed to defend their local territory against other armed groups. Most were formed to resist the invasion of [[Rwanda]]n forces and Rwanda-affiliated Congolese rebel groups, but some may have formed to exploit the war for their own advantage by [[looting]], [[cattle rustling]] or [[banditry]].

Groups that fall under the umbrella term "Mai-Mai" include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads, and politically motivated resistance fighters.  Because Mai Mai have had only the most tenuous internal cohesion, different Mai-Mai groups allied themselves with a variety of domestic and foreign government and guerrilla groups at different times. The term Mai-Mai does not refer to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups.

Mai-Mai were particularly active in the eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, [[North Kivu]] and [[South Kivu]] (the "[[Kivus]]"), which were under the control of the Rwanda-allied [[Banyamulenge]]-dominated rebel faction, the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma]] (RCD-Goma). While militias have long been common in the Kivus, particularly among the minority [[Batembo]] and [[Babembe]] ethnic groups, the recent wars and conflicts caused large numbers of town dwellers to form Mai-Mai. Although the Mai-Mai, either as a group or as individual groups, were not party to the 1999 [[Lusaka Accord]] meant to end the war, they remained one of the most powerful forces in the conflict and the lack of cooperation from some groups has been problematic for the peace process.

==Mai-Mai in North and South Kivu==
[[File:Zaire 97 kivus.jpg|thumb|The East-central DRC, showing Kivu]]
According to a 2001 UN report, 20,000 to 30,000 Mai-Mai were active in the two Kivu provinces.  The two most powerful and well-organized Mai-Mai groups in the Kivus were led by Generals Padiri and Dunia, but now it is another ''Mai-Mai'' group which is called [[Mai-Mai Yakutumba]] which was organized in 2007 by General Yakutumba, ex-Mai-Mai in 2001. They were reported to have received aid from the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and are widely viewed by other Mai Mai groups as the leaders, though not the commanders, of the Kivu Mai-Mai.  A number of smaller Mai-Mai groups, such as the [[Mudundu 40]]/[[Front de Résistance et de Défense du Kivu]] (FRDKI) and [[Mouvement de Lutte contre l'Agression au Zaïre]]/[[Forces Unies de Résistance Nationale contre l'Agression de la Républíque Démocratique du Congo]] (MLAZ/FURNAC), were reported to cooperate with the [[Rwanda]]n military and [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma]] (RCD-Goma).

Walikale and Masisi north of Goma were the centres of Mai-Mai activity in North Kivu.  In South Kivu, there have historically been concentrations around [[Walungu]] and [[Bunyakiri]] south of [[Lake Kivu]], around [[Uvira]] and [[Mwenaga]] at the northern end of [[Lake Tanganyika]], further south around [[Fizi]], and around [[Shabunda]], between the Rwandan border and Kindu.

A Mai-Mai leader, Colonel Mayele, was arrested by UN forces in October 2010, allegedly being the leader behind mass rapes in the Walikale region of North Kivu province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/1007/1224280566201.html Congo rebel chief arrested over mass rape – The Irish Times – Thu, Oct 07, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mai-Mai in Katanga==
{{Main|Mai-Mai Kata Katanga}}
A former leader of the Mai-Mai, [[Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga]], turned himself over to [[MONUC]] troops in May 2006. He was found guilty of numerous war crimes between October 2003 and May 2006 and was sentenced to death by the Kipushi Military Tribunal in [[Katanga Province]] on 6 March 2009.&lt;ref name="RO060309"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.radiookapi.net/index.php?i=53&amp;a=22549| title=Kipushi : Kyungu Mutanga alias Gédéon condamné à la peine capitale| work=[[Radio Okapi]]| date=2009-03-06|accessdate = 2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped from prison in September 2011 and formed the [[Mai-Mai Kata Katanga]] ("Secede Katanga").&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-23422038|title=Katanga: Fighting for DR Congo's cash cow to secede|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=12 September 2013|date=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Mai-Mai groups==

There was a large Mai-Mai presence in [[Maniema]], in particular around [[Kindu]] and [[Kalemie]].  [[Province Orientale]] also hosts a number of Mai-Mai, but these groups were apparently involved in long-standing ethnic disputes.

''Mai-Mai Gedeon'' is also commanded by Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga and loosely tied to his Mai-Mai Kata Katanga.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; The ''Corak Kata Katanga'' also known as the Co-ordination for a Referendum on Self-determination for Katanga, composed mainly of former Katanga Tigers, a separatist group active in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; They claim to be behind the attack on the Katanga airport in February 2011. It is unclear to what extent all these groups are co-ordinated.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; 

==Mai-Mai and the mountain gorillas==

In May 2007, Mai-Mai killed two [[wildlife officer]]s in [[Virunga National Park]] and threatened to kill [[mountain gorilla]]s if the government retaliated. The Mai-Mai are also suspected of the killings of nine mountain gorillas, with the use of machetes, and automatic weapons. In an October 2012 incident, Mai-Mai killed two park staff and a soldier, while three soldiers were injured. From 1990 to 2018 some 170 Virunga Rangers have died in such attacks, according to the WWF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?206549/WWF-Deeply-Saddened-By-Death-Of-Virunga-Park-Protectors WWF deeply saddened by death of Virunga park protectors (''WWF'' article)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six Virunga Park Rangers were reported to have been killed in Virunga National Park. Five rangers and a driver were killed in an ambush and a sixth ranger was injured in the Central section of the vast reserve on Monday April 9 2018. Officials suspected the attacks were by the Mai-Mai. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2018/apr/09/six-virunga-park-rangers-killed-in-drc-wildlife-sanctuary&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[thermal equilibrium]] the product of the [[Valence and conduction bands|free electron]] concentration &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and the free hole concentration &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is equal to a constant square of intrinsic carrier concentration &lt;math&gt;n_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. The intrinsic carrier concentration is a function of temperature.

The equation for the mass action law for [[semiconductor]]s is:&lt;ref name="JNTU"&gt;{{Cite book | last = S | first = Salivahanan |author2=N. Suresh Kumar | title = Electronic Devices &amp; Circuits | publisher = Tata McGraw Hill Education Pvt Ltd | year = 2011 | location = India | pages = 1.14 | isbn = 0-07-070267-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;np = n_{i}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Carrier concentrations==
In semiconductors, free electrons and [[electron hole|holes]] are the [[charge carrier|carriers]] that provide [[electrical conduction|conduction]]. For cases where the number of carriers are much less than the number of band states, the carrier concentrations can be approximated by using [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics|Boltzmann statistics]], giving the results below.

===Electron concentration===
The free electron concentration ''n'' can be approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;n=N_c\text{ exp}\left[-\frac{(E_c-E_F)}{kT}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[band diagram|conduction band]] 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[Fermi level]] 
* ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
* ''T'' is the temperature in Kelvin
* ''N''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective density of states at the conduction band edge given by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N_c=2\left(\frac{2\pi m_e^*kT}{h^2}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''m*''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; being the electron [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and ''h'' being the [[planck constant]].

===Hole concentration===
The free hole concentration ''p'' is given by a similar formula
:&lt;math&gt;p=N_v\text{ exp}\left[-\frac{(E_F-E_v)}{kT}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[Fermi level]] 
* ''E''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the [[band diagram|valence band]] 
* ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
* ''T'' is the temperature in Kelvins 
* ''N''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective density of states at the valence band edge given by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N_v=2\left(\frac{2\pi m_h^*kT}{h^2}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''m*''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; being the hole [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and ''h'' being the [[planck constant]].

===Mass action law===
Using the carrier concentration equations given above, the mass action law can be stated as
:&lt;math&gt;np = N_cN_v\text{ exp}\left(-\frac{E_g}{kT}\right) = n_i^2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the bandgap energy given by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''E''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;

As a Deputy Senior Advisor to The President, he is working on UN affairs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://southasiafasttrack.com/2018/06/06/award-winning-afghan-actress-ms-leena-alam-talks-about-the-film-industry-in-afghanistan/|title=In #Conversation with award-winning Afghan actress Ms. Leena Alam about the film industry in Afghanistan|date=2018-06-06|work=South Asia Fast Track|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Afghanistan. The Senior Advisory Office of The President on UN Affairs (SAOP UN-Affairs) has established in early 2017 at the office of The President as policy and advisory body. The SAOP UN-Affairs worked on One UN for Afghanistan, a strategic framework that has replaced The United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for Afghanistan. The advisory also successfully drafted a mutual accountability framework between the government of Afghanistan and the United Nations. The One UN or Delivering As One (DAO) was one of the most challenging task for the UN family and the Afghan government, but the SAOP was able to do it successfully. Under the new framework the UN has to align its programs and projects based on the national strategies and priorities of Afghanistan.

Hamdam said that corruption is the biggest problem, which feeds insecurity in Afghanistan as well as the insurgency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncaccoalition.org/learn-more/articles/199-an-open-letter-to-president-karzai-and-president-obama |title=An Open Letter to President Karzai and President Obama |publisher=UNCAC Coalition |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130828134802/http://www.uncaccoalition.org/learn-more/articles/199-an-open-letter-to-president-karzai-and-president-obama |archivedate=2013-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; poppy cultivation, drug processing and drug trafficking. He formed the biggest ever group of volunteer social activists from across Afghanistan

to fight corruption, the most dangerous and toughest job in one of the most [[Corruption in Afghanistan|corrupt]] and unstable country in the world. Through peaceful demonstration and protests such a 5&amp;nbsp;km countrywide race against corruption, he mobilized thousands of citizens to pressure the government for reform, through 5&amp;nbsp;km race against corruption. He has also mobilized youth, students and women to take part in the fight against corruption. He is an outspoken activist, who has disclosed cases of senior corrupt official and he has advocated for the trail and persecution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.khaama.com/aacn-statement-about-the-governments-recent-actions-against-corruption-741|title = AACN Statement about the Government's Recent Actions Against Corruption|publisher = Khaama Press (KP)|date = |accessdate = 2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; of cabinet members and senior politicians. Hamdam exposed land garbing, corruption of senior government officials and cabinet members. He has advocated for election transparency and reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sismec.org/2014/05/15/afghan-election-fraud-who-is-responsible/|title = Afghan Election Fraud–Who is Responsible?|date = |accessdate = |website = SISMEC|publisher = SISMEC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also played a key role in exposing Kabul Bank corruption, where near on billion USD was looted in corruption and resulted in the collapse of the bank.

Hamdam was a critic of Karzai government for not taking firm steps to fight corruptions. In his interview with the CBS TV he said that corruption starts from the street and goes to the palace and he called Karzai's government the most corrupt government ever. He has repeatedly called and pressured Afghan government for fighting corruption and he looks at corruption as a major problem for the country.

== Afghanistan's affairs ==
[[File:Dr. Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam During a Conference on Afghanistan in Brussels.jpg|thumb|Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam at the [[Security &amp; Defence Agenda]] Conference in Brussels 2013]]

Hamdam is closely following Afghanistan and regional countries developments. Following Afghanistan's affairs as an observer, He has attended [[International Conference on Afghanistan, The Hague (2009)|International Conference on Afghanistan, The Hague]] 2009 in Netherlands, [[2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit|NATO 60 Summit]] in Strasburg and Kehl, France in 2009, Kabul International conference in 2010, [[2010 Lisbon summit|NATO Summit in Lisbon]] Portugal in 2010, [[International Conference on Afghanistan, Bonn (2011)|2nd International Bonn Conference]] about Afghanistan, the NATO Chicago Summit in 2011  and tens of other national and international conferences on Afghanistan. As an observer he observed Afghanistan presidential elections in 2004 and 2009, Afghan parliamentary and [[provincial elections]] in 2005 and Traditional Loya Jirga on the Afghanistan and the U.S. Strategic Partnership Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.khaama.com/afghanistan-is-not-alone-by-shafiq-hamdam-29612|title = Afghanistan is note alone|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Khamma Press|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocating for a closer relationship with the western allies, Hamdam played a key role in signing the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) between Afghanistan and US. Among other Afghan leaders and activists, he also signed the letter to president Obama advocating for the BSA and the letter said: We strongly echo the endorsement of the Bilateral Security Agreement last month at the ''Loya Jirga ''and reiterate that the agreement should be signed without delay. Our voice reflects a growing chorus from all segments of the Afghan society, including our religious and business community leaders, who remain concerned about the future of our country and wish to see the expeditious finalization of the BSA.
[[File:Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam Help IDPs.jpg|thumb|Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam during the distribution of humanitarian assistance to the needy family of internally displaced people in Afghanistan.]]
Representing Afghanistan in the European parliament, he advocates for accountability, transparency and fighting corruption. He urged leaderships of European Union, European Parliament and European Commission to support Afghans in the fight against corruption. He wrote in one of his articles to EU leaders: Afghanistan alone cannot reach its goal of reducing corruption; it requires the support of the international community. Without delay, serious actions should be taken to eliminate the problem. These actions should include empowering civil society organizations and the media to play a bigger role in the fight against corruption. If Afghanistan is to qualify for aid over the coming years, seriousness, strong commitment, political determination, and practical decisions will be needed in order to implement the laws and strategies required to overcome the problem of corruption in Afghanistan.

Hamdam was often criticized for his pro-western opinions by some Afghan politicians and through some anti-western figures. He is seen as a pro-west. As a Senior NATO Public Diplomacy Adviser, he has often defended NATO policies and by extremist he is seen as a NATO-backed activist. Hamdam has defended in many occasions NATO's position and he has advocated for Afghanistan to become a NATO member. He was widely criticized by Muslim extremists and regional actors for his article, where he clearly stated that Afghanistan should be a NATO member. After completion of ISAF mission, he advised in one of his articles that "Afghan government and NATO should be able to enter a new, comprehensive, closer, stronger and mutual relationship. It should be based on mutual commitment and long-term cooperation with full respect to the sovereignty of Afghanistan. The relation which can possibly make Afghanistan a NATO member country in the future."  While some analyst called the ISAF mission as a failure, but Hamdam called that a historic and major success.

== As a writer ==

[[File:Dr. Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam and Senior U.S Senator Lindsey Graham.JPG|thumb|Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam with US Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] ]]
He writes for ''The Huffington Post''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mohammad-shafiq-hamdam/s|title = Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam's Biography|date = 2016-02-22|access-date = 2016-02-22|website = Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam Blog|publisher = The Huffington Post|last = Mohammad Shafiq|first = Hamdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many leading Afghan papers and journals on political, security and foreign affairs. Talking about the corruption related issues and Afghanistan's affairs he has been appearing in numbers of national and International media outlets, such as Tolo TV, Ariana TV, RFE/RL, BBC, CBS, AFP, ARD, VOA, TRT TV, Aljazeera TV, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and other key national and international media outlets.

He is optimistic about Afghanistan. After the end of one decade ISAF mission in Afghanistan, he wrote on the Open Think Thank on Foreign Policy that Afghanistan of 2001 is not comparable with the Afghanistan of 2015. With 352,000 strong Afghan National Security Forces, backed by the US and NATO, an increasingly vibrant civil society sector, and a large youth population, Afghans are hopeful that their country will never return to the dark era. For this to remain effective, Afghanistan and its partners must continue to broaden those achievements over the next decade, ushering in a new era of transformation.

Hamdam looks at democracy as a new phenomenon in Afghanistan and emphasizes on reform and fighting corruption. He wrote in Unipath is a professional military magazine published quarterly by the Commander of the United States Central Command as an international forum for military personnel in the Middle East and Central Asia region:  Governments and institutions work differently in democratic societies. So it's not only fighting terrorism and extremists, but good governance that is a key priority for Afghanistan. Weak rule of law and the existence of "impunity circles" and safe havens for corrupt individuals and officials in Afghanistan and abroad have contributed to violations of human rights and injustice.

He believes that the Afghan and US government were not able to define their relationship during more than a decade. Hamdam wrote in his opinion editorial, ''A Decade of Relations Without Definition'', that the Afghan-U.S. relationship should not be only based on dying and killing for each other, but it should be based on social, economic and political interests as well. Numerous opportunities already exist to build that long-term and stable relationship. At the moment, some Afghans see the presence of the U.S. in Afghanistan as a world policing and a force against Al-Qaeda and Taliban. What if there are no more Taliban and war in Afghanistan? How will the U.S. and Afghan government justify their relations? Should this relationship remain merely a donor-recipient exchange, a relationship only to finance, train and advise Afghan National Security Forces? These questions are urgent. The two countries must, through inclusive dialogue, define their relationship and must reach for a vision beyond a militarized association.

In [[Analytic Business Theory]] '''Monte Carlo Polarization''' is an opinion generation [[algorithm]] for a given prototype or design idea. 
The algorithm expands on traditional [[Monte Carlo Aggregation]] which operates by placing candidates together and selecting a subset at [[random]].
Each member of this subset is then asked for an opinion usually by filling out a [[form (document)|form]].
A resultant [[opinion scalar]] can be generated by application of the [[Softmax function]] over the generated [[form set]].
However '''Monte Carlo Polarization''' goes a step further and attempts to construct the subset with the greatest [[standard deviation]] in response, referred to as the [[form data response eigen-norm vector scalar]].
&lt;ref&gt;http://omlc.org/~prahl/pubs/pdfx/ramella05a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The idea of Monte-Carlo Polarization was firstly invented in Athens, (more commonly known as Thens), by Errikos Babudopoulos in 1978, but was mostly used in research in the 1990s by famous mathematicians, such as [[Grigori Perelman]], in proving the [[soul conjecture]].

== Inception ==

The origins of '''Monte Carlo Polarization''' came from the following observations made in early 1922:&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus&lt;/ref&gt;
# All opinions are '''valid'''
# Some opinions are more '''valid''' than others
Where the '''validity''' of an opinion is defined by the [[Emotional Intelligence]] Hierarchical [[metric space]], using the obvious distance function.&lt;ref&gt;http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1614-0001/a000028?journalCode=jid&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==

Given an array ''A'' of ''n'' elements with values or [[Record (computer science)|records]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, sorted such that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ... ≤ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, and target value ''T'', the following [[subroutine]] uses '''Monte Carlo Polarization''' to find the index of ''T'' in ''A''.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 ("Searching an ordered table"), subsection "Algorithm B"}}
# Set ''L'' to 0 and ''R'' to ''n'' &amp;minus; 1.
# If ''L'' &gt; ''R'', the search terminates as unsuccessful.
# Set ''m'' (the position of the middle element) to the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] (the largest previous integer) of (''L'' + ''R'') / 2.
# If A&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''T'', set L to ''m'' + 1 and go to step 2.
# If A&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; T, set R to ''m'' – 1 and go to step 2.
# Now A&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''T'', the search is done; return ''m''.

Although this a very recent cutting-edge technique, it has seen a couple of variations upon the basic algorithm in the last couple of month, most notably '''JSON driven''' resolution methods. the basic idea is that instead of supplying the algorithm with ''n'' records, it is more useful to provide the algorithm with emotional meta-data to guide its search and improve its complexity beyond the usual logarithmic bounds and this by a factor of  ''log(n)/2''. It allows to select intermediate ''m'' values for the search index and skew them towards the wanted emotional value in the initial records.

== Applications ==

The acceleration structures permitted by the '''Monte Carlo Polarization''' consist mainly in BVH and EBVH hierarchies. The logical subdivision of the kernel space leads to a logarithmic complexity, which is key to the scalability of the sentient analysis tools.

A key application is the direct targeting of hidden nodes in neural networks. By applying a Monte Carlo Polarization filter to the input layer of the neural system, hidden layers will be systematically and dynamically selected based on user-defined characteristics. Only the specified layers and units will receive and process the data.

Compared to standard drop-off methods, Monte Carlo Polarization is both more effective and more secure. Instead of having all nodes receiving the data and selecting output from a subset, the unnecessary nodes are directly filtered out. The result is a greatly increased level of accuracy and protection, as unreliable and malicious nodes will be left out, and a higher degree of efficiency.

The neural system that is created using the aforementioned method is the basis for many Computer Vision projects. A specific highlight is the American web-animated sitcom "F is for Family".  

== NodeJS support ==

Monte Carlo Polarization can be easily deployed through NodeJS

&lt;pre&gt;npm --save install monte-carlo&lt;/pre&gt;

The library provides a basic implementation of Monte Carlo Polarization, and shows the kernel space learning algorithm applied to session tokens.

The native support of JSON files by NodeJS's Javascript language is an example of the application of JSON Driven Monte Carlo Polarization.

Being a cutting edge technology, researchers are experimenting the expandability of the current technology to support Asynchronous Transport Protocol for [[JSON]], and to provide an api for classic [[AJAX]] (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) interface by tunneling the data through Socket.IO packets secured by [[Blockchain]] technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42986">'''Morality and religion''' is the relationship between [[religion|religious]] views and [[morals]]. Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Gems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Zoroastrianism#Principal beliefs|Zoroastrianism's]] "good thoughts, good words, and good deeds" concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|edition= |last= Esptein|first= Greg M.|year= 2010|publisher= HarperCollins|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-06-167011-4|page= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frameworks are outlined and interpreted by various sources such as holy books, oral and written traditions, and religious leaders. Many of these share tenets with [[secular]] value frameworks such as [[consequentialism]], [[freethought]], and [[utilitarianism]].

Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not necessarily depend upon religion, though for some, this is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Rachels| first1 = (ed) James | last2 =  Rachels | first2 = (ed) Stuart | title = The Elements of Moral Philosophy | publisher = McGraw-Hill| edition = 7 | year = 2011| location = New York| page = | isbn = 0-07-803824-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'', religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress| first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie| first2 = (ed) John  | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press| edition = | year = 1986| location = Philadelphia| page = 401| isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the views of others, the two can overlap. According to one definition, morality is an active process which is, "at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason, that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing, while giving equal consideration to the interests of all those affected by what one does."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"/&gt;

[[Value judgment]]s can vary greatly between religions, past and present. People in various religious traditions, such as [[Christianity]], may derive ideas of right and wrong from the rules and laws set forth in their respective authoritative guides and by their religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|edition= | authorlink = Simon Blackburn|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equating morality to adherence to authoritative commands in a holy book is the [[Divine Command Theory]].&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"/&gt; [[Polytheistic]] religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] generally draw from some of the broadest canons of religious works.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhippriya Subhadra Siriwardena, [http://www.lankaweb.com/dhamma/view12.html 'The Buddhist perspective of lay morality'], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; There has been interest in the relationship between religion and crime and other behavior that does not adhere to contemporary laws and [[social norm]]s in various countries. Studies conducted in recent years have explored these relationships, but the results have been mixed and sometimes contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Saint George, [http://www.prisoners.com/relcrime.html "Religion's Effects On  Crime Rates"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of religious faiths to provide value frameworks that are seen as useful is a debated matter. Religious commentators have asserted that a moral life cannot be led without an [[Divine law|absolute lawgiver]] as a guide. Other observers assert that moral behavior does not rely on religious tenets, and secular commentators point to ethical challenges within various religions that conflict with contemporary social norms.

== Relationship between religion and morality ==
Within the wide range of ethical traditions, religious traditions co-exist with secular value frameworks such as [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], and others. There are many types of religious values. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] (and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]]) define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective gods and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. [[Polytheistic]] religious traditions tend to be less absolute. For example, within [[Buddhism]], the intention of the individual and the circumstances play roles in determining whether an action is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Morgan, "Buddhism." In {{cite book |title = Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition = Second|editor1-first =  Peggy|editor1-last = Morgan|editor2-first = Clive A. | editor2-last = Lawton|year = 2007|publisher = Columbia University Press|location = |isbn = 978-0-7486-2330-3 |pages = 61, 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Stoler Miller]] points out a further disparity between the morals of religious traditions, stating that in Hinduism, "practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism, this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War |last =  Miller|first = Barbara Stoler|year = 2004|publisher = Random House|location = New York|isbn = 0-553-21365-2 |page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stephen Gaukroger]]: "It was generally assumed in the 17th century that religion provided the unique basis for morality, and that without religion, there could be no morality."&lt;ref name="Gaukroger 2012 91"&gt;{{cite book |title = Objectivity: A Very Short Introduction|edition = |last = Gaukroger|first = Stephen|year = 2012|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-960669-6|page = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view slowly shifted over time. In 1690, [[Pierre Bayle]] asserted that religion "is neither necessary nor sufficient for morality".&lt;ref name="Gaukroger 2012 91"/&gt; Modern sources separate the two concepts. For example, ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' says that, &lt;blockquote&gt;For many religious people, morality and religion are the same or inseparable; for them either morality is part of religion or their religion is their morality. For others, especially for nonreligious people, morality and religion are distinct and separable; religion may be immoral or nonmoral, and morality may or should be nonreligious. Even for some religious people the two are different and separable; they may hold that religion should be moral and morality should be, but they agree that they may not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress | first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie | first2 = (ed) John | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press | edition = | year = 1986 | location = Philadelphia | page = 400 | isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richard Paula and Linda Elder of the Foundation for Critical Thinking assert that, "Most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs, and the law." They separate the concept of ethics from these topics, stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;The proper role of ethical reasoning is to highlight acts of two kinds: those which enhance the well-being of others—that warrant our praise—and those that harm or diminish the well-being of others—and thus warrant our criticism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|edition = |last1 = Paul|first1 = Richard|last2 = Elder|first2 = Linda|year = 2006|publisher = Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location = United States|isbn = 0-944583-17-2|pages = np}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; They note problems that could arise if religions defined ethics, such as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

# religious practices like "torturing unbelievers or burning them alive" potentially being labeled "ethical"
# the lack of a common religious baseline across humanity because religions provide different theological definitions for the idea of [[sin]]

They further note that various documents, such as the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]] lay out "transcultural" and "trans-religious" ethical concepts and principles—such as slavery, genocide, torture, sexism, racism, murder, assault, fraud, deceit, and intimidation—which require no reliance on religion (or social convention) for us to understand they are "ethically wrong".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Armin Geertz suggests that "the age-old assumption that religion produces morals and values is neither the only, nor the most parsimonious, hypothesis for religion".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious frameworks ==
Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in [[Hinduism]], which recognizes that it "may be inevitable and indeed necessary" in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Menski, "Hinduism." In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Christian traditions, certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms, such as [[abortion]] or [[divorce]]. In the latter case, a 2008 study by the Barna Group found that some denominations have a significantly higher divorce rate than those in non-religious demographic groups (atheists and agnostics). However Catholics and Evangelical Christians had the lowest divorce rates and the agnostic/atheist group had by far the lowest number of married couples to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/15-familykids/42-new-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-released|title= New Marriage and Divorce Statistics Released|author= Barna Group|date= 31 March 2008|publisher= Barna Group|accessdate= 19 November 2011|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141219120231/http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/15-familykids/42-new-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-released|archivedate= 19 December 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas Dixon, "Many today&amp;nbsp;... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world."&lt;ref name="Dixon 2008 115"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| pages = 115| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] Ron Rhodes has remarked that "it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/Atheism.html|title=Strategies for Dialoguing with Atheists|author=Ron Rhodes|publisher=[http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/ Reasoning from the Scriptures Ministries]|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Dixon states, "Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong."&lt;ref name="Dixon 2008 115"/&gt;

== Religion and social dimensions ==

The study of religion and morality is contentious due to conceptual differences.  The ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definition of religiosity all contribute to conflicting findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=R|last2=Whitehouse|first2=H|title=Religion and morality.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=March 2015|volume=141|issue=2|pages=447–73|doi=10.1037/a0038455|pmid=25528346|pmc=4345965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galen|first1=LW|title=Does religious belief promote prosociality? A critical examination.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=September 2012|volume=138|issue=5|pages=876–906|doi=10.1037/a0028251|pmid=22925142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership of a religious group can accentuate biases in behavior toward in group versus out group members, which may explain the lower number of interracial friends and greater approval of torture among church members.  Furthermore, some studies have shown that religious prosociality is primarily motivated by wanting to appear prosocial, which may be related to the desire to further ones religious group.  The egoistically motivated prosociality may also affect self-reports, resulting in biased results. Peer ratings can be biased by stereotypes, and indications of a persons group affiliation are sufficient to bias reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galen|first1=LW|title=The complex and elusive nature of religious prosociality: reply to Myers (2012) and Saroglou (2012).|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=September 2012|volume=138|issue=5|pages=918–23|doi=10.1037/a0029278|pmid=22925145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are racially segregated, and only 12% have a degree of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don’t We Practice What We Preach?

According to global research done by Gallup on people from 145 countries, adherents of all the major world religions who attended religious services in the past week reported higher rates of generosity such as donating money, volunteering, and helping a stranger than do their coreligionists who did not attend services (non-attenders). Even for people who were nonreligious, those who said they attended religious services in the past week exhibited more generous behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stark|first1=Rodney|last2=Smith|first2=Buster G.|title=Religious Attendance Relates to Generosity Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/122807/religious-attendance-relates-generosity-worldwide.aspx|publisher=Gallup|date=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another global study by Gallup on people from 140 countries showed that highly religious people are more likely to help others in terms of donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers despite them having, on average, lower incomes than those who are less religious or nonreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crabtree|first1=Steve|last2=Pelham|first2=Brett|title=Worldwide, Highly Religious More Likely to Help Others|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/111013/worldwide-highly-religious-more-likely-help-others.aspx|publisher=Gallup|date=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study on [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social]] sentiments showed that non-religious people were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people were less inclined when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120430140035.htm Highly Religious People Are Less Motivated by Compassion Than Are Non-Believers] by Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura R.

A study by [[Harvard University]] professor [[Robert Putnam]] found that religious people were more charitable than their irreligious counterparts.&lt;ref name="Relgion &amp; Charity"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-05-14-church-community_N.htm|title =Religious citizens more involved -- and more scarce? |publisher = [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="better neighbors"&gt;{{cite news | title =Religious people are 'better neighbors'| work = [[USA Today]] | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-11-15-column15_ST_N.htm |accessdate = 2007-10-18|first1=David|last1=Campbell|first2=Robert|last2=Putnam|date=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study revealed that forty percent of [[service of worship|worship service]] attending Americans volunteered regularly to help the poor and elderly as opposed to 15% of Americans who never attend services.&lt;ref name="Relgion &amp; Charity"/&gt; Moreover, religious individuals were more likely than non-religious individuals to volunteer for school and youth programs (36% vs. 15%), a neighborhood or civic group (26% vs. 13%), and for health care (21% vs. 13%).&lt;ref name="Relgion &amp; Charity"/&gt; Other research has shown similar correlations between religiosity and giving.&lt;ref name="Brooks Giving"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Arthur|title=Religious Faith and Charitable Giving|url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/6577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern research in [[Relationship between criminology and sociology of education|criminology]] also acknowledges an inverse relationship between religion and crime,&lt;ref&gt;As is stated in: Doris C. Chu (2007). Religiosity and Desistance From Drug Use. Criminal Justice and Behavior, 2007; 34; 661 originally published online Mar 7, 2007; {{doi|10.1177/0093854806293485}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some studies establishing this connection.&lt;ref&gt;
For example:
* Albrecht, S. I., Chadwick, B. A., &amp; Alcorn, D. S. (1977). Religiosity and deviance:Application of an attitude-behavior contingent consistency model. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 16, 263–274.

&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of 60 studies on religion and crime concluded, "religious behaviors and beliefs exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Baier, C. J.,&amp; Wright, B. R. (2001). "If you love me, keep my commandments":A meta-analysis of the effect of religion on crime. Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency,38,3–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in his books about the materialism in Americas Evangelical Churches [[Ron Sider]] accuses fellow Christians of failing to do better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Ronald J. Sider, ''The Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience: Why Are Christians Living Just Like the Rest of the World?'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 2005). Sider quotes extensively from polling research by [[The Barna Group]] showing that moral behavior of evangelical Christians is unexemplary.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Georgia State University]] study published in the academic journal ''Theoretical Criminology'' suggests that religion helps criminals to justify their crimes and might "encourage" it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/03/08/faith_based_prison_programs_new_study_suggests_religion_may_help_criminals.html | title=New Study Suggests Religion May Help Criminals Justify Their Crimes | publisher=www.slate.com | accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research concluded that "many street offenders anticipate an early death, making them less prone to delay gratification, more likely to discount the future costs of crime, and thus more likely to offend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://tcr.sagepub.com/content/17/1/49.short?rss=1&amp;amp%3bssource=mfr | title=With God on my side: The paradoxical relationship between religious belief and criminality among hardcore street offenders |author1=Volkan Topalli |author2=Timothy Brezina |author3=Mindy Bernhardt | journal=Theoretical Criminology |date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of religious values ==
Religious values can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on [[murder]], mass atrocities, and [[slavery]]. For example, [[Simon Blackburn]] states that "apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to Christianity, he states that the "[[Bible]] can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provides examples such as the phrase in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18 that has "helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America": "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live," and notes that the [[Old Testament]] God apparently has "no problems with a slave-owning society", considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and "is keen on child abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn notes morally suspect themes {{which|date=February 2017}} in the Bible's New Testament as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[David Hume]] stated that, "The greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hume]], "The Natural History of Religion." In {{cite book |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last= Hitchens|first= Christopher|year= 2007|publisher= Da Capo Press|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0-306-81608-6|page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] said, "There are also, in most religions, specific ethical tenets which do definite harm. The Catholic condemnation of birth control, if it could prevail, would make the mitigation of poverty and the abolition of war impossible. The Hindu beliefs that the cow is a sacred animal and that it is wicked for widows to remarry cause quite needless suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that &lt;blockquote&gt;You find this curious fact, that the more intense has been the religion of any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs....You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in humane feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races, or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects |edition= |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1957 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd. |location= New York |isbn=978-0-671-20323-8 |pages= 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Paul Copan, Jewish laws in the bible show an evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing forced slavery and identifying slaves as persons and not property.&lt;ref name="Paul Copan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Copan |first=Paul |url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/201102/201102_108_slavery.htm.cfm |title=Does the Old Testament Endorse Slavery? An Overview |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bertrand Russell, "Clergymen almost necessarily fail in two ways as teachers of morals. They condemn acts which do no harm and they condone acts which do great harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites an example of a clergyman who was warned by a physician that his wife would die if she had another (her tenth) child, but impregnated her regardless, which resulted in her death. "No one condemned him; he retained his benefice and married again. So long as clergymen continue to condone cruelty and condemn 'innocent' pleasure, they can only do harm as guardians of the morals of the young."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|pages= 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell further states that, "The sense of sin which dominates many children and young people and often lasts on into later life is a misery and a source of distortion that serves no useful purpose of any sort or kind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russel allows that religious sentiments have, historically, sometimes led to morally acceptable behavior, but asserts that, "in the present day, [1954] such good as might be done by imputing a theological origin to morals is inextricably bound up with such grave evils that the good becomes insignificant in comparison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are number of secular value frameworks, such as [[consequentialism]],  [[freethought]], [[humanism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Yet, there have been opposing views about the ability of both religious and secular moral frameworks to provide useful guides to right and wrong actions.

Various non-religious commentators have supported the ability of secular value frameworks to provide useful guides. [[Bernard Williams]] argued that, "Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate ''morality'' at all&amp;nbsp;... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Morality|authorlink1=Bernard Williams|last= Williams|first= Bernard|year= 1972|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge|isbn= 0-521-45729-7|pages= 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers criticize religious morals as incompatible with modern social norms. For example, popular atheist [[Richard Dawkins]], writing in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that we now consider morally repugnant. He has stated that [[Religious views of Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Religious aspects of Nazism|Nazis]] held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the [[Holocaust]] on account of [[Christian antisemitism|antisemitic Christian]] doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed [[Christianity and women|unfair restrictions]] on the legal and civil rights of women, and that [[Slavery and Christianity|Christians have condoned slavery]] of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The God Delusion]] |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston, New York |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |pages= 262–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul Copan, the position of the Bible to slaves is a positive one for the slaves in that Jewish laws imposed a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treated slaves as persons, not property.&lt;ref name="Paul Copan"/&gt;

'''Nelle Artis Coley''', a noted educator, was born in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro, NC]] in 1909.  She attended local [[Parochial school|parochial primary schools]] (Episcopal and Lutheran) in Greensboro before starting public school (Washington Street School?). She entered [[Bennett College]] in 1926, completing her high school studies in 1927.  For the next four years, she alternated her studies with summer employment as a waitress in restaurants on the [[Jersey Shore|New Jersey shore]].  She completed her undergraduate studies at Bennett College in 1931. Unable to find work in Greensboro, she moved to [[Beaufort, North Carolina]], where she found a teaching job.

Mrs. Coley continued teaching in Beaufort through the early 1930s, and spent her summers in New York, pursuing graduate studies at [[Columbia University]]. She completed her graduate studies at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] in 1935. In the fall of 1935, she returned to Greensboro and started teaching at James B. Dudley Senior High.  She taught English courses at Dudley until her retirement in 1980.  Mrs. Coley died on April 14, 1999 after a brief illness.

He was born in Hong Kong, HKSAR China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skypost.hk/%25E6%25B8%25AF%25E8%2581%259E/%25E6%2596%25B0%25E8%2581%259E%25E9%25A0%25AD%25E6%25A2%259D/20130708/001/%25E6%259C%2583%25E8%2580%25833%25E5%2588%2586%2520%25E5%25B9%25B4%25E8%25B3%25BA%25E7%2599%25BE%25E8%2590%25AC/100981|website = www.skypost.hk|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an exchange student in Australia. A turning point came when his host asked, "I want to ask from your soul, what do you want？". He then discovered a talent in [[public speaking]]. After accumulating experience in teaching etiquette, he started the first etiquette school in Hong Kong, providing training for major corporations.

In computing, a '''one-pass algorithm''' is a [[streaming algorithm]] which reads its input exactly once, in order, without unbounded [[Buffer (computer science)|buffering]].  A one-pass algorithm generally requires O(n) (see [[Big O Notation|'big O' notation]]) time and less than O(n) storage (typically O(1)), where n is the size of the input.

Basically one-pass algorithm operates as follows:
(1) the object descriptions are processed serially;
(2) the first object becomes the cluster representative of the first cluster;
(3) each subsequent object is matched against all cluster representatives existing at
its  processing time;
(4) a given object is assigned to one cluster (or more if overlap is allowed) according
to  some condition on the matching function;
(5) when an object is  assigned to a cluster the representative for that cluster is
recomputed;
(6) if an object fails a certain test it becomes the cluster representative of  a new
cluster (7) nothing happened
==Example problems solvable by one-pass algorithms==
Given any list as an input:
* Count the number of elements.
* Find the ''n''th element (or report that the list has fewer than ''n'' elements).
* Find the ''n''th element from the end (or report that the list has fewer than ''n'' elements).

Given a list of numbers:
* Find the ''k'' largest or smallest elements, ''k'' given in advance.
* Find the [[summation|sum]], [[mean]], [[variance]] and [[standard deviation]] of the elements of the list.

Given a list of symbols from an alphabet of ''k'' symbols, given in advance.
* Count the number of times each symbol appears in the input.
* Find the most or least frequent elements.
* Sort the list according to some order on the symbols (possible since the number of symbols is limited).
* Find the maximum gap between two appearances of a given symbol.

==Example problems not solvable by one-pass algorithms==
Given any list as an input:
* Find the middle element of the list.

Given a list of numbers:
* Find the [[median]].
* Find the [[mode (statistics)|modes]] (This is not the same is finding the most frequent symbol from a limited alphabet).
* Sort the list.

'''OpenStructures''' is an [[open source]] [[modular design|modular construction]] model based on a shared geometrical grid, called the OS grid. It was conceived by designer [[Thomas Lommée]], and first demonstrated at the [[Art Museum Z33|Z33]], a house for contemporary art.&lt;ref name="dfe"&gt;{{cite web|work=openmaterials.org|accessdate=31 December 2014|title=OpenStructures :: everyone designs for everyone|url=http://openmaterials.org/openstructures-everyone-designs-for-everyone/|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.z33.be/en/about-z33-mobile About Z33], Z33.be&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lommee, the OpenStructures project explores the possibility of a modular system where "everyone designs for everyone." OpenStructures is developing a database where anyone can share designs which are in turn available for download by the public. Each component design in the OS system will feature previously designed OS parts that were used to create it. In addition, each part will feature component designs that can be made from it.

The OpenStructures model includes large and small scale manufacturers as well as craftsmen. They are invited to create their own designs according to the OS standard for sale on the market, which can in turn be fixed or disassembled at their end of life and made into new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Page &gt; About. &gt; show|url = http://openstructures.net/pages/2#vraag-1c|website = openstructures.net|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;!--needs expansion; http://openstructures.net/pages/2 --&gt;
== Grid ==
[[File:OpenStructures.jpg|thumb]]
The OpenStructures grid is built around a square of  4 x 4 cm and is scalable.  The squares can be further subdivided or put together to form larger squares, without losing inter-compatibility. The image shows nine complete squares of each 4x4 cm put together. 

Designers use the OS grid to determine dimensions, assembly points, and interconnecting diameters. This allows parts that were not originally from the same design to be used together in a new design. 

== Scales==
OpenStructures works at several [[scale model|scales]], and analogies are made to [[biological system]]s including (from smallest to biggest):&lt;ref name="dfe"/&gt;

* ''Parts'', like [[body tissue]]s.
* ''Components'', like [[organ (biology)|organs]], formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues. An example is a motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=openstructures.net|accessdate=31 December 2014|volume=The Component Database|title=Search|url=http://openstructures.net/pages/11/components}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Structures'', like a group of related organs in an [[organ system]]. Here, different components are composed with frames and joints, such as a bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=openstructures.net|accessdate=31 December 2014|volume=The Structures Database|url=http://openstructures.net/pages/14/structures/35|title=Triangle bike}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=openstructures.net|accessdate=31 December 2014|volume=The Structures Database|url=http://openstructures.net/pages/14/structures/3|title=OpenCargoBike}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Superstructures'', like [[organism]]s, can be understood as the whole hierarchical assembly of different structures that together function as a stable whole which has the capacity to grow and develop. Example are houses or [[electric vehicle]]s.

== Open architecture==
{{See also|Open-source architecture|Modular building}}
One of the research areas of OpenStructures is architecture. Architects of the [[Brussels Cooperation Collective]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc-as.org/ Brussels Cooperation Collective]&lt;/ref&gt; have worked on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=z33.be|accessdate=31 December 2014|title=Workshop OpenStructures / Open Architecture|url=http://www.z33.be/en/projects/workshop-openstructures-open-architecture|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brusselscooperation.be/bcstudies/?p=96 Short Description and Master Document Case Study n°1], The project Case Study n°1  is a master plan for a social centre and community in Katanga, Congo, developed in collaboration with ‘Intrastructures’, a Belgian design studio. This was developed according to the ‘OpenStructures’ principles.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autarchitecture]] ({{lang-vls|autarkytecture}}, {{ety|grc|auto|self||architecture}}) is based in OpenStructures and proposes flexible constructions that can adapt over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.z33.be/en/artworks/thomas-lommee-christiane-hoegner-autarkytecture|title=Thomas Lommée &amp; Christiane Hoegner - Autarkytecture|work=z33.be|year=2013|accessdate=1 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231104727/http://m.z33.be/en/artworks/thomas-lommee-christiane-hoegner-autarkytecture|archivedate=31 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Corrected reference to Talbot’s paper negative process. The waxed paper process was invented by French photographer Gustave le Gray and introduced in 1851.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">The '''paper negative''' process consists of using a [[Negative (photography)|negative]] printed on [[paper]] (either photographically or digitally) to create the final print of a [[photograph]], as opposed to using a modern negative on a [[film base]] of [[cellulose acetate]].  The plastic acetate negative (which is what modern films produce) enables the printing of a very sharp image intended to be as close a representation of the actual subject as is possible.  By using a negative based on paper instead, there is the possibility of creating a more ethereal image, simply by using a paper with a very visible grain, or by drawing on the paper or distressing it in some way.  

One of the original forms of [[photography]] was based on the paper negative process. William Henry Fox Talbot's paper negative process, which was used to create his work "[[The Pencil of Nature]]", used a negative created on paper treated with [[silver]] salts, which was exposed in a [[camera obscura]] to create the negative and then contact printed on a similar paper to produce a [[Positive (photography)|positive]] image.      

When Talbot created this process it was intended to be a way to reproduce nature as accurately as possible (hence the name of his work, "The Pencil of Nature"). Through the years afterwards, however, better and more accurate ways of producing exact replicas of nature were developed, and these processes relegated the paper negative process to obsolescence.  

The process of the paper negative is still relevant, though, in the realm of alternative-process photography.  Photographers employing alternative processes reject the idea of the exact replica of nature and seek to use the inherent inexactness of antiquated processes to create a more personal and emotional image.  The paper negative is an extremely versatile process that allows all manner of reworking and retouching of an image, and is the perfect medium to bridge the gap between [[camera operator]] and [[artist]].

'''Permaculture''' is a set of design principles centered around [[Systems thinking|whole systems thinking]] simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and [[resilience|resilient]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} features observed in natural [[ecosystem]]s. It uses these principles in a growing number of fields from [[regenerative agriculture]], [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] to [[Community resilience|community]] and [[Organization|organizational]] design and development.

With its system of applied education, research and citizen- led [[Design thinking|design]] permaculture has grown a popular web of global networks and developed into a global [[social movement]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn | King | 1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy.

It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, [[ecological design]], [[ecological engineering]], [[regenerative design]], [[environmental design]], and [[construction]]. Permaculture also includes [[integrated water resources management]] that develops [[sustainable architecture]], and regenerative and self-maintained [[habitat]] and agricultural systems modelled from natural ecosystems.{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gxW0MGXha6cC&amp;pg=PA5  5]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mars | first = Ross| title= The Basics of Permaculture Design|publisher=Chelsea Green |year=2005|isbn=978-1-85623-023-0|page=1|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MWb6i-G6QAkC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mollison has said: "Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a [[Monocropping|single product system]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mollison, B. (1991). ''Introduction to permaculture''. Tasmania, Australia: Tagari.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12 principles of permaculture most commonly referred to are first described by David Holmgren in his book ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'' (2002). They include: Observe and Interact, Catch and Store Energy, Obtain a Yield, Apply Self Regulation and Accept Feedback, Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services, Produce No Waste, Design From Patterns to Details, Integrate Rather Than Segregate, Use Small and Slow Solutions, Use and Value Diversity, Use Edges and Value the Marginal, and Creatively Use and Respond to Change.

==History==
Several individuals revolutionized the branch of permaculture. In 1929, [[Joseph Russell Smith]] added an antecedent term as the subtitle for ''Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture'', a book which sums up his long experience experimenting with fruits and nuts as crops for human food and animal feed.&lt;ref name = jrsjs&gt;{{cite book | first1=Joseph Russell |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Smith | title=Tree Crops: A permanent agriculture| publisher=Island Press | year= 1987|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0PQvqpVnFbAC&amp;lpg=PP1 | isbn = 978-1-59726873-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees and crops underneath. This book inspired many individuals intent on making agriculture more sustainable, such as [[Toyohiko Kagawa]] who pioneered [[forest farming]] in [[Japan]] in the 1930s.{{Sfn | Hart| 1996|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA41  41]}}

In Australian P.A. Yeomans' 1964 book ''Water for Every Farm'', he supports the definition of permanent agriculture, as one that can be sustained indefinitely. Yeomans introduced both an observation-based approach to land use in Australia in the 1940s and the Keyline Design as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in the 1950s.

Holmgren noted [[Stewart Brand]]’s works as an early influence to permaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Essence of Permaculture | url = http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http://www.holmgren.com.au/html/Writings/weeds.html | first = David | last = Holmgren | publisher = Holmgren Design Services | accessdate = 10 September 2011 | year = 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080526225318/http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.holmgren.com.au%2Fhtml%2FWritings%2Fweeds.html | archivedate = 26 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early influences include [[Ruth Stout]] and [[Esther Deans]], who pioneered [[no-dig gardening]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] who, in the late 1930s in Japan, began advocating [[no-till]] orchards and gardens and [[natural farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The One-Straw Revolution by Masanobu Fukuoka |first=Bill |last=Mollison |newspaper=[[Nation Review]] |date= 15–21 September 1978 |page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill Mollison 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Mollison]] in 2008.]]
In the late 1960s, Bill Mollison and David Holmgren started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island state of [[Tasmania]]. Dangers of the rapidly growing use of industrial-agricultural methods sparked these ideas.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"&gt;''Introduction to Permaculture'', 1991, Mollison, p.v&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, these methods were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing [[biodiversity]], and removing billions of tons of [[topsoil]] from previously fertile landscapes. They responded with a design approach called ''permaculture.'' This term was first made public with their publication of their 1978 book ''Permaculture One''.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"/&gt;

Among some of the more recognizable names who received their original training within Mollison's PDC system would include [[Geoff Lawton]] and [[Toby Hemenway]], each of whom have more than 25 years experience teaching and promoting permaculture as a sustainable way of growing food. [[Simon J Fjell]] was a Founding Director of the Permaculture Institute in late 1979 and a teacher of the first Permaculture Design Course, having first met Mollison in 1976. He has since worked internationally and is currently listing a major social enterprise on NASDAQ.

By the early 1980s, the concept had broadened from agricultural systems design towards [[Sustainable habitat|sustainable human habitats]]. After ''Permaculture One'', Mollison further refined and developed the ideas by designing hundreds of permaculture sites and writing more detailed books, such as ''Permaculture: A Designers Manual''. Mollison lectured in over 80 countries and taught his two-week Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to hundreds of students. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Mollison "encouraged graduates to become teachers themselves and set up their own institutes and demonstration sites. This multiplier effect was critical to permaculture’s rapid expansion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1 = Lillington| first1 = Ian| last2 = Holmgren | first2 = David |last3=Francis|first3=Robyn|last4=Rosenfeldt|first4= Robyn|title= The Permaculture Story: From ‘Rugged Individuals’ to a Million Member Movement|url= https://www.pipmagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/what-is-permaculture.pdf | format = PDF | work =Pip Magazine|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permaculture movement also spread throughout Asia and Central America, with Hong Kong-based Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA),&lt;ref&gt;[https://daforum.wordpress.com/aisa/ Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Rony Lec leading the foundation of the Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://imapermaculture.org Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Guatemala and Juan Rojas co-founding the Permaculture Institute of El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permacultura.com.sv Permaculture Institute of El Salvador]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core tenets and principles of design==

* '''Care for the earth''': Provision for all life systems to continue and multiply. This is the first principle, because without a healthy earth, [[human]]s cannot flourish.
* '''Care for the people''': Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence
* '''Fair share''': By governing our own needs, we can set resources aside to further the above principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: a Designer's Manual |last=Mollison |first=Bill |year=1988 |publisher=Tagari Press |isbn = 0-908228-01-5 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mollison|first=Bill|title=Permaculture: A Quiet Revolution | type = interview |url=http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/mollison.html|work= Scott London |accessdate= 17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third ethic is  referred to as Fair Share, which reflects that each of us should take no more than what we need before we reinvest the surplus.

Permaculture design emphasizes patterns of [[landscape]], function, and species assemblies.  It determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment. Permaculture maximizes useful connections between components and [[synergy]] of the final design. The focus of permaculture, therefore, is not on each separate element, but rather on the relationships created among elements by the way they are placed together; the whole becomes [[Emergence|greater than the sum of its parts]]. Permaculture design therefore seeks to minimize [[waste]], human labor, and energy input by building systems, and maximizes benefits between design elements to achieve a high level of [[synergy]]. Permaculture designs evolve over time by taking into account these relationships and elements and can evolve into extremely complex systems that produce a high density of food and materials with minimal input.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edibleforestgardens.com/|title=Edible Forest Gardening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design principles, which are the conceptual foundation of permaculture, were derived from the science of [[systems ecology]] and study of pre-industrial examples of [[sustainable]] land use. Permaculture draws from several disciplines including [[organic farming]], [[agroforestry]], [[integrated farming]], [[sustainable development]], and [[applied ecology]].&lt;ref name="David Holmgren 1997"&gt;{{cite web | title = Weeds or Wild Nature | url = http://holmgren.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/23_weeds_or_wild_nature.pdf | first = David | last = Holmgren |publisher= Permaculture International Journal |accessdate= 10 September 2011 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture has been applied most commonly to the design of housing and landscaping, integrating techniques such as [[agroforestry]], [[natural building]], and [[rainwater harvesting]] within the context of permaculture design principles and theory. {{FACT|date=January 2018}}

==Theory==
===Twelve design principles===
Twelve Permaculture design principles articulated by David Holmgren in his ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holmgren.com.au/product/principles/ |title=Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability |publisher=Holmgren Design |accessdate= 21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Observe and interact'': By taking time to engage with nature we can design solutions that suit our particular situation.
# ''Catch and store energy'': By developing systems that collect resources at peak abundance, we can use them in times of need.
# ''Obtain a yield'': Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.
# ''Apply self-regulation and accept feedback'': We need to discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well.
# ''Use and value [[renewable]] resources and services'': Make the best use of nature's abundance to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on non-renewable resources.
# ''Produce no waste'': By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.
# ''Design from patterns to details'': By stepping back, we can observe patterns in nature and society. These can form the backbone of our designs, with the details filled in as we go.
# ''Integrate rather than segregate'': By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other.
# ''Use small and slow solutions'': Small and slow systems are easier to maintain than big ones, making better use of local resources and producing more sustainable outcomes.
# ''Use and value diversity'': Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.
# ''Use edges and value the marginal'': The interface between things is where the most interesting events take place. These are often the most valuable, diverse and productive elements in the system.
# ''Creatively use and respond to change'': We can have a positive impact on inevitable change by carefully observing, and then intervening at the right time.

===Layers===
[[File:Claire Gregorys Permaculture garden.jpg|thumb|238px|Suburban permaculture garden in [[Sheffield]], UK with different layers of vegetation]]
Layers are one of the tools used to design functional ecosystems that are both sustainable and of direct benefit to humans. A mature ecosystem has a huge number of relationships between its component parts: trees, [[understory]], [[ground cover]], [[soil]], [[fungi]], insects, and animals.  Because plants grow to different heights, a diverse community of life is able to grow in a relatively small space, as the vegetation occupies different layers.  There are generally seven recognized layers in a [[forest gardening|food forest]], although some practitioners also include [[fungi]] as an eighth layer.&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://tcpermaculture.com/site/2013/05/27/nine-layers-of-the-edible-forest-garden/ | title = Nine layers of the edible forest garden | date = 27 May 2013 | publisher = TC permaculture}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]: the tallest trees in the system. Large trees dominate but typically do not saturate the area, i.e. there exist patches barren of trees.
# [[Understory]] layer: trees that flourish in the dappled light under the canopy.
# [[Shrub layer]]: a diverse layer of woody perennials of limited height. Includes most berry bushes.
# [[Herbaceous layer]]: Plants in this layer die back to the ground every winter (if winters are cold enough, that is). They do not produce woody stems as the Shrub layer does. Many culinary and medicinal herbs are in this layer. A large variety of beneficial plants fall into this layer. May be annuals, biennials or perennials.
# Soil surface/[[Groundcover]]: There is some overlap with the [[Herbaceous layer]] and the [[Groundcover layer]]; however plants in this layer grow much closer to the ground, grow densely to fill bare patches of soil, and often can tolerate some foot traffic. [[Cover crop]]s retain soil and lessen [[erosion]], along with [[green manure]]s that add nutrients and [[organic matter]] to the soil, especially [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen]].
# [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|Rhizosphere]]: Root layers within the soil. The major components of this layer are the soil and the organisms that live within it such as plant roots and [[rhizomes]] (including [[root crop]]s such as [[potato]]es and other edible [[tuber]]s), fungi, insects, nematodes, worms, etc.
# Vertical layer: climbers or [[vine]]s, such as [[runner bean]]s and [[lima bean]]s (vine varieties).&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://permacultureschool.ca/food-forests/seven-layers-of-a-forest/ | title = Food forests | contribution = Seven layers of a forest | publisher = Permaculture school | place = [[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilds===
A guild is a group of species where each provides a unique set of diverse functions that work in conjunction or harmony. There are many forms of guilds, including guilds of plants with similar functions that could interchange within an ecosystem, but the most common perception is that of a mutual support guild. Mutual support guilds are groups of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[insect]]s, etc. that work well together. Plants may be grown for food production, draw nutrients from deep in the soil through tap roots, are nitrogen-fixing [[legumes]], attract [[beneficial insects]], and repel harmful insects. When grouped together in a mutually beneficial arrangement, these plants form a guild.  See Dave Jacke's work on edible forest gardens for more information on other guilds, specifically resource-partitioning and community-function guilds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=D|last2=Dayan|first2=T|title=The Guild Concept and the Structure of Ecological Communities|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=22|page=115|year=1991|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.000555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-70591/community-ecology | work = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Guilds | accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=SE|last2=Hero|first2=JM|title=Rainforest frogs of the Australian Wet Tropics: guild classification and the ecological similarity of declining species|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences | publisher = The Royal Society|volume=265|issue=1396|pages=597–602|year=1998|pmid=9881468|pmc=1689015|doi= 10.1098/rspb.1998.0336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge effect===
The [[edge effect]] in ecology is the effect of the juxtaposition, or placing contrasting [[natural environment|environments]] on an ecosystem. Permaculturists argue that where vastly differing systems meet, there is an intense area of productivity and useful connections. An example of this is the coast; where the land and the sea meet, there is a particularly rich area that meets a disproportionate percentage of human and animal needs.  This idea is played out in permacultural designs by using spirals in herb gardens, or creating ponds that have wavy undulating shorelines rather than a simple circle or oval (thereby increasing the amount of edge for a given area).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-design-principles/10-edge-effect/|title=10. Edge Effect|date=3 April 2013|newspaper=Deep Green Permaculture|language=en-US|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zones===
[[File:Permaculture Zones.svg|thumb|Permaculture zones 0-5]]

Zones intelligently organize design elements in a human environment based on the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs. Frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2.  Manipulated elements located further away are used less frequently. Zones are numbered from 0 to 5 based on positioning.{{Sfn | Burnett, Graham, ''Permaculture A Beginners Guide', Spiralseed, 2001 p.26}}
; Zone 0: The house, or home center.  Here permaculture principles would be applied in terms of aiming to reduce energy and water needs, harnessing natural resources such as sunlight, and generally creating a harmonious, sustainable environment in which to live and work.  Zone 0 is an informal designation, which is not specifically defined in [[Bill Mollison]]’s book.
; Zone 1: The zone nearest to the house, the location for those elements in the system that require frequent attention, or that need to be visited often, such as salad crops, [[herb]] plants, soft fruit like [[Strawberry|strawberries]] or [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[greenhouse]] and [[cold frame]]s, propagation area, [[Vermicompost|worm compost]] bin for kitchen waste, etc. [[Raised bed gardening|Raised beds]] are often used in zone 1 in [[Urban agriculture|urban areas]].
; Zone 2: This area is used for siting [[perennial]] plants that require less frequent maintenance, such as occasional [[weed control]] or [[pruning]], including currant bushes and orchards, pumpkins, sweet potato, etc.  This would also be a good place for [[beehive]]s, larger scale [[compost]]ing bins, etc.
; Zone 3: The area where main-crops are grown, both for domestic use and for trade purposes. After establishment, care and maintenance required are fairly minimal (provided [[mulch]]es and similar things are used), such as watering or weed control maybe once a week.
; Zone 4: A semi-wild area. This zone is mainly used for [[forage]] and collecting wild food as well as production of timber for construction or firewood.
; Zone 5: A wilderness area. There is no human intervention in zone 5 apart from the observation of natural [[ecosystem]]s and cycles. Through this zone we [[Biological pest control|build up a natural reserve of bacteria, moulds and insects]] that can aid the zones above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://edepot.wur.nl/115721 | title = Permacultuur course | publisher = WUR | place = [[Netherlands|NL]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===People and permaculture===
Permaculture uses observation of nature to create regenerative systems, and the place where this has been most visible has been on the landscape. There has been a growing awareness though that firstly, there is the need to pay more attention to the peoplecare ethic, as it is often the dynamics of people that can interfere with projects, and secondly that the principles of permaculture can be used as effectively to create vibrant, healthy and productive people and communities as they have been in landscapes.

===Domesticated animals===
[[List of domesticated animals|Domesticated animals]] are often incorporated into site design, ensuring the efficiency and productivity of the system.{{Sfn | Mollison| 1988|p =5| ps =: ‘[[Deer]], [[rabbit]]s, [[sheep]], and [[herbivorous]] [[fish]] are very useful to us, in that they convert unusable herbage to acceptable human food. Animals represent a valid method of storing inedible vegetation as food.’}}Animals, domestic or wild are a critical component of any wild or designed sustainable ecosystem. Research indicates that without the animal’s participation and contribution, ecological integrity is diminished or impossible.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217221136/http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 December 2014|title=Backyard Animals {{!}} Permaculture Institute|website=www.permaculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the activities that contribute to the system include: foraging to cycle nutrients, clear fallen fruit, weed maintenance, spreading seeds, and pest maintenance. The nutrients are cycled by animals, transformed from their less digestible form (such as grass or twigs) into more nutrient-dense manure.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"/&gt;

Several animals can be incorporated into a permaculture system, including cows, goats, chickens, geese, turkey, rabbits, and worms. A more specific explanation of how the animals can be used is seen in the chicken design. Chickens can be used to scratch over the soil, thus breaking down the top soil and using the fecal matter as manure creating a sustainable system. However, in the domestication of these animals, the complexity and elegance lie in an effectiveness and efficiency of the design, including factors like timing and habits to specific areas of a farm. For example, animals require daily attention in a way that is much more demanding than plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2016/03/07/permaculture-animals-as-a-discipline-to-the-system/|title=Permaculture Animals as a Discipline to the System|date=7 March 2016|website=The Permaculture Research Institute|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common practices==
===Agroforestry===
[[Agroforestry]] is an integrated approach of permaculture, which uses the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops or livestock. It combines agricultural and [[forestry]] technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nac.unl.edu |title=USDA National Agroforestry Center (NAC) |publisher=UNL |date=1 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agroforestry systems, trees or shrubs are intentionally used within agricultural systems, or [[non-timber forest product]]s are cultured in forest settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/documents/OC/FactSheet_final_8-1-11.pdf|title=USDA Agroforestry Strategic Framework|last=|first=|date=1 August 2011|website=|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forest gardening]] is a term permaculturalists use to describe systems designed to mimic natural forests.  Forest gardens, like other permaculture designs, incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems.  The terms forest garden and food forest are used interchangeably in the permaculture literature.  Numerous permaculturists are proponents of forest gardens, such as Graham Bell, [[Patrick Whitefield]], Dave Jacke, Eric Toensmeier and [[Geoff Lawton]]. Bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book ''The Permaculture Garden'' in 1995, Whitefield wrote the book ''How to Make a Forest Garden'' in 2002, Jacke and Toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set ''Edible Forest Gardening'' in 2005, and Lawton presented the film ''Establishing a Food Forest'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|work=Permaculture|title=Graham Bell’s Forest Garden|publisher=Media mice|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308060346/http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Transition culture | url=http://transitionculture.org/2009/02/11/film-review-%E2%80%9Cestablishing-a-food-forest-the-permaculture-way-series/| date = 11 February 2009 | title= Establishing a Food Forest | type = film review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree Gardens, such as Kandyan tree gardens, in South and Southeast Asia, are often hundreds of years old.  It is not self-evident whether these tree gardens derived initially from experiences of cultivation and forestry, as is the case in agroforestry, or whether they derived from an understanding of forest ecosystems, as is the case for permaculture systems.  Many studies of these systems, especially those that predate the term permaculture, consider these systems to be forms of agroforestry.  Permaculturalists may obscure the distinction of permaculture and agroforestry when they include existing and ancient systems of polycropping as examples of food forests.

Food forests and agroforestry are parallel approaches that sometimes lead to similar designs.

===Hügelkultur===
[[Hügelkultur]] is the practice of burying large volumes of wood to increase soil water retention. The porous structure of wood acts as a sponge when decomposing underground. During the rainy season, masses of buried wood can absorb enough water to sustain crops through the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, Paul. [http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ "Raised garden beds: hugelkultur instead of irrigation"] Richsoil. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has been used by permaculturalists [[Sepp Holzer]], [[Toby Hemenway]], [[Paul Wheaton]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | pp = 84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Feineigle, Mark. [http://permaculture.org.au/2012/01/04/hugelkultur-composting-whole-trees-with-ease/#more-6825 "Hugelkultur: Composting Whole Trees With Ease"]. Permaculture Research Institute of Australia. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural building===
A [[natural building]] involves a range of [[building]] systems and materials that place major emphasis on sustainability.  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or [[renewable resource]]s, as well as those that, while [[Recycling|recycled]] or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality.

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the [[natural environment|environmental]] impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort, health, or [[aesthetics]]. Natural building primarily utilizes abundantly available natural materials (e.g., clay, rock, sand, straw, wood, reeds), and draws heavily on traditional architectural strategies from various climates across the world.  In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the [[ecological footprint]] is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment, and water reuse.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Most materials are sourced regionally, locally, or even on-site. Straw bales, and various earthen masonry techniques such as adobe bricks, cob (or monolithic adobe), rammed earth and clay-straw infill are common choices for wall material. Roofing coverings often used include sod or "living" roofs, thatch, and wooden shakes or shingles. Rubble trench foundations are popular, as they do not require concrete; likewise, dry-stacked or lime mortared stem walls are common. Natural builders also regularly combine different wall systems in a single building, making best use of different materials' thermal or water resistant properties, for example, where they are most needed in the structure.

===Rainwater harvesting===
[[Rainwater harvesting]] is the accumulating and storing of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the [[aquifer]].&lt;ref name="Rainwater harvesting"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aramo.de/rain.html |title= Rainwater harvesting |year= 2012 |place= [[Germany|DE]] |publisher= Aramo |accessdate= 19 August 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130606063516/http://aramo.de/rain.html |archivedate= 6 June 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to provide [[drinking water]], water for [[livestock]], water for [[irrigation]], as well as  other typical uses. Rainwater collected from the roofs of houses and local institutions can make an important contribution to the availability of drinking water. It can supplement the subsoil water level and increase urban greenery. Water collected from the ground, sometimes from areas which are especially prepared for this purpose, is called [[stormwater harvesting]].{{citation needed |date=June 2012}}

[[Greywater]] is [[wastewater]] generated from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing, which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and [[constructed wetland]]s. Greywater is largely sterile, but not potable (drinkable). Greywater differs from water from the toilets, which is designated [[sewage]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] to indicate it contains [[human waste]]. Blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot easily be reused. There are, however, continuing efforts to make use of blackwater or human waste. The most notable is for composting through a process known as humanure; a combination of the words human and manure. Additionally, the methane in humanure can be collected and used similar to natural gas as a fuel, such as for heating or cooking, and is commonly referred to as biogas. Biogas can be harvested from the human waste and the remainder still used as humanure.  Some of the simplest forms of humanure use include a composting toilet or an outhouse or dry bog surrounded by trees that are heavy feeders which can be coppiced for wood fuel. This process eliminates the use of a standard toilet with plumbing.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

===Sheet mulching===
In agriculture and [[gardening]], mulch is a protective cover placed over the soil. Any material or combination can be used as mulch, such as stones, leaves, cardboard, wood chips, gravel, etc., though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions.  These include absorbing rainfall, reducing evaporation, providing nutrients, increasing organic matter in the soil, feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms, suppressing weed growth and seed germination, moderating diurnal temperature swings, protecting against frost, and reducing erosion. [[Sheet mulching]] is an agricultural no-dig gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within [[forest]]s. Sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors. When deployed properly and in combination with other Permacultural principles, it can generate healthy, productive and low maintenance ecosystems.&lt;ref name="agroforestry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |title=Sheet Mulching: Greater Plant and Soil Health for Less Work |publisher=Agroforestry |date=3 September 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210053204/http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |archivedate=10 December 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "mason"&gt;{{Citation | title = Sustainable Agriculture | first = J | last = Mason | publisher = Landlinks | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}

Sheet mulch serves as a "nutrient bank," storing the nutrients contained in organic matter and slowly making these nutrients available to plants as the organic matter slowly and naturally breaks down. It also improves the soil by attracting and feeding [[earthworms]], [[woodlouse|slaters]] and many other soil micro-organisms, as well as adding [[humus]]. Earthworms "till" the soil, and their [[worm castings]] are among the best fertilizers and [[soil conditioner]]s. Sheet mulching can be used to reduce or eliminate non-desired plants by starving them of light, and can be more advantageous than using [[herbicide]] or other methods of control. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stratton|first1=Margie Lynn|last2=Barker|first2=Allen|last3=Ragsdale|first3=James|title=Sheet composting overpowers weeds in restoration project|journal=BioCycle|date=April 2000|volume=41|issue=4|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensive rotational grazing===
Grazing has long been blamed for much of the destruction we see in the environment. However, it has been shown that when grazing is modeled after nature, the opposite effect can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress|url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|work=International Union for Conservation of Nature|accessdate=6 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315111928/http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774%2FPrince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|archivedate=15 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Grassland birds: Fostering habitat using rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/a3715.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known as cell grazing, [[managed intensive rotational grazing]] (MIRG) is a system of grazing in which ruminant and non-ruminant herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh pasture, range, or forest with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth. This disturbance is then followed by a period of rest which allows new growth. MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, rabbits, geese, turkeys, ducks, and other animals depending on the natural [[ecological community]] that is being mimicked.

===Keyline design===
[[Keyline design]] is a technique for maximizing the beneficial use of water resources of a piece of land developed in Australia by farmer and engineer [[P. A. Yeomans]]. The ''Keyline'' refers to a specific [[topography|topographic feature]] linked to water flow which is used in designing the drainage system of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | type = video | url = http://www.permaculture.co.uk/videos/creating-permaculture-keyline-water-systems-don-tipping | title = Creating Permaculture Keyline Water Systems | first = Don | last = Tipping | place = UK | publisher =Beaver State Permaculture | date= 4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential factor in this system, the Keyline, is a level or sloping line extending in both directions from a point or divides the two types of relationship, always in the same vertical interval, that a valley bears to its ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Keyline plan|last=Yeomas|first=P.A|publisher=Authour|year=1954|isbn=|location=Australia|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fruit tree management===
Some proponents of permaculture advocate no, or limited, pruning. One advocate of this approach is [[Sepp Holzer]] who used the method in connection with [[Hügelkultur]] [[berms]].  He has successfully grown several varieties of fruiting trees at altitudes (approximately {{convert |9000|ft|m}}) far above their normal altitude, temperature, and snow load ranges.  He notes that the Hügelkultur berms kept or generated enough heat to allow the roots to survive during alpine winter conditions.  The point of having unpruned branches, he notes, was that the longer (more naturally formed) branches bend over under the snow load until they touched the ground, thus forming a natural arch against snow loads that would break a shorter, pruned, branch.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[Masanobu Fukuoka]], as part of early experiments on his family farm in Japan, experimented with no-pruning methods, noting that he ended up killing many fruit trees by simply letting them go, which made them become convoluted and tangled, and thus unhealthy.&lt;ref name="Natural Way Farming-Pruning"&gt;{{Citation | last = Masanobu | first = Fukuoka | origyear = 1985 | edition = rev | year = 1987 | title = The Natural Way of Farming – The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy | publisher = Japan Publications | place = Tokyo | page = 204}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978 | pp = 13, 15–18, 46, 58–60}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}} Then he realised this is the difference between natural-form fruit trees and the process of change of tree form that results from abandoning previously-pruned unnatural fruit trees.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}  He concluded that the trees should be raised all their lives without pruning, so they form healthy and efficient branch patterns that follow their natural inclination. This is part of his implementation of the [[Tao]]-philosophy of [[Wu wei|Wú wéi]] translated in part as no-action (against nature), and he described it as no unnecessary pruning, nature farming or "do-nothing" farming, of fruit trees, distinct from non-intervention or literal no-pruning. He ultimately achieved yields comparable to or exceeding standard/intensive practices of using pruning and chemical fertilisation.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}&lt;ref name = "Ramon Magsaysay Award-Bio"&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyFukuokaMas.htm | year = 1988 | title = Public Service | type = biography | contribution = Masanobu Fukuoka | publisher = The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation | place = [[The Philippines|PH]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Permaculture Action'''&lt;/big&gt;

Permaculture helps generate plans that are easy and cheap when it comes to production. Permaculture allows creativity and innovation in farming. The action of permaculture looks and all becoming consciously involved in the process of producing and ensuring abundant food nearby, problem on malnutrition caused by the world hunger problem will inevitably lessen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasarinlan|first=|year=2011|title=Permaculture as Alternative Agriculture|url=http://www.journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/kasarinlan/article/viewFile/3511/pdf_149|journal=Philippine|volume=26|pages=422–434|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture principles in action are powerful forces to help right the environmental wrongs of the last two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.solscape.co.nz/permaculture-sustainability/|title=Permaculture and Sustainability - Solscape|work=Solscape|access-date=6 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark and copyright issues==
There has been contention over who, if anyone, controls legal rights to the word ''permaculture'': is it [[trademark]]ed or [[copyright]]ed? If so, who holds the legal rights to the use of the word? For a long time Bill Mollison claimed to have copyrighted the word, and his books said on the [[copyright page]], "The contents of this book and the word PERMACULTURE are copyright." These statements were largely accepted at face value within the permaculture community. However, copyright law does not protect names, ideas, concepts, systems, or methods of doing something; it only protects the expression or the description of an idea, not the idea itself. Eventually Mollison acknowledged that he was mistaken and that no copyright protection existed for the word ''permaculture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Permaculture Papers 5: time of change and challenge — 2000-2004 | url = http://pacific-edge.info/the-permaculture-papers-5-time-of-change-and-challenge-%E2%80%94-2000-2004/ | first = Russ | last = Grayson | publisher= Pacific edge |accessdate=8 September 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Mollison's US based Permaculture Institute sought a [[service mark]] (a form of trademark) for the word ''permaculture'' when used in educational services such as conducting classes, seminars, or workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)| url = http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4005:o81il1.2.1 |author= [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] |publisher= US Department of Commerce |accessdate=8 September 2011|year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service mark would have allowed Mollison and his two Permaculture Institutes (one in the US and one in Australia) to set enforceable guidelines regarding how permaculture could be taught and who could teach it, particularly with relation to the PDC, despite the fact that he had instituted a system of certification of teachers to teach the PDC in 1993. The service mark failed and was abandoned in 2001. Also in 2001 Mollison applied for trademarks in Australia for the terms "Permaculture Design Course"&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Result | url = http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/Falcon.Result |publisher =[[IP Australia]] |accessdate=8 September 2011| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Permaculture Design".&lt;ref name ="IPA"/&gt; These applications were both withdrawn in 2003. In 2009 he sought a trademark for "Permaculture: A Designers’ Manual"&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; and "Introduction to Permaculture",&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; the names of two of his books. These applications were withdrawn in 2011. There has never been a trademark for the word ''permaculture'' in Australia.&lt;ref name="IPA" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
===General criticisms===
In 2011, Owen Hablutzel argued that "permaculture has yet to gain a large amount of specific mainstream scientific acceptance," and that "the sensitiveness to being perceived and accepted on scientific terms is motivated in part by a desire for permaculture to expand and become increasingly relevant."

In his books ''Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture'' and ''Farming in Ponds and Dams'', Nick Romanowski expresses the view that the presentation of aquaculture in Bill Mollison's books is unrealistic and misleading.&lt;ref name="Romanowski2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Romanowski|title=Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture: The Complete Guide from Backyard to Investor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOCHj_b16jgC|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=978-0-86840-835-4|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agroforestry===
Greg Williams argues that forests cannot be more productive than farmland because the net productivity of forests declines as they mature due to [[ecological succession]].&lt;ref name="Williams 2001"&gt;{{cite news| work=Whole Earth | title= Gaia’s Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture | first=Greg | last= Williams | year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of permaculture respond that this is true only if one compares data between woodland forest and climax vegetation, but not when comparing farmland vegetation with woodland forest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, ecological succession generally results in a forest's productivity rising after its establishment only until it reaches the ''woodland state'' (67% tree cover), before declining until ''full maturity''.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening" /&gt;

==Introduction==
During the early 1900s, the study of regional-scale [[geomorphology]] was termed "physiography". Unfortunately, physiography later was considered to be a contraction of "'''''physi'''''cal" and "ge'''''ography'''''", and therefore synonymous with [[physical geography]], and the concept became embroiled in controversy surrounding the appropriate concerns of that discipline. Some geomorphologists held to a geological basis for physiography and emphasized a concept of physiographic regions while a conflicting trend among geographers was to equate physiography with "pure morphology," separated from its geological heritage. In the period following World War II, the emergence of process, climatic, and quantitative studies led to a preference by many Earth scientists for the term "geomorphology" in order to suggest an analytical approach to landscapes rather than a descriptive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Victor R. |title=Geomorphology From Space: A Global Overview of Regional Landforms, Introduction |publisher=[[NASA]] |year=1986 |url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_1/GEO_CHAPTER_1.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315105147/http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_1/GEO_CHAPTER_1.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In current usage, physiography still lends itself to confusion as to which meaning is meant, the more specialized "geomorphological" definition or the more encompassing "physical geography" definition. For the remainder of this article, emphasis will remain on the more "geomorphological" usage, which is based upon geological landforms, not on climate, vegetation, or other non-geological criteria.

For the purposes of physiographic mapping, landforms are classified according to both their geologic structures and histories. Distinctions based on geologic age also correspond to physiographic distinctions where the forms are so recent as to be in their first [[Cycle of erosion|erosion cycle]], as is generally the case with sheets of [[Glacial Drift|glacial drift]]. Generally, forms which result from similar histories are characterized by certain similar features, and differences in history result in corresponding differences of form, usually resulting in distinctive features which are obvious to the casual observer, but this is not always the case. A maturely [[dissected plateau]] may grade without a break from rugged mountains on the one hand to mildly rolling farm lands on the other. So also, forms which are not classified together may be superficially similar; for example, a young [[coastal plain]] and a [[peneplain]]. In a large number of cases, the boundary lines are also geologic lines, due to differences in the nature or structure of the underlying rocks.&lt;ref name="Fenneman-US" /&gt;

===History===

====19th-century====
The history of "physiography" itself is at best a complicated effort. Much of the complications arise from how the term has evolved over time, both as its own 'science' and as a synonym for other branches of science. In 1848, [[Mary Somerville]] published her book ''Physical Geography'' which gave detailed descriptions of the [[topography]] of each continent, along with the distribution of plant, animals and humans. This work gave impetus to further works along the field. In Germany, Oscar Peschel in 1870, proposed that geographers should study the morphology of the Earth's surface, having an interest in the study of landforms for the development of human beings. As the chair of geography (and a geologist by training) in Bonn, Germany, [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] made the study of landforms the main research field for himself and his students. Elsewhere, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s ''Physiography'' was published in 1877 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name="Huxley1877"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=Physiography: An Introduction to the Study of Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FiT_td97DT8C|date=1 June 1877|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4179-0806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the field of "physical geography" itself was renamed as "physiography". Afterwards, physiography became a very popular school subject in Britain, accounting for roughly 10% of all examination papers in both English and Welsh schools, and physiography was now regarded as an integral, if not the most important aspect of geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt-Jensen |first=Arild |title=Geography, History and Concepts: A Student's Guide |publisher=Sage Publications Inc. |year=1999 |pages=40–42 |isbn=0-7619-6180-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with these 'advances' in physiography, physically and visually mapping these descriptive areas was underway as well. The early photographers and balloonists, [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] and Triboulet, experimented with aerial photography and the view it provided of the landscape. In 1899, [[Albert Heim]] published his photographs and observations made during a balloon flight over the Alps; he is probably the first person to use aerial photography in geomorphological or physiographical research. The block diagrams of Fenneman, Raisz, Lobeck and many others were based in part upon both aerial photography and topographic maps, giving an oblique "birds-eye" view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hayden |first=Robert S. |title=Geomorphology From Space: A Global Overview of Regional Landforms, Chapter 11: Mapping |publisher=NASA |year=1986 |url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_11/index.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====20th century====
By 1901, there were clear differences in the definition of the term physiography. "In England, physiography is regarded as the introduction to [[physical science]] in general. It is made to include the elements of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], physical geography, and [[geology]], and sometimes even certain phases of [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. In America, the term has a somewhat different meaning. It is sometimes used as a [[synonym]] for physical geography, and is sometimes defined as the science which describes and explains the physical features of the earth's surface".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Student's Reference Work: A Cyclopaedia for Teachers, Students, and Families |publisher=C.B. Beach and Company |year=1901 |location=New York and Chicago |pages=1123 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IVkPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1123&amp;dq=subject:%22Encyclopedias+and+dictionaries.%22+%2Bphysiography |author1= Adam, Graeme Mercer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1911, the definition of physiography in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' had evolved to be "In popular usage the words 'physical geography' have come to mean geography viewed from a particular standpoint rather than any special department of the subject. The popular meaning is better conveyed by the word physiography, a term which appears to have been introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], and was reinvented as a substitute for the cosmography of the Middle Ages by Professor Huxley. Although the term has since been limited by some writers to one particular part of the subject, it seems best to maintain the original and literal meaning. In the stricter sense, physical geography is that part of geography which involves the processes of contemporary change in the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the circulation of the fluid envelopes. It thus draws upon physics for the explanation of the phenomena with the space-relations of which it is specially concerned. Physical geography naturally falls into three divisions, dealing respectively with the surface of the [[lithosphere]] – geomorphology; the [[hydrosphere]] – [[oceanography]]; and the [[atmosphere]] – [[climatology]]. All these rest upon the facts of mathematical geography, and the three are so closely inter-related that they cannot be rigidly separated in any discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Geography |volume=11 |page=630 |inline=1 |first=Hugh Robert |last=Mill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1919 edition of ''The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge'' further adjusted the definition to be "Physiography (geomorphology), now generally recognized as a science distinct from geology, deals with the origins and development of land forms, traces out the topographic expression of structure, and embodies a logical history of oceanic basins, and continental elevations; of [[mountain]]s, [[plateau]]s and [[plain]]s; of hills and valleys. Physical geography is used loosely as a synonym, but the term is more properly applied to the borderland between geography and physiography; dealing, as it does, largely with the human element as influenced by its physiographic surroundings".

====21st-century====
Even in the 21st century, some confusion remains as to exactly what "physiography" is. One source states "Geomorphology includes quaternary geology, physiography and most of physical geography",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Geomorphology |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/geomorphology/ |accessdate=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; treating physiography as a separate field, but subservient to geomorphology. Another source states "Geomorphology (or physiography) refers to the study of the surface features of the earth. It involves looking at the distribution of land, water, soil and rock material that forms the land surface. Land is closely linked to the geomorphology of a particular landscape",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Geomorphology |publisher=[[Government of Alberta]] |year=2006 |url=http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/land/quality/html/quality/geomorphology.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225004304/http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/land/quality/html/quality/geomorphology.html |archivedate=2007-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding physiography as synonymous with geomorphology. Yet another source states "Physiography may be viewed from two distinct angles, the one dynamic, the other passive". The same source continues by stating "In a large fashion [[geodynamics]] is intimately associated with certain branches of geology, as [[sediment]]ation, while geomorphology connects physiography with geography. The dynamic interlude representing the active phase of physiography weaves the basic threads of geologic history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glock |first=Waldo S. |title=Dual Nature of Physiography | journal = Science | volume = 72 | issue = 1853 |pages=3–5 |publisher=|year=1930 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/72/1853/3 | doi = 10.1126/science.72.1853.3 |accessdate=2007-12-21 |pmid=17769440 |bibcode=1930Sci....72....3G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Geological Survey defines physiography as a study of "Features and attributes of earth's land surface",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Alphabetical index, Physiography |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |url=http://www.usgs.gov/science/science-kwic.php?letter=p |accessdate=2007-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212213206/http://www.usgs.gov/science/science-kwic.php?letter=p |archivedate=2007-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while geomorphology is defined separately as "Branch of geology dealing with surface land features and the processes that create and change them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Subject index, Geomorphology |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |url=http://www.usgs.gov/science/science.php?term=468 |accessdate=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to this confusion over what "physiography" actually means, some scientists have refrained from using the term physiography (and instead use the similar term geomorphology) because the definitions vary from the American Geological Institute's "the study and classification of the surface features of Earth on the basis of similarities in geologic structure and the history of geologic changes" to descriptions that also include vegetation and/or land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Belward |first=Alan S. |author2=Valenzuela, Carlos R. |title=Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems for Resource Management in Developing Countries |publisher=Springer |year=1991 |pages=430 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8XvOEfo6fX8C&amp;pg=PA430&amp;lpg=PA430&amp;dq=%22geomorphic+mapping%22+physiography |isbn=0-7923-1268-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PAR-1to1.svg|thumb|Pixel aspect ratio 1:1]]
[[Image:PAR-2to1.svg|thumb|Pixel aspect ratio 2:1]]
'''Pixel aspect ratio''' (often abbreviated '''PAR''') is a mathematical [[ratio]] that describes how the width of a [[pixel]] in a [[digital image]] compares to the height of that pixel.

Most [[digital imaging]] systems display an image as a grid of tiny, square pixels. However, some imaging systems, especially those that must be compatible with [[standard-definition television]] motion pictures, display an image as a grid of rectangular pixels, in which the pixel width and height are different. Pixel aspect ratio describes this difference.

Use of pixel aspect ratio mostly involves pictures pertaining to standard-definition television and some other exceptional cases. Most other imaging systems, including those that comply with [[SMPTE]] standards and practices, use square pixels.

== Introduction ==
The ratio of the width to the height of an image is known as the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], or more precisely the '''display aspect ratio''' (DAR) – the aspect ratio of the image ''as displayed;'' for TV, DAR was traditionally 4:3 (a.k.a. fullscreen), with 16:9 (a.k.a. widescreen) now the standard for HDTV. In [[digital image]]s, there is a distinction with the '''[[storage aspect ratio]]''' (SAR), which is the ratio of [[pixel dimensions]]. If an image is displayed with square pixels, then these ratios agree; if not, then non-square, "rectangular" pixels are used, and these ratios disagree. The aspect ratio of the pixels themselves is known as the ''pixel aspect ratio'' (PAR) – for square pixels this is 1:1 – and these are related by the identity:
:SAR&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;PAR&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;DAR.

Rearranging (solving for PAR) yields:
:PAR&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;DAR/SAR.

For example, a 640&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;480 [[VGA]] image has a SAR of 640/480 = 4:3, and if displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3) has square pixels, hence a PAR of 1:1. By contrast, a 720&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;576 [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]] PAL image has a SAR of 720/576 = 5:4, but is displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3).

In analog images such as film there is no notion of pixel, nor notion of SAR or PAR, but in the ''digitization'' of analog images the resulting digital image has pixels, hence SAR (and accordingly PAR, if displayed at the same aspect ratio as the original).

Non-square pixels arise often in early digital TV standards, related to digitalization of analog TV signals – whose vertical and "effective" horizontal resolutions differ and are thus best described by non-square pixels – and also in some digital video cameras and computer [[display mode]]s, such as [[Color Graphics Adapter]] (CGA). Today they arise also in [[transcoding]] between resolutions with different SARs.

Actual displays do not generally have non-square pixels, though digital sensors might; they are rather a mathematical abstraction used in resampling images to convert between resolutions.

There are several complicating factors in understanding PAR, particularly as it pertains to digitization of analog video:
* First, analog video does not have pixels, but rather a [[raster scan]], and thus has a well-defined vertical resolution (the lines of the raster), but not a well-defined ''horizontal'' resolution, since each line is an analog signal. However, by a standardized sampling rate, the effective horizontal resolution can be determined by the [[sampling theorem]], as is done below.
* Second, due to [[overscan]], some of the lines at the top and bottom of the raster are not visible, as are some of the possible image on the left and right – see [[Overscan#Analog to digital resolution issues|Overscan: Analog to digital resolution issues]]. Also, the resolution may be rounded (DV NTSC uses 480 lines, rather than the 486 that are possible).
* Third, analog video signals are ''interlaced'' – each image (frame) is sent as two "fields", each with ''half'' the lines. Thus pixels are either twice as tall as they would be without interlacing, or the image is deinterlaced.

==Background==
{{see also|Aspect ratio (image)#Distinctions}}
[[Video]] is presented as a sequential series of images called video frames. Historically, video frames were created and recorded in analog form. As digital display technology, digital broadcast technology, and digital [[video compression]] evolved separately, it resulted in video frame differences that must be addressed using pixel aspect ratio. Digital video frames are generally defined as a grid of pixels used to present each sequential image. The horizontal component is defined by pixels (or samples), and is known as a video line. The vertical component is defined by the number of lines, as in 480 lines.

[[Standard-definition television]] standards and practices were developed as broadcast technologies and intended for terrestrial broadcasting, and were therefore not designed for digital video presentation. Such standards define an image as an array of well-defined horizontal "'''[[Line (video)|Line]]s'''", well-defined vertical "'''Line Duration'''" and a well-defined picture center. However, there is not a standard-definition television standard that properly defines image edges or explicitly demands a certain number of picture elements per line. Furthermore, analog video systems such as [[NTSC]] [[480i]] and [[PAL]] [[576i]], instead of employing progressively displayed frames, employ [[Field (video)|fields]] or interlaced half-frames displayed in an interwoven manner to reduce flicker and double the image rate for smoother motion.

===Analog-to-digital conversion {{anchor|parrec601}} ===
As a result of computers becoming powerful enough to serve as [[video editing]] tools, video [[digital-to-analog converter]]s and [[analog-to-digital converter]]s were made to overcome this incompatibility. To convert analog video lines into a series of square pixels, the industry adopted a default sampling rate at which [[Luma (video)|luma]] values were extracted into pixels. The luma sampling rate for [[480i]] pictures was '''{{frac|12|3|11}}&amp;nbsp;MHz''' and for 576i pictures was '''{{frac|14|3|4}}&amp;nbsp;MHz'''.

The term ''pixel aspect ratio'' was first coined when [[Rec. 601|ITU-R BT.601]] (commonly known as "[[Rec. 601]]") specified that standard-definition television pictures are made of lines of exactly 720 non-square pixels. ITU-R BT.601 did not define the exact pixel aspect ratio but did provide enough information to calculate the exact pixel aspect ratio based on industry practices: The standard luma sampling rate of precisely {{frac|13|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;MHz. Based on this information:
*The pixel aspect ratio for [[480i]] would be 10:11 as:
*: &lt;math&gt;12\tfrac{3}{11} \div 13\tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{10}{11}&lt;/math&gt;
*The pixel aspect ratio for [[576i]] would be 59:54 as:
*: &lt;math&gt;14\tfrac{3}{4}  \div 13\tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{59}{54}&lt;/math&gt;

SMPTE RP 187 further attempted to standardize the pixel aspect ratio values for [[480i]] and [[576i]]. It designated 177:160 for [[480i]] or 1035:1132 for [[576i]]. However, due to significant difference with practices in effect by industry and the computational load that they imposed upon the involved hardware, SMPTE RP 187 was simply ignored. SMPTE RP 187 information annex A.4 further suggested the use of 10:11 for [[480i]].

As of this writing, ITU-R BT.601-6, which is the latest edition of ITU-R BT.601, still implies that the pixel aspect ratios mentioned above are correct.

===Digital video processing {{anchor|pardigital}}===
As stated above, ITU-R BT.601 specified that standard-definition television pictures are made of lines of 720 non-square pixels, sampled with a precisely specified sampling rate. A simple mathematical calculation reveals that a 704 pixel width would be enough to contain a [[480i]] or [[576i]] standard 4:3 picture:

* A 4:3 480-line picture, digitized with the Rec. 601-recommended sampling rate, would be 704 non-square pixels wide.
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{480}\times \frac{10}{11} = \frac{4}{3}\Rightarrow x = \frac{480\times 11\times 4}{10\times 3} = 704&lt;/math&gt;
* A 4:3 576-line picture, digitized with the Rec. 601-recommended sampling rate, would be 702.915254 non-square pixels wide.
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{576}\times \frac{59}{54} = \frac{4}{3}\Rightarrow x = \frac{576\times 54\times 4}{59\times 3} \approx 702.915254&lt;/math&gt;

Unfortunately, not all standard TV pictures are exactly 4:3: As mentioned earlier, in analog video, the center of a picture is well-defined but the edges of the picture are not standardized. As a result, some analog devices (mostly PAL devices but also some NTSC devices) generated motion pictures that were horizontally (slightly) wider. This also proportionately applies to [[anamorphic widescreen]] (16:9) pictures. Therefore, to maintain a safe margin of error, ITU-R BT.601 required sampling 16 more non-square pixels per line (8 more at each edge) to ensure saving all video data near the margins.

This requirement, however, had implications for PAL motion pictures. PAL pixel aspect ratios for standard (4:3) and anamorphic wide screen (16:9), respectively 59:54 and 118:81, were awkward for digital image processing, especially for mixing PAL and NTSC video clips. Therefore, video editing products chose the almost equivalent values, respectively 12:11 and 16:11, which were more elegant and could create PAL digital images at exactly 704 pixels wide, as illustrated:
* For PAL 4:3:
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}\div \frac{704}{576} = \color{blue}{\frac{12}{11}}&lt;/math&gt;
* For PAL 16:9:
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{16}{9}\div \frac{704}{576} = \color{blue}{\frac{16}{11}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Inconsistency in defined pixel aspect ratio values==
Commonly found on the Internet and in various other published media are numerous sources that introduce different and highly incompatible values as the pixel aspect ratios of various video pictures and video systems. (See the [[#Supplementary sources|Supplementary sources]] section.)

To neutrally judge the accuracy and/or feasibility of these sources, please note that as the digital motion picture was invented years after the traditional motion picture, all video pictures targeted for standard definition television and compatible media, digital or otherwise, have (and must have) specifications compatible with standard definition television. Therefore, the pixel aspect ratio of digital video must be calculated from the specification of common traditional equipment rather than the specifications of digital video. Otherwise, any pixel aspect ratio that is calculated from a digital video source is only usable in certain cases for the same kind of video sources and cannot be considered/used as a general pixel aspect ratio of any standard definition television system.

In addition, unlike digital video that has well-defined picture edges, traditional video systems have never standardized a well-defined edge for the picture. Therefore, the pixel aspect ratio of common standard television systems cannot be calculated based on edges of pictures. Such a calculated aspect ratio value would not be entirely wrong, but also cannot be considered as the general pixel aspect ratio of any specific video system. The use of such values would be restricted only to certain cases.

==Modern standards and practices==
In modern digital imaging systems and [[high-definition television]]s, especially those that comply with SMPTE standards and practices, only square pixels are used for broadcast and display. However, some formats (ex., [[HDV]], [[DVCPRO HD]]) use non-square pixels internally for image storage, as a way to reduce the amount of data that must be processed, thus limiting the necessary transfer rates and maintaining compatibility with existing interfaces.

==Issues of non-square pixels==
Directly mapping an image with a certain pixel aspect ratio on a device whose pixel aspect ratio is different makes the image look unnaturally stretched or squashed in either the horizontal or vertical direction. For example, a circle generated for a computer display with square pixels looks like a vertical ellipse on a standard-definition NTSC television that uses vertically rectangular pixels. This issue is more evident on wide-screen TVs.

Pixel aspect ratio must be taken into consideration by video editing software products that edit video files with non-square pixels, especially when mixing video clips with different pixel aspect ratios. This would be the case when creating a video montage from various cameras employing different video standards (a relatively rare situation). Special effects software products must also take the pixel aspect ratio into consideration, since some special effects require calculation of the distances from a certain point so that they look visually correct. An example of such effects would be radial blur, motion blur, or even a simple image rotation.

==Use of pixel aspect ratio==
Pixel aspect ratio value is used mainly in digital video software, where motion pictures must be converted or reconditioned to use video systems other than the original. The [[Media player (application software)|video player]] software may use pixel aspect ratio to properly render digital video on screen. Video editing software uses pixel aspect ratio to properly [[Image scaling|scale]] and render a video into a new format.

The pixel aspect ratio support is also required to display, without distortion, legacy digital images from computer standards and video-games what existed in the 80s. In that generation, square pixels were too expensive to produce, so machines and video cards like the SNES, CGA, EGA, Hercules, C64, MSX, PC-88, X68000 etc had non-square pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Dot_clock_rates|title=Dot clock rates|publisher=pineight.com|date=|accessdate=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confusion with display aspect ratio==
{{main|Aspect ratio (image)}}
[[File:Screenshot of DVD Flick 1.3.0.7 build 738.png|thumb|300px|DVD Flick 1.3.0.7: Example of a computer program that has mislabeled ''picture aspect ratio'' as ''pixel aspect ratio'']]
Pixel aspect ratio is often confused with different types of image aspect ratios; the ratio of the image width and height. Due to non-squareness of pixels in Standard-definition TV, there are two types of such aspect ratios: ''storage aspect ratio'' (''SAR'') and ''[[display aspect ratio]]'' (abbreviated ''DAR'', also known as ''[[image aspect ratio]]'' and ''[[picture aspect ratio]]''). Note the reuse of the abbreviation ''PAR''. This article uses only the terms pixel aspect ratio and display aspect ratio to avoid ambiguity.

Storage aspect ratio is the ratio of the image width to height in pixels, and can be easily calculated from the video file. Display aspect ratio is the ratio of image width to height (in a unit of length such as centimeters or inches) when displayed on screen, and is calculated from the combination of pixel aspect ratio and storage aspect ratio.

However, users who know the definition of these concepts may get confused as well. Poorly crafted user-interfaces or poorly written documentations can easily cause such confusion: Some video-editing software applications often ask users to specify an "aspect ratio" for their video file, presenting him or her with the choices of "4:3" and "16:9". Sometimes, these choices may be "PAL 4:3", "NTSC 4:3", "PAL 16:9" and "NTSC 16:9". In such situations, the video editing program is implicitly asking for the pixel aspect ratio of the video file by asking for information about the video system from which the video file originated. The program then uses a table (similar to the one below) to determine the correct pixel aspect ratio value.

Generally speaking, to avoid confusion, it can be assumed that video editing products never ask for the storage aspect ratio as they can directly retrieve or calculate it. Non-square-pixel–aware applications also need only to ask for either pixel aspect ratio or display aspect ratio, from either of which they can calculate the other.

==Pixel aspect ratios of common video formats&lt;!-- For PAL you included both the MPEG-4 and MPEG-2 options, but for NTSC you gave only the MPEG-4 option. I would appreciate it if the MPEG-2 PAR values for NTSC (32:27 for 16:9 and 8:9 for 4:3 were included)  Thnx --&gt;==
Pixel aspect ratio values for common standard-definition video formats are listed below. Note that for PAL video formats, two different types of pixel aspect ratio values are listed:
#''[[#parrec601|Rec.601]]'', a Rec.601-compliant value, which is considered the real pixel aspect ratio of standard-definition video of that type.
#''[[#pardigital|Digital]]'', which is roughly equivalent to Rec.601 and is more suitable to use in Digital Video Editing software.

Note that sources differ on PARs for common formats – for example, 576 lines (PAL) displayed at 4:3 (DAR) corresponds to either PAR of 12:11 (if 704×576, SAR = 11:9), or a PAR of 16:15 (if 720×576, SAR = 5:4). See [[#References|references]] for sources giving both, and [[Standard-definition television#Resolution|SDTV: Resolution]] for a table of storage, display and pixel aspect ratios.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13295">{{short description|Legal doctrine that political questions are nonjusticiable}}
{{US fed civ pro}}
In [[United States|American]] [[Constitutional law]], the '''political question''' doctrine is closely linked to the concept of [[justiciability]], as it comes down to a question of whether or not the [[court system]] is an appropriate forum in which to hear the case.  This is because the court system only has authority to hear and decide a legal question, not a political question.  Legal questions are deemed to be justiciable, while political questions are nonjusticiable.&lt;ref name="HuhnWilson"&gt;Huhn, Wilson R.  ''American Constitutional Law Volume 1''. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar explained:

{{Quote|The political question doctrine holds that some questions, in their nature, are fundamentally political, and not legal, and if a question is fundamentally political ... then the court will refuse to hear that case. It will claim that it doesn't have jurisdiction. And it will leave that question to some other aspect of the political process to settle out.|John E. Finn, professor of government, 2006&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs&gt;{{cite news
 |author= John E. Finn
 |title= Civil Liberties and the Bill of Rights
 |work= The Teaching Company
 |quote= Part I: Lecture 4: The Court and Constitutional Interpretation (see page 55 in the guidebook)
 |year= 2016
 |accessdate= 2013-01-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A ruling of nonjusticiability will ultimately prohibit the issue that is bringing the case before the court from being able to be heard in a court of law.  In the typical case where there is a finding of nonjusticiability due to the political question doctrine, the issue presented before the court is usually so specific that the Constitution gives all power to one of the coordinate political branches, or at the opposite end of the spectrum, the issue presented is so vague that the [[United States Constitution]] does not even consider it.  A court can only decide issues based on law.  The Constitution dictates the different legal responsibilities of each respective branch of government.  If there is an issue where the court does not have the Constitution as a guide, there are no legal criteria to use.  When there are no specific constitutional duties involved, the issue is to be decided through the democratic process.  The court will not engage in political disputes.

A constitutional dispute that requires knowledge of a non-legal character or the use of techniques not suitable for a court or explicitly assigned by the Constitution to the [[U.S. Congress]], or the [[President of the United States]], is a political question, which judges customarily refuse to address.

==Origin==
{{or section|date=November 2018}}
The doctrine has its roots in the historic [[US Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803).&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury v. Madison'', 5 U.S. 137 (1803).&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, [[Chief Justice John Marshall]] drew a distinction between two different functions of the [[U.S. Secretary of State]]. Marshall stated that when the Secretary of State was performing a purely discretionary matter, such as advising the President on matters of policy, he was not held to any legally identifiable standards.  Therefore, some of the Secretary's actions are unable to be reviewed by a court of law.

The doctrine is grounded in the federal judiciary's desire to avoid inserting itself into conflicts between branches of the [[US federal government|federal government]].  It is justified by the notion that there exist some questions best resolved through the political process, voters approving or correcting the challenged action by voting for or against those involved in the decision.

==Leading authority==
The leading Supreme Court case in the area of political question doctrine is ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name="Baker v. Carr 1962"&gt;''Baker v. Carr'', 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the opinion written for Baker, the Court outlined six characteristics of a political question.  These include:
*A "textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or"
*A "lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or"
*The "impossibility for a court's independent resolution without expressing a lack of respect for a coordinate branch of the government; or"
*The "impossibility of deciding the issue without an initial policy decision, which is beyond the discretion of the court; or"
*An "unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or"
*The "potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question."

==Other applications==
While this is a still rather unsettled doctrine, its application has been settled in a few decided areas.  These areas are:

=== The Guarantee Clause ===
The [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Republican government|Guarantee Clause]], Article IV, section 4, requires the federal government to "guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government". The Supreme Court has declared that this Clause does not imply any set of "judicially manageable standards which a court could utilize independently in order to identify a State's lawful government".&lt;ref&gt;''Baker v. Carr'', 369 U.S. 186, 223 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impeachment ===
Article I, section 2 of the Constitution states that the House "shall have the sole power of Impeachment", and Article I, section 3 provides that the "Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments".&lt;ref&gt;United States Constitution, Article I, Section 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Constitution placed the sole power of impeachment in two political bodies, it is qualified as a political question. As a result, neither the decision of the House to impeach nor a vote of the Senate to remove a President or any other official can be appealed to any court. &lt;ref&gt;[[Nixon v. United States]], 506 U.S. 224 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy and war===
*A court will not usually decide if a treaty has been terminated, because on that issue, "governmental action ... must be regarded as of controlling importance".&lt;ref&gt;''Baker v. Carr'', 369 U.S. 186, 212. (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Given the sensitive problems of holding a war to be illegal, most issues relating to the constitutionality of a war may well be nonjusticiable, a notable example being the 1973 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Schlesinger v. Holtzman]]''.

=== Gerrymandering ===
* In the case of ''[[Davis v. Bandemer]]'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;''Davis v. Bandemer'', 478 U.S. 109 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that [[gerrymandering]] cases were justiciable under the [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The precedential power of this case is still unclear; to date, the Court still struggles to determine what the [[standard of review]] in gerrymandering cases should be.&lt;ref name="HuhnWilson" /&gt;
* ''[[Vieth v. Jubelirer]]'' (2004) held claims of partisan gerrymandering nonjusticiable because a discernible and manageable standard for adjudicating them had not been established or applied since ''Davis v. Bandemer''. However, [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] stated in his concurring opinion that judicially manageable standards for gerrymandering could be developed in future cases.&lt;ref&gt;''Vieth v. Jubelirer'', [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 541|541]] [[United States Reports|U.S.]] 267 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Gill v. Whitford]]'' and ''[[Benisek v. Lamone]] (2017)'' were decided without taking a final stance on partisan gerrymandering.&lt;ref&gt;Liptak, Adam (June 18, 2018). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/politics/supreme-court-wisconsin-maryland-gerrymander-vote.html Supreme Court Sidesteps Decision on Partisan Gerrymandering]". ''The New York Times''. Retrieved November 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Private military contractors ===
* In the case of ''Ghane v. Mid-South'' (January 16, 2014),&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.ms.gov/Images/Opinions/CO91632.pdf Narjess Ghane, et al v. Mid-South Institute of Self Defense Shooting; JFS, LLC; John Fred Shaw; Donald Ross Sanders, Jr.; and Jim Cowan (Miss.2014)]&lt;/ref&gt; the Mississippi Supreme Court held that a wrongful death action against a [[private military company]] by the family of a deceased [[United States Navy SEAL]] could proceed under Mississippi law since the plaintiff's claims did not present a non-justiciable political question under ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name="Baker v. Carr 1962"/&gt;

==Court cases==
Important cases discussing the political question doctrine:
*''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{Ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}, the origin of the phrase.
* ''[[Luther v. Borden]]'', {{ussc|48|1|1849}} – Guarantee of a republican form of government is a political question to be resolved by the President and the Congress;
* ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'', {{ussc|307|433|1939}} – Mode of amending federal Constitution is a political question;
* ''[[Colegrove v. Green]]'', {{ussc|328|549|1946}} – Apportionment of Congressional districts is a political question [Overruled by Baker v. Carr];
* ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'', {{ussc|369|186|1962}} – Apportionment of state legislatures in which the court ruled that this was not a political question;
* ''[[Powell v. McCormack]]'', {{ussc|395|486|1969}} – Congressional authority to exclude members who have met qualifications to serve is not a political question;
* ''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]'', {{ussc|444|996|1979}} – Presidential authority to terminate treaties is a political question;
* ''[[INS v. Chadha]]'', {{ussc|462|919|1983}} – Constitutionality of one house legislative veto is not a political question;
* ''[[Nixon v. United States]]'', {{ussc|506|224|1993}} – Senate authority to try impeachments and impeachment are political questions.

==Beyond the United States==
The political question doctrine has also had significance beyond American constitutional law. 

===International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights===

Before [[international courts]], the [[International Court of Justice]] has dealt with the doctrine in its advisory function, and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has engaged with the doctrine through the margin of appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odermatt |first1=Jed |title=Patterns of avoidance: political questions before international courts |journal=International Journal of Law in Context |date=2018 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=221-236 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-law-in-context/article/patterns-of-avoidance-political-questions-before-international-courts/301DCDCA0727B014EE7DB72515C7A5CB |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Court of Justice of the European Union===
Within [[European Union law]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] has never addressed the political question doctrine in its jurisprudence explicitly, yet it has been argued that there are traces of the doctrine present in its rulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butler |first1=Graham |title=In Search of the Political Question Doctrine in EU Law |journal=Legal Issues of Economic Integration |date=9 November 2018 |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=329-354 |url=http://www.kluwerlawonline.com/abstract.php?area=Journals&amp;id=LEIE2018020 |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postural Integration''' is a process-oriented [[Body psychotherapy|body-based therapy]] originally developed in the late 1960s by Jack Painter&lt;ref&gt;Ziehl, Silke: [http://icpit.org/jack-w-painter/ Recalling Jack Painter]&lt;/ref&gt; (1933–2010) in California, US, after exploration in the fields of [[humanistic psychology]] and the [[Human Potential Movement|human potential movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Erken, Rita and Schlage, Bernhard: Editors: ''Transformation of '''the Self''' with Bodymind Integration'' &lt;br&gt;Postural Integration – Energetic Integration – Psychotherapeutic Postural Integration; &lt;br&gt;Articles by 14 international authors; Hubert W. Holzinger Verlag, Berlin (2012)  {{ISBN|978-3-926396-67-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method aims to support [[Self-efficacy|personal change]] and [[Personal Development|self development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icpit.info/articles/J_Painter_PosturalIntegration 1985_.pdf Painter, Jack: ''Postural Integration, Transformation of the Whole Self'' (1985)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Jack: ''Deep Bodywork and Personal Development: Harmonizing Our Bodies, Emotions, and Thoughts;'' Bodymind Books, Mill Valley, Calif., {{ISBN|0938405012}} (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Painter, Jack: ''Technical Manual of Deep Wholistic Bodywork'', Postural Integration; published by &lt;br&gt;The International Centre for Release and Integration, Mill Valley, Calif. US (1984) (2nd edit. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
During his time as Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Miami]], Painter became interested in working with the body and personally explored many different approaches – [[massage]], [[acupuncture]], [[Zen]], [[yoga]], the work of [[Ida Rolf]] and her [[Rolfing]] method,&lt;ref name = Ben-Shahar&gt;Ben-Shahar, Asaf Rolef: ''Touching the Relational Edge; Body Psychotherapy'' A Roadmap to Body Psychotherapy modalities, &lt;br&gt; \PI defined: pp.43-44, Karnac Books Ltd., London (2014) {{ISBN|978-1-7822009-4-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gestalt therapy]] developed by [[Fritz Perls]], and the theories of [[Wilhelm Reich]] in the form of [[Vegetotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cascone, Raffaele in: Erken &amp; Schlage: Editors: ''Transformation of '''the Self''' ''; ''Biology, psychotherapy &amp; somatic ecology'' p.68. &lt;/ref&gt;

By the seventies he was calling his form of holistic [[bodymind]] bodywork 'Postural Integration'.&lt;ref&gt;Keleman, Stanley: ''Your Body speaks its Mind'', Center Press (US) (1989) {{ISBN|978-0934320016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erken, Rita and Schlage, Bernhard: Editors: ''Transformation of '''the Self''' with Bodymind Integration''&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighties and nineties Painter then went on to develop two further methods, Energetic Integration&lt;ref&gt;[http://icpit.org/energetic-integration/ Energetic Integration]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deborah Anapol#Pelvic-Heart Integration|Pelvic-Heart Integration]].

==In practise==
In the course of a twelve-session series&lt;ref name= "Knaster"/&gt; modeled loosely on [[Rolfing|Rolfing Structural Integration]], the Postural Integration process integrates [[Gestalt therapy]] with [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]],&lt;ref name = Ben-Shahar/&gt; as well as [[Breathwork|breath work]], [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|fine energy]] work and elements from the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Jack: ''Technical Manual of Deep Wholistic Bodywork'' (1984), 'Five Element Associations' pp.54-57 &lt;/ref&gt; The initial seven sessions address specific body areas and focus on releasing defensive armoring habits, characterized as "letting go of the old self".&lt;ref name= "Knaster"&gt;{{cite book |last= Knaster |first= Mirka |year= 1996 |title= Discovering the Body's Wisdom: A Comprehensive Guide to More Than Fifty Mind-Body Practices |publisher= [[Bantam Press|Bantam]] |pages= 205–6 |isbn= 9780307575500}}&lt;/ref&gt; During sessions, spontaneous [[emotional expression]] is encouraged. Additional tools include [[drama therapy]], attention to [[body language]]&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Shahar, Asaf Rolef: Ch.VII The Language of the Body pp.151-187&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Self-awareness#In psychology|self-awareness]].&lt;ref name = Ben-Shahar/&gt;

Since Postural Integration works simultaneously with the physical, mental and emotional aspects of the whole person, &lt;ref&gt;The Free Dictionary: ''Segen's Medical Dictionary'', ''Postural Integration'': [https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/postural+integration the technique works simultaneously with the physical, mental and emotional aspects of the whole person.] [http://www.farlex.com Farlex, Inc © 2012] &lt;/ref&gt; it contains elements of both psychotherapy and bodywork, some practitioners qualified in psychotherapy focus more on the therapy aspect while others use it primarily as a form of bodywork with psychotherapy-based awareness and insights.&lt;ref name = Ben-Shahar/&gt;

Postural Integration is taught and practised mainly in Europe, and also in US, Mexico &lt;ref&gt;Sevilla, Rosa María (Integración Postural): p.114 in Lachica, Fernando Ortiz: ''Psicoterapia corporal'' Bases teóricas de la práctica, Painter, Jack (Postural Integration) pp. 3, 17, 62, 92, 114, 115, 138, 169, Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, Mexico (2016), {{ISBN|978-607-9472-27-6}}. &lt;/ref&gt; and South Africa. 

Postural Integration trainings are organized by the International Council of PsychoCorporal (Bodymind) Integration Trainers (ICPIT).

In the 1990s Postural Integrational Psychotherapy (PIP) developed in Europe out of Postural Integration with the inclusion of [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]], and was acknowledged by the [[European Association for Body Psychotherapy]] as a method of [[Body psychotherapy]] provided the practitioner is also a qualified [[psychotherapist]].

'''''Pratītyasamutpāda''''' ({{lang-sa|प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद pratītyasamutpāda}}; {{lang-pi|पटिच्चसमुप्पाद}} ''paṭiccasamuppāda''), commonly translated as '''dependent origination''', or '''dependent arising''', is a key principle in Buddhist teachings,{{refn|group=note|The ''Pratītyasamutpāda'' doctrine, states Mathieu Boisvert, is a fundamental tenet of Buddhism and it may be considered as "the common denominator of all the Buddhist traditions throughout the world, whether Theravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mathieu Boisvert |title=The Five Aggregates: Understanding Theravada Psychology and Soteriology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUTRBtvSUaUC |year=1995|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |isbn=978-0-88920-257-3 |pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} which states that all ''dharmas'' ("phenomena") arise in dependence upon other ''dharmas'': "if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist".

The principle is expressed in the [[Twelve Nidānas|links of dependent origination]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]: ''dvādasanidānāni,'' Sanskrit: ''dvādaśanidānāni'') in [[Buddhism]], a linear list of twelve elements from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings which arise depending on the preceding link. Traditionally the list is interpreted as describing the conditional arising of rebirth in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]'', and the resultant ''[[Dukkha|duḥkha]]'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).{{sfn|Harvey|2015|p=50-59}} An alternate Theravada interpretation regards the list as describing the arising of mental formations and the resultant notion of "I" and "mine," which are the source of suffering.&lt;ref name="Payutto"/&gt;{{sfn|Jones|2009}} Traditionally, the reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the annihilation of mental formations and rebirth.{{sfn|Harvey|2015|p=50-59}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E. Buswell Jr. |author2=Donald S.

Scholars have noted inconsistencies in the list, and regard it to be a later synthesis of several older lists.{{sfn|Frauwallner|1973|p=167-168}}{{sfn|Schumann|1997}}{{sfn|Bucknell|1999}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009}}{{sfn|Shulman|2007}}{{sfn|Jones|2009}} The first four links may be a mockery of the Vedic-Brahmanic cosmogeny, as described in the ''[[Hymn of Creation]]'' of Veda X, 129 and the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]].{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009}}{{sfn|Jones|2009}}{{sfn|Wayman|1984|p=173 with note 16}}{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=256}}{{sfn|Wayman|1971}} These were integrated with a branched list which describe the conditioning of mental processes,{{sfn|Bucknell|1999}}{{sfn|Shulman|2007}}{{sfn|Jones|2009}} akin to the five skandhas.{{sfn|Boisvert|1995}} Eventually, this branched list developed into the standard twelvefold chain as a linear list.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}} While this list may be interpreted as describing the processes which give rise to rebirth, in essence it describes the arising of ''dukkha'' as a psychological process, without the involvement of an atman.{{sfn|Shulman|2007}}{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}}

==Etymology and meaning==

===Etymology===
''Pratityasamutpada'' (Sanskrit: प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद) consists of two terms:
* pratitya: "having depended";{{sfn|Hopkins|1983|p=163}} it appears in various [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishads]], such as hymns 4.5.14, 7.68.6 of the [[Rigveda]] and 19.49.8 of [[Atharvaveda]], in the sense of "confirmation, dependence, acknowledge origin".&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_७.६८ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं ७.६८], Rigveda 7.68.6, Wikisource; Quote: उत त्यद्वां जुरते अश्विना भूच्च्यवानाय '''प्रतीत्यं''' हविर्दे । अधि यद्वर्प इतऊति धत्थः ॥६॥&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mmwp623/&gt; The Sanskrit root of the word is ''prati*'' whose forms appear more extensively in the Vedic literature, and it means "to go towards, go back, come back, to approach" with the connotation of "observe, learn, convince oneself of the truth of anything, be certain of, believe, give credence, recognize". In other contexts, a related term ''pratiti*'' means "going towards, approaching, insight into anything".&lt;ref name=mmwp623&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=623}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* samutpada: "arising",{{sfn|Hopkins|1983|p=163}} "rise, production, origin"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=samutpada+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU spokensanskrit.de, ''samutpada'']&lt;/ref&gt; In Vedic literature, it means "spring up together, arise, come to pass, occur, effect, form, produce, originate".&lt;ref name=mmwp1078&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been translated into English variously as ''dependent origination'', ''dependent arising'', ''interdependent co-arising'', ''conditioned arising'', and ''conditioned genesis''.{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=29, Quote: "''Dependent origination'' has two meanings in Buddhist thought. The first refers to the twelvefold sequence of causation... The second meaning of ''dependent origination'' is a more general one, the notion that everything comes into existence in dependence on something else. It is this second meaning that [[Nagarjuna]] equates with emptiness and the middle way."}}{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}}{{refn|group=note|The term ''pratītyasamutpāda'' been translated into English as conditioned arising,{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}} conditioned genesis,{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations  791-809}} dependent arising,{{sfn|Garfield|1994}}{{refn|group=quote|The Dalai Lama explains: "In Sanskrit the word for dependent-arising is ''pratityasamutpada''. The word ''pratitya'' has three different meanings–meeting, relying, and depending–but all three, in terms of their basic import, mean dependence. ''Samutpada'' means arising. Hence, the meaning of ''pratityasamutpada'' is that which arises in dependence upon conditions, in reliance upon conditions, through the force of conditions."{{sfn|Dalai Lama|1992|p=35}}}} dependent co-arising,{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2008}} or dependent origination&lt;ref group=web name=brit1/&gt;}}

The term may also refer to the twelve nidānas, [[Pāli|Pali]]: ''dvādasanidānāni,'' Sanskrit: ''dvādaśanidānāni,'' from ''dvāvaśa'' ("twelve") + ''nidānāni'' (plural of "''nidāna''", "cause, motivation, link").{{refn|group=quote|The Nalanda Translation Committee states: "Pratitya-samutpada is the technical name for the Buddha’s teaching on cause and effect, in which he demonstrated how all situations arise through the coming together of various factors. In the hinayana, it refers in particular to the twelve nidānas, or links in the chain of samsaric becoming."&lt;ref group=web name=nalanda1&gt;Nalanda Translation Committee, [http://nalandatranslation.org/offerings/choosing-the-right-word/dependent-arising-tendrel/ Dependent Arising/Tendrel]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Generally speaking, in the Mahayana tradition, ''pratityasamutpada'' (Sanskrit) is used to refer to the general principle of interdependent causation, whereas in the Theravada tradition, ''paticcasamuppāda'' (Pali) is used to refer to the twelve nidānas.

===Meaning===

====Conditionality====
The ''Pratityasamutpada'' teachings asserts neither direct Newtonian-like causality nor a single causality. Rather, it asserts an indirect conditioned causality and a plural causality.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=153}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein |title=A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZQy2lu70bwC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3683-7 |pages=512–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "causal link" propositions in Buddhism is very different from the idea of causality that developed in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Debrock |editor=Paul B. Scheurer|others=G. Debrock|title=Newton’s Scientific and Philosophical Legacy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y18yBwAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-2809-1 |pages=376 with note 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=153-155}} Instead, the concept of causality in Buddhism is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate phenomena within and across lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in one of realms of existence for another lifetime.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Kalupahana|title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1|pages=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Genjun Sasaki |title=Linguistic Approach to Buddhist Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUBPAzlxJPUC |year=1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0038-0 |pages=67–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=151-152}} The ''Pratītyasamutpāda'' principle asserts that the dependent origination is necessary and sufficient condition in both directions. This is expressed in [[Majjhima Nikaya]] as "When this is, that is; This arising, that arises; When this is not, that is not; This ceasing, that ceases."{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}}&lt;ref name="Storhoff2010p74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Storhoff|title=American Buddhism as a Way of Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUCoZygxHRoC |year=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3095-9|pages=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontological principle====
According to Peter Harvey, ''Pratityasamutpada'' is an [[ontology|ontological]] principle; that is, a theory to explain the nature and relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. Buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent, except the state of nirvana.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}}{{refn|group=note|Harvey: "This [doctrine] states the principle of conditionality, that all things, mental and physical, arise and exist due to the presence of certain conditions, and cease once their conditions are removed: nothing (except ''Nibbana'') is independent. The doctrine thus complements the teaching that no permanent, independent self can be found."{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}}}} All physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre-existing states, and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease.{{sfn|Bowker|1997}} The 'dependent arisings' have a causal conditioning, and thus ''Pratityasamutpada'' is the Buddhist belief that causality is the basis of ontology, not a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self ([[Brahman]]) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=64, Quote: In the ''Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta'' the Buddha [stresses] that things originate in dependence upon causal conditioning, and this emphasis on causality describes the central feature of Buddhist ontology. All elements of samsara exist in some sense or another relative to their causes and conditions.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Neville |editor=Jeremiah Hackett|others=Jerald Wallulis|title= Philosophy of Religion for a New Century: Essays in Honor of Eugene Thomas Long|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEER8fGxCfMC |year=2004|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-2073-5 |pages=257 }}, Quote: "[Buddhism's ontological hypotheses] that nothing in reality has its own-being and that all phenomena reduce to the relativities of pratitya samutpada. The Buddhist ontological hypothesese deny that there is any ontologically ultimate object such a God, Brahman, the Dao, or any transcendent creative source or principle."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pratītyasamutpāda ontological principle in Buddhism is applied not only to explain the nature and existence of matter and empirically observed phenomenon, but also to the nature and existence of life.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=141}} In abstract form, according to Peter Harvey, "the doctrine states: 'That being, this comes to be; from the arising of that, this arises; that being absent, this is not; from the cessation of that, this ceases'."{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}} There is no 'first cause' from which all beings arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert S. Ellwood |author2=Gregory D. Alles |title=The Encyclopedia of World Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pGbdI4L0qsC |year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn= 978-1-4381-1038-7|pages=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Workings of the mind====
Against Harvey's ontological interpretation, Eviatar Shulman argues that 
{{quote|dependent-origination addresses the workings of the mind alone. Dependent-origination should be understood to be no more than an inquiry into the nature of the self (or better, the lack of a self). Viewing pratitya-samutpada as a description of the nature of reality in general means investing the words of the earlier teachings with meanings derived from later Buddhist discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, E; Early Meanings of Dependent-Origination, J Indian Philos (2008) 36:297–317 DOI 10.1007/s10781-007-9030-8,http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Meanings%20of%20Dependent%20Origination_Shulman_JIP_2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shulman grants that there are some ontological implications that may be gleaned from dependent origination, but that at its core it is concerned with "identifying the different processes of mental conditioning and describing their relations".&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, E; Early Meanings of Dependent-Origination, J Indian Philos (2008) 36:297–317 DOI 10.1007/s10781-007-9030-8,http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Meanings%20of%20Dependent%20Origination_Shulman_JIP_2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Noa Ronkin states that while Buddha suspends all views regarding certain metaphysical questions, he is not an anti-metaphysician: nothing in the texts suggests that metaphysical questions are completely meaningless, instead Buddha taught that sentient experience is dependently originated and that whatever is dependently originated is conditioned, impermanent, subject to change, and lacking independent selfhood.{{sfn|Ronkin|2009}}

====Epistemological principle====

According to Stephen Laumakis, pratītyasamutpāda is also an [[epistemology|epistemological]] principle; that is, a theory about how we gain correct and incorrect knowledge about being, becoming, existence and reality.&lt;ref name=laumakis2008p113&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen J.

We live under the illusion that terms such as 'I',  self, mountain, tree, etc. denote permanent and stable things. The doctrine teaches this is not so."&lt;ref name="Harvey2001p242"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZCvAwAAQBAJ|year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4411-4726-4|pages=242–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is nothing permanent ([[anicca]]), nothing substantial, no unique individual self in the nature of becoming and existence ([[anatta]]), because everything is a result of "dependent origination".&lt;ref name="Harvey2001p242"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Storhoff2010p74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billington2002p58"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray Billington |title=Understanding Eastern Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dACFAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-79348-8 |pages=58–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no independent objects and independent subjects, according to the Pratītyasamutpāda doctrine, there is fundamental emptiness in all phenomena and experiences.&lt;ref name=laumakis2008p113/&gt;

==Twelve Nidanas==
The twelve [[Nidana|nidāna]]s ([[Pāli|Pali]]: ''dvādasanidānāni,'' Sanskrit: ''dvādaśanidānāni'') is a linear list of twelve  elements from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings which are ''pratītyasamutpāda'', arising depending on the previous link. According to Shulman, "the 12 links ''are paticcasamuppada''"; in the suttas, dependent origination refers to nothing else but the process of mental conditioning as described by the twelve ''nidanas''.{{sfn|Shulman|2007|p=307}}

Traditionally the standard-list is interpreted as describing the conditional arising of rebirth in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]'', and the resultant ''[[Dukkha|duḥkha]]'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pallis&gt;{{cite book|author=Marco Pallis |title=A Buddhist Spectrum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7Laz6jbnIIC&amp;pg=PA180|year=2003|publisher=World Wisdom |isbn=978-0-941532-40-2 |pages=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emamnuelp60&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven M.

===Several series===
There are various Nidana lists throughout the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] and collections such as the [[Pali]] Nikayas, the most common of which is a list of [[Twelve Nidānas]] which appears in both Pali texts and [[Mahayana sutras]] such as the [[Salistamba Sutra]]. The 'dependent origination' doctrine is presented in Vinaya Pitaka 1.1–2, in abbreviated form in Samyutta Nikaya 2.1, 2.19 and 2.76.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James McDermott |editor=Wendy Doniger|title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C |year=1980|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03923-0 |pages=167 with note 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Williams | first=David M. | title=The Translation and Interpretation of the Twelve Terms in the Paticcasamuppada | journal=Numen | publisher= BRILL Academic | volume=21 | issue=1 | year=1974 | pages=35–63 |  doi=10.2307/3269713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dīgha Nikāya Sutta 1, the Brahmajala Sutta, verse 3.71 describes six Nidānas:
{{quote|[...] [T]hey experience these feelings by repeated contact through the six sense-bases; feeling conditions craving; craving conditions clinging; clinging conditions becoming; becoming conditions birth; birth conditions aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, sadness and distress.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe (1996), page 497.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walshe|first=Maurice|title=The Long Discourses of the Buddha: a Translation of the Dīgha Nikāya|year=1996|publisher=Wisdom Publications|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-86171-103-1|page=656|edition=3.

Dīgha Nikāya, Sutta 14 describes ten links, and in Sutta 15 nine links are described, but without the six sense{{nbhyph}}bases:&lt;ref&gt;Walshe 1996, page 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...they experience these feelings by repeated contact through the six sense-bases; feeling conditions craving; craving conditions clinging; clinging conditions becoming; becoming conditions birth; birth conditions aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, sadness and distress.}}

Descriptions of the full sequence of twelve links can be found elsewhere in the Pali canon, for instance in section 12 of the Samyutta Nikaya:&lt;ref name="SN12.2"&gt;Samyutta Nikaya 12.2, [https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html ''Paticca-samuppada-vibhanga Sutta: Analysis of Dependent Co-arising'']&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications ... From the cessation of birth, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering.}}

If it is again asked, 'Will the person be able to see things on the outside without the window (if he is confined to a room without the window or with the window closed)?' the answer will be, 'It is not possible to see things through the wall without the window. One can only see through the window.' Similarly, in the case of seeing, there are two separate realities of the eye and seeing. (So the eye does not have the ability to see without the eye-consciousness. The eye-consciousness itself cannot see anything without the organ.) The eye is not seeing, nor is seeing the eye, yet there cannot be an act of seeing without the eye. In reality, seeing comes into being depending on the eye. It is now evident that in the body there are only two distinct elements of materiality (eye) and mentality (eye-consciousness) at every moment of seeing.

|-
|[[Faith in Buddhism|Faith]] (''saddhā'')
|An attitude of trust directed at ultimate liberation and as refuge in the [[Refuge (Buddhism)|three jewels]]. The sutta states that "suffering is the supporting condition for faith", thereby linking it with the last nidana in the 12 nidana chain. As Bhikkhu Bodhi explains: "it is the experience of suffering which first tears us out of our blind absorption in the immediacy of temporal being and sets us in search of a way to its transcendence." Faith also comes about through the hearing of the exposition of true Dhamma (teaching). Faith also leads to the practice of [[Buddhist ethics|morality]] (sila).
|-
|Joy (''pāmojja'')
|From confidence in the sources of refuge and contemplation on them, a sense of joy arises
|-
|[[Pīti|Rapture]] (''pīti'')
|Generally, the application of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] is needed for the arising of rapture or bliss, though some rare individuals might experience rapture simply from the joy which arises from faith and a clear conscience arising from moral living. The meditative states called [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]] are states of elevated rapture.
|-
|[[Passaddhi|Tranquillity]] (''passaddhi'')
|In the higher states of meditation, rapture gives way to a calm sense of tranquility. 
|-
|[[Sukha|Happiness]] (''sukha'')
|A subtler state than rapture, a pleasant feeling. 
|-
|[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|Concentration]] (''samādhi'')
|"The wholesome unification of the mind", totally free from distractions and unsteadiness. 
|-
|''yathābhūta-ñānadassana''
|"Knowledge and vision of things as they really are". With a peaceful and concentrated mind, one is now able to practice the development of insight (''[[Vipassanā|vipassana]] bhavana),'' the first phase of which is insight into the nature of the [[Skandha|five aggregates]]''.'' Only ''pañña,'' the wisdom which penetrates the true nature of phenomena, can destroy the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] which keep beings bound to samsara. This wisdom is not mere conceptual understanding, but a kind of direct experience akin to visual perception which sees the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of all phenomena. In Northern Buddhist traditions and Mahayana works, insight into [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] is further emphasized. 
|-
|Disenchantment (''nibbidā'')
|Noticing the passing away of phenomena, the fact that nothing is stable, reliable or permanent, gives rise to a sense of disenchantment towards them. B. Bodhi: "a conscious act of detachment resulting from a profound noetic discovery. ''Nibbida'' signifies in short, the serene, dignified withdrawal from phenomena which supervenes when the illusion of their permanence, pleasure, and selfhood has been shattered by the light of correct knowledge and vision of things as they are."
|-
|Dispassion (''virāga'')
|The first truly transmundane (''lokuttara'') stage in the progression. B. Bodhi: "Whatever tends to provoke grasping and adherence is immediately abandoned, whatever tends to create new involvement is left behind. The old urges towards outer extension and accumulation give way to a new urge towards relinquishment as the one clearly perceived way to release."
|-
|[[Vimutti|Freedom]] (''vimutti'')
|Having a twofold aspect: the emancipation from ignorance ''(paññavimutti)'' and defilements ''(cetovimutti)'' experienced in life, the other is the emancipation from repeated existence attained when passing away. Equivalent with [[Nibbana]].
|-
|''āsava-khaye-ñāna''
|"Knowledge of destruction of the [[Asava|Asavas]]". This is a stage termed retrospective cognition or "reviewing knowledge" ''(paccavekkhana ñana),'' which reviews and confirms that all defilements have been abandoned. B. Bodhi: "The retrospective cognition of release involves two acts of ascertainment. The first, called the "knowledge of destruction" ''(khaya ñana),'' ascertains that all defilements have been abandoned at the root; the second, the "knowledge of non-arising" ''(anuppade ñana),'' ascertains that no defilement can ever arise again."  
|}

The Upanisa Sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya describes the reversed order, in which the causes for enlightenment are given. This application of the principle of dependent arising is referred to in Theravada exegetical literature as "transcendental dependent arising".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], "Transcendental Dependent Arising: A Translation and Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta." [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: "In addition to giving a clear, explicit account of the conditional structure of the liberative progression, this sutta has the further advantage of bringing the supramundane form of dependent arising into immediate connection with its familiar samsaric counterpart. By making this connection it brings into prominence the comprehensive character of the principle of conditionality — its ability to support and explain both the process of compulsive involvement which is the origin of suffering and the process of disengagement which leads to deliverance from suffering. Thereby it reveals dependent arising to be the key to the unity and coherence of the Buddha's teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi. Transcendental Dependent Arising. A Translation and Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The chain in this case is:
# suffering (''[[dukkha]]'')
# faith (''[[saddha|saddhā]]'')
# joy (''pāmojja'', ''pāmujja'')
# rapture (''[[pīti]]'')
# tranquillity (''[[passaddhi]]'')

# knowledge of destruction of the cankers (''{{IAST|āsava-khaye-ñāna}}'')}}

The nikayas themselves do not give a systematic explanation of the nidana series.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''In the Buddha's Words.'' Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 313.&lt;/ref&gt; As an expository device, the commentarial tradition presented the factors as a linear sequence spanning over three lives,&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi 2005, page 314"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''In the Buddha's Words.'' Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 314.&lt;/ref&gt; thus shifting the theme from a single conception (and birth) to a sequence of "incarnations" (roughly speaking). The twelve nidanas were interpreted by [[Buddhaghosa]] (c. fifth century CE) of the Sri Lankan [[Mahavihara]] tradition as encompassing three successive lives, as outlined in his influential [[Visuddhimagga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant Olson (Translator)|title=Buddhadhamma: Natural Laws and Values for Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffsumKIixS8C |year=1995|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2631-9|pages=112–115, 171–172 with footnote 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keownprebish269&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown |author2=Charles S.

====Arising of mental processes====
Yet, the twelve nidanas have also been interpreted within the Theravada tradition as explaining the arising of psychological or phenomenological processes in the present moment. There is scriptural support for this as an explanation in the [[Abhidharmakosa]] of [[Vasubandhu]], insofar as Vasubandu states that on occasion "the twelve parts are realized in one and the same moment".&lt;ref&gt;Abhidharmakosa, by Vasubandhu. Translated by Leo Pruden, Vol. II, pgs 404-405.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prayudh Payutto]] notes that in Buddhaghosa's Sammohavinodani, a commentary to the [[Vibhanga]] of the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]], the principle of Dependent Origination is explained as occurring entirely within the space of one mind moment.&lt;ref name=Payutto2&gt;Ven. Prayudh Payutto, Dependent Origination: the Buddhist Law of Conditionality, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books3/Payutto_Bhikkhu_Dependent_Origination.htm#C5&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Prayudh Payutto]] there is material in the [[Vibhanga]] which discusses both models, the three lifetimes model and the phenomenological mind moment model.&lt;ref name=Payutto2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (2003), [http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/JACBUD.html ''Buddhadasa. Theravada Buddhism and Modernist Reform in Thailand''], p.90-91&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis is also defended by Bhikkhu [[Buddhadasa]]'s ''Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination.'' In this interpretation, Birth and Death refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the "emergence of the ego". According to Buddhadhasa,
{{quote|...dependent arising is a phenomenon that lasts an instant; it is impermanent. Therefore, Birth and Death must be explained as phenomena within the process of dependent arising in everyday life of ordinary people. Right Mindfulness is lost during contacts of the Roots and surroundings. Thereafter, when vexation due to greed, anger, and ignorance is experienced, the ego has already been born. It is considered as one 'birth'".&lt;ref&gt;Buddhadhasa, Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Bhikkhu_Buddhadasa_Paticcasamuppada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sarvāstivāda===
According to Akira Hirakawa and Paul Groner, the three-lives model, with its "embryological" interpretation which links dependent origination with rebirth was also promoted by the [[Sarvastivadin]] school (a north Indian branch of the [[Sthavira nikāya]]) as evidenced by the [[Abhidharmakosa]] of [[Vasubandhu]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 4th to 5th century CE).&lt;ref name="Hirakawa page 178"&gt;Hirakawa; Groner, A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna, page 178&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abhidharmakosa]] also outlines three other models of the twelve nidanas, that were used by the Sarvastivada schools together with the three lifetimes model:&lt;ref name="Hirakawa page 178"/&gt;
#Instantaneous – All 12 links are present in the same instant.
#Prolonged – The interdependence and causal relationship of dharmas or phenomenal events arising at different times.
#Serial – The causal relationship of the twelve links arising and ceasing in continuous series of moments.

===Yogacara===
[[Asanga]] (4th century CE) groups the twelve nidanas into four groups: 1-3 cause of dharmas; 4-7 dharmas; 8-10 cause of suffering; 11-12 suffering.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=173}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
[[File:Traditional bhavachakra wall mural of Yama holding the wheel of life, Buddha pointing the way out.jpg|thumb|right|The twelve nidanas are typically shown on the outer rim of a [[Bhavachakra]] in Buddhist artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Brandon|title=History, Time, and Deity: A Historical and Comparative Study of the Conception of Time in Religious Thought and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sny7AAAAIAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ''[[bhavachakra]]'' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]; [[Pali language|Pāli]]: ''bhavachakra''; [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]]: ''srid pa'i 'khor lo'') is a symbolic representation of [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]] (or cyclic existence). It is found on the outside walls of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temples and monasteries in the Indo-Tibetan region, to help ordinary people understand Buddhist teachings. The Three Fires sit at the very center of the schemata in the [[Bhavacakra]] and drive the whole edifice. In Himalayan iconographic representations of the Bhavacakra such as within [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the Three Fires are known as the Three Poisons which are often represented as the [[Gankyil]]. The Gankyil is also often represented as the hub of the [[Dharmacakra]].

[[Tsongkhapa]], following [[Asanga]], explains how the twelve nidanas can be applied to one life of a single person, two lives of a single person, and three lives of a single person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman|title=Buddhist Insight: Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC|year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0675-7|pages=180–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Discussing the three lifetimes model, Alex Wayman states that the Theravada/Sarvāstivāda interpretation is different from the Vajrayana view, because the Vajrayana view places a ''bardo'' or an intermediate state between death and rebirth, which is denied by the Theravadins and Sarvastivadins. This denial necessitated placing the first two nidanas of the "dependent origination" chain into the past life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=186–187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan Buddhism tradition allocates the twelve nidanas differently between various lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=184–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the twelve nidanas==

===Synthesis of older versions===

====Combination of older lists====
According to Frauwallner, the twelvefold chain is a combination of two lists. Originally, the Buddha explained the appearance of ''dukkha'' from ''tanha'', "thirst," craving. This is explained and described in the second part, from ''tanha'' on fowards. Later on, under influence of concurring systems, the Buddha incorporated ''avijja'', "ignorance," as a cause of suffering into his system. This is described in the first part, which describes the entry of ''vijnana'' into the womb, where the embryo develops.{{sfn|Frauwallner|1973|p=167-168}} Frauwallner notes that "the purely mechanical mixing of both the two parts of the causal chainis remarkable and enigmatical." Noting that "contradictory thoughts stand directly near one another in the oldest Buddhistic ideas" many times, Frauwallner explains this as a "deficiency in systematization, the inability to mix different views and principles into a great unity."{{sfn|Frauwallner|1973|p=168}}

According to Schumann, the twelvefold chain is a later composition by monks, consisting of three shorter lists. These lists may have encompassed ''nidana'' 1-4, 5-8, and 8-12. The progress of this composition can be traced in various steps in the canon.{{sfn|Schumann|1997|p=92}}

Lambert Schmitthausen argues that the twelve-fold list is a synthesis from three previous lists, arguing that the three lifetimes-interpretation is an unintended consequence of this synthesis.{{sfn|Shulman|2008|p=305, note 19}}{{refn|group=note|Shulman refers to Schmitthausen (2000), ''Zur Zwolfgliedrigen Formel des Entstehens in Abhangigkeit'', in ''Horin: Vergleichende Studien zur Japanischen Kultur, 7''}}

Roderick S. Bucknell analysed four versions of the twelve nidanas, to explain the existence of various versions of the ''pratitya-samutpada'' sequence. The twevefold version is the "standard version," in which ''vijnana'' refers to sensual consciousness.{{refn|group=note|Bucknell: "''vinnana'': consciousness associated with eye, ear, nose tongue, body, and mind (''mano'')"{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=313}}}} According to Bucknell, the "standard version" of the twelve nidanas developed out of an ancestor version, which in turn was derived from two different versions, in which ''vijnana'' is differently explained.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999}} 

&lt;!-- *BRANCHED VERSION* --&gt;
{| class="wikitable floatleft mw-collapsible autocollapse" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="font-size:100%;"&gt;

|-

| style="text-align:center;" | etc.
|}
In the socalled "branched version", which is not strictly linear, but connects a couple of branches, ''vijnana'' is derived from the coming together of the sense organs and the sense objects, a description which can also be found in other sutras. The three of them constitute ''phassa'' ("contact"). From there on, the list is linear. In the Sutta-nipata version, which is altogether linear, ''vijnana'' is derived from ''avijja'' ("ignorance") and ''[[Saṅkhāra]]'' ("activities" (RSB); also translated as "volitional formations").{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=335}} 

&lt;!-- *LOOPED VERSION* --&gt;
{| class="wikitable floatleft mw-collapsible autocollapse" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="font-size:100%;"&gt;

|-
| style="text-align:center;" | etc.
|}
The ''Mahanidana-sutta'' describes a "looped version," which is also further linear, in which ''vijnana'' and ''nama-rupa'' condition each other. According to Bucknell, this "looped version" is derived from the "branched version."{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=315, 333}} According to Bucknell, "some accounts of the looped version state explicitly that the chain of causation goes no further back than the loop.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=316}} The Mahanidana further explains ''vijnana'' as "consciousness that descends into the mother's womb at the moment of conception."{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=317}} Waldron notes that ''vijnana'' here has two aspects, namely "samsaric ''vijnana''" and "cognitive consciousness." "Samsaric ''vijnana''" is "consciousness per se, the basic sentience necessary for all animate life," which descends into the womb at the time of conception. Cognitive consciousness is related to the senses and the sense objects. It is "samsaric ''vijnana''" which forms, in Buddhist thought, the connection between two lifes.{{sfn|Walfron|2004|p=20}} While these two aspects were largely undifferentiated in early Buddhist thought, these two aspects and their relation was explicated in later Buddhist thought, giving rise to the concept of ''[[alaya-vijñana]]''.{{sfn|Walfron|2004|p=20-21}}

While the "branched version" refers directly to the six sense objects, the "looped version" and the standard version  instead name it ''nama-rupa'', which eventually was misinterpreted as "name-and-form" in the traditional sense. This created "new causal series," which made it possible to interpret the beginning of the chain as referring to rebirth, just like the end of the chain. In line with this reinterpretation, ''vijnana'' "became the consciousness that descends into the mother's womb at conception, while ''nama-rupa'' became the mind-body complex that [...] experiences contact (''phassa'') and so on." {{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=339}}{{refn|group=note|Bucknell: "These observations by Watsuji, Yinshun, and Reat indicate that ''nama-rupa'', far from signifying "mind-and-body" or something similar, is a collective term for the six types of sense object."{{sfn|Bucknell|p=325}}}}

Bucknell further notes that the "branched version," in which ''nama-rupa'' refers to the six classes of sense-objects, corresponds with [[Buddhadasa]]s psychological interpretation of the twelve nidanas. The "looped version," in which ''vijanana'' corresponds with "rebirth consciousness," corresponds with defenders of the traditional interpretation, such as [[Nyanatiloka]].{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=327-328, note 46}} According to Bucknell, the linear list, with its distortions and changed meaning for ''nama-rupa'' and ''vinaya'', may have developed when the list came to be recited in reverse order.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=332}}

Alex Wayman has argued that the idea of "dependent origination" may precede the birth of the Buddha, noting that the first four causal links starting with Avidya in the Twelve Nidānas are found in the cosmic development theory of the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' and other older Vedic texts.{{sfn|Wayman|1984|p=173 with note 16}}{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=256}}{{sfn|Wayman|1971}} Jeffrey Hopkins notes that terms synonymous to ''Pratītyasamutpāda'' are ''Apekṣhasamutpāda'' and ''Prāpyasamutpāda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Hopkins|title=Meditation on Emptiness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rp8qAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148|year=2014|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-705-7|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kalupahana, the concept of causality and causal efficacy where "cause produces an effect because a property or ''svadha'' (energy) is inherent in something", appears extensively in the Indian thought in the Vedic literature of the 2nd millennium BCE, such as the 10th mandala of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the [[Brahmana]]s layer of the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p6"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

# ''sayam katam'' (''attakatam'', self causation): this theory posits that there is no external agent (God) necessary for a phenomenon, there is ''svadha'' (inner energy) in nature or beings that lead to creative evolution, the cause and the effect are in the essence of the evolute and inseparable (found in the Vedic and particularly [[Upanishad]]ic proto-Hindu schools); 
# ''param katam'' (external causation): posits that something external (God, fate, past karma or purely natural determinism) causes effects (found in materialistic schools like [[Charvaka]], as well as fate-driven schools such as [[Ajivika]]); 
# ''sayam-param katam'' (internal and external causation): combination of the first two theories of causation (found in some [[Jainism]], theistic proto-Hindu schools); 
# ''asayam-aparam katam'' (neither internal nor external causation): this theory denies direct determinism (''ahetu'') and posits fortuitous origination, asserting everything is a manifestation of a combination of chance (found in some proto-Hindu{{clarify|date=January 2018}} schools).

|} 
A similar resemblance has been noted by Jurewicz, who argues that the first four ''nidanas'' resemble the ''Hymn of Creation'' of RigVeda X, 129, in which ''avijja'' (ignorance) leads to ''kamma'' (''desire''), which is the seed of ''vijnana'' ("consciousness").{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135-136}}{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}} This consciousness is a "singular consciousness," (Jurewicz) "non-dual consciousness," (Gombrich) "reflexive, cognizing itself" (Gombrich).{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135}} When the created world, ''name and form'', evolves, pure consciousness manifests itself in the world. It mistakenly identifies itself with ''name and form'', losing sight of its real identity.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|=135-136}} The Buddha mimicked this creation story, making clear how the entanglement with the world "drive a human being into deeper and deeper ignorance about himself."{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}} According to Jurewicz, the Buddha may have picked the term ''nama-rupa'', because "the division of consciousness into name and form has only the negative value of an act which hinders cognition."{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}} 

According to Gombrich, the Buddhist tradition soon lost sight of this connection with the Vedic worldview. It was aware that at this point there is the appearance of an individual person, which the Buddha referred to as the five skandhas,{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135}} denying a self (''atman'') separate from these skandhas.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=255}} The Buddhist tradition equated ''rupa'' with the first ''skandha'', and ''nama'' with the other four. Yet, as Gombrich notes, ''samkhara'', ''vijnana'', and ''vedana'' also appear as separate links in the twelvefold list, so this eqaution can't be correct for this ''nidana''.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135-136}} According to Jurewizc, all twelve nidanas show similarities with the Vedic cosmogeny. They may have been invoked for educated listeners, to make the point that suffering arises in dependence on psychological processes without an atman, thereby rejecting the Vedic outlook.{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}}

According to Gombrich, following Frauwallner,{{refn|group=note|Frauwallner (1973), ''History of Indian Philosophy Vol. 1''}} the twelve-fold list is a combination of two previous lists, the second list beginning with ''tanha'', "thirst," the cause of suffering as described in the second Noble Truth".{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}} The first list consists of the first four ''nidanas'', which parody the Vedic-Brahmanic cosmogony, as described by Jurewicz.{{refn|group=note|Jurewicz (2000), ''Playing with fire: the pratityasamutpada from the perspective of Vedic thought''. Journal of the Pali Text Society, XXVI, 77-104.}} According to Gombrich, the two lists were combined, resulting in contradictions in it's negative version.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}}{{refn|group=note|Gombrich: "The six senses, and thence, via 'contact' and 'feeling', to thirst." It is quite plausible, however, that someone failed to notice that once the first four links became part of the chain, its negative version meant that in order to abolish ignorance one first had to abolish consciousness!"{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}}}} Gombrich further notes that
{{quote|Jurewicz's interpretation also makes it unnecessary to accept the complicated, indeed contorted, interpretation favoured by Buddhaghosa, that the chain covers three lives of the individual.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=142}}}}

According to Mathieu Boisvert, nidana 3-10 correlate with the five skandhas.{{sfn|Boisvert|1995|p=147-150}} Boisvert notes that ''sanna'', "perception," is not part of the twelvefold chain, but does play a role in the prevention of the arising of the ''samkharas''.{{sfn|Boisvert|1995}} Likewise, Waldron notes that the ''anusaya'', "underlying tendencies, are the link between the cognitive provcesses of ''phassa'' ("contact") and ''vedana'' (feeling), and the afflictive responses of ''tanha'' ("craving") and ''upadana'' ("grasping").{{sfn|Waldron|2004|p=34}}

According to Schumann, the Nidanas are a later synthesis of Buddhist teachings, meant to make them more comprehensible. Comparison with the five [[Skandha|skhandhas]] shows that the chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain is considered to be a later elaboration.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}} This way it is explainable that nama-rupa en consciousness in the 9-fold are the beginning or start, while in the 12-fold chain they are preceded by ignorance and formations. Those can only exist when nama-rupa en consciousness are present.
Schumann also proposes that the 12-fold is extended over three existences, and illustrate the succession of rebirths. While Buddhaghosa and Vasubandhu maintain a 2-8-2 schema, Schumann maintains a 3-6-3 scheme, putting the five skandhas aside the twelve nidanas.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}}

Altogether the various lists combine as follows:

===Sequence of stages prior to birth===
According to Eisel Mazard, the twelve Nidanas are a description of "a sequence of stages prior to birth," as an "orthodox defense against any doctrine of a 'supernal self' or soul of any kind [...] excluding an un-mentioned life-force (jīva) that followers could presumed to be additional to the birth of the body, the arising of consciousness, and the other aspects mentioned in the 12-links formula."&lt;ref name=Mazard /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Mazard: "[T]he 12-links formula is unambiguously an ancient tract that was originally written on the subject of the conception and development of the embryo, as a sequence of stages prior to birth; in examining the primary source text, this is as blatant today as it was over two thousand years ago, despite some very interesting misinterpretations that have arisen in the centuries in-between [...] In the Mahānidāna [sutta]’s brief gloss on the term nāmarūpa [...] we have a very explicit reminder that the subject-matter being described in this sequence of stages is the development of the embryo [...] it is indisputably clear that we are reading about something that may (or may not) enter into (okkamissatha) the mother’s womb (mātukucchismiŋ) [...] [T]he passage is wildly incongruent with attempts of many other interpreters to render the whole doctrine in more abstract terms (variously psychological or metaphysical).&lt;ref name=Mazard&gt;Eisel Mazard, [http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2011/01/27/unpopular-facts-about-one-of-buddhist-philosophys-most-popular-doctrines/ ''Unpopular facts about one of buddhist philosophys most popular doctrines'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Mazard, "many later sources have digressed from the basic theme and subject-matter of the original text, knowingly or unknowingly."&lt;ref name=Mazard/&gt;

==Karma==
The notion of karma is integrated into the list of twelve nidanas, and has been extensively commented on by ancient Buddhist scholars such as [[Nagarjuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray Billington |title=Understanding Eastern Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dACFAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-79348-8 |pages=57–58, 73–74 note 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma consists of any intentional action, whether of body or speech or in mind, which can be either advantageous (merit) or disadvantageous (demerit). Both good and bad karma sustain the cycle of samsara (rebirth) and associated dukkha, and both prevent the attainment of nirvana.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p124"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-97342-3|pages=124–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nagarjuna, the second causal link (''[[sankhara]]'', motivations) and the tenth causal link (''[[bhava]]'', gestation) are two karmas through which sentient beings trigger seven sufferings identified in the Twelve Nidanas, and from this arises the revolving rebirth cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman|title=Buddhist Insight: Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC|year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0675-7|pages=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be liberated from samsara and dukkha, asserts Buddhism, the 'dependent origination' doctrine implies that the karmic activity must cease.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p124"/&gt; One aspect of this 'causal link breaking' is to destroy the "deeply seated propensities, festering predilections" ([[asavas]]) which are karmic causal flow because these lead to rebirth.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p124"/&gt;

==Sunyata (emptiness)==

===Madhyamaka===
{{Main|Madhyamaka}}
In the [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy, to say that an object is "empty" is synonymous with saying that it is dependently originated. [[Nāgārjuna]] equates [[Sunyata|emptiness]] with dependent origination in [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] 24.18-19;{{sfn|Mabja Tsondru|2011|p=67-71, 447-477}} 
{{quote|Whatever arises dependently&lt;br/&gt;
Is explained as empty.&lt;br/&gt;
Thus dependent attribution&lt;br/&gt;
Is the middle way.

Since there is nothing whatever&lt;br/&gt;
That is not dependently existent,&lt;br/&gt;
For that reason there is nothing&lt;br/&gt;
Whatsoever that is not empty.{{sfn|Geshe Sonam Rinchen|2006|p=21}}}}

In his analysis, [[svabhāva]] is somewhat redefined from the [[Sarvastivada]]-[[Vaibhāṣika]] interpretation to mean: ''inherent existence'' or ''self-characterization.'' Nagarjuna notably rejected the idea of ''dharmas'' containing [[svabhāva]], meaning 'a self-sustaining, permanent, or unchanging identity.' If a ''dharma'' was inherently what-it-was from its own side, what need would there be for causes and conditions to bring that object into being? If any object was characterized by 'being-itself,' then it has no need to dependently rely on anything else. Further, such an identity or self-characterization would prevent the process of dependent origination. Inherence would prevent any kind of origination at all, for things would simply always have been, and things would always continue to be. Madhyamaka suggests that uncharacterized mere experiences—with no specific qualities—are designated by conceptual labels, and this brings them into being (See [[Prasaṅgika#N.C4.81g.C4.81rjuna.27s Merely Designated Causality|Prasaṅgika Merely Designated Causality]]). According to Nagarjuna, even the principle of causality itself is dependently originated, and hence it is empty. 

[[Madhyamaka]] is interpreted in different ways by different traditions. In the Tibetan [[Gelug]] school, all dharmas are said to lack any {{'}}''inherent''{{'}} existence, according to the Tibetan scholar [[Tsongkhapa]] in his Ocean of Reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaari.info/notes/03-06-06Tam2.pdf|title=Mula by Jay Garfield|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibetan Buddhism===
In the [[Dzogchen]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the concept of dependent origination is considered to be complementary to the concept of emptiness. Specifically, this tradition emphasizes the indivisibility of appearance and emptiness—also known as the relative and absolute aspects of reality:{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}
* Appearance (relative truth) refers to the concept that all appearances are dependently originated;
* Emptiness (absolute or ultimate truth) refers to the concept that the "nature" of all phenomena is emptiness—lacking inherent existence.

In [[Mipham Rinpoche]]'s ''Beacon of Certainty'', this relationship is explained using the metaphor of the reflection of the moon in water.{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}  According to this metaphor:{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}
* The ''nature'' of all phenomena is like the reflection of the moon in water—completely lacking inherent existence. However,
* The ''appearance'' of the moon in the water is an expression of dependent origination—the appearance is completely dependent upon causes and conditions.

One of the founders of Tibetan Buddhism, [[Padmasambhava]], emphasized his respect for this relationship as follows:
{{quote|Though my View is as spacious as the sky,&lt;br&gt; 
My actions and respect for cause and effect are as fine as grains of flour.{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=169}}}}

==Interdependence==

===Hua Yen school===
The [[Huayan school]] taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in [[Indra's net]]. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing. This philosophy is based in the tradition of the great Madhyamaka scholar [[Nagarjuna]] and, more specifically, on the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. Regarded by [[D.T. Suzuki]] as the crowning achievement of Buddhist philosophy, the ''Avatamsaka Sutra'' elaborates in great detail on the principal of dependent origination. This sutra describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms, mutually containing one another.

===Thich Nhat Hanh===
[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] states, "''Pratitya samutpada'' is sometimes called the teaching of cause and effect, but that can be misleading, because we usually think of cause and effect as separate entities, with cause always preceding effect, and one cause leading to one effect. According to the teaching of Interdependent Co-Arising, cause and effect co-arise (''samutpada'') and everything is a result of multiple causes and conditions... In the sutras, this image is given: "Three cut reeds can stand only by leaning on one another. If you take one away, the other two will fall." In Buddhist texts, one cause is never enough to bring about an effect. A cause must, at the same time, be an effect, and every effect must also be the cause of something else. This is the basis, states Hanh, for the idea that there is no first and only cause, something that does not itself need a cause.{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
[[Sogyal Rinpoche]] states all things, when seen and understood in their true relation, are not independent but interdependent with all other things. A tree, for example, cannot be isolated from anything else. It has no independent existence, states Rinpoche.{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|loc=Kindle Locations 849-863}}

==Comparison with western philosophy==
[[Jay L. Garfield]] states that [[Mulamadhyamikakarika]] uses the causal relation to understand the nature of reality, and of our relation to it. This attempt is similar to the use of causation by Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer as they present their arguments. Nagarjuna uses causation to present his arguments on how one individualizes objects, orders one's experience of the world, and understands agency in the world.{{sfn|Garfield|1994}}

The concept of ''pratītyasamutpāda'' has also been compared to Western [[metaphysics]], the study of reality. Schilbrack states that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by questioning whether there is anything at all.{{sfn|Schilbrack|2002}} Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.{{refn|group=quote|Hoffman states: "Suffice it to emphasize that the doctrine of dependent origination is not a metaphysical doctrine, in the sense that it does not affirm or deny some super-sensible entities or realities; rather, it is a proposition arrived at through an examination and analysis of the world of phenomena ..."{{sfn|Hoffman|1996|p=177}} }}

{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}

'''Redaction''' is a form of [[editing]] in which multiple source texts are combined (''redacted'') and altered slightly to make a single document. Often this is a method of collecting a series of writings on a similar theme and creating a definitive and coherent work.

The term is also used to describe removal of some document content, replacing it typically with black rectangles which indicate the removal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/declassification/iscap/redaction-codes.html |title=Redaction Codes |website=[[US National Archives]] |date=2012-09-26 |author= |accessdate= 13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this usage was not documented by authorities such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' {{As of|2016|lc=y}},&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|redaction}}&lt;/ref&gt; though earlier editions  gave only this definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1974|isbn=0 19 861107-2|location=|pages=1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, originally [[classified document]]s released under [[freedom of information]] legislation may have sensitive information redacted in this way. This usage is discussed in the article on an alternative name for this practice, [[sanitization (classified information)|sanitization]].

==Forms==
[[File:Documentary Hypothesis Sources Distribution English.png|thumb|Possible distribution of materials by source in the [[Old Testament]], including a redactor (black)&lt;!-- in the first four books of the Torah/Pentateuch, following Richard Friedman--&gt;.]]

On occasion, the persons performing the redaction (the redactors) add brief elements of their own. The reasons for doing so are varied and can include the addition of elements to adjust the underlying conclusions of the text to suit the redactor's opinion, adding bridging elements to integrate disparate stories, or the redactor may add a [[frame story]], such as the tale of [[Scheherazade]] which frames the collection of folk tales in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

Sometimes the [[source text]]s are interlaced, particularly when discussing closely related details, things, or people. This is common when source texts contain alternative versions of the same story, and slight alterations are often made in this circumstance, simply to make the texts appear to agree, and thus the resulting redacted text appears to be coherent. Such a situation is proposed by the [[documentary hypothesis]], which proposes that multiple redactions occurred during the creation of the [[Torah]], often combining texts, which have rival political attitudes and aims, together; another example is the [[Talmud]].

Redactional processes are documented in numerous disciplines, including ancient literary works and [[biblical studies]]. Much has been written on the role of redaction in creating meaning for texts in various formats.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the field of biblical studies, see John Barton, ''Anchor Bible Dictionary'', vol. 5: 644–647; or Odil Hannes Steck, ''Old Testament Exegesis'', 2nd edition (Atlanta: Scholars Press), 74–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some reported that his personality had undergone a change at some point during his employment at the facility.&lt;ref name="nytRich"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcWho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teleConn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Neil|title=Japan knife attack suspect said 'disabled people should be euthanised,' before killing 19|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/26/japan-knife-attacker-said-disabled-people-should-be-euthanised-b/|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letter and statements===
In February 2016, Uematsu attempted to hand-deliver a letter to [[Tadamori Oshima]], the [[List of Speakers of the House of Representatives of Japan|Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan]], at Oshima's home in Tokyo but was prevented from doing so by security. He returned the following day and this time left the letter with the security guards.&lt;ref name="nytRich"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rich|first1=Motoko|title=Japan Knife Attack Kills 19 at Center for Disabled|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/world/asia/knife-japan-stabbing-sagamihara.html|work=The New York Times|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uematsu's letter appealed for the legalization of ending the lives of those with multiple disabilities in cases where it was requested by their guardians, and asked for Oshima's assistance in delivering his message to [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Shinzo Abe]]. In it, he wrote, "I envision a world where a person with multiple disabilities can be [[involuntary euthanasia|euthanised]], with an agreement from the guardians, when it is difficult for the person to carry out household and social activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/japan-care-home-attack-satoshi-uematsu-horrifying-vision-disabled-people|title=Japan care home attack: picture emerges of modest man with horrifying vision|first=Justin|last=McCurry|date=26 July 2016|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that the killings of the disabled would be "for the sake of Japan and world peace" as well as to benefit the global economy and prevent [[World War III]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asahiAP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Letter by man accused of mass stabbings carried eerie warning|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201607260083.html|agency=Associated Press|work=Asahi Shimbun|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=26 July 2016}}{{dl|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After signing his name, the letter proceeded to detail an offer to target two facilities housing the disabled (possibly a reference to the two residential buildings in which he later committed the crime), and went on to appeal for certain conditions in exchange for committing the act. In the first half of the message, Uematsu said he could kill 460 people; however, in the second half, the number he gave was 260. He added that staff would be tied up to keep them from interfering but that they would not be harmed, the act would be swift, and that afterwards he would turn himself in. At the end of the latter half of the letter, he signed his name again, this time with his address, telephone number, and the name of his employer.&lt;ref name="asahiAP"/&gt;

At some point, the letter was handed over to Tokyo police, who contacted the police in Sagamihara. During this time frame, Uematsu posted to his [[Twitter]] account that he expected he might be arrested.&lt;ref name="bbcWho"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36891375 | title=Japan knife attack: Who is suspect Satoshi Uematsu? | publisher=BBC | date=26 July 2016 | accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously posted tweets about Japan being ravaged by [[radiation poisoning]] and [[AIDS in Japan|AIDS]].&lt;ref name="rtLiesHa"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Elaine|last1=Lies|first2=Kwiyeon|last2=Ha|title=Shock as peaceful Japanese town wakes to 'unthinkable' disabled center horror|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-attack-scene-idUSKCN1060I9|agency=Reuters|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, after his letter was brought to the attention of Sagamihara's authorities, he was arrested, detained, questioned, and then involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital for two weeks.&lt;ref name="remorseJT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect in Sagamihara care facility mass murder says he has ‘no remorse’|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/27/national/crime-legal/suspect-sagamihara-care-facility-mass-murder-says-no-remorse/#.V5iSHKLKvEt|publisher=The Japan Times|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was released on 2 March after doctors deemed that he was not a threat.&lt;ref name="Guardian.Attack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sydmorn"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tokyo knifeman kills nearly two dozen|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/tokyo-knifeman-kills-more-than-a-dozen-reports-20160725-gqdm48.html|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|agency=Associated Press|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160726/p2a/00m/0na/005000c |title=Neighbors describe alleged stabber at facility for disabled as 'cheerful' |language=ja |publisher=The Mainichi |date=26 July 2016 |accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0003105111 |title=Sagamihara knife attack / Neighbors, families express fear, shock |publisher=The Japan News |date=26 July 2016 |accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pascaline|first1=Mary|title=Japan Knife Attack: Several Dead, Scores Injured At Care Center In West Tokyo|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/japan-knife-attack-several-dead-scores-injured-care-center-west-tokyo-2394791|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=International Business Times|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letter and in statements made after turning himself in, Uematsu explained that he was "saving from unhappiness" both the severely disabled and those who he believed were burdened with maintaining their lives.&lt;ref name="asahiAP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="remorseJT"/&gt;

===Legal proceedings===
On 20 February 2017, Uematsu was found mentally competent to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/02/21/national/crime-legal/accused-killer-19-sagamihara-facility-deemed-fit-stand-trial-sources/|title=Accused killer of 19 at Sagamihara facility deemed fit to stand trial: sources|date=21 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2018|via=Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February, Uematsu was charged with 19 counts of murder, 24 counts of attempted murder, two counts of illegal confinement causing injury, three counts of illegal confinement, one count of unlawful entry, and one count of violating the swords and firearms control law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201702240075.html|title=Suspect deemed fit to stand trial, indicted on 19 murder charges：The Asahi Shimbun|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Yoshihide Suga]], the Japanese [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]], acknowledged that the attack was "a very heart-wrenching and shocking incident in which many innocent people became victims".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters.Feared/&gt; He also said that the [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare]] would investigate ways to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

A number of Japanese news outlets ran [[editorial]]s calling the stabbings a [[disability hate crime|hate crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/articles/-/49918 | title=社説[障がい者施設殺傷]兆候は幾つも出ていた | work=Okinawa Times | date=27 July 2016 | accessdate=2 August 2016}} {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://mainichi.jp/articles/20160727/ddm/010/040/038000c | title=相模原の障害者施設殺傷 - 識者の見方 | work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]] | date=27 July 2016 | accessdate=2 August 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sankei.com/affairs/news/160802/afr1608020004-n1.html | title=【相模原１９人刺殺】 憎悪と計画性、浮かぶ異様さ | work=[[Sankei Shimbun]] | date=2 August 2016 | accessdate=2 August 2016}} {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://mainichi.jp/articles/20160802/org/00m/040/005000c | title=Ｌｉｓｔｅｎｉｎｇ ＜記者の目＞相模原殺傷事件＝須藤孝（政治部） | work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]] | date=2 August 2016 | accessdate=2 August 2016}} {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2016, little information had been released about the victims of the attack.

'''Selfism''' refers to any philosophy, theory,  doctrine, or tendency that upholds explicitly [[selfish]] principles as being desirable. It is usually used [[pejoratively]].

==Definition==
The term "selfism" was used by [[Paul Vitz]] in his 1977 book ''Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-Worship''. Vitz deconstructs the selfist movement(s) and tries to uphold [[God]]-centered [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]], and claims that all of modern-day [[liberalism]] and [[leftism]] are essentially selfist at their core. He lays the blame predominantly at the feet of [[Erik Erikson]], [[Erich Fromm]], and other prominent psychologists of the third quarter of the 20th century (c. 1950–1975 CE).

Explicit selfishness as a desirable end and moral good had diverse manifestations during that period, for example, in the writings of [[David Seabury]], [[Ayn Rand]], and even among some of Rand's near-opposites, such as Erikson and Fromm. Rand called her philosophy [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Later popularizers of similar positions include [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Paul Lepanto]], [[Robert Ringer]], [[Harry Browne]], and [[David Kelley]], among others. None of these named the system they espoused "selfism" or characterized it as "selfist", although both Seabury and Rand included the word "selfishness" in the titles of books presenting their views. Many of these figures were pro-[[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Secularism|secularists]] ("[[Atheism|atheist]] capitalists"), but Seabury was a [[Christian]], while Erickson and Fromm were prominent [[Leftism|leftists]].

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]] and author of [[The Satanic Bible]], acknowledges [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] as a source of inspiration for [[LaVeyan Satanism]]. This form of Satanism holds the [[self]] above all else in similar fashion to Objectivism. Despite some similarities, they remain separate entities, as there are clear differences between the two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origins of selfist thought==
Some early examples of "selfist" thinking are the [[Ethical egoism|egoistic]] philosophies of [[Yangism]] in [[ancient China]] and of [[Cyrenaic]] [[hedonism]] in [[ancient Greece]].  Yangists followed the teachings of [[Yang Zhu]] and might have been influenced by [[Taoism]].  [[Cyrenaics]], founded by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]], were [[Religious skepticism|skeptics]] and [[Materialism|materialists]] (but perhaps nominally Greek [[Paganism|pagans]]). [[Thomas Hobbes]], who could also be viewed as ''selfist'', was a [[Materialism|materialist]] but also advocated loyalty to a strong government and [[state church]]. [[Joseph Butler]], whose philosophy is unmistakably selfist, was generally regarded as an [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|orthodox Christian]] and was canonized an [[Anglican]] [[saint]]. The views of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Max Stirner]] provide a more proximate link to the modern selfists.

'''Southern [[hospitality]]''' is a phrase used in [[American English]] to describe the [[stereotype]] of residents of the [[Southern United States]] as particularly warm, sweet, and welcoming to visitors to their homes, or to the South in general. The term has engendered some controversy due to the connection of related practices to the culture of [[slavery]], and its continued use during periods of both overt and covert [[racism]], and other forms of [[prejudice]].

==Origins==
Southern hospitality "first existed as a narrowly defined body of social practices among the antebellum planters classes".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Szczesiul, "Re-mapping southern hospitality: discourse, ethics, politics", ''European Journal of American Culture'' (2007), Issue 26, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the origin of the practice was intimately tied to [[slavery in the United States|slavery]].  One analysis notes:

{{quote|African Americans had little place in this initial conceptualization of hospitality beyond the role of servant. Yet, it was the labor and hardships of the enslaved that allowed southern planters to entertain their guests so lavishly and seemingly so effortlessly. Southern hospitality from and for whites was in large part achieved by being inhospitable and inhumane to African Americans.&lt;ref name="Alderman"&gt;Derek H. Alderman and E. Arnold Modlin Jr., "[https://www.academia.edu/2252782/Southern_Hospitality_and_the_Politics_of_African_American_Belonging_An_Analysis_of_Photographs_in_North_Carolina_Tourism_Brochures Southern hospitality and the politics of African American belonging: an analysis of North Carolina tourism brochure photographs]", ''Journal of Cultural Geography'' (December, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Over time, however, the concept "developed into a discourse that stretches far beyond the image of the [[planter class]]", and the principles of Southern hospitality were eventually adopted by African Americans in the South, and incorporated into materials used to advertise destinations in the South to African American tourists.&lt;ref name="Alderman"/&gt; The concept of Southern hospitality has also been examined as a reflection of the deeply held religious beliefs of the region; the idea that one should be good to strangers is an outgrowth of such [[Parables of Jesus|Biblical parable]]s as the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Szczesiul, ''The Southern Hospitality Myth: Ethics, Politics, Race, and American Memory'' (2017), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[travel writer]] Ernest Hamlin Abbott wrote in 1902, "as religious observances are in the South as naturally included in the hospitality of the home as anything else, so, conversely, hospitality in the South is an integral part of the church services".&lt;ref name="Abbott1902"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Ernest Hamlin |title=Religious Life in America: A Record of Personal Observation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUcaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR111 |date=1902 |publisher=Outlook Company |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Some characteristics of Southern hospitality were described as early as 1835, when [[Jacob Abbott]] attributed the poor quality of taverns in the South to the lack of need for them, given the willingness of Southerners to provide for strangers.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"/&gt; Abbott writes:

{{quote|[T]he hospitality of southerners is so profuse, that taverns are but poorly supported. A traveler, with the garb and the manners of a gentleman, finds a welcome at every door. A stranger is riding on horseback through Virginia or Carolina. It is noon. He sees a plantation, surrounded with trees, a little distance from the road. Without hesitation he rides to the door. The gentleman of the house sees his approach and is ready upon the steps.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Jacob |title=New England and her Institutions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7ETAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR223 |publisher=John Allen |date=1835 |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abbott further describes how the best stores of the house are at the disposal of visitors.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"/&gt; Furthermore, says Abbott:

{{quote|Conversation flows cheeringly, for the southern gentleman has a particular tact in making a guest happy. After dinner you are urged to pass the afternoon and night, and if you are a gentleman in manners and information, your host will be in reality highly gratified by your so doing.&lt;br /&gt;Such is the character of southern hospitality.&lt;ref name="Abbott1835"/&gt;}}

Food figures highly in Southern hospitality, a large component of the idea being the provision of [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern cuisine]] to visitors. A cake or other delicacy is often brought to the door of a new neighbor as a mechanism of introduction. Many club and church functions include a meal or at least a [[dessert]] and beverage. Churches in the South frequently have large commercial style kitchens to accommodate this tradition, but many "fellowship suppers" are "covered dish": everyone attending brings a dish. However, if a newcomer arrives without a dish, he or she will be made to feel welcome and served generously. When a death or serious illness occurs, neighbors, friends, and church members generally bring food to the bereaved family for a period of time. A number of [[cookbooks]] promise [[recipe]]s advancing this concept.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Winifred Green Cheney, ''The Southern Hospitality Cookbook'' (1976) {{ISBN|0-8487-0417-7}}; Sara Pitzer, ''Enjoying the Art of Southern Hospitality: Menus, Recipes, and Suggestions for Entertaining Simply and Graciously'' (1990) {{ISBN|0-87483-121-0}}; Lisette Verlander, Susan Murphy, ''The Cookin' Cajun Cooking School Cookbook'' (1997) {{ISBN|0-87905-784-X}} (stating "I learned to love the tastes and smells of good food, and that true Southern hospitality begins in the kitchen, the soul of a home"); James Villas, ''The Glory of Southern Cooking'' (2007) {{ISBN|0-7645-7601-1}} (discussing "the sacred tradition of preparing and serving lots of good food and drink to large numbers of family, friends, and even strangers — better known as Southern hospitality").&lt;/ref&gt;

It commissioned a radio in 1968, published the newspaper ''Ropet fra Øst'' in 1971, and helped establish [[Forum 18]] news service in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/om_oss/kort_historikk/|title=Kort historikk|last=|first=|date=|website=Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NGO is a partner in the international [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]] network since 2001.

''Stefanus Alliance International'' awards the [[Stefanus Prize]], a prestigious human rights prize to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the work for freedom of religion or belief as defined by the Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Despite having historical roots as a Christian missions organization, ''Stefanus Alliance International'' in awarding the [[Stefanus Prize]] has recognized the efforts of individuals across different faiths.

[[File:Former Kreditbanken Norrmalmstorg Stockholm Sweden.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The location where the 1973 [[Norrmalmstorg robbery]] took place in [[Stockholm]], Sweden (photographed in 2005)]]
'''Stockholm syndrome''' is a condition that causes [[kidnapping|hostages]] to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jameson|first=Celia | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010|title=The Short Step From Love to Hypnosis: A Reconsideration of the Stockholm Syndrome|url=|journal=Journal for Cultural Research|volume=14.4|pages=337–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alliances, resulting from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time spent together, are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. &lt;!--Generally speaking, Stockholm syndrome consists of "strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other."&lt;ref name = "McKenzie_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last = McKenzie | first = Ian K. | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Stockholm Syndrome Revisited | journal = Journal of Police Crisis Negotiations | date = 23 February 2004 | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–21 | doi = 10.1300/J173v04n01_02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI's]] Hostage Barricade Database System and [[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin|Law Enforcement Bulletin]] shows that roughly 8% of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.&lt;ref name="Sundaram_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sundaram | first = Chandar S. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2013 | title = Stockholm Syndrome | journal = Salem Press Encyclopedia | via = Research Starters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI-1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fuselier | first = G.

This term was first used by foreign media in 1973 as [[Eponym|eponym]] when four hostages were taken during [[Norrmalmstorg robbery|a bank robbery]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The hostages defended their captors after being released and would not agree to testify in court against them.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adorjan | first1 = Michael | first2 = Tony | last2 = Christensen | first3 = Benjamin | last3 = Kelly | first4 = Dorothy | last4 = Pawluch | name-list-format = vanc | title = Stockholm Syndrome As Vernacular Resource | journal = The Sociological Quarterly | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | year = 2012 | pages = 454–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stockholm syndrome is ostensibly paradoxical because the sympathetic sentiments captives feel towards their captors are the opposite of the fear and disdain an onlooker may feel towards the captors.

There are four key components that generally lead to the development of Stockholm syndrome: 
* A hostage's development of positive feelings towards their captor
* No previous hostage-captor relationship
* A refusal by hostages to co-operate with police forces and other government authorities
* A hostage's belief in the humanity of their captor, for the reason that when a victim holds the same values as the aggressor, they cease to be perceived as a threat.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="McKenzie_2004" /&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sundaram_2013" /&gt;

Stockholm syndrome is considered a "contested illness", due to many law enforcement officers' doubt about the legitimacy of the condition.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; Stockholm syndrome has also come to describe the reactions of some abuse victims beyond the context of kidnappings or hostage-taking. Actions and attitudes similar to those suffering from Stockholm syndrome have also been found in victims of [[sexual abuse]], [[human trafficking]], discrimination, terror, and political and religious oppression.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012" /&gt;

==History==
=== Stockholm bank robbery ===
{{Main|Norrmalmstorg robbery}}
In 1973, [[Jan-Erik Olsson]], a convict on parole, took four employees of the bank (three women and one man) hostage during a failed bank robbery in [[Kreditbanken]], one of the largest banks in Stockholm, Sweden. He negotiated the release from prison of his friend [[Clark Olofsson]] to assist him. They held the hostages captive for six days (23–28 August) in one of the bank’s vaults. When they were released, none of them would testify against either captor in court; instead they began raising money for their defense.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; 

[[Nils Bejerot]], a Swedish [[criminologist]] and [[psychiatrist]] coined the term after [[Swedish Police|Stockholm police]] asked him for assistance with analyzing the victims' reactions to the 1973 bank robbery and their status as hostages. As the idea of [[brainwashing]] was not a new concept, Bejerot, speaking on "a news cast after the captives' release" instinctively reduced the hostages' reactions to a result of being brainwashed by their captors.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012" /&gt; He called it ''Norrmalmstorgssyndromet'', meaning "The Norrmalmstorg Syndrome"; it later became known outside of Sweden as the Stockholm syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nilsbejerot.se/sexdagar_eng.htm |vauthors=Bejerot N |title=The six day war in Stockholm |journal=New Scientist |date=1974 |volume=61 |issue=886 |pages=486–487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally defined by psychiatrist [[Frank Ochberg]] to aid the management of hostage situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |vauthors=Ochberg F |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/08/opinion/oe-ochberg8 |title=The Ties That Bind Captive to Captor |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=8 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olsson later said in an interview:&lt;blockquote&gt;It was the hostages' fault. They did everything I told them to. If they hadn't, I might not be here now. Why didn't any of them attack me? They made it hard to kill. They made us go on living together day after day, like goats, in that filth. There was nothing to do but get to know each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22447726|title=What is Stockholm syndrome?|last=Westcott|first=Kathryn | name-list-format = vanc |date=22 August 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Other famous examples ===

==== Mary McElroy ====
[[Mary McElroy (kidnapping victim)|Mary McElroy]] was abducted from her home at age 25 by four men who held a gun to her, demanded her compliance, took her to an abandoned farmhouse, and chained her to a wall. She defended her kidnappers when she was released, explaining that they were only businessmen. She then continued to visit her captors while they were in jail. She eventually committed suicide and left the following note: “My four kidnappers are probably the only people on Earth who don't consider me an utter fool. You have your death penalty now – so, please, give them a chance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mara | last = Bovsun | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/lady-kidnappers-article-1.396520 | title = Justice Story: The lady and her kidnappers | work = NY Daily News | access-date = 2018-04-08 | date = 11 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natascha Kampusch ====
[[Natascha Kampusch]] was kidnapped at age ten and kept in an insulated, dark room under the garage of Wolfgang Priklopil. She would receive a variation of kind, physically and sexually abusive, controlling, and permissive treatment from her captor. Eight years after her kidnapping, Natascha left and Priklopil committed suicide. After her kidnapper's death, Natascha lamented and kept a picture of him in her wallet.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Kampusch now owns the house in which she was imprisoned, saying, "I know it's grotesque – I must now pay for electricity, water and taxes on a house I never wanted to live in". It was reported that she claimed the house from Přiklopil's estate because she wanted to protect it from vandals and being torn down; she also noted that she has visited it since her escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1316125,00.html|title=Kidnap Victim Owns Her House of Horrors|publisher=Sky News|date=15 May 2008|accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the third anniversary of her escape approached, it was revealed she had become a regular visitor at the property and was cleaning it out possibly to move in herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |title=Kampusch to auction off horror house items – Panorama – Austrian Times |website= |accessdate=15 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/688Ynv8tb?url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |archivedate=3 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Kampusch said she had retained the house because it was such a big part of her formative years, also stating that she would fill in the cellar if it is ever sold, adamant that it will never become a macabre museum to her lost adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1245899/Natascha-Kampusch-If-I-sell-house-I-held-captive-half-years-I-make-sure-cellar-filled-in.html Natascha Kampusch: He put me inside the cellar for eight-and-a-half years, preserved alive like an Egyptian pharaoh], ''Daily Mail''. Retrieved 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The cellar was indeed filled in, though Kampusch still owns the house.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAxRCnoa9Aw Abductee Natascha Kampusch speaks out about her 8 years in captivity], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Patty Hearst ====
[[Patty Hearst]], the granddaughter of publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]], was taken and held hostage by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]], "an urban guerilla group", in 1974. She was recorded denouncing her family as well as the police under her new name, "Tania", and was later seen working with the SLA to rob banks in San Francisco. She publicly asserted her sympathetic feelings towards the SLA and their pursuits as well. After her 1975 arrest, pleading Stockholm syndrome did not work as a proper defense in court, much to the chagrin of her defense lawyer, [[F. Lee Bailey]]. Her seven-year prison sentence was later commuted, and she was eventually presidentially pardoned by [[Bill Clinton]], who was informed that she was not acting under her own free will.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt;

==== Colleen Stan ====
In 1977, [[Kidnapping of Colleen Stan|Colleen Stan]] was hitchhiking to visit a friend in southern California when she was kidnapped by Cameron Hooker and his wife Janice and forced to live in a wooden restraining box underneath their bed. For seven years she was repeatedly raped and tortured by Cameron and forced to live life as a sort of domestic/sex slave. Even though she was allowed to socialize with Janice and even visit her mother, she still continued to live in the box and did not attempt to escape. She was eventually freed by Janice, who asked Stan to not disclose her abuse as Janice was attempting to reform Cameron. Stan remained silent until Janice finally decided to turn Cameron over to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mara | last = Bovsun | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/girl-box-article-1.1715494 | title=Hitchhiker kept as sex slave for seven years as 'Girl in the Box' | work = NY Daily News | access-date = 2018-04-08 | date = 9 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual abuse victims ===
There is evidence that some victims of ''childhood sexual abuse'' come to feel a connection with their abuser. They often feel flattered by the adult attention or are afraid that disclosure will create family disruption. In adulthood, they resist disclosure for emotional and personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jülich | first = Shirley | name-list-format = vanc | title = Stockholm Syndrome and Child Sexual Abuse | journal = Journal of Child Sexual Abuse | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 107–129 | date = 2005 | doi = 10.1300/J070v14n03_06 | pmid = 16203697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lima syndrome===
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
A similar form of Stockholm syndrome called ''Lima syndrome'' has been proposed, in which abductors develop sympathy for their hostages. An abductor may also have second thoughts or experience empathy towards their victims.

Lima syndrome was named after [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis|an abduction at the Japanese embassy]] in [[Lima]], Peru, in 1996, when members of a militant movement took hostage hundreds of people attending a party at the official residence of Japan's ambassador. Within a few hours, the abductors had set free most of the hostages, including the most valuable ones, because of sympathy towards them.&lt;ref name=ptsd&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kato N, Kawata M, Pitman RK | title=PTSD |year=2006 |publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FUOHCwnHFKUC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Lima+Syndrome%22 |isbn = 978-4-431-29566-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Tansa|last= Musa  | name-list-format = vanc  | title = Africa Politics | url = http://www.ipsnews.net/1996/07/africa-politics-rwandas-revenge/ |work=[[International Press Service]] |date=10 July 1996 |access-date=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms and behaviours ==
{{Original research section|date=October 2016}}
Victims of the formal definition of Stockholm syndrome develop "positive feelings toward their captors and sympathy for their causes and goals, and negative feelings toward the police or authorities".&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; These symptoms often follow escaped victims back into their previously ordinary lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/coping-after-captivity/384577/|title=Coping After Captivity|last=Giambrone|first=Andrew | name-list-format = vanc |work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical and psychological effects ===

# Cognitive: confusion, blurred memory, refusal to accept the reality of events and recurring flashbacks.
# Emotional: lack of feeling, fear, helplessness, hopelessness, aggression, depression, guilt, dependence on captor and development of posttraumatic stress disorder. 
# Social: anxiety, irritability, cautiousness and estrangement. 
# Physical: increase in effects of pre-existing conditions; development of health conditions due to possible restriction from food, sleep, and exposure to outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander DA, Klein S | title = Kidnapping and hostage-taking: a review of effects, coping and resilience | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–21 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19147852 | pmc = 2627800 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2008.080347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coping mechanism ===
From a psychoanalytic lens, it can be argued that Stockholm syndrome arises strictly as a result of survival instincts. Strentz states, "the victim’s need to survive is stronger than his impulse to hate the person who has created the dilemma." A positive emotional bond between captor and captive is a "defense mechanism of the ego under stress".&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; These sentimental feelings are not strictly for show, however. Since captives often fear that their affection will be perceived as fake, they eventually begin to believe that their positive sentiments are genuine. The conception of Stockholm syndrome has grown to include victims of kidnappings or hostage instances, domestic or child abuse, human trafficking, incest, prisoners of war, political terrorism, cult members, concentration camp prisoners, slaves, and prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012" /&gt; It is believed that women are especially prone to developing the condition.&lt;ref name = "Åse_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Åse|first1=Cecilia | name-list-format = vanc |title=Crisis Narratives and Masculinist Protection|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|date=22 May 2015|volume=17|issue=4|pages=595–610|doi=10.1080/14616742.2015.1042296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, Stockholm syndrome develops in captives when they engage in "face-to-face contact" with their captors, and when captors make captives doubt the likelihood of their survival by terrorizing them into "helpless, powerless, and submissive" states. This enables captors to appear merciful when they perform acts of kindness or fail to "beat, abuse, or rape" the victims.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; Ideas like "dominance hierarchies and submission strategies" assist in devising explanations for the illogical reasoning behind the symptoms of those suffering from Stockholm syndrome as a result of any oppressive relationship.&lt;ref name="Åse_2015" /&gt; Partial activation of the capture-bonding psychological trait may lie behind [[battered woman syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=October 2016}}{{cite book|first=Libb|last=Thims | name-list-format = vanc |title=Human Chemistry (Volume Two)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGaghraz8AUC|year=2007 |publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4303-2840-7|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KGaghraz8AUC&amp;pg=PA604&amp;dq=%25captive–bonding%25+%25battered–wife+syndrome%25 604–605]}}&lt;/ref&gt; military basic training, fraternity [[hazing]], and sex practices such as [[BDSM|sadism/masochism or bondage/discipline]].&lt;ref name="hkhenson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henson |first=Keith | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evolutionary Psychology, Memes and the Origin of War |journal=Mankind Quarterly |date=Summer 2006 |volume=46 |issue=4 |url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2006/4/17/194059/296 |authorlink=Keith Henson |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209044509/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2006/4/17/194059/296 |archive-date=9 December 2012 |access-date=15 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possible evolutionary explanations ====

Evolutionarily speaking, research evidence exists to support the genuine scientific nature of Stockholm syndrome. Responses similar to those in human captives have been detected in some reptiles and mammals, primates in particular. Abuse and subsequent submission and appeasement by the victim have been observed among chimpanzees, leading to the theory that the Stockholm syndrome may have its roots in evolutionary needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cantor C, Price J | title = Traumatic entrapment, appeasement and complex post-traumatic stress disorder: evolutionary perspectives of hostage reactions, domestic abuse and the Stockholm syndrome | journal = The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 377–84 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17464728 | doi = 10.1080/00048670701261178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life in the "environment of evolutionary adaptiveness" ([[Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|EEA]]) is thought by researchers such as Israeli military historian [[Azar Gat]] to be similar to that of the few remaining hunter-gatherer societies, who asserts that war and abductions were typical of human pre-history.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-scribd-10|&lt;sup&gt;[10&lt;/sup&gt;]] Being captured by neighbouring tribes was a relatively common event for women. In some of those tribes ([[Yanomamo]], for instance), practically everyone in the tribe is descended from a captive within the last three generations. As high as one in ten of females were abducted and incorporated into the tribe that captured them.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-hkhenson-15|&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;]]Being captured[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-11|&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] and having their children killed may have been common;[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-12|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]] women who resisted capture risked being killed.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-13|&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;]] When [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is intense and persistent, adaptive traits (such as capture-bonding) become universal to the population or species.

==== Loving to survive ====
First published in 1994, author Dee Graham uses the Stockholm syndrome label to describe group or collective responses to trauma, rather than individual reactions. Graham focuses specifically on the impact of Stockholm syndrome on battered and abused women as a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://violentadegen.ro/wp-content/uploads/Loving-to-Survive-Graham.pdf|title=Loving to Survive|last=Graham|first=Dee L. R.|publisher=New York University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-:1-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]She claimed that in both the psychological and societal senses, these women are defined by their sense of fear surrounding the threat of male violence. This constant fear is what drives these women to perform actions that they know will be pleasing to men in order to avoid emotional, physical, or sexual assault as a result of male anger. Graham draws parallels between women and kidnapping victims in the sense that these women bond to men to survive, as captives bond to their captors to survive.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-:1-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

=== Recovery ===
Recovering from Stockholm syndrome ordinarily involves "psychiatric or psychological counseling," where the patient is helped to realize that their actions and feelings stemmed from inherent human survival techniques. The process of recovery includes reinstating normalcy into the lives of victims, including helping the victim learn how to decrease their survival-driven behaviors.[[Stockholm syndrome#cite note-:24-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;ref name="Åse_2015"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
=== Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM5, 2013) ===
This book is widely used as the "classification system for psychological disorders" by the American Psychiatric Association.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; Stockholm syndrome has not historically appeared in the manual, as many believe it falls under [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Before the fifth edition (DSM5) was released, Stockholm syndrome was under consideration to be included under 'Disorders of Extreme Stress, Not Otherwise Specified'.&lt;ref name="Adorjan_2012"/&gt; The work was updated in 2013, but Stockholm syndrome was not present.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | author = American Psychiatry Association | title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5 | date = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | location = Washington | isbn = 978-0-89042-555-8 | edition = 5th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Namnyak, Tufton, Szekely, Toal, Worboys and Sampson (2008) ===
Researchers have found that although there is a lot of media coverage of Stockholm syndrome, there has not been a lot of professional research into the phenomena. What little research has been done is often contradictory and does not always agree on what Stockholm syndrome is. The term has grown beyond kidnappings to all kinds of abuse. Also, there is no clear definition of symptoms to ‘diagnose’ the ‘syndrome’.&lt;ref name="Namnyak_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Namnyak M, Tufton N, Szekely R, Toal M, Worboys S, Sampson EL | title = 'Stockholm syndrome': psychiatric diagnosis or urban myth? | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–11 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18028254 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2007.01112.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin (1999) ===
A report by the FBI found that only 8% of kidnapping victims showed signs of Stockholm syndrome. The sensational nature of dramatic cases causes the public to perceive this phenomenon as the rule rather than the exception. For Stockholm syndrome to happen, FBI researchers have identified three key factors: the passage of time, continual contact, and small acts of kindness without direct and persistent abuse.&lt;ref name="FBI-1999"/&gt;&lt;!--{{cite journal | last = Fuselier | first = G.

=== Robbins and Anthony (1982) ===
Robbins and Anthony, who had historically studied a condition similar to Stockholm syndrome, known as destructive cult disorder, observed in their 1982 study that the 1970s were rich with apprehension surrounding the potential risks of brainwashing. They assert that brainwashing’s media attention during this time resulted in the fluid reception of Stockholm syndrome as a psychological condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Elizabeth Aileen| name-list-format = vanc |date=31 December 2012|title=The use of the "Brainwashing" Theory by the Anti-cult Movement in the United States of America, pre-1996|url=http://journals.openedition.org/zjr/387|journal=Zeitschrift für Junge Religionswissenschaft | language=en|issue=7|doi=10.4000/zjr.387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victims ===
It is possible that the label Stockholm syndrome is used too freely in cases in which it may not apply. [[Elizabeth Smart]] has been held as a classic example of Stockholm syndrome; however, she denies that she ever had any emotional attachment to her abusers. Although she chose not to run away when she had the chance, she emphasized that the threats from her captors to her and her family, and the direct presence of her captors influenced her decision to stay. Once freed from her captors, she gladly reunited with her family and felt no empathy for her abusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | last= McLaughlin | first = Christen Marie | degree = Bachelor of Science | name-list-format = vanc | title = Fear or Love: Examining Stockholm Syndrome in the Elizabeth Smart Kidnapping case | date = 2015 | publisher = Salem State University | url = http://digitalcommons.salemstate.edu/honors_theses/72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films and television===
* In the 1977 TV series ''[[Lou Grant (season 1)|Lou Grant]]'', episode ''Hostages''. The hostage negotiator mentions Stockholm syndrome to Lou when hostage Carla Mardigian goes back after hostage taker lets her go to the toilet.
*In the opening sequence of ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983), James Bond is "killed" in a training exercise by a prisoner he has released, since he doesn't anticipate that she might be suffering from Stockholm syndrome. This condition is also mentioned in The World is Not Enough, where Bond accuses Elektra King of having romantic feelings for her captor, Renard.
*In ''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988), a book author, Dr. Hasseldorf, expresses his view that "by this time, the hostages should be going through the early stages of the Helsinki syndrome," an error compounded by news reporter Harvey Johnson's reply of "As in Helsinki, Sweden."
*In ''[[Babylon 5]]'''s 8th episode of Season 4, ''[[The Illusion of Truth]]'' (1997), Dr. Indiri states that [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|Sheridan]] is suffering from Helsinki syndrome.
*In the animated series ''[[Black Lagoon]]'', it is often contemplated by the protagonist whether or not he has Stockholm syndrome after he joins the pirates as a former hostage.
* In the second episode of [[Red Dwarf XII|Series XII]] of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', ''[[Siliconia]]'' (2017), the leader of the Mechanoid Intergalactic Liberation Front known as Wind suggests to [[Kryten]] that he is suffering from Stockholm syndrome based on his professed affection for his shipmates despite his seeming servitude.
* In the Spanish TV series [[Money Heist]] (Casa de Papel, 2017), all of the captors are nicknamed for cities -- Tokyo, Berlin, etc.  One of the hostages falls in love with one of the captors and joins them, earning her the nickname Stockholm.

===Other media===
*In music, many bands have published [[Stockholm syndrome (disambiguation)#songs|songs titled "Stockholm Syndrome"]], such as [[Yo La Tengo]], [[blink-182]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], and [[One Direction]]. Japanese-British singer [[Rina Sawayama]] has also released a song "Cyberstockholm Syndrome" based on the condition with an Internet-technological theme of online relationships. 
*In the video game ''[[Payday 2]]'', there is an available skill in the "Mastermind" tree called Stockholm Syndrome, which gives civilians (who are typically held hostage if not freed by police units or left unattended long enough) a chance to revive downed players and give them more weapon ammunition.

'''Superpower''' is a [[popular culture]] term for an imaginary [[superhuman]] ability. They are most frequently used in [[pulp magazine]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[science fiction]], [[television program]]s, and [[film]]s as the key attribute of a [[superhero]]. The concept originated in [[American comic book]]s and [[pulp magazines]] of the 1930s and 1940s, and has gradually worked its way into other genres and media.

== Definition ==
There is no rigid definition of a "superpower." In popular culture, it may be used to describe anything from minimal exaggeration of normal human traits to [[magic in fiction|magic]], flight, super strength, projection of destructive energy beams and force fields, invulnerability, telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation, super speed, or weather control.

Generally speaking, exceptional-but-not-superhuman fictional characters like [[Batman]], [[Iron Man]], [[Green Arrow]], and [[Punisher|the Punisher]] may be classified as superheroes even though they do not have any actual superhuman abilities. Similarly, characters with superhuman abilities derived from artificial, external sources, like the [[Six Million Dollar Man]]'s bionic limbs, [[Green Lantern]]'s [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]], and Tony Stark's [[Iron Man armor]], may be described as having superpowers, but are not necessarily superhuman.

==Explanations in fiction==
In fiction, seemingly impossible superpowers are often given scientific, quasi-scientific, pseudoscientific, or supernatural explanations. Superpowers based on possible current or future technology, such as mechanized suits, rockets, [[bionics]] and [[genetic manipulation]], are typically explained using science and [[science fiction]]. Superpowers based on [[psychic]] and [[paranormal]] phenomena, for example, are typically explained using supernatural/otherworldly ideas, parapsychology, or even pseudoscience. Other superpowers may be explained using [[mythology]].

== Superpower diversification ==
[[File:CharacterProfile1.jpg|thumb|[[Role-playing games]] often described superpowers in terms of numeric values.]]
The 1970s brought the development of [[role-playing game]]s like ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ptgptb.org/0001/history1.html|title=RPG History Part One|website=ptgptb.org|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superhero-themed games soon followed, but within the [[game mechanics]] of [[role-playing game system]]s, issues such as the name or visible effects of a form of attack became apparent. The ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' role-playing game handled this by describing powers by their effects rather than their causes; for example, a laser and a lightning bolt were both considered to be forms of a ranged attack. Another issue was that some powers were simply more useful than others in terms of gameplay; ''Champions'' handled this as well by assigning each power a "value" in a point system, with more powerful or useful abilities costing more points to "buy." ''Champions'' also gave players options to modify their characters' powers, allowing each character's abilities to be unique. This system has influenced many other similar games since.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In the 1980s, Marvel Comics began publishing their ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' series, in which the powers of their characters were explained in great detail, often using scientific and [[pseudo-scientific]] terms. Issues of persecution in relation to the possession of superpowers have also been expanded upon; an example of this is the persecution of mutants in the ''X-Men'' series.

==In manga and anime==
Superpowers are a commonly used concept in [[manga]] and [[anime]], particularly in the [[shonen]] genre. They are often featured in popular manga and anime such as [[Attack on Titan]], [[My Hero Academia]], [[HunterxHunter]], [[Naruto]], and [[Code Geass]]. The types of powers featured vary from anime to anime. Some anime, such as [[Dragon Ball Z]], feature many different characters who have the same types of powers; others, such as [[One Piece]], feature characters with a wide range of different powers, with many powers being unique to only one or a few characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anime-planet.com/characters/tags/superpowers|title=Superpowers Characters {{!}} Anime-Planet|website=www.anime-planet.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swarm Development Group''' ('''SDG''') is an American non-profit organization to advance the development of [[complex adaptive system]]-oriented [[agent-based model]]ing (ABM) tools initiated at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, US. It was formed in 1999 by a group of multidisciplinary scientists, researchers, and software developers, led by [[Chris Langton]]. Langton was also the founder of the emerging field of research called [[artificial life]].  The initial, primary, role for the SDG was to house continued development of the [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] simulation software after the software become independent of the SFI in 1999.

The role of the Swarm Development Group, has since expanded to include the co-ordination of a long-running conference SwarmFest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm:_SwarmFest SwarmFest]&lt;/ref&gt; during May, June, or July each summer – typically hosted by a different research university each year. Developers, users, and researchers gather to present research papers and discuss the state of Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms like [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] (University of Chicago) and Ascape&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/es/dynamics/models/ascape/ Ascape]&lt;/ref&gt; (Brookings).  Typically, a wide range of academic, corporate, and government organizations are represented at SwarmFest.   The first SwarmFest was in 1998 while Swarm was still sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute.   From SwarmFest 2000 onwards, after the SDG was formed in late 1999, SwarmFests were organized directly by the SDG.

Recent SwarmFests have been held at a variety of institutions.  SwarmFest 2007 was held at DePaul University's School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.depaul.edu/news/default.asp School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown Chicago, Illinois.  SwarmFest 2008 was held at Northwestern Memorial Hospital/Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in downtown Chicago, Illinois.  Swarmfest 2008 had special focus areas on [[agent based modeling]] in [[Systems Biology]], and the implementation of [[agent based model]]s in [[high-performance computing]] environments. Between 2009 and 2012, SwarmFest was held at the Santa Fe Complex in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].  Swarmfest 2013 was held at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida July 8–9.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ucf.edu/swarmfest2013.html SwarmFest2013]&lt;/ref&gt; SwarmFest 2014 was held at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, IN from June 29 – July 1, 2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarmfest2014.org/ |title=SwarmFest2014 |accessdate=2014-05-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001230/http://www.swarmfest2014.org/ |archivedate=May 9, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC (in 2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarmfest2015.org/ |title=SwarmFest2015 |accessdate=2018-02-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117084740/http://www.swarmfest2015.org/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Vermont in Burlington, VT (in 2016),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/swarmfest2016/ SwarmFest2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and Old Dominion University in Suffolk, VA (in 2017),&lt;ref&gt;[http://swarmfest2017.org/ SwarmFest2017]&lt;/ref&gt; were the selected venues.

'''Time displacement''' in [[sociology]] refers to the idea that new forms of activities may replace older ones. New activities that cause time displacement are usually technology-based, most common are the [[information and communication technologies]] such as [[Internet]] and [[television]]. Those technologies are seen as responsible for declines of previously more common activities such as in- and out-of-home socializing, work, and even personal care and sleep.

For example, Internet users may spend time online using it as a substitute of other activities that served similar function(s) (watching television, reading printed media, [[face time|face to face]] interaction, etc.). Internet is not the first technology to result in time displacement. Earlier, television had a similar impact, as it shifted people's time from activities such as listening to [[radio]], going to [[movie theater]]s or, talking in house, or spending time outside it.

'''Unix time''' (also known as '''POSIX time'''{{cn|date=July 2017}} or '''UNIX Epoch time'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beginning Linux Programming|last=Matthew|first=Neil|last2=Stones|first2=Richard|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|isbn=978-0-470-14762-7|location=Indianapolis, Indiana, US|pages=148|chapter=The Linux Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a system for describing a point in [[time]]. It is the number of [[second]]s that have elapsed since 00:00:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970,&lt;ref name="single-unix-spec-4.16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_16|title=The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, section 4.16 Seconds Since the Epoch|publisher=[[The Open Group]]|accessdate=22 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; minus [[leap seconds]]. Every day is treated as if it contains exactly 86400 seconds,&lt;ref name="single-unix-spec-4.16"/&gt; so [[leap second]]s are to be subtracted since the Epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/V4_xbd_chap04.html#tag_21_04_16|title=The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, Rationale, section 4.16 Seconds Since the Epoch|publisher=The OpenGroup|accessdate=22 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used widely in [[Unix-like]] and many other operating systems and file formats. However, Unix time is not a true representation of UTC, as a leap second in UTC shares the same Unix time as the second which came before it. Unix time may be checked on most Unix systems by typing {{code|date +%s}} on the command line.

On systems where the representation of Unix time is as a signed 32-bit number, the representation will end after the completion of {{val|2147483647}} (2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) seconds from 00:00:00 on 1 January 1970, which will happen at 3:14:08 on 19 January 2038 UTC, although exactly how many seconds that is from now is not known because of unpredictable leap seconds. This is referred to as the ''[[Year 2038 problem]]'' where the 32-bit signed Unix time will overflow and will take the actual count to negative.

==Definition==
Two layers of encoding make up Unix time. The first layer encodes a point in time as a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] [[real number]] which represents the number of seconds that have passed since the beginning of 00:00:00 UTC Thursday, 1 January 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epochconverter.com/|title=Epoch Converter - Unix Timestamp Converter|website=Epoch Converter|language=en|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second layer encodes that number as a sequence of bits or decimal digits.

As is standard with UTC, this article labels days using the [[Gregorian calendar]], and counts times within each day in hours, minutes, and seconds. Some of the examples also show [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI), another time scheme, which uses the same seconds and is displayed in the same format as UTC, but in which every day is exactly {{val|86400}} seconds long, gradually losing [[synchronization]] with the Earth's rotation at a rate of roughly one second per year.

===Encoding time as a number===
Unix time is a single signed number which increments every second, without requiring the calculations to determine year, month, day of month, hour and minute required for intelligibility to humans.

The ''Unix [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]'' is the time 00:00:00{{nbsp}}UTC on 1 January 1970. There is a problem with this definition, in that UTC did not exist in its current form until 1972; this issue is discussed below. For brevity, the remainder of this section uses [[ISO 8601]] date and time format, in which the Unix epoch is 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

The Unix time number is zero at the Unix epoch, and increases by exactly {{val|86400}} per day since the epoch. Thus 2004-09-16T00:00:00Z, {{val|12677}} days after the epoch, is represented by the Unix time number {{val|12677}} × {{val|86400}} = {{val|1095292800}}. This can be extended backwards from the epoch too, using negative numbers; thus 1957-10-04T00:00:00Z, {{val|4472}} days before the epoch, is represented by the Unix time number {{val|−4472}} × {{val|86400}} = {{val|−386380800}}.

Within each day, the Unix time number is calculated as in the preceding paragraph at midnight UTC (00:00:00Z), and increases by exactly 1 per second since midnight. Thus 2004-09-16T17:55:43.54Z, {{val|64543.54}} seconds since midnight on the first day in the example above, is represented by the Unix time number {{val|1095292800}} + {{val|64543.54}} = {{val|1095357343.54}}. On dates before the epoch the number still increases, thus becoming less negative, as time moves forward.

Because Unix time is based on the Unix epoch, it is sometimes referred to as ''epoch time''.

===Leap seconds===
The above scheme means that on a normal UTC day, which has a duration of {{val|86400}} seconds, the Unix time number changes in a [[continuous function|continuous]] manner across midnight. For example, at the end of the day used in the examples above, the time representations progress as follows:

When a [[leap second]] occurs, the UTC day is not exactly {{val|86400}} seconds long and the Unix time number (which always increases by exactly {{val|86400}} each day) experiences a [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]]. At the end of a day with a negative leap second, which has not yet occurred, the Unix time number would jump up by 1 to the start of the next day. During a positive leap second at the end of a day, which occurs about every year and a half on average, the Unix time number increases continuously into the next day during the leap second and then at the end of the leap second jumps back by 1 (returning to the start of the next day). For example, this is what happened on strictly conforming POSIX.1 systems at the end of 1998:

Unix time numbers are repeated in the second immediately following a positive leap second. The Unix time number {{val|915148800.50}} is thus ambiguous: it can refer either to the instant in the middle of the leap second, or to the instant one second later, half a second after midnight UTC. In the theoretical case when a negative leap second occurs, no ambiguity is caused, but instead there is a range of Unix time numbers that do not refer to any point in time at all.

A Unix clock is often implemented with a different type of positive leap second handling associated with the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). This yields a system that does not conform to the POSIX standard. See the section below concerning NTP for details.

When dealing with periods that do not encompass a UTC leap second, the difference between two Unix time numbers is equal to the duration in seconds of the period between the corresponding points in time. This is a common computational technique. However, where leap seconds occur, such calculations give the wrong answer. In applications where this level of accuracy is required, it is necessary to consult a table of leap seconds when dealing with Unix times, and it is often preferable to use a different time encoding that does not suffer from this problem.

A Unix time number is easily converted back into UTC by taking the quotient and modulus of the Unix time number, modulo {{val|86400}}. The quotient is the number of days since the epoch, and the modulus is the number of seconds since midnight UTC on that day. If given a Unix time number that is ambiguous due to a positive leap second, this algorithm interprets it as the time just after midnight. It never generates a time that is during a leap second. If given a Unix time number that is invalid due to a negative leap second, it generates an equally invalid UTC time. If these conditions are significant, it is necessary to consult a table of leap seconds to detect them.

====Non-synchronous Network Time Protocol-based variant====
Commonly a [[David L. Mills|Mills]]-style Unix clock is implemented with leap second handling not synchronous with the change of the Unix time number. The time number initially decreases where a leap should have occurred, and then it leaps to the correct time 1 second after the leap. This makes implementation easier, and is described by Mills' paper.&lt;ref name="eeci_TheN"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The NTP Timescale and Leap Seconds | last = Mills | first = David L. | work = eecis.udel.edu | date = 12 May 2012 | accessdate = 2017-08-21 | url = https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/leap.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is what happens across a positive leap second:

This can be decoded properly by paying attention to the leap second state variable, which unambiguously indicates whether the leap has been performed yet. The state variable change is synchronous with the leap.

A similar situation arises with a negative leap second, where the second that is skipped is slightly too late. Very briefly the system shows a nominally impossible time number, but this can be detected by the '''TIME_DEL''' state and corrected.

In this type of system the Unix time number violates POSIX around both types of leap second. Collecting the leap second state variable along with the time number allows for unambiguous decoding, so the correct POSIX time number can be generated if desired, or the full UTC time can be stored in a more suitable format.

The decoding logic required to cope with this style of Unix clock would also correctly decode a hypothetical POSIX-conforming clock using the same interface. This would be achieved by indicating the '''TIME_INS''' state during the entirety of an inserted leap second, then indicating '''TIME_WAIT''' during the entirety of the following second while repeating the seconds count. This requires synchronous leap second handling. This is probably the best way to express UTC time in Unix clock form, via a Unix interface, when the underlying clock is fundamentally untroubled by leap seconds.

====TAI-based variant====
{{Disputed section|Does any system really keep a time as a pure linear count of seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01T00:00:00 *TAI*?|date=April 2016}}
Another, much rarer, non-conforming variant of Unix time keeping involves encoding TAI rather than UTC; some Linux systems are configured this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Scales|url=http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/TimeScales|work=Network Time Protocol Wiki|accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because TAI has no leap seconds, and every TAI day is exactly 86400 seconds long, this encoding is actually a pure linear count of seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01T00:00:00{{nbsp}}TAI. This makes time interval arithmetic much easier. Time values from these systems do not suffer the ambiguity that strictly conforming POSIX systems or NTP-driven systems have.

In these systems it is necessary to consult a table of leap seconds to correctly convert between UTC and the pseudo-Unix-time representation. This resembles the manner in which time zone tables must be consulted to convert to and from [[civil time]]; the [[IANA time zone database]] includes leap second information, and the sample code available from the same source uses that information to convert between TAI-based time stamps and local time. Conversion also runs into definitional problems prior to the 1972 commencement of the current form of UTC (see section [[Unix time#UTC basis|UTC basis]] below).

This TAI-based system, despite its superficial resemblance, is not Unix time. It encodes times with values that differ by several seconds from the POSIX time values, and does not have the simple mathematical relationship to UTC that is mandated by POSIX.

===Representing the number===
A Unix time number can be represented in any form capable of representing numbers. In some applications the number is simply represented textually as a string of decimal digits, raising only trivial additional problems. However, certain binary representations of Unix times are particularly significant.

The Unix &lt;!-- time_t meaning time type is a C type name. DO NOT REPLACE time_t WITH time t!!! --&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[[time t|time_t]]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;!-- DO NOT REPLACE time_t WITH time t!!! --&gt; data type that represents a point in time is, on many platforms, a [[Integer (computer science)|signed integer]], traditionally of 32{{nbsp}}[[bit]]s (but see below), directly encoding the Unix time number as described in the preceding section. Being 32 bits means that it covers a range of about 136 years in total. The minimum representable time is Friday 1901-12-13, and the maximum representable time is Tuesday 2038-01-19. One second after 03:14:07{{nbsp}}UTC 2038-01-19 this representation will [[arithmetic overflow|overflow]]. This milestone is anticipated with a mixture of amusement and dread—see [[year 2038 problem]].

In some newer operating systems, &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; has been widened to 64 bits. This expands the times representable by approximately 293 billion years in both directions, which is over twenty times the present [[age of the universe]] per direction.

There was originally some controversy over whether the Unix &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; should be signed or unsigned. If unsigned, its range in the future would be doubled, postponing the 32-bit overflow (by 68 years). However, it would then be incapable of representing times prior to the epoch. The consensus is for &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; to be signed, and this is the usual practice. The software development platform for version 6 of the [[QNX]] operating system has an unsigned 32-bit &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt;, though older releases used a signed type.

The [[POSIX]] and [[Open Group]] Unix specifications include the [[C standard library]], which includes the time types and functions defined in the [[time.h|&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;time.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;]] header file. The ISO C standard states that &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; must be an arithmetic type, but does not mandate any specific type or encoding for it. POSIX requires &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; to be an integer type, but does not mandate that it be signed or unsigned.

Unix has no tradition of directly representing non-integer Unix time numbers as binary fractions. Instead, times with sub-second precision are represented using [[composite data type]]s that consist of two integers, the first being a &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; (the integral part of the Unix time), and the second being the fractional part of the time number in millionths (in &lt;tt&gt;struct timeval&lt;/tt&gt;) or billionths (in &lt;tt&gt;struct timespec&lt;/tt&gt;). These structures provide a [[decimal]]-based [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] data format, which is useful for some applications, and trivial to convert for others.

===UTC basis===
The present form of UTC, with leap seconds, is defined only from 1 January 1972 onwards. Prior to that, since 1 January 1961 there was an older form of UTC in which not only were there occasional time steps, which were by non-integer numbers of seconds, but also the UTC second was slightly longer than the SI second, and periodically changed to continuously approximate the Earth's rotation. Prior to 1961 there was no UTC, and prior to 1958 there was no widespread [[atomic clock|atomic timekeeping]]; in these eras, some approximation of [[GMT]] (based directly on the Earth's rotation) was used instead of an atomic timescale.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The precise definition of Unix time as an encoding of UTC is only uncontroversial when applied to the present form of UTC. The Unix epoch predating the start of this form of UTC does not affect its use in this era: the number of days from 1 January 1970 (the Unix epoch) to 1 January 1972 (the start of UTC) is not in question, and the number of days is all that is significant to Unix time.

The meaning of Unix time values below {{val|+63072000}} (i.e., prior to 1 January 1972) is not precisely defined. The basis of such Unix times is best understood to be an unspecified approximation of UTC. Computers of that era rarely had clocks set sufficiently accurately to provide meaningful sub-second timestamps in any case. Unix time is not a suitable way to represent times prior to 1972 in applications requiring sub-second precision; such applications must, at least, define which form of UT or GMT they use.

{{As of|2009}}, the possibility of ending the use of leap seconds in civil time is being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A likely means to execute this change is to define a new time scale, called ''International Time'', that initially matches UTC but thereafter has no leap seconds, thus remaining at a constant offset from TAI. If this happens, it is likely that Unix time will be prospectively defined in terms of this new time scale, instead of UTC. Uncertainty about whether this will occur makes prospective Unix time no less predictable than it already is: if UTC were simply to have no further leap seconds the result would be the same.

==Command line==
In [[Unix-like operating system]]s, &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; is the command which will print or set the current time.&lt;ref&gt;{{man|cu|date}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest versions of Unix time had a 32-bit integer incrementing at a rate of 60&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], which was the rate of the system clock on the hardware of the early Unix systems. The value 60&amp;nbsp;Hz still appears in some software interfaces as a result. The epoch also differed from the current value. The first edition Unix Programmer's Manual dated 3 November 1971 defines the Unix time as "the time since 00:00:00, 1 January 1971, measured in sixtieths of a second".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unix Programmer's Manual|edition=1st|url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/pdfs/man22.pdf|quote="''time'' returns the time since 00:00:00, 1 Jan. 1971, measured in sixtieths of a second."|date=1971-11-03|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The User Manual also commented that "the chronologically-minded user will note that 2**32 sixtieths of a second is only about 2.5 years". Because of this limited range, the epoch was redefined more than once, before the rate was changed to 1&amp;nbsp;Hz and the epoch was set to its present value of 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This yielded a range of about 136 years, though with more than half the range in the past (see discussion of signedness above).

As indicated by the definition quoted above, the Unix time scale was originally intended to be a simple linear representation of time elapsed since an epoch. However, there was no consideration of the details of time scales, and it was implicitly assumed that there was a simple linear time scale already available and agreed upon. The first edition manual's definition does not even specify which time zone is used. Several later problems, including the complexity of the present definition, result from Unix time having been defined gradually by usage rather than fully defined from the outset.

When [[POSIX#POSIX.1|POSIX.1]] was written, the question arose of how to precisely define &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; in the face of leap seconds. The POSIX committee considered whether Unix time should remain, as intended, a linear count of seconds since the epoch, at the expense of complexity in conversions with civil time or a representation of civil time, at the expense of inconsistency around leap seconds. Computer clocks of the era were not sufficiently precisely set to form a precedent one way or the other.

The POSIX committee was swayed by arguments against complexity in the library functions,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} and firmly defined the Unix time in a simple manner in terms of the elements of UTC time. This definition was so simple that it did not even encompass the entire [[leap year]] rule of the Gregorian calendar, and would make 2100 a leap year.

The 2001 edition of POSIX.1 rectified the faulty leap year rule in the definition of Unix time, but retained the essential definition of Unix time as an encoding of UTC rather than a linear time scale. Since the mid-1990s, computer clocks have been routinely set with sufficient precision for this to matter, and they have most commonly been set using the UTC-based definition of Unix time. This has resulted in considerable complexity in Unix implementations, and in the [[Network Time Protocol]], to execute steps in the Unix time number whenever leap seconds occur.

==Notable events in Unix time==
&lt;!-- new entries to this list are subject to removal unless accompanied by a citation establishing notability --&gt;

Unix enthusiasts have a history of holding "time_t parties" to celebrate significant values of the Unix time number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/02/unix-lovers-to/ |accessdate=2013-08-09 |title=Unix Lovers to Party Like It's 1234567890 |magazine=Wired |last=Tweney |first=Dylan |date=12 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slashdot.org/articles/05/03/17/169200.shtml?tid=130 |title=Slashdot {{!}} date +%s Turning 1111111111 |accessdate=2007-07-14 }}{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are directly analogous to the [[new year]] celebrations that occur at the change of year in many calendars. As the use of Unix time has spread, so has the practice of celebrating its milestones. Usually it is time values that are round numbers in [[decimal]] that are celebrated, following the Unix convention of viewing &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; values in decimal. Among some groups round [[binary numeral system|binary]] numbers are also celebrated, such as +2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; which occurred at 13:37:04 UTC on Saturday, 10 January 2004.

The events that these celebrate are typically described as "''N'' seconds since the Unix epoch", but this is inaccurate. As discussed above, due to the handling of leap seconds in Unix time, the number of seconds elapsed since the Unix epoch is slightly greater than the Unix time number for times later than the epoch.

* At 01:46:40 UTC on Sunday, 9 September 2001, the Unix billennium (Unix time number {{val|1000000000}}) was celebrated.&lt;ref name="unixtime_facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unix time facts &amp;amp; trivia – Unix Time .

Affected programs included the popular [[Usenet]] reader [[KNode]] and [[e-mail]] client [[KMail]], part of the [[KDE]] desktop environment. Such bugs were generally cosmetic in nature and quickly fixed once problems became apparent. The problem also affected many ''Filtrix'' document-format filters provided with [[Linux]] versions of [[WordPerfect]]; a patch was created by the user community to solve this problem, since [[Corel]] no longer sold or supported that version of the program.&lt;ref name="linu_Tech"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Technical Problems. | author =  | work = linuxmafia.com | date =  | accessdate = 2017-08-21 | url = http://linuxmafia.com/wpfaq/problems.html#FITRIX &lt;!-- that link looks like a typo, but FITRIX is correct; copy and pasted --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{anchor|Decimal 1 Day}} At 01:58:31 UTC on Friday, 18 March 2005, Unix time reached {{val|1111111111}} seconds. A celebration was held on [[IRC]] in the [[Freenode]] channel #1111111111. South Korean enthusiasts called it "Decimal 1 Day".{{cn|date=May 2017}}
* {{anchor|1234567890 Day}}At 23:31:30 UTC on Friday, 13 February 2009, the [[decimal]] representation of [[Unix]] time reached {{val|1234567890}} seconds (like the number row on a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nixCraft |url=http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/february-13th-unix-time-will-reach-1234567890.html |title=Humor: On Feb, Friday 13, 2009 Unix time Will Be 1234567890 |publisher=Cyberciti.biz |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of the world, this day fell on [[Friday the 13th]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], or Saturday, 14 February, for locations from France east to the [[International Date Line]].

* At 03:33:20 UTC on Wednesday, 18 May 2033, the Unix time value will equal {{val|2000000000}} seconds.
* At 06:28:16 UTC on Thursday, 7 February 2036, [[Network Time Protocol#Timestamps|Network Time Protocol]] will loop over to the next epoch, as the 32-bit time stamp value used in NTP (unsigned, but based on 1 January 1900) will overflow. This date is close to the following date because the 136-year range of a 32-bit integer number of seconds is close to twice the 70-year offset between the two epochs.
* At 03:14:08 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038, [[Year 2038 problem|32-bit versions of the Unix time stamp will cease to work]], as it will overflow the largest value that can be held in a signed 32-bit number ({{n-ary|7FFFFFFF|16}} or [[2147483647|{{val|2147483647}}]]). Before this moment, software using 32-bit time stamps will need to adopt a new convention for time stamps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php |title=Unix Time Stamp.com |publisher=Unixtimestamp.com |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and file formats using 32-bit time stamps will need to be changed to support larger time stamps or a different epoch. If unchanged, the next second will be incorrectly interpreted as 20:45:52 Friday {{nowrap|13 December 1901 UTC}}.
* At 05:20:00 UTC on Saturday, 24 January 2065, the Unix time value will equal {{val|3000000000}} seconds.
* At 06:28:15 UTC on Sunday, 7 February 2106, the Unix time will reach {{n-ary|FFFFFFFF|16}} or {{val|4294967295}} seconds which, for systems that hold the time on 32-bit unsigned integers, is the maximum attainable. For some of these systems, the next second will be incorrectly interpreted as 00:00:00 Thursday {{nowrap|1 January 1970 UTC}}. For others systems there will be an overflow error with unpredictable results. 
* At 15:30:08 UTC on Sunday, 4 December {{val|292277026596}} (should that date happen),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vEN-ckcdtCwC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=292,277,026,596 | title = Code Quality: The Open Source Perspective | isbn = 9780321166074 | author1 = Spinellis | first1 = Diomidis | date = 2006-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120513133703/http://www.idrbt.ac.in/publications/workingpapers/Working%20Paper%20No.%209.pdf IDRBT Working Paper No. 9 Y2K38] – Ashutosh Saxena and Sanjay Rawat&lt;/ref&gt; 64-bit versions of the Unix time stamp would cease to work, as it will overflow the largest value that can be held in a signed 64-bit number. This is nearly 22 times the [[age of the universe|estimated current age of the universe]], which is 1.37×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years (13.7&amp;nbsp;billion).

==In literature and calendrics==
[[Vernor Vinge]]'s novel ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]'' describes a spacefaring trading civilization thousands of years in the future that still uses the Unix epoch. The "[[software archaeology|programmer-archaeologist]]" responsible for finding and maintaining usable code in mature computer systems first believes that the epoch refers to the time when [[Apollo 11|man first walked on the Moon]], but then realizes that it is "the 0-second of one of Humankind's first computer operating systems".&lt;ref name="mashey20041227"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039532 | title=Languages, Levels, Libraries, and Longevity | author=Mashey, John R. | authorlink=John R.
