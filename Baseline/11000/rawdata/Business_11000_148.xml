Her hotel was involved with the production and housing of the crew on the American film production of [[Return to Paradise (1953 film)|Return to Paradise]] (1953) starring Gary Cooper.

She was friends with American writer [[James A. Michener|James Michener]] and she and her sister Mary Croudace (Aunty Mary) were widely believed to be possible models for his character [[Bloody Mary (South Pacific)|Bloody Mary]] that he created in ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'' (1946).  The book was adapted into Broadway's [[musical theatre|musical]] blockbuster ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949) by [[Richard Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]] (collectively known as [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]), and subsequently the 1958 film [[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]].

Aggie Gray's sister Mary Croudace ran "The Casino" a boarding-house in Apia, and was reputed to have been the lover of a Marine general in the war.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7196">Bank Administration Institute (BAI) is a [[nonprofit organization]] in the United States that provides research, training, and thought leadership events for the [[financial services]] industry. Headquartered in [[Chicago|Chicago, IL]], '''BAI''' also operates Banking Strategies, a daily online financial services publication.

==Organization==
BAI's mission is to give financial services leaders confidence, information and resources in order to make smart business decisions, every day. BAI's mission is created on the belief that a strong financial services industry helps consumers, businesses, and communities thrive.

BAI's members include national and global [[bank]]s, [[credit union]]s, [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] and [[Loan|auto loan]] providers, [[Money services business|money service businesses]], and larger lending institutions. In 2016, over 250,000 financial services individuals at more than 1,500 financial services organizations took compliance and [[Professional development|professional training courses]] through BAI.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==History==
In 1924, several representatives of regional [[Audit|auditors']] groups met to discuss issues in the auditing industry. Later that same year they created a national organization—the National Association of Bank Auditors and Controllers (NABAC) —and began to hold annual conventions and distribute a magazine focused on financial industry topics.

In the 1940s, the NABAC established its own office—first in [[Cleveland]] and later in Chicago. And the organization began to provide both education and technical research for its members. In 1957, the organization set up the NABAC Research Institute as the first official, collective research effort for the banking industry.

In 1969, NABAC rebranded as Bank Administration Institute (BAI), and had approximately 8,000 member institutions across the U.S.

In 1981, BAI launched the first electronic information services—Innerline—providing 24-hour access to world news briefs, American Banker news service, financial information on 8,500 publicly held corporations, and email and online registration for BAI conferences.

As of 1997, BAI co-sponsored with ECCHO (Electronic Check Clearing House Organization) the National Electronic Check and Image Exchange Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eccho.org/about_overview.php |title=About ECCHO™ |publisher=ECCHO |accessdate=16 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419210713/http://eccho.org/about_overview.php |archivedate=19 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, BAI recognized 90 years of service to the financial services industry and provided more than 250,000 individuals with [[Compliance training|compliance]] and professional training.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Business lines==

BAI is organized into three major divisions: Research, Learning and Development, and Conferences and Events.

BAI's Research division conducts [[data analysis]] using account-level data provided from participating financial services organizations. Once data is gathered, the data is then analyzed and compiled using BAI's proprietary database. BAI uses the data in order to present individual organizations with a comparison of their data with the larger peer group of participating organizations. All individual company data is kept confidential, and competitive data is available to participating organizations only in [[Aggregate data|aggregate]]. As a non-profit organization, BAI does not provide advice or consulting as a part of its research services. Comparative data is presented without additional insight or opinion. BAI Research topics include industry trends, small business banking, retail banking, and commercial banking. Analytics that can be compared include deposit performance, forecasts, market opportunities, and branch performance.

BAI Learning and Development division maintains a software course catalog through BAI's proprietary learning management system, the BAI Learning Manager, which can be accessed and managed by training administrators. The catalog includes more than 250 courses for banks, credit unions, mortgage lenders, and other financial services organizations. Topics cover areas including financial regulations, compliance, professional skills, certifications, and [[Human resource management|human resources]] issues. Courses are available from entry to executive level. BAI's course catalog is regularly updated to reflect the latest regulatory trends and issues in compliance and can also be provided to a financial institution's own learning management platform. BAI compliance and professional training can be customized, is updated continually, and is compliant with national regulatory standards.

BAI's Conferences and Events division hosts several industry events with the help of sponsors. Events include a comprehensive banking conference, a global awards program learning conference, executive roundtables, certification programs, and [[Web conferencing|webinars]] throughout the year.

The following are a few of the main events:

* '''BAI Global Banking Innovation Awards''': An annual awards program that has operated since 2011, the BAI Global Banking Innovation Awards event recognizes innovators within the financial services industry worldwide. Nominations are submitted by the financial services organizations themselves, with winners selected by an independent judging panel, and given the awards at the annual ceremony. A majority of finalists and award winners have historically been awarded to financial services organizations located outside the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161012005832/en/CBW-Bank-Named-Innovative-Community-Based-Banking-Organization|title=CBW Bank Named Most Innovative Community-Based Banking Organization by BAI&amp;rsquo;s 2016 Global Banking Innovation Awards|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''BAI Beacon''': Formerly two separate conferences—BAI Retail Delivery and BAI Payments Connect—BAI Beacon is a two-day "immersive experience" for those in the financial services industry. Topics include sales, marketing and product development, channel strategies, payments strategy and fraud, compliance, small business, analytics, and technology. In 2016, BAI Beacon served as the premiere of the U.S. FinTechStage. Speakers focus on innovation and industry trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Rebecca|title=BAI Beacon|url=http://www.technologyrecord.com/Article/bai-beacon-56121#.V_6DW2U5mhY|website=TheRecord|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''F.I.V. Edoardo Bianchi S.p.A''', commonly known as '''Bianchi''' ({{IPA-it|ˈbjaŋki|}}) is the world's oldest [[bicycle]] manufacturing company still in existence, having pioneered the use of equal-sized wheels with pneumatic rubber tires.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The company was founded in [[Italy]] in 1885 and in addition to bicycles it produced [[motorcycle]]s from 1897 to 1967. In 1955 the joint-venture [[Autobianchi]] was created together with [[Fiat]] and [[Pirelli]] for the manufacturing of cars – Autobianchi was subsequently sold to Fiat in 1969.

Throughout its modern era, Bianchi has been associated with the Italian [[Giro d'Italia]] and [[Tour de France]] winners, [[Fausto Coppi]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=December 2000 |title=Design Classics |url= |magazine=Cycling Plus |location=United Kingdom |publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]] |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Pantani]] and [[Felice Gimondi]].

==Bianchi bicycles==
Edoardo Bianchi, a 21-year-old medical instrument maker, started his bicycle-manufacturing business in a small shop at 7 Via Nirone, [[Milan]] in 1885. Bianchi pioneered the front-wheel caliper brake. Since May 1997, the company has been part of [[Cycleurope Group]], which is owned by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] company of [[Grimaldi Industri AB]]. Bianchi and [[Ferrari]] announced in July 2017 a partnership to produce a new range of 'high-end' models. The SF01 was their first collaboration bike.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mxlynx.blogspot.com/2017/08/bianchi-ferrari-sf01-eurobike.html Bianchi lancia ad Eurobike il progetto "Bianchi for Scuderia Ferrari" | Mxlynx.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bianchi reputation began when the company sponsored Giovanni Tommasello, the winner of the Grand Prix de Paris sprint competition in 1899. Fifteen years later it was making 45,000 [[bicycles]], 1,500 [[motorcycle]]s and 1,000 [[car]]s a year. In 1935 Bianchi sponsored [[Costante Girardengo]], one of the first Italian stars on the road, and its bicycle sales rose to 70,000 a year.&lt;ref name="L'Equipe, France, 26 July 2003"&gt;L'Equipe, France, 26 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 [[Fausto Coppi]] won the [[Paris–Roubaix]] on a Bianchi equipped with what was later named the [[Campagnolo]] Paris–Roubaix [[derailleur]] gear, for which Bianchi bicycles featured the necessary special [[Dropout (bicycle part)|drop-outs]] until 1954. He won the race by two and a half minutes on a bicycle equipped with Universal brakes, Bianchi steel handlebars and stem, a Regina chain and a four-speed [[freewheel]] with shaped teeth. It also had Nisi rims, Campagnolo hubs and [[Pirelli]] tyres. It was made for sale only in 57 and 59&amp;nbsp;cm, smaller than the bike that Coppi used.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  A variation known as the Campione Del Mondo followed Coppi's win in the 1953 world championship.

Riders of different eras have been associated with Bianchi including [[Felice Gimondi]], who continues his association with the company.&lt;ref name="L'Equipe, France, 26 July 2003" /&gt;  Recent riders include [[Danilo Di Luca]], [[Mario Cipollini]], [[Gianni Bugno]], [[Laurent Fignon]], [[Marco Pantani]], [[Moreno Argentin]] and [[Jan Ullrich]].  Until 2007, Bianchi was a cosponsor of the [[UCI ProTour]] team, [[Liquigas]]. It did not supply teams from 1959 to 1964 nor from 1967 to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Wielermagazine, Netherlands, undated cutting&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, for the 2012 season, it was announced that Bianchi had been signed to a two-year deal to co-sponsor and supply bikes to the UCI ProTeams [[Vacansoleil-DCM]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/stronger-vacansoleil-ready-for-second-year-in-worldtour Stronger Vacansoleil Ready For Second Year In WorldTour | Cyclingnews.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Androni Giocattoli-Venezuela]]. These sponsorships continued in 2013 and for 2014, with [[Vacansoleil-DCM]] ceasing to exist, Bianchi again supplied [[Androni Giocattoli-Venezuela]] for a further year, and the then new [[Belkin Pro Cycling Team]]. In 2015, the latter became [[Team LottoNL-Jumbo]] and Bianchi's only UCI Pro Continental sponsored road team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bianchi.com/Au/news/news_detail.aspx?newsidmaster=199295|Bianchi.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015124952/http://www.bianchi.com/Au/news/news_detail.aspx?newsidmaster=199295 |date=October 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most demanding rider may have been Pantani. Sara Mercante, head of Bianchi's research and development, said: "Pantani had very specific ideas about what he wanted. He had 30 different frames a year from us—with different angles and weights on each one. He changed his bike after every ride. I'd go and meet him during the [[Giro d'Italia]] and the Tour and discuss improvements with him. He'd ask to have the geometry changed by, say, half a degree, just to make sure the bike was absolutely perfect. He'd want different angles for different races. He's ask us to tweak the length of the top tube by a millimetre or by half a degree. Pantani was quite obsessive."&lt;ref&gt;Framemakers' guide, Procycling, UK, undated cutting&lt;/ref&gt;

Bianchi is currently headed up by CEO Bob Ippolito, who before joining Bianchi was the Executive Vice President and General Manager of Pacific Cycle, headquartered in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]].

==Colour==

Bianchi bicycles are traditionally painted [[Celeste (colour)|Celeste]], a [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]] also known as Bianchi Green, (and sometimes, incorrectly [[Tiffany Blue]], a trademarked colour).  Contradictory myths say Celeste is the colour of the Milan sky, the eye colour of a former queen of Italy for whom Edoardo Bianchi made a bicycle (the crowned eagle of the company logo is an adaptation of the former royal crest) and that it was a mixture of surplus military paint. The shade has changed over the years, sometimes more blue, then more green.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Bianchi USA==
Bianchi USA is the [[United States]] division of Bianchi based in [[Hayward, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0923/p11s03-algn.html |title=For hard-core biking, try one gear, no brakes / The Christian Science Monitor |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=September 23, 2005 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bicycleretailer.com/north-america/2012/11/29/new-office-bianchi-usa#.UMRMEIVygtE "New office for Bianchi USA", ''Bicycle Retailer'', November 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; It oversees the production of bicycles built in [[Taiwan]] and in Italy for the worldwide market.

==Motor production==

[[File:ZweiRadMuseumNSU Bianchi ES250.JPG|thumb|A Bianchi ES 250 motorcycle of 1937]]
Bianchi also took part in motorcycle races, where one of its first riders was [[Tazio Nuvolari]], whom [[Ferdinand Porsche]] called "the greatest driver of the past, the present, and the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicracing.com/top100.cfm?otdother%3D2%26driverID%3D1353%26selMonth%3D3%26 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616100546/http://www.historicracing.com/top100.cfm?otdother=2&amp;driverID=1353&amp;selMonth=3&amp; |archivedate=2009-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company began making trucks in the 1930s and supplied the Italian army during [[World War II]] . It was that that brought the end of production shortly after peace returned because the factory had been so heavily bombed.

Bianchi continued with motorcycles, particularly the 125cc Bianchina and the Aquilotto, an auxiliary motor for a conventional bicycles. Bianchi took on [[Lino Tonti]] as its research engineer in 1959. It produced 250, 350 and 500cc machines and took part in grands prix in 1960. The company also produced a model for the [[Italian army]] and a civilian scooter, the Orsetto 80. [[Piaggio]] bought out Bianchi Motorcycles in 1967.

In 1955, Bianchi created a car brand, [[Autobianchi]], in collaboration with [[Pirelli]] and [[Fiat]]. The three turned out only a handful of models, almost exclusively small cars, the biggest being the short-lived [[Autobianchi A111]]. Traditionally, Autobianchi motor vehicles cost more than equivalent Fiat models.

Fiat used Autobianchi to test new production concepts such as [[glass fibre]] and front-wheel drive. Eventually, Fiat bought out Autobianchi and integrated it with [[Lancia]]. Autobianchi are no longer in production beginning from 1995 when, everywhere except Italy, its [[Autobianchi Y10|Y10 hatchback]] was rebranded a Lancia.

A '''braiding machine''' is device, which interlaces at least three strands of [[yarn]]s or wires to form a [[rope]]
[[Hose#Reinforced rubber hose|reinforced hose]], covered [[power cord]]s, and some types of [[lace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931672549|title=Braiding technology for textiles|last=Yordan|first=Kyosev,|date=2015-01-01|publisher=WP, Woodhead Publ./Elsevier|isbn=9780857091352|oclc=931672549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wbg"&gt;{{cite journal|last-author-amp=yes|year=2006|title=Braiding Processes and Machines|publisher=Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

==Maypole braiders==
[[File:Maypole dancing in Cape Town.jpg|thumb|Alternate dancers traveling in opposite directions around a maypole.  Notice how dancers use their arms to raise the ribbons to allow other dancers to pass by.]]
Maypole braiders work by a circular braiding process. They were well suited to be driven by the steam engines of the industrial revolution and were common by the beginning of the 20th century being easily powered by electric motors.   
Common types of braiding machines work in much the same way as the process of decorating a [[maypole]]. At the start of decorating a maypole an even number of ribbons tied to the top of the pole. A group of people form a ring about the base of the pole and take a ribbon in hand. Half the people then travel clockwise and the other half counter clockwise. When the people pass one another they pass alternately to the right and to the left. This results in a downward forming braid on the pole. As the braid works its way down the pole, the ribbons become shorter and the angle of forming changes as the braid works lower on the pole. On a standard braiding machine, the supply lines are a constant angle and at a constant tension and hence the output braided product is uniform.

==Process==
#Fibers are spun into yarn.
#One or more yarns are twisted together to form a strand.
#Strands are wound onto [[bobbin]]s.
#Bobbins are mounted on carriers.
#Carriers are mounted onto a braiding machine, where the braiding takes place.

==Horn gear braider==
[[File:Braiding machine arbetes museum.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A horn gear braiding machine at the Arbetets Museum (Museum of Work) in Norrköping, Sweden]]
In a horn gear braider, bobbins of thread pass one another to the left and right on pseudo-sinusoidal tracks, a peg at their bases is driven by a series of so called ''horn gears''.  A horn gear consists of a notched disk driven by a [[Spur gear#Spur|spur gear]] below on the same shaft.  These gears lie below the track plate that the bobbin carriers ride on, and an even number of gears must be used as there are always an even number of bobbins. The gears must be driven at multiple points on machines with two or more bobbin sets and cross-shafts are used.

On a vertically oriented machine, the braided thread is taken up above the machine and height and diameter of a guide ring determines the characteristics of the braided product to some degree. On horizontal oriented machines, the braiding track plate and associated bobbins are turned through 90 degrees. This enables large stiff braided cables to be output horizontally so a tall factory building is not required.

Braiding machines, although they have an apparent complex movement of bobbins, are mechanically simple and robust. Modern versions are very reliable and consequently can operate for many hours or even days without attention. This has enabled factories with hundreds of machines to be operated by just a few workers, reducing wages, and making products cheaper and/or profits higher. These modern machines have incorporated electronic controls with automated controls. Although ropes, cords and fishing line are still the core products of most braiding companies there are many other products including webbing, cable shielding and automotive products such as reinforced brake lines.

Some machines use a different system, where the motion of the thread carriers resemble a Teacup Ride.

===Square braider===
[[File:Braiding machine patent.pdf|thumb|400px|An annotated patent for a square braider.  Colors and labels were added for Wikipedia.]]
The illustration on the right shows the base plate of a horn gear braider specifically designed to create a square braid from eight strands of yarn.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference
 | number = 4803909
 | y =1989 
 | m = 
 | d = 
 | inventor = Michael F. Smith
 | title =Apparatus and method for automated braiding of square rope and rope product produced thereby 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The braider has two tracks, one shaded in green and one shaded in red.  Four bobbin carriers slide along each track.  The four carriers shaded in green travel around the green track in the counter-clockwise direction, and the four carriers shaded in red travel around the red track in the clockwise direction.  As the two tracks cross over, the strands twist around each other, making a braid.

The carriers are pushed by four horn gears in the base plate.  Each of the horn gears has a gear and a horn on a common shaft. The gears intermesh with each other, with alternate gears traveling in opposite directions.  Each horn has four slots for pushing a bobbin carrier.  The bobbin carriers get passed along from one horn to the next as they make their way along a track.

== Wardwell Rapid Braider==
[[File:Wardwell.png|thumb|left|Patent for Wardwell Rapid Braider]]
The speed of a horn gear braider is limited by the effort needed to force bobbin carriers to follow a [[serpentine shape|serpentine path]].  In 1922, Simon W. Wardwell solved this problem by moving the strands of yarn, instead of the carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference
 | number = 1423587
 | y =1922 
 | m = 
 | d = 
 | inventor =Simon W. Wardwell 
 | title = Yarn retriever for braiding or similar machines 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The carriers follow a simple circular path, while lever arms driven by a cam guide the strands of yarn to their correct places.  Because a lever arm has much less [[mass]] than a bobbin and carrier, the machine can run faster.

In a [[YouTube]] video of a Wardwell braider, the cam is painted yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buVMO4tRjQU |accessdate=February 25, 2016 |author=YMCORP |title=Cam Ring Wardwell Slow Speed |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these machines run smooth and fast, they must be built for a particular type braid, and are not easily reconfigured.

==Track and column braider==
In a track and column braider, bobbin carriers follow tracks in a two dimensional array of rows and columns, instead of circular paths defined by horn gears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Soares | first = Carlos | title = Mechanics of composite materials and structures | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Dordrecht Boston, MA | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780792358701 | DOI=10.1007/978-94-011-4489-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automatic high speed braiding machines  ==
Automatic high speed braiding machines are normally equipped with [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC), automatic mass adjusting and motor-driven yarn feeders, so that to make the operation simple and easy. Meanwhile, compared to normal braiding machines, high speed braiding machines save costs from labour, electricity and time.

Products from braiding machines are everywhere in life, like [[shipbuilding]], [[defense (military)|national defense]] industry, port operations, high pressure and magnet shielding wires and pipes, decorative ropes and belts, shoelace, elastic ropes and belts, cables, etc.

There are non-traditional machines that have a grid array of thread carriers that under computer control can braid over complex shapes.

'''''Cafeteria Nipponica''''' is a [[simulation game|simulation]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Kairosoft]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems. It was released in April, 2012. The game places the player in control of a restaurant, which they must build up to a high quality [[restaurant chain]]. The game met with mixed reviews, with many reviewers noting that there were better Kairosoft simulation games.

[[File:C and H Sugar factory.jpg|thumb|C&amp;H Pure Cane Sugar refinery in [[Crockett, California]]]]
'''California and Hawaiian Sugar Company''' ('''C&amp;H Sugar''') is an American [[sugar]] processing and distribution company. Originally organized as a co-operative in 1921, it encountered a severe decline in sugar markets and passed through a series of owners in the last half of the 20th Century. In 2017, its Crockett, California refinery processed its last shipment of Hawaiian sugar but continues to produce Pure Cane Sugar sourced from other locations. The C&amp;H Sugar Crockett Refinery employs more than 450 people and produces 14% of the nation's cane sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibabuzz.com/westcounty/2016/03/18/crockett-ch-will-douse-the-lights-on-its-famous-sign-for-an-hour-saturday/|title=Crockett: C&amp;H will douse the lights on its famous sign for an hour – West County|website=www.ibabuzz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The California and Hawaiian Sugar Company was founded in 1906 and operated from 1921 to 1993 as an [[agricultural cooperative]] marketing association owned by the member [[sugar]] companies in [[Hawaii]]. Its headquarters are in [[Crockett, California|Crockett]] under the [[Carquinez Bridge]] in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Contra Costa County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chsugar.com/Consumer/contact.php Contact Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323113844/http://www.chsugar.com/consumer/contact.php |date=2010-03-23 }}." C&amp;H Sugar. Retrieved on April 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDPMap"&gt;"[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US0617274&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on Crockett CDP, California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606084253/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US0617274&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on |date=2011-06-06 }}." [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. Retrieved on April 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the member companies sold their interests in C&amp;H to [[Alexander &amp; Baldwin]] in [[Honolulu]], and the refining company's status changed from a cooperative to a corporation. Alexander &amp; Baldwin subsequently sold its majority share to an investment group, Citicorp Venture Capital (CVC) in 1998, retaining a 40% common stock interest in the recapitalized company. [[American Sugar Refining]] bought C&amp;H in 2006, merging it with its other sugar operations.{{efn|ASR, better known as [[Domino Foods|Domino Sugar]]), a company owned by [[Florida Crystals]] and the [[Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida]]. Florida Crystals is a privately held company that is part of [[FLO-SUN]], a sugar empire of the [[The Fanjul Brothers|Fanjul family]] whose origins trace to Spanish-Cuban sugar plantations of the early 19th century.}} C&amp;H revenues and profits continued to decline into the 21st Century.

==Products and market==
The C&amp;H brand is one of the leading sugar brands in the company's markets (where it is not the de facto leader), largely due to advertisements stressing their exclusive use of [[sugarcane|cane sugar]], believed by some to be superior to sugar from the [[sugar beet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sugar, Sugar: Cane and beet share the same chemistry but act differently in the kitchen |author= Miriam Morgan |date= March 31, 1999 |newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle |url= http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/SUGAR-SUGAR-Cane-and-beet-share-the-same-2939081.php |accessdate= 2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; C&amp;H sells a variety of cane sugar products, including white granulated, brown, baker's (superfine), powdered and organic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= C&amp;H Pure Cane Sugar - Explore our sugar products |work= official web site |url= http://www.chsugar.com/Consumer/our-products.html  |year= 2011 |accessdate= 2012-09-30  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

C&amp;H's primary market is west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the United States, although some sugar is sold in various east coast stores. A number of high-profile restaurants, bakeries and hotels have C&amp;H sugar shipped directly to them where it is not available through local distribution channels. More than 70 types, grades, and package sizes are sold within the two major groupings of grocery and industrial products. About {{convert|700000|short ton|metric ton}} of sugar per year are processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= C&amp;H Pure Cane Sugar |work= official web site |url= http://www.chsugar.com |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2010-01-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery at [[Crockett, California]], refines, packages, and markets all of the output from Hawaii's sugar factories, such as the remaining factory of Alexander &amp; Baldwin, the Hawaiian Commercial &amp; Sugar Company on [[Maui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= HC&amp;S - Operations |publisher= Hawaiian Commercial &amp; Sugar Company |work= web site |url= http://www.hcsugar.com/factory_operations.shtml#about |accessdate= 2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, citing a loss of profitability, the Hawaiian Commercial &amp; Sugar Company harvested its last Hawaiian sugar cane crop, and will cease refining operations there.

'''Charles Bosanquet''' (23 July 1769 – 20 June 1850) was an English official and writer.

==Life==
He was born at Forest House, [[Essex]], the second son of Samuel Bosanquet and Eleanor Hunter. He was educated at [[Newcome's School]] and then in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Bradbury and Nicholas Penny, ''The Picture Collecting of Lord Northwick: Part I'', The Burlington Magazine Vol. 144, No. 1193 (Aug. 2002), pp. 485–496, at p. 486. Published by: The Burlington Magazine Publications Ltd. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/889635&lt;/ref&gt; He married Charlotte Anne Holford on 1 June 1796 and fathered seven children, three of whom survived him.

He served as sub-governor of the [[South Sea Company]] from 1808–38, and governor from 1838–50. From 1823–36 he was chairman of the exchequer bill office. He served as Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Northumberland, and was [[High Sheriff of Northumberland]] in 1828. In 1819 he was lieutenant-colonel of light horse volunteers, later rising to colonel. He maintained a London residence at the Firs, Hampstead, and spent his later years at his estate of [[Rock Hall, Northumberland|Rock Hall]] near [[Alnwick]] in Northumberland. He died there on 20 June 1850, and is buried in its church.

==Economic works==
Between 1806 and 1807 Bosanquet produced three short works on commercial themes:

#''Letter on the Proposition submitted to the Government for taking the Duty on Muscavado Sugar ad valorem'' (1806?).
#''A Letter to W. Manning, Esq., M.P., on the Depreciation of the West India Property'' (1807?). In this work Bosanquet blamed the depreciation on ill-considered taxes and other restrictions placed on the colony. He proposed that British breweries should use colonial sugar and that the British navy should use colonial rum.
#''Thoughts on the Value to Great Britain of Commerce in general, and of the Colonial Trade in particular'' (1807?), in which he pointed out the benefits yielded by the West India trade.
   
In 1810 Bosanquet published his most important work, ''Practical Observations on the Report of the Bullion-Committee''. In it he criticised the Report as being “altogether at variance with (the opinions) of the persons selected for examination,” of relying on propositions that “are not generally true, and do not therefore form a solid foundation for the abstract reasoning of the Report,” and of relying upon facts that “are erroneously stated; and, when corrected, lead to opposite conclusions.”

Inflationary pressure in early 1809 had prompted David Ricardo to write three letters to the Morning Chronicle, the first of which appeared on 29 August (Ricardo’s first published work on economics). The public attention aroused by these letters and subsequent pamphlets led Parliament to appoint a select Committee to “Inquire into the cause of the high price of bullion, and to take into consideration the state of the circulating medium, and of the exchanges between Great Britain and foreign parts.”

The Committee, along with Ricardo, took the ‘Bullionist’ position. It stated that inflation had resulted from over-issue of currency, primarily by the Bank of England but also by country banks; and that as a means of preventing over-issue, the Bank of England should resume convertibility of the pound into gold.

Bosanquet held to the ‘Anti-Bullionist’ (or ‘real bills’) position, which was that over-issue would be avoided if banks issued paper money only in exchange for “solid paper, given, as far as we can judge, for real transactions.” Any over-issue of paper money, in the words of the Bank directors, “would revert to us by a diminished application for discounts and advances on government securities.” This latter principle became known as the ‘Law of the Reflux’.
David Ricardo had likened the issues of the Bank of England to a gold mine, insofar as an increased issue of paper money would have the same effect on prices as increased production of gold. Bosanquet countered that the Bank of England issued paper money only on loan, and that since loans must ultimately be repaid, the newly issued paper money would not cause inflation. Newly mined gold, in contrast, did not have to be repaid, and therefore would cause inflation. On these grounds Bosanquet denied the analogy between gold and paper money. 

Ricardo’s ''Reply to Mr. Bosanquet'' (1811) has been described by McCulloch (1845) as “perhaps the best controversial essay that has ever appeared on any disputed question of Political Economy.” In response to Bosanquet’s statement that the supply of currency was adequately limited by the Bank’s policy of making loans only for ‘solid paper’, Ricardo answered that as long as the Bank is willing to lend, borrowers will always exist, so that there is no practical limit to the over-issue of money, unless the Bank either maintains convertibility, or otherwise acts to maintain the quantity of money within reasonable bounds. Ricardo argued that the simple fact of the pound’s depreciation was proof of its over-issue—a circular argument that nevertheless carried the day.

Bosanquet never published a reply to Ricardo, and he has consequently been much abused by historians of economic thought. J.K. Horsefield (1941) wrote of “the lamentable decline from the counsels of Samuel Bosanquet in 1783 to the apologia of Charles Bosanquet in 1810,” while R.S. Sayers (1952) observed that “poor Bosanquet is left cutting a very sorry figure.”
Ricardo’s victory over Bosanquet was in fact far from complete. His arguments concerning money issued on loan were resurrected intact during the Currency School/Banking School debates of the 1840s. The issue has remained unsettled ever since, and featured prominently in the Monetarist/Keynesian debates of the 1960s and 1970s. Beginning in the 1980s, the real-bills viewpoint has seen a small revival of interest (e.g., Sargent (1982), Sproul (1998)). It appears that Bosanquet’s writings, like the man himself, are entitled to more respect than they have received.

{{Companies law}}
{{Business administration}}
'''Commercial law''', also known as '''trade law''', is the body of [[law]] that applies to the rights, relations, and conduct of [[Legal person|persons]] and businesses engaged in [[commerce]], [[merchandising]], [[trade]], and sales.&lt;ref name=cornellcommerciallaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Law: An Overview|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commercial_law|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered to be a branch of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and deals with issues of both [[private law]] and [[public law]].

Commercial law includes within its compass such titles as principal and agent; carriage by land and sea; [[Maritime transport|merchant shipping]]; [[guarantee]]; marine, fire, life, and accident [[insurance]]; bills of exchange, [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable instruments]], [[Contract|contracts]] and partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Commercial Law|volume=6|page=771|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these categories fall within [[Financial law]], an aspected of Commercial law pertaining specifically to financing and the financial markets. It can also be understood to regulate [[corporation|corporate]] [[contract]]s, [[Recruitment|hiring practices]], and the [[manufacturing|manufacture]] and [[sales]] of [[Final good|consumer goods]]. Many countries have adopted [[civil code]]s that contain comprehensive statements of their commercial law.

In the United States, commercial law is the province of both the [[United States Congress]], under its power to regulate interstate commerce, and the states, under their police power. Efforts have been made to create a unified body of commercial law in the United States; the most successful of these attempts has resulted in the general [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adoption]] of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], which has been adopted in all 50 states (with some modification by state legislatures), the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and the U.S. territories.

Various regulatory schemes control how commerce is conducted, particularly ''vis-a-vis'' employees and customers. Privacy laws, safety laws (e.g., the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] in the United States), and food and drug laws are some examples.

The '''Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work''' was adopted in 1998, at the 86th International Labour Conference. It is a statement made by the [[International Labour Organization]] "that all Members, even if they have not ratified the [[ILO Conventions|Conventions]] in question, have an obligation arising from the very fact of membership in the Organization to respect, to promote and to realize, in [[good faith]] and in accordance with the Constitution, the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of those Conventions".

==Core conventions==
{{main|List of ILO Conventions}}
There are eight core conventions, which cover collective bargaining, forced labour, child labour and discrimination. They require,

'''Downtown Ottawa''' ({{lang-fr|Centre-Ville d'Ottawa}}) is the central area of [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Like other downtowns it is the commercial and economic centre of the city. It is sometimes referred to as the Central Business District and contains Ottawa's financial district.  It is bordered by the [[Ottawa River]] to the north, the [[Rideau Canal]] to the east, Gloucester Street to the south and [[Bronson Avenue (Ottawa)|Bronson Avenue]] to the west. This area and the residential neighbourhood to the south are also known locally as 'Centretown'. The total population of the area is 4,876 (2016 Census).&lt;ref&gt;(Census tract number 5050048.00) http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&amp;T=1601&amp;SR=51&amp;S=94&amp;O=A&amp;RPP=25&amp;PR=0&amp;CMA=505&amp;CSD=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:East Block and Langevin Block.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Ottawa is dominated by government buildings such as [[Parliament Hill]] (left) and [[Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council|Langevin Block]] (right).]]
Downtown Ottawa is dominated by government buildings, including [[Parliament Hill]] and the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]]. Most prominent buildings are situated along [[Wellington Street (Ottawa)|Wellington]], [[Sparks Street|Sparks]] and [[Elgin Street (Ottawa)|Elgin]] streets. Most of the buildings are office towers containing the various government departments. While most of Ottawa's [[high tech]] industry is based elsewhere it also has a significant presence in the downtown core. The downtown also contains a number of [[apartment]]s, [[hotel]]s, and [[condominium]]s as well as the older single family homes and townhouses along its edges.

From Wellington to [[Laurier Avenue|Laurier]], Elgin Street is the site of several landmarks, the [[Chateau Laurier]], the [[National Arts Centre]], [[Lord Elgin Hotel]], [[Place Bell|Place Bell Canada]], the [[Ottawa Courthouse]], and [[Ottawa City Hall]]. Other prominent buildings include [[World Exchange Plaza]] office and retail complex, encompassing a whole city block on the south-west corner of Queen and Metcalfe, featuring the 'clock ball' on top, and [[Place de Ville]], a complex incorporating four office buildings and two large hotels on two city blocks, with all buildings interconnected through an underground retail concourse. There are also many prominent heritage buildings along Sparks Street.
[[File:Buidingsottawa3.jpg|thumb|Until the 1960s, the height of [[high-rise buildings|high-rises]] in Downtown Ottawa was limited by legislation. After the limit was removed, several high-rises exceeding {{convert|150|m|ft}} have been built.]] 
The towers of downtown Ottawa are not as tall as those in other cities, as legislation prevented buildings being built taller than 150 feet until the 1960s, so as not to overshadow the Parliament Buildings and the [[Peace Tower]] (similar to [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[Heights of Buildings Act of 1910|Heights of Buildings Act]]). Today, several buildings are taller than the Peace Tower, with the tallest being the 29-storey [[Place de Ville]] (Tower C) at {{convert|112|m}}, which was built above the height limit, and several hotels being slightly shorter but with 30-35 stories.

The downtown employs about 100,000 people and currently holds around 20 million square feet of office space.

===Surrounding areas===
East of the canal, but west of King Edward Avenue, including the [[Rideau Centre]] and the [[Byward Market]], is also normally considered downtown, and is referred to locally as 'Lowertown' or [[Lower Town]]. The residential neighbourhoods around the central business district are also generally referred to as being downtown. These include [[Centretown]] to the south and [[Sandy Hill, Ottawa|Sandy Hill]] and [[Lower Town]] to the east. North of the Ottawa River the centre of [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]] can be considered an extension of Ottawa's downtown.

==Transportation==
===Roads===
====Prominent streets====
[[Image:Downtown Ottawa.png|thumb|right|275px|Map of downtown Ottawa with several prominent streets named (from [[OpenStreetMap]]).]]
Downtown Ottawa has a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] pattern of [[street]]s, aligned either east-west or north-south with a number of the streets being one way.

From east to west, the prominent streets are [[Elgin Street (Ottawa)|Elgin Street]], [[Metcalfe Street (Ottawa)|Metcalfe Street]], [[O'Connor Street]], [[Bank Street (Ottawa)|Bank Street]], [[Kent Street (Ottawa)|Kent Street]] and [[Bronson Avenue]].

Starting from the east:
* [[Elgin Street (Ottawa)|Elgin Street]], a ceremonial route for the daily [[Ceremonial Guard|Changing of the Guard]] and site of many prominent buildings and landmarks, and a restaurant district south of Laurier Avenue,
* Metcalfe and O'Connor, both of which are busy multi-lane one-way streets,
* [[Bank Street (Ottawa)|Bank Street]] runs through the heart of downtown and is a prominent retail centre,
* [[Kent Street (Ottawa)|Kent Street]], another busy multi-lane one way with high traffic volumes,
* Lyon, the edge of the central business district, with a wall of towering office buildings and hotels to the east and shorter buildings and parking lots to the west,
* Bay and Percy, are one way local residential streets, and,
* [[Bronson Avenue]] is a major avenue that forms the western edge of downtown.
[[File:Sparks Street, Ottawa (14579934199).jpg|thumb|[[Sparks Street]] is a [[pedestrian mall]] in Downtown Ottawa, closed off to vehicle traffic.]]
The northernmost east-west street that crosses downtown is [[Wellington Street (Ottawa)|Wellington Street]], site of the parliamentary precinct, National Library and Archives, and Supreme Court. It is a major four-lane thoroughfare. To the east, it connects to Rideau Street, and to the west, the Ottawa River Parkway.

South of Wellington is [[Sparks Street]], most of which is a pedestrian mall closed to vehicles. The heritage district runs from Bank to Elgin, with CBC broadcast studios at Metcalfe and Sparks.

The streets to the south are dominated by office and hotel towers: Queen Street, Albert Street, Slater Street, Laurier Avenue and Gloucester Street.

The City of Ottawa zoning restricts and regulates development to allow high-rises north of Gloucester St. and affords heritage designation to some areas and buildings.

====Other streets====
[[File:Bank Street Ottawa.jpg|thumb|[[Bank Street (Ottawa)|Bank Street]] is a major north-south road that runs through Downtown Ottawa.]]

Albert and Slater carry the [[Ottawa Rapid Transit|Transitway]] through downtown. A new 12.5 kilometre light rail line, called the [[Confederation Line]], is currently under construction. Part of it will tunnel under downtown's Queen street and travel east to [[Rideau Street]] and turn south under [[Nicholas Street]] to eventually resurface south of [[Laurier Avenue|Laurier Avenue East]]. Construction of the 2.1 billion dollar line, including the 2.5 kilometer subway tunnel should end in time for the 2017 celebration of Confederation's 150th anniversary. The line should be operational by 2018. It will include three subway stations; one between Lyon and [[Kent Street (Ottawa)|Kent Street]]s, integrated with [[Place de Ville]], the next station will be built between [[O'Connor Street]] and [[Metcalfe Street (Ottawa)|Metcalfe Street]] and one under Rideau Street with multiple entrances in the [[Rideau Centre]].

==Biography==
Born in 1984, Elina Berglund was raised in [[Malmö]] in southern Sweden.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Her father is a professor of medicine but both he any her mother are entrepreneurs, running several companies together.&lt;ref name=visma&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vismaspcs.se/ditt-foretagande/visma-infoline/reportage/elina-berglund|title=Idag vågar jag drömma stort|author=Rito, Mimmi|publisher=Visma|accessdate=20 December 2017 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began to be interested in physics at the age of five when her father talked to her about the universe.&lt;ref name=we/&gt; She went on to study engineering physics at the [[Faculty of Engineering (LTH), Lund University|Lund Institute of Technology]], receiving a master of science degree in 2008. She then spent three years at the [[University of Geneva]], culminating in a PhD in elementary particle physics in 2011. In parallel with her studies, she collaborated in the [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS project]] at [[CERN]], becoming a member of one of the teams searching for the [[Higgs boson]] particle at CERN.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/careers/working-life/articles/page_69752.html|title=Once a physicist: Elina Berglund |publisher=IOP: Institute of Physics|accessdate=19 December 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One month after the announcement of [[Higgs boson]] discovery in the summer of 2012, Berglund left CERN as the experiment facility was closing for an upgrade over the next two years. She married her physicist colleague Raoul Scherwitzl and the couple started to think about raising a family. After deciding to stop using the contraceptive pill, she began to analyse her body temperature in order to reveal the days when she was most fertile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hippocraticpost.com/fertility/cern-natural-fertility/|title=From CERN to natural fertility|author=Elina Berglund Scherwitzl|publisher=''The Hippocratic Post''|accessdate=19 December 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I wanted to give my body a break from the pill," she explained, "but I couldn't find any good forms of natural birth control, so I wrote an algorithm for myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/fertility-natural-cycles-app-contraception|title=Can an algorithm replace the pill? Natural Cycles app wants to do just that|author=Manthorpe, Rowland|publisher=''Wired''|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her husband's encouragement, this led her to develop a fertility app, suitable for use by any woman.&lt;ref name=iop/&gt;

The couple gave up their physics jobs and moved to Sweden to concentrate on developing and marketing the app, founding the company Natural Cycles in 2013. They successfully used the app to plan the birth of their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/99a4be5e-5fa5-11e4-986c-00144feabdc0|title=Scheduling sex with an app|publisher=''Financial Times''|date=4 November 2014|accessdate=20 December 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although they began to market the product in 2014 with approval from the Swedish Medicinal Products Agency, they ran into trouble the following year when the agency revoked approval, forcing them to remove any reference to contraception in marketing the app.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40629994|title=The Swedish physicist revolutionising birth control||author=Savage, Maddy|publisher=BBC|date=7 August 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in February 2017 that they finally received approval from the German inspection and certification organisation [[Technischer Überwachungsverein|Tüv Süd]], allowing them to market the product throughout Europe. It was the first time a technical device of this type had been approved for contraception anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.va.se/nyheter/2017/02/08/svenske-karnfysikern-blir-forst-i-varlden-med-godkand-preventiv-app/|title=Svenske kärnfysikern blir först i världen med godkänd preventiv-app|publisher=''VA''|date=8 February 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by Mimmi Rito of Visma whether she intended to spend her life working on the app, she replied: "No, but I think I will always work with something involving data, analysing data, drawing conclusions, applying data to something or other. It does not need to be physical, it does not need to be contraception, but that's the common denominator now and I think it will always continue to be."&lt;ref name=visma/&gt;

==Awards==
In 2015, Berglund received the Women in Tech Foundation's Entrepreneurial Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressreleases/the-women-in-tech-foundation-presents-the-wit-award-winners-for-2015-1127199|title=The Women in Tech Foundation presents the WIT-award winners for 2015|publisher=MyNewsDesk|date=6 March 2015|accessdate=20 December 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emil Stock''' (1868–1951) was a [[Croatia]]n industrialist and businessman.

Stock was born in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] on 3 August 1868 to Abramo and Gentile ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Valenzin) Stock, as one of 12 children. Stock's paternal [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Jews in Croatia|Jewish]] family originated from [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[German Empire]], while his maternal [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] Jewish family arrived in Split during [[Napoleonic era]]. His father moved to Split in 1844 from [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]. Stock graduated from university with a civil engineering degree. After graduation he built a cement factory near [[Solin]], and also a factory of asbestos-cement products. At the beginning of the 1900s Stock became involved in the production of [[alcoholic]] beverages. In 1905 Stock , along  with [[Vid Morpurgo]], another Croatian Jewish industrialist, founded the alcoholic beverages company "Morpurgo, Stock e Comp." Stock 84 was being produced in the Split-based old Morpurgo factory. The new company obtained the franchise to construct a new [[liquor]] factory on the outskirts of Split (today part of the city). The factory concession was subsequently challenged by the municipal prefect [[Vicko Mihaljević]] , ostensibly due to environmental issues, while some attributed the problem to a political conflict between the owners and the municipal authorities. Disappointed  by the withdrawal of the concession, Stock and Morpurgo went on to build the factory in [[Rovinj]], Croatia. The business was prosperous so Stock and his partner decided to build a second plant in Trieste, where Stock's brother [[Lionello Stock|Lionel]] already owned the steam wine distillery "Distilleria a vapore Camis &amp; Stock" (now [[Fernet Stock]]) which produced cognac "Medicinal". Stock died in Trieste in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bašić|first=Želimir|coauthors=|title=Prva tvornica "Stock" bila je u Splitu|pages=|publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|date=|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20030308/feljton01.asp|accessdate=2013-05-28|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Šilović|first=Meri|coauthors=|title=Stock je zapravo "splitsko dite"|pages=|publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|date=|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20061113/mozaik01.asp|accessdate=2013-05-28|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Stock, Emilio|pages=|publisher=[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|date=|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/emilio-stock_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/|accessdate=2013-05-31|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Entrepreneur''''' is a 1997 [[Business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]].

== Gameplay ==
The game sees the player build a successful company and [[Monopoly|dominate the market]] through [[corporate warfare]]. Players need to research, manufacture, and market their products better than their [[Business competition|competitors]], and when in financial trouble they can seek help from criminal figures.

== Critical reception ==

'''''Europe Tonight''''' was an evening television business news programme which was broadcast on [[CNBC Europe]] from 2004 to 2009. The programme was most recently presented by [[Guy Johnson (journalist)|Guy Johnson]] and Anna Edwards.

==History==
The original ''Europe Tonight'' was a 30-minute market review broadcast on weekdays at 6:30pm CET until 2001. The programme was relaunched in September 2004, and replaced '''''[[Frankfurt Closing Bell]]''''', which was shown at 8pm CET and co-presented from the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] by [[Silvia Wadhwa]] and by [[Simon Hobbs]] in [[London]]. Until 2004, the Deutsche Börse remained open later than the other European markets - until 20:00 CET. After the hours of electronic trading on the [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]] system were changed so as to stop at 17:30 CET, Wadhwa remained as co-host of the new ''Europe Tonight''.

The programme time, previously filled by updates on late German trade was replaced by interviews with Frankfurt-based strategists, commentators and [[Chief Executive Officer|CEOs]]. The remainder of this version of the programme was essentially an update of '''''[[European Closing Bell]]''''', in which Hobbs reviewed the day's business events and covered any late breaking news.

==2007 revamp==
The programme length was extended from 30 minutes to one hour on 26 March 2007 as part of schedule changes at the network, which also saw ''European Closing Bell'' have its runtime halved. Johnson was installed as presenter, the show was given a new title sequence and its theme music was changed from that formerly used by ''Closing Bell'' to that used by ''[[Street Signs (CNBC)|Street Signs]]'' before December 2005. The format of the programme was heavily revamped, gaining some of the segments previously contained in the second hour of ''European Closing Bell'', such as a daily ''Guest Investor''.  New features introduced included ''The Editor'', where the [[editing|editor]] of a European business publication discussed how they will be covering notable events, and an update on the U.S. markets which came live from the [[NASDAQ MarketSite]]. Wadhwa no longer acted as co-host of ''Europe Tonight'', but remained a contributor to the show. Anna Martin joined Johnson as co-host of the programme in January 2008, having previously been the show's regular reporter.

The show's timeslot was brought forward by an hour to 7pm CET from 4 February 2008. ''Europe Tonight'' did not return after the 2009 [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas holiday season]].

A '''fishing license''' (US), '''fishing licence''' or '''fishing permit''' is a regulatory or legal mechanism to control [[fishing]]. Licensing is one mechanism of [[fisheries management]] and may be required for either [[commercial fishing|commercial]] or [[recreational fishing]].

==Historical licensing==
[[File:Chinese fishing license from the Qing era in the Baojiashu jiyao (1838).jpg|thumb|Chinese fishing license from the Qing era in the ''Baojiashu jiyao'' (1838)]]

In 1765, the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]] government required all fishing boat operators to obtain a fishing license under the ''aojia'' system that regulated coastal populations. The [[Tanka people|Dan]] boat people of [[Guangdong]] had to acquire a fishing license as early as 1729. The wooden license issued by the government was to be displayed on the bow or stern of a boat. The information on the license consisted of the name and age of the boat's owner, the ship's status as either a fishing or commercial vessel, the home port of the boat, crew and family members on board, the date the license was issued, and the registration number of the license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Antony|first1=Robert J.|title=Elusive Pirates, Pervasive Smugglers Violence and Clandestine Trade in the Greater China Seas|year=2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9789888028115|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the jurisdiction, licenses or permits may be required by a government, a property owner, or both.

===United Kingdom===
The  government requires a [[fishing rod|rod]] licence for anyone over the age of 12 who fishes in [[England]], [[Wales]] or the [[River Esk, Dumfries and Galloway|Border Esk]] area in [[Scotland]] for [[salmon]], [[trout]], freshwater fish, [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] or [[eel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/fishing/38081.aspx |title=Rod Fishing Licence - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Environment Agency |location=UK |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, anyone who fishes in a non-[[estuarine]] [[stream]], [[lake]], or [[canal]] needs a permit from the owner of the fishing rights to the water body, which might be a local [[angling club]], a landowner with [[riparian right]]s, or an organization such as the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/contact-us/faqs/fishing |title=FAQs about fishing at the Canal &amp; River Trust|publisher=Canal &amp; River Trust |location=UK |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], rights to fish in non-tidal freshwater also are owned either by the government or by private entities such as angling club. The ownership of fishing rights in Ireland derives from the [[Plantations of Ireland|confiscation of lands]] by the [[British Crown]] in the 17th century; the boundaries of fishing rights areas typically follow the boundaries of estates granted by the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fisheriesireland.ie/State-Fisheries/history-of-fishing-rights-in-ireland.html |title=History of fishing rights in Ireland |publisher=Inland Fisheries Ireland |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The U.S. state of [[Oregon]] instituted a requirement for commercial fishing licenses in 1899, the same year that the state's [[sturgeon]] fishery had collapsed due to over-harvesting. Oregon began requiring recreational fishing licenses in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/history.asp |title=ODFW History, 1792 - 2000 |publisher=Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Indiana]] began issuing [[hunting license]]s in 1901 and added fishing privileges to its hunting license in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/dnr/fishwild/5446.htm |title=History of Fish &amp; Wildlife |publisher=Indiana Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Pennsylvania]] first issued recreational fishing licenses in 1919. Licenses were required only for nonresidents, and only 50 licenses were issued that first year. In 1922, when the state first required licenses for state residents, over 2,700 nonresident licenses and over 200,000 resident licenses were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fishandboat.com/licsal2.htm |title=Pennsylvania Fishing License Sales, 1919 to Present |publisher=Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== License free fishing ==
Some countries don't require a license for recreational sea fishing, provided that certain rules in regard to fish size, numbers and total catch are followed.

=== Belgium ===
Recreational fishing in the sea does not require a license in certain spots. Size limits need to be followed. Also need to have a freshwater permit when fishing on certain seadocks&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cefas.co.uk/publications/files/sportsfishing-c2362.pdf|title=EU contract FISH/2004/011 on "Sport Fisheries" (or Marine Recreational Fisheries) in the EU|last=Pawson|first=M.

=== Cyprus ===
Sea angling and spear fishing without diving equipment is allowed with no licence. Multiple species including seals, dolphins and turtles are protected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Estonia ===
Estonians have a life-long right to fish with one simple hand line in waters owned by the state and local governments, provided that regulations about species, sizes and seasons are followed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
No license is necessary for recreational sea fishing. There are many detailed regulations about fish species, size limits, fishing methods and prohibited areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nzfishing.com/AboutFishingInNZ/SaltWaterFishinginNZ.htm|title=New Zealand Saltwater Fly Fishing-Sea and saltwater fly fishing in New Zealand-nzfishing|website=nzfishing.com|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blueseafishing.co.nz/faq.htm|title=FAQ's about New Zealand Fishing Holidays in the Bay of Islands with Blue Sea Charters|website=www.blueseafishing.co.nz|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Sea fishing from the coast and from the boat is free for both residents and visitors, although there are minimum fish rules and other regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/great-outdoors/fishing/sea-fishing/|title=Sea fishing|last=|first=|date=|website=Official travel guide to Norway|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
For fishing in public waters no license is necessary. Foreign citizens are allowed to fish without license only with hand gear. License free fishing is legal along the sea coast (in many cases also on private land along the coast) and in Sweden's five largest lakes – [[Vänern]], [[Vättern]], [[Hjälmaren]], [[Mälaren]] and [[Storsjön]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swedenfishing.com/fishing_nature/fishing_rules|title=Fishing rules &amp; ecological angling {{!}} SwedenFishing|website=www.swedenfishing.com|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://relaxfishingsweden.com/en/sport-fishing/sea/|title=The Sea - Relax Fishing Sweden|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swedishepa.se/Enjoying-nature/The-Right-of-Public-Access/This-is-allowed/Hunting-and-fishing/|title=Hunting and fishing|website=Swedish Environmental Protection Agency|language=en|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Fishing licence for sea fishing is not required in most of the places in the United Kingdom. For salmon and sea trout game licence is required regardless of location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/sea-angling|title=Sea angling|date=2015-11-16|website=Northern Ireland direct - government services|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences|title=Buy a fishing rod licence - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In places where saltwater and freshwater cross over the regulations are complicated and licence may be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://britishseafishing.co.uk/do-i-need-a-fishing-licence-for-sea-fishing/|title=Do I Need A Fishing Licence for Sea Fishing? {{!}} Britishseafishing.co.uk|website=britishseafishing.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''flybmi''', legally ''British Midland Regional Limited'' and formerly branded as '''bmi regional''', is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[regional airline]] that operates scheduled passenger services across the UK and Europe. The airline's head office is in [[East Midlands Airport]] in [[North West Leicestershire]], with its registered office at [[Glasgow Airport]]. The airline has operating bases at Aberdeen, Brussels, Bristol, East Midlands, Newcastle and Munich.

flybmi, previously known as bmi Regional, was a former subsidiary of [[British Midland International]] (bmi), which was purchased from [[Lufthansa]] by [[International Airlines Group]] (IAG) on 20 April 2012. Regional was sold to Sector Aviation Holdings in May 2012 and operated as an independent airline from October 2012. In August 2015, the airline became part of a new regional airline group, Airline Investments Limited (AIL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-33766635 | title = New regional airline group created | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate = 2016-03-29 | date = 2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Loganair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flybmi.com/press-release/new-regional-airline-group-created-bmi-regional-and-loganair-now-part-of-ail-group/|title=New regional airline group created: bmi regional and Loganair now part of AIL Group|date=2015-08-03|publisher=BMI Regional|access-date=2016-03-29|quote=}}[http://www.flybmi.com/press-release/new-regional-airline-group-created-bmi-regional-and-loganair-now-part-of-ail-group/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Saab-Fairchild SF-340A(QC), Business Air AN0216713.jpg|thumb|A former Business Air [[Saab 340]]]]
[[File:Saab SF.340A G-GNTC BD Cmtr RWY 23.07.98 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Saab 340 of ''British Midland Commuter'' at [[Manchester Airport]] in July 1998.]]
The airline was established in 1987 as ''Business Air'' and started operations in August 1987. In 1998 Business Air was purchased by British Midland and became British Midland Commuter. In 2001, it changed its name to bmi regional and later to flybmi in December 2017.

As a subsidiary of BMI, BMI Regional known then was owned by [[Michael Bishop (businessman)|Sir Michael Bishop]] (50%), [[Lufthansa]] (30%) and [[Scandinavian Airlines]] (20%). Lufthansa purchased Sir Michael Bishop and SAS' stakes in October 2009, taking full ownership of the airline group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/lufthansa-buys-final-20-of-bmi-1796083.html | title=Lufthansa buys final 20% of BMI | first = Sarah | last = Arnott | date = 1 October 2009 | newspaper = [[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A restructuring of the group was announced the following month, which also affected Regional's operations. A suspension of loss-making routes and capacity adjustments within the group resulted in Regional having a surplus of three Embraer aircraft in 2010, and the company began consultations with staff over possible job losses. The excess aircraft were leased to other carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flybmi.com/bmi/en-gb/about-us/information-centre/press-releases/20091125.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103042128/http://www.flybmi.com/bmi/en-gb/about-us/information-centre/press-releases/20091125.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-03 |title=Flights across the UK and Europe - BMI Regional |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

flybmi was acquired by Sector Aviation Holdings, a company predominantly owned and funded by Stephen and Peter Bond, whose family sold helicopter operator [[Bond Aviation Group]] in 2010.  Sector Aviation Holdings also included the founders of Regional's predecessor Business Air, Ian Woodley and Graeme Ross. The sale was announced on 1 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flybmi.com/en/bottom-menu/press/sale-of-bmi-regional-completed |title=Sale of bmi regional completed |publisher=bmi regional |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224173320/http://www.flybmi.com/en/bottom-menu/press/sale-of-bmi-regional-completed |archivedate=24 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 flybmi was named the most punctual scheduled airline in the UK for the ninth consecutive year. Based on [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] statistics, the airline achieved an on-time performance of over 92% in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Airliner World|date=May 2014|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2018, BMI Regional rebranded to flybmi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blueswandaily.com/bmi-regional-rebrands-as-flybmi/ BMI Regional rebrands as flybmi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate affairs==

===Offices===
[[File:Bmi regional head office.png|thumb|Head office of flybmi at East Midlands Airport]]
Since being founded as Business Air, the company had always had its [[control room|Operations Control Centre]] located at [[Aberdeen Airport|Aberdeen]]. The occupied building was shared with [[CHC Helicopter]] which utilises the hangar space for helicopter maintenance and storage for its North Sea fleet. Aircraft maintenance is still carried out at the shared hangar, however all other functions have been moved elsewhere.

Following the purchase of Regional in May 2012, Sector Aviation Holdings took the decision to relocate the company headquarters from Aberdeen to Pegasus Business Park, on the grounds of [[East Midlands Airport]].  Whilst a subsidiary, some head office functions were provided by British Midland International at its head office in [[Donington Hall]], [[Castle Donington]].

===Operations===
[[File:Bmi (British Midland) offices - geograph.org.uk - 971803.jpg|thumb|Previous operations office at Aberdeen Airport]]
British Midland Regional Limited holds a [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] Type A Operating Licence, permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=183&amp;pagetype=90&amp;pageid=340 | title = Type A Operating Licence Holders |publisher=Civil Aviation Authority |date= |accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since becoming an independent airline, flybmi has changed its callsign from "Kittiwake" to "Midland" and on 28 October 2012 announced that it would be using "BM" as the company IATA airline designator in place of the previously used "BD" which belonged to [[British Midland International]].

The airline's three main operating bases are [[Aberdeen Airport]] and [[Bristol Airport]] in the UK, as well as [[Munich Airport]] in Germany. On 23 January 2014, flybmi launched a new domestic operation in Norway with an aircraft based in Stavanger.  This new service provided the first scheduled direct air link between [[Evenes Airport|Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes]] and [[Stavanger Airport|Stavanger]], however this service no longer operates.

Along with the current operating bases, flybmi previously had numerous bases throughout the [[United Kingdom]] with crew stationed at [[Edinburgh Airport]], [[Glasgow Airport]], [[Leeds Bradford Airport]], [[Manchester Airport]] and [[London Heathrow Airport]]. All of these bases had Regional routes operated from them along with routes on behalf of [[British Midland International]] (BMI), Heathrow which was solely mainline routes. A base at [[Birmingham Airport]] opened during May 2013, but on 28 October 2013 it was announced that following a network review the base would close at the end of December 2013.

Using its [[Embraer Regional Jet|Embraer 145]] aircraft, flybmi previously operated a number of shuttle services on behalf of aircraft manufacturer [[Airbus]]. These linked manufacturing sites at [[Airbus Broughton|Broughton]], [[Filton Aerodrome|Filton]] and [[Toulouse Blagnac International Airport|Toulouse]]. Despite previously having crew based at [[Manchester Airport]] and no scheduled services operating from [[Hawarden Airport|Chester Hawarden]], flybmi based crew at Hawarden for the Airbus shuttle flights. Originally the Airbus shuttle operated to [[Filton Aerodrome]] but following its closure in December 2012, the shuttle operation transferred to [[Bristol Airport|Bristol Lulsgate]] in January 2013. This had no impact on crew as they were already based at Bristol. The contract for these corporate shuttle flights was won by [[Eastern Airways]] and as a result flybmi ceased operating these flights in late 2015.

In early 2014, flybmi commenced a contract to operate a further staff shuttle on behalf of helicopter manufacturer [[AgustaWestland]]. This shuttle was previously operated by [[Eastern Airways]] using an Embraer 135 between [[Milan Malpensa Airport|Milan Malpensa]] and [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]]. In 2015 flybmi chose to operate the route from nearby Bristol Airport instead, therefore enabling them to carry commercial passengers on the route also, as well as upgrading the aircraft type.

In summer 2015 the airline based an Embraer 135 and an Embraer 145 at [[Munich Airport|Munich]] to operate services to [[Bern]], [[Liège]] and [[Rotterdam]] in conjunction with [[Lufthansa]] and replacing [[Lufthansa CityLine]]. This follows the signing of a code-share agreement with Lufthansa in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bmi Regional|journal=Airliner World|date=March 2015|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2015 the service to Liège was cancelled, while new service to [[Brno–Tuřany Airport|Brno]] commenced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flybmi.com/press-release/brno/&lt;/ref&gt; Since early 2016 a further Embraer 145 aircraft has been based in Munich in order to allow them to serve further routes from there bringing the total number to eight.

== Destinations ==
{{main|List of flybmi destinations}}
As a subsidiary of [[British Midland International]], the airline operated regional services for its parent. Since becoming independent of BMI, the airline has completed an entire network review which has resulted in numerous route and base closures along with the introduction of a number of new routes during 2012 and 2013.

flybmi operates scheduled services to over 27 destinations throughout [[Mainland Europe|continental Europe]] including [[Scandinavia]] and also [[United Kingdom]]. Commencing 30 March 2014, the start of the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] Northern Summer Season 2014, the airline operated a scheduled service on behalf of [[Brussels Airlines]] between [[Brussels Airport|Brussels]] and [[Bristol Airport|Bristol]]. Previously, Flybmi also operated a scheduled service on behalf of Brussels Airlines between Brussels and [[Newcastle Airport|Newcastle]].

At present, flybmi has [[Codeshare agreement|codeshare]] agreements in place with other airlines. flybmi operates codeshares with [[Lufthansa]] on its routes from Bristol to [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]] and on all of its routes to/from [[Munich Airport|Munich]]. It also operates a codeshare with Brussels Airlines from both [[East Midlands Airport]] and Newcastle to Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flybmi.com/en/bottom-menu/press/bmi-regional-trading-update-and-2014-outlook |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709041255/http://www.flybmi.com/en/bottom-menu/press/bmi-regional-trading-update-and-2014-outlook |archivedate=9 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

flybmi also operates regular holiday charter flights over the summer months. These destinations have include [[Bastia Airport|Bastia]] on the island of [[Corsica]] on behalf of specialist tour operator Corsican Places, from Bristol, and [[Verona Villafranca Airport|Verona]] from Bristol on behalf of another specialist tour operator Inghams. During 2011 Regional aircraft operated, on behalf of BMI, direct flights between [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[Beja Airport|Beja]] in the [[Alentejo]] region of [[Portugal]] for Sunvil Discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunvil.co.uk/news/beja-direct-flight|title=Latest travel news|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of July 2016 the airline announced an extension to its codeshare agreement with Brussels Airlines by adding seven new routes to its network. This has allowed flybmi to sell fares to Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flybmi.com/press-release/bmi-regional-extends-partnership-brussels-airlines/|title=BMI REGIONAL EXTENDS PARTNERSHIP WITH BRUSSELS AIRLINES - BMI Regional|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georg Theodor Policron Chiewitz''' (5 October 1815 – 28 December 1862) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] architect and engineer. Due to financial problems he moved to [[Finland]] in 1851, where Chiewitz made his most remarkable career.&lt;ref name=arki&gt;[http://130.242.34.243/webarkdok/detalj.asp?id=619 Svenska Arkitektregistret] (in Swedish). Retrieved 17 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Chiewitz graduated from the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in 1829 and later from the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]]. From 1837–1838 he worked as an assistant for inventor [[John Ericsson]] in London and in 1839 for architect [[César Daly]] in Paris. In 1840, Chiewitz returned to Stockholm having businesses on railroad and bridge construction. In 1851 he went bankrupt and moved to Finland. From 1852–1860, Chiewitz was the regional architect of [[Turku and Pori Province]] and 1860–1862 the city architect of [[Turku]].&lt;ref name=arki/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/kb/artikkeli/3168/ Finnish National Biography Center] (in Finnish). Retrieved 17 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Chiewitz was the favourite architect of King [[Oscar I of Sweden]]. He designed several structures for [[Haga Park]] and the gardens of [[Ulriksdal Palace]] in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]] and [[Tullgarn Palace]] in [[Södertälje]]. Most important works are the [[Blackamoor Bridge]] in Ulriksdal Palace and [[Oscar I's Orangery]] in the garden of Tullgarn Palace.

His best known works in Finland are the [[Central Pori Church]], [[House of Nobility (Finland)|House of Nobility]] (Ritarihuone) and the [[Swedish Theatre]] of [[Helsinki]]. Chiewitz was also known of his [[city plan]]ning. His most significant work is the [[Pori]] city plan as the town was rebuilt after the great fire of 1852. The town of [[Mariehamn]] in [[Åland Islands]] was established in 1861 by Chiewitz's planning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfbe/0111.html Nordisk familjebok] (in Swedish).

{{Insolvency|By Country=India}}
The '''Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016''' ('''IBC''') is the bankruptcy law of India which seeks to consolidate the existing framework by creating a single law for insolvency and bankruptcy. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2015 was introduced in [[Lok Sabha]] in December 2015. It was passed by Lok Sabha on 5 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lok Sabha passes bill to fast track debt recovery|date=2 August 2016|url=http://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/lok-sabha-passes-bill-to-fast-track-debt-recovery/articleshow/53495364.cms|work=[[The Economic Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code received the assent of the President of India on 28 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/169882.pdf|title=Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code|publisher=Gazette of India|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain provisions of the Act have come into force from 5 August and 19 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification|url=http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/171374.pdf|website=E-Gazette|publisher=Gazette of India|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bankruptcy code is a one stop solution for resolving insolvencies which at present is a long process and does not offer an economically viable arrangement. A strong insolvency framework where the cost and the time incurred is minimised in attaining liquidation has been long overdue in India.  The code will be able to protect the interests of small investors and make the process of doing business a less cumbersome process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cppr.in/article/the-bankruptcy-code-for-india-a-step-to-ease-doing-business/|title=The Bankruptcy Code for India – A step to ease ‘Doing Business’?|date=2015-12-16|work=Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR)|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A maximum time limit, for completion of the insolvency resolution process,has been set for corporates and individuals. For companies, the process will have to be completed in 180 days, which may be extended by 90 days, if a majority of the creditors agree. For start ups (other than partnership firms), small companies and other companies (with asset less than Rs. 1 crore), resolution process would be completed within 90 days of initiation of request which may be extended by 45 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=India Overhauls Century-Old Bankruptcy Laws in Win for Modi |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-11/india-overhauls-century-old-bankruptcy-laws-in-key-win-for-modi |work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] |date=11 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Insolvency professionals''': The insolvency process will be managed by licensed professionals. These professionals will also control the assets of the debtor during the insolvency process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If the plea is accepted, the tribunal has to appoint an [[Insolvency Resolution Professional]] (IRP) to draft a resolution plan within 180 days (extendable by 90 days). following which the Corporate Insolvency Resolution process is initiated by the court. For the said period, the board of directors of the company stands suspended, and the promoters do not have a say in the management of the company. The IRP, if required, can seek the support of the company’s management for day-to-day operations. if the CIRP fails in reviving the company the liquidation process is initiated.&lt;ref name=lm0817/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/trends/breaking-down-bankruptcy-what-are-the-steps-involved/story/271770.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendments==
The Bill prohibits certain persons from submitting a resolution plan in case of defaults.  These include: (i) wilful defaulters, (ii) promoters or management of the company if it has an outstanding non-performing debt for over a year, and (iii) disqualified directors, among others.  Further, it bars the sale of property of a defaulter to such persons during liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRS {{!}} Bill Track {{!}} The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2017|url=http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/the-insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code-amendment-bill-2017-5017/|website=www.prsindia.org|accessdate=20 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Council of Management Consulting Institutes''' (ICMCI) has since 1987 been the professional body worldwide for [[Management consulting|management consultants]].&lt;ref&gt;Kubr, M. (ed.) Management Consulting: A guide to the profession 4th ed, Geneva, International Labour Office, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  
ICMCI since 2013 il called '''CMC-Global'''.

It exists to:

* Elevate the standards of the [[certified management consultant]] (CMC) worldwide
* Increase the acceptance and respect of the management consulting profession
* Increase the international and regional profile of management consulting
* Improve the process of [[certification]] throughout the world
* Provide a forum for national certifying bodies of certified management consultants
* Prepare and promulgate standards for management consulting to be adopted internationally
* Promote the ethical and moral practices of Certified Management Consultants and the management consulting profession
* Promote the higher performance and purpose of CMC's versus non certified "management consultants"

The practice of management consulting is about "helping organizations to improve their performance, operating primarily through the analysis of existing organizational problems and the development of plans for improvement." with the purpose of "gaining external (and presumably objective) advice and access to the consultants' specialized expertise."  It follows therefore that there is scope for an international organization to promote and foster [[Competence (human resources)|competence]] in the management consulting profession.

== CMC-Global Organisation ==
CMC-Global is a membership organisation with the only members being the leading [[Professional association|professional body]] for management consultancy committed to the certification of management consultants in the country of their operation.

CMC-Global is registered as a [[Swiss association|Swiss Verein]] with its main Council consisting of trustees.  Most of the trustees are appointed by the Institutes that are the Members as defined in the above paragraph. The number of trustees for each country varies from 1 to 4 depending on the individual membership by individual management consultants in the country.  The remaining trustees are officer trustees voted for every two years by all the trustees, the Officers are Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, and five Vice Chairs.  Together these officers form the Executive Committee (ExCom).  Reporting to ExCom are various other committees, work groups and task bodies depending on need.  Permanent committees include Membership Committee (responsible for overseeing the admittance of new Members and the continuing adherence to the membership requirements of the existing Members), the Professional Standards Committee (which covers all professional matters including Standards), and the Quality Assurance Committee (responsible for checking that all Full Members award the Certified Management Consultant to the agreed Standard using the preferred assessment methods).  A Nominations and Succession planning Committee (responsible for the election of officers and identifying and nurturing potential future office-holders) reports to the trustees as a whole.

Other committees always include some trustees but also may have individual management consultant members of the Institutes (and endorsed to be on the committee by that Institute)

All the office holders must be CMC holders and at the time of the election a trustee for one of the Full Members.  They are unpaid and contribute between (on average) three to one day a week of effort to the organisation.

The Organisation has in 2013 appointed an Executive Director.

In support, the organisation has a permanent secretariat which undertakes the committee and trustee support, including accounting, communications, and web site provision.

The web site (www.cmc-global.org) should be consulted for the names and contact details of the Office holders, the Executive Directorate and the Secretariat.

== Certified Management Consultant (CMC) ==
Professional buyers of management consultancy worldwide specify that the key requirements of a management consultancy are in ascending order of priority: [[Knowledge]] (of management, the function, the sector, the general economy, the processes and the business professions), [[skill]]s (analytic and inter-personal), competence (the ability to manage the assignment in close communication with the client), and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] (keeping organisational secrets, maintaining confidentiality, integrity).  The major buyers are aware that the [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], and other masters in management degrees provides evidence of underpinning knowledge and analytic skills and, depending on the course, maybe some courses in consultancy and a short period of relevant work experience.[[File:Certified Management Consultant.png|thumb|Certified Management Consultant "CMC" brand]]

CMC-Global understood these requirements and has developed the [[Certified management consultant|Certified Management Consultant]] qualification.  This is primarily awarded by a competence based assessment against a defined CMC-Global Standard Competence Framework (see: http://www.icmci.org/?page=6972393) which uses prerequisites of evidence of possessing the underpinning knowledge and at least three years of successful practice.  Client cases are examined and a competence assessment is undertaken.  All holders of the qualification are required to be a member of their national ICMCI Member and thus are committed to a code of professional conduct at least as restrictive as that defined in the CMC-Global standard (see www.cmc-global.com ): failures to comply are subject to a disciplinary procedure which can result in the removal of the CMC designation.

The Certified Management Consultant is the equivalent (that is taking into account cultural differences) in all countries and was the first worldwide single business professional qualification.

== History ==
In May 1987, thirty-two management consultants from ten countries met to explore the common ground between professional institutes which were known to certify individual management consultants. At the end of the two-day meeting the delegates proposed the formation of an International Council of Management Consulting Institutes to improve the certification of management consultants around the world. IMCs of seven countries formed the founding members of the new Council.

In 1989 the Council organizational structure including membership requirements and application process were in place. Membership had grown to ten IMCs with four applications pending. The thirty delegates from eleven countries who attended this session ratified the structure and membership criteria, agreed to establish ICMCI as a Swiss Verein and approved the ICMCI Code of Professional Conduct. This ICMCI Code became the first and still may be the only international code of conduct of any profession.

In 1993 the ICMCI strategic plan was adopted by the members. The features of this plan included: [[International standard|international Standards]], support and adherence by Member Institutes, increased international recognition with support (by international influencers and Member Institutes) for certification of competent management consultants to the CMC (Certified Management Consultant) a title originating from our Canadian Member who were delighted to enable ICMCI to use the title worldwide.

From 1999 to 2003 the standards for the competence qualification CMC were developed and agreed.  A quality assurance programme was developed to ensure that all awarded the CMC were to an equivalent standard: the first business qualification to achieve this.  The CMC is a benchmark of management consultancy competence, objectivity, independence, and professionalism.

In July 2001, ICMCI was granted [[Special Consultative Status]] by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|United Nation’s Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC). ICMCI since then has provided research based research papers in support of the [[United Nations|UN]], or its member bodies, objectives.
 
Since 2007, ICMCI has increased its working with international bodies and organisations including ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization|International Organisation for Standardisation]]), CEN (Centre for European Norms), EBRD ([[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]),  IAF ([[International Accreditation Forum]]) and ILO ([[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]])[[File:Icmci member countries.png|450px|thumbnail|ICMCI member countries]]

In 2011 ICMCI began a coordinated series of initiatives which have led already to the appointment of ICMCI Academic fellows, the first awarding of the title "CMC Firm".

CMC-Global runs the Constantinus Awards which promote excellence in consulting worldwide &lt;ref&gt;http://www.constantinus-international.com/award/en/introduction/&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theconsultant.eu/news/uk-firms-win-global-recognition-at.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==The CMC-Global Academic Fellow==

The CMC-Global Academic Fellow designation is intended to be a mark of distinction which recognises academics from around the world who have contributed to the study and teaching of management consultancy. It is awarded by CMC-Global to suitably qualified individuals based upon the recommendation of the local Institute of Management Consulting (IMC).
Candidates must hold a position at a recognised academic institution, specifically a publicly accredited university and must be engaged in research and/or teaching within the external or internal management consulting field for a minimum of five years.
Benefits to the local IMC:
The attraction and engagement of a new stakeholder group that will add valuable new perspectives and insights within their management consulting community along with the expectation that the Fellow will demonstrate tangible on-going involvement with the management consulting profession. 
Increased membership through the potential development of management consulting streams within MBA or related Masters programs which could lead to award of the CMC credential upon suitable demonstration of knowledge (know what) and competence (know how). 
Pragmatic contributions to debates within the IMC on academic matters, including annual conferences where Fellows and other related academics can profile their research and teaching best practices. 
Benefits to the Academic Fellow:
Enhanced academic and professional profile arising from the appointment along with international peer recognition.
Invitations to international conferences and hub meetings with the opportunity to showcase applied research and publications.
Support for appropriate international research projects within the management consulting field, in terms of providing industry contacts and primary research respondents, along with endorsement of funding applications.
Support for major student projects through CMC client introductions or directly for CMC practitioners.
The first round of nominations was received in 2013 with 16 academics from around the world awarded the Academic Fellow designation. An overall target of 100 Academic Fellows has been established.

==Membership==
Membership of CMC-Global is only available to Associations or Institutes of Management Consultancy that satisfy the requirements listed below.  Individual consultants are invited to contact their national Member Institute. If there is no CMC-Global member in their country they should contact  [reference to GIMC]

There are two classes of membership: Provisional Members and Full Members.  Full Members are the only members who have had their assessment processes quality assured and can award the CMC (see section 2 above) and depending on their size appoint a number of delegates to CMC-Global – in effect the directors of CMC-Global.

All Members are required to be

*formally created with a constitution that complies with CMC-Global expectations
*committed to certifying individual management consultants
*the most significant body satisfying the above in their country

In rare circumstances (language, history related) there may be more than one Member in a single country (as recognised by the UN)

==International programmes==
5.1 UN NGO status&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/ngo425.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Having had corresponding status NGO with ECOSOC since 2001, ICMCI has been active in two ways.  One is the reactive provision of advice and consideration to issues being examined by the ECOSOC and related bodies.  Past examples have been on the benefits of indigenous competent management consultants to development projects and to enhancing the economy by increasing the capability and capacity of the economy.  Another effort was to support the consideration of the use of new technologies in developing economies: the advice reiterated that for the introduction of extra technology to be successful, not only must the technology be appropriate but the people aspects (in all senses of the term) and the process implementation be also fitting to the need in order for the technology investment to be successful.

5.2 CMC-Global Academic Fellows

The CMC-Global Academic Fellow designation is awarded by CMC-Global to suitably qualified individuals based upon the recommendation of the local Institute of Management Consulting (IMC).

5.3 CMC Firm

CMC-Global awards an international accreditation of Management Consulting firms called the "CMC Firm".  The accreditation recognises a firm for its standards with a specific focus on ethical practices, standards of conduct in addition to ability to practice management consulting to the highest standards. CMC-Global manages the global directory of the CMC Firms, published within the CMC-Global web site.

5.4 CMC-Global Accredited courses

CMC-Global has a scheme whereby the national Members can accredit a training course for management consultancy which is in accordance with CMC-Global's standards.  This gives the course an internationally recognised approval imprimatur.

5.5 Relationships with other bodies

CMC-Global has been an observer to The International Accreditation Forum (IAF) since 2008.

CMC-Global led an initiative to develop an EU style service standard for management consultancy through CEN (Centre for European Norms) and sponsored the effort used to produce EN 16114 in 2011, with UNI [[Ente Nazionale Italiano di Unificazione]] (The Italian Standards Body) being the Secretariat for the project committee (PC) named CEN/PC 381, transformed in 2017 the CEN TC 381 permanent committee.

CMC-Global in 2013 promoted with ISO the constitution of a new working group, the project committee (PC) called ISO/PC 280 always to the Italian Secretariat of UNI, which generated the international standard ISO 20700:2017 ''Guidelines for Management Consultancy Services''.

'''John Edward Patrick "Jack" Gallagher''', [[Order of Canada|OC]] (16 July 1916 – 16 December 1998) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] oilman who from 1950 to 1983 was the head of [[Dome Petroleum]]. Gallagher is best remembered for leading extensive explorations in the [[Beaufort Sea]] in the late 1970s.

==Biography==

=== Early years and university ===

Jack Gallagher was born in [[Winnipeg]] on 16 July 1916. In 1933 he graduated from [[St. John's High School (Winnipeg)|St. John's High School]]. In the fall of 1933 Gallagher entered the [[University of Manitoba]], studying engineering. Fearful about his prospects of getting a job in construction during the [[Great Depression]], he later transferred to studying geology. During the summer of 1936, Gallagher worked for the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] in northern Manitoba. This first encounter with the north would inspire his return there later in his career.

=== Career beginnings ===

Upon graduating in 1937, Gallagher hitched a ride to [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] and got a job selling [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] tractors. After a year, Gallagher moved to California where he got a job as a scout with the [[Shell Oil Company]]. Despite not having experience in oil and gas, the company was interested in his field experience in the North. In January 1939 Shell sent Gallagher to [[Egypt]]. When the [[World War II|Second World War]] began in September of that year, Shell ceased its Egyptian operations and moved to the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Instead of transferring to the new location, Gallagher left Shell and began to work for the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Company of New Jersey]], who remained in the region. At one point, Gallagher worked for the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] searching for water wells. During his time in the east Gallagher also lectured on geology at the [[Cairo University]].

In the early 1940s Standard transferred Gallagher to [[South America]], where he spent time in [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], and [[Panama]]. His South American stay led to many interesting experiences, including being granted a meeting with president [[Jorge Ubico]] to ask permission to search for oil in the north of the country. On another occasion, while in the passenger seat of a truck on a trip through the [[Andes]], Gallagher's driver fainted from the altitude. Gallagher managed to steer the truck into a rock wall, preventing it from going off the cliff. Suffering from back pain, it was ten days before he was able to see a doctor, who concluded he was only experiencing muscle spasms. A year later in [[New York City]], an X-Ray revealed three fractured vertebrae. Gallagher would have back pain the rest of his life. The pressure from giving a hand shake would often cause him pain, and to help the problem he would often use a two-hand clasp when meeting people.

In 1948 Standard sent Gallagher to [[Harvard University]] for a year to study management. Upon finishing at Harvard, Standard informed Gallagher that they wanted him to work as their head geologist in the [[Far East]]. Wanting to return to Canada, Gallagher instead took a job with Standard's Canadian subsidiary, [[Imperial Oil]], in Calgary.

=== Dome Petroleum ===

In 1950 Gallagher was approached by Jim McCrea of [[Placer Dome|Dome Mines]], an [[Toronto]] company that had been in existence since 1910. Wanting to expand their operations to include oil, the company formed Dome Exploration (Western), wanting Gallagher to head the new operation. Throughout the 1950s Dome remained a relatively small company. Gallagher worked primarily on his own and had an office in the Alberta Block at 805 1st Street South West with his secretary Ethel Cairns. In 1951 Dome became public, selling a half-million shares, and in 1958 it changed its name to Dome Petroleum and moved into the new Dome Building at 706 8th Avenue South West. Having become fascinated with the Canadian North during the summer of 1936, Gallagher remained interested in the potential for northern oil and gas exploration. In 1959 Gallagher first filed for land position in the north, and in September 1961 Dome became the first company to drill in the Canadian Arctic. In 1974 Gallagher was contacted by then Minister of Northern Affairs, [[Jean Chrétien]], to ask if Dome would be interested in exploration in the Beaufort Sea. Dome's first season of exploration in the Beaufort was in 1976. By the early 1980s, Dome had built a fleet of around 40 vessels. Although Dome invested a great deal of money in Arctic exploration, it never made a major discovery.

By the early 1980s Gallagher, although still Chief Executive, had relinquished some power to younger members of the company. In May 1981 Dome set out to acquire the [[Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company]], which at the time was controlled by the American company [[Conoco]]. Gallagher had opposed this move, although he ultimately allowed it to take place. That June, Dome took a U.S.$1.68 billion loan from the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]], [[Royal Bank of Canada]], [[Bank of Montreal]], and the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]]. In the fall Toronto-Dominion requested that part of the loan be repaid, at which time it was revealed that Dome did not have the money. This revelation threw the Canadian banking system into a state of chaos for the next year before a rescue package for Dome was developed in the fall of 1982. On 8 April 1983, Gallagher stepped down as the head of Dome. In his 33 years of running the company, he had turned a one-man operation into the third-largest private company in Canada, at the time.

=== Personal life ===

Gallagher was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1983. After leaving Dome, he dedicated his time largely to political causes, helping to found the [[Reform Party of Canada]]. Gallagher was known for his affable personality and famous smile, being given the nickname "Smilin' Jack." In August 1949 he married Kathleen Stewart, who was originally from [[Red Deer, Alberta]]. They, along with their three sons, lived in a house located at 4315 Britannia Drive in Calgary's mid-century [[Britannia, Calgary|Britannia]] neighbourhood. The house remains largely original today and has been featured in local architectural tours. Gallagher's personal papers are held at the [[Glenbow Museum]] as the ''[http://www.glenbow.org/collections/search/findingAids/archhtm/gallagher.cfm Jack Gallagher fonds]''.

'''John Ezzidio''' (c. 1810 – October 1872) was a freed slave from [[Nigeria]] who became a successful businessman and politician in [[Sierra Leone]]. Rescued from a slave ship headed for [[Brazil]], he was apprenticed to a French shopkeeper and taught himself to read and write. Ezzidio eventually rose to the position of mayor of [[Freetown]] and later became a member the colonial governor's Legislative Council.

==Kidnapping==

==Business and political career==
Ezzidio became the apprentice of a French shopkeeper named Beyaust; Beyaust named his apprentice "Isadore". The name was written down as "Ezzido", and eventually morphed into "Ezzidio". After the death of the Frenchman, Ezzidio was hired by an English firm. He managed a European-owned shop and then used the money he saved to start his own trading firm. He taught himself to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;Sanneh, pp. 129-130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, Ezzidio purchased property for £100. He visited England the next year, making import deals with companies based there; by importing directly, he eliminated the need for middle men. Goods that were sent to his George Street property, at a total value of between £3000 and £4000 per year, included clothing such as suits and boots, foodstuffs such as ham, cookies, tea, and [[fortified wines]] (port and sherry).&lt;ref name=sanneh130&gt;Sanneh, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, [[William Fergusson]], Governor of Sierra Leone, appointed him to the position of alderman, and in 1845 Ezzidio became Mayor of Freetown.&lt;ref name=sanneh130/&gt;

In 1862, Governor [[Samuel Wensley Blackall]] split the Governor's Council into two parts, an Executive and a Legislative Council; the latter allowed representation from, among others, the colony's merchants. The Mercantile Association, in a vote consisting of twenty-four Africans, fourteen Europeans, and one Caribbean merchant, elected Ezzidio to represent them on this body. While on the council, he was noted for his fairness and unobtrusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Sanneh, pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezzidio described himself as an "[[oracle]]" of the people; some people, meanwhile, nicknamed him "dancing bear" due to his size and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Sanneh, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wesleyan Church involvement==
Ezzidio joined the [[Methodism|Wesleyan Church]] in 1835. He became a lay preacher in 1842 and also ran a Sunday school. He is recorded to have made the largest donation of all contributors at an 1864 church celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Sanneh, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, at Ezzidio's request, a white superintendent was sent from England to supervise the Wesleyan mission. This superintendent, [[Benjamin Trebaskis]], was a [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist]], strongly sectarian, and opposed to the interdenominational cooperation Ezzidio and others in the church had previously supported.&lt;ref&gt;Salleh, pp. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Trebaskis feuded with Ezzidio over church policy until the latter's death in October 1872.&lt;ref name=heroes/&gt;

==Honours==
In 2007, in a campaign to [[Africanization|Africanise]] British street names, the government of Freetown announced plans to rename Howe Street after Ezzidio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Yvonne |last= Ndege-Burke |author2=Mohammed Fajah-Barrie|title= S Leone honours Africa slave campaigners |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6466951.stm |work= BBC News|publisher=BBC |date= 2007-03-20|accessdate=2007-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julio A. Ramos''' (4 February 1935 in [[Buenos Aires]] – 19 November 2006 in Buenos Aires) was an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[journalist]] and businessman. On 9 December 1976 he founded ''[[Ámbito Financiero]]'', a newspaper specializing in finance and economy that was later expanded to cater to a wider audience.

Ramos received a degree in Economics from the [[University of Buenos Aires]] and worked as a journalist for ''[[Noticias Gráficas]]'', ''[[La Nación]]'' and ''[[La Opinión (Argentina)|La Opinión]]'', among other media. He was a firm believer in [[free market]] [[liberalism]]. In 1985, Ramos ran unsuccessfully for the Deputy Chamber of the [[Buenos Aires Province]] in a center-right ticket. He also directed the [[Inter American Press Association]] from 1986 to 1989.

Ramos married twice and had five children, two of whom preceded him in death (one was electrocuted, and the other died in a car accident less than a month later).  He had a personal friendship with former president [[Carlos Menem]]. He also wrote the nonfiction books ''Los cerrojos a la prensa'' (''Locks on the Press'', 1993) and ''El periodismo atrasado'' (''Set-back Journalism'', 1996).

He died of [[leukemia]] in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="134894">The following '''list of worker deaths in United States labor disputes''' captures known incidents of fatal labor-related violence in U.S. labor history, which began in the colonial era with the [[Timeline of labor issues and events|earliest worker demands]] around 1636 for better working conditions. It does not include killings of enslaved persons. According to a study in 1969, the United States has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any industrial nation in the world, and there have been few industries which have been immune.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

This list is not comprehensive. A number of factors (multi-sided conflicts, physically remote locations, company-controlled locations, exaggerated or biased original reporting, etc.) make some of the death and injury counts uncertain.

===Law enforcement and companies' militia, armed detectives and guards===

On June 26 a national rail strike of 125,000 workers paralyzed traffic in 27 states for weeks.  By July 3 a mob peaking at perhaps 10,000 had gathered near the shoreline in south Chicago embarking on several straight days of vandalism and violence, burning switchyards and hundreds of railroad cars.  Thousands of federal troops and deputy marshals were inserted over the governor's protests and clashed with rioters.  The strike dissolved by August 2.

|[[Leadville Miners' strike]]: The union asked for a wage increase of 50 cents-per-day for those making less than $3-per-day, to restore a 50-cent cut imposed in 1893. The county sheriff and his deputies supported the strikers. Leadville city police took the side of the mine owners, recruited new officers from Denver, and "apparently kept up a near-constant campaign of harassment and violence against union members throughout the strike." As many as six union men were killed during the strike, by strikebreakers, police, or under mysterious circumstances. Four more union men died when they joined about 50 strikers in a nighttime rifle and dynamite attack on the Coronado and Emmett mines; the attackers burned the Coronado shafthouse and killed a firefighter trying to extinguish the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William P.|last=Philpott|title=The Lessons of Leadville, or, Why the Western Federation of Miners turned left|publisher=Colorado Historical Society|year=1995|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Battle of Blair Mountain]]: the largest labor uprising in United States history and the largest organized armed uprising since the American Civil War. During an attempt by the miners to unionize, and following the murder of [[Sid Hatfield]], 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3000 lawmen and [[Baldwin-Felts]] strikebreakers, who were backed by coal mine operators. In the summer of 1921 in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]], hundreds of miners were arrested without [[habeas corpus]] and other basic legal rights. Talk spread of a march to free those confined miners, end martial law, and organize the county. In [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha County]], up to 13,000 miners gathered and began marching toward [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]] on August 24. The reviled anti-union sheriff of Logan County, [[Don Chafin]]&lt;ref&gt;The Herald-Dispatch. [http://www.wvculture.org/History/government/chafindon01.html "Funeral Rites Thursday For Colorful Don Chafin"], August 10, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; set up defenses on Blair Mountain, with the nation's largest private armed force of 2000. By August 29, battle was fully joined. Chafin's men, though outnumbered, had the advantage of higher positions and better weaponry. Private hired planes dropped homemade bombs on the miners near the towns of Jeffery, Sharples and Blair. Army bombers were used for aerial surveillance.  Sporadic gun battles continued for a week. Up to 30 deaths were reported by Chafin's side and 50–100 on the union miners' side, with hundreds more injured. On September 2, federal troops arrived by presidential order, and the miners started heading home the next day. About one million rounds were fired in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2015-09-13|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1201/features/blair_mountain_coal_activism_west_virginia.html|volume=65|number=1|date=January–February 2012|first=Samir S.|last=Patel|title=Mountaintop Rescue – Archaeology, coal, and activism collide in the Appalachian Mountains at the site of America's largest labor conflict|work=Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Three members of the [[Coal and Iron Police]] beat miner [[John Barkoski]] to death. He had gone to his mother-in-law's home and there fell into the hands of two coal and iron policemen employed by the Pittsburgh Coal Company. Eyewitnesses said one of them had launched an unprovoked attack on Barkoski, who received a laceration of the left cheek, five or six head wounds, two broken ribs and a fractured nose. Later at police barracks over the course of four hours, according to trial testimony, a third officer beat Barkoski with a strap while he lay semiconscious on the floor, twisted his ears until the miner cried aloud, and twisted his broken nose until he lapsed again into unconsciousness. Then he beat Barkoski over the chest with a poker until the poker bent, straightened the implement and beat the man again. He stripped the miner to the waist in order to better use a strap and kicked Barkoski until the miner's body rolled over and over on the floor. The original attacker also beat Barkoski, kicked him, struck him over the head with knucklers, and slapped him on the arms and legs and neck with his blackjack.  The next morning he was taken to a hospital where he died. A jury acquitted the three officers of murder.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Frank|last= Butler|title=Coal and Iron Justice|work=The Nation|date=October 16, 1929|url=http://explorepahistory.com/odocument.php?docId=1-4-29A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marco Börries''' (born 1 August 1968) is a German IT entrepreneur. He is best known as the founder of [[Star Division]], who developed [[StarOffice]], which later became [[OpenOffice.org]].

== Career ==

Inspired by a student exchange program to [[Silicon Valley]] while he attended the {{ill|Gymnasium Oedeme|de}}, Marco Börries founded [[Star Division]] as a garage company in Lüneburg at the age of 16. As its first product the company distributed [[StarWriter (word processor)|StarWriter]], a [[word processor]] application developed by friends,&lt;ref name="Vermes_1999"/&gt; as an alternative to [[Microsoft]]'s office package. StarWriter later became [[StarOffice]] (and thereby was the foundation to [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] and [[LibreOffice]]).

StarOffice was sold over 25 million times. On 5 August 1999 Börries sold Star Division to [[Sun Microsystems]], where Börries also subsequently briefly employed.&lt;ref name="heise /&gt;&lt;ref name="chip" /&gt;

In parallel to Star Division Börries also founded the Hamburg-based company Star&amp;nbsp;Finanz as a [[joint venture]] with [[Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband|Deutsche Sparkassen-Organisation]], a German savings bank.&lt;ref name="Hofmann_2014"/&gt; With [[StarMoney]] the company grew to become a significant provider of [[home banking]] software in the years following. In early 2001, Börries sold his shares in this company as well.&lt;ref name="Behr_2001"/&gt;

In August 2001, Börries founded [[VerdiSoft]] and served as its CEO. The company developed the [[Yahoo! Go]] technology to enable [[mobile phone]]s to have screen-optimized access to emails, photos, messages and other web content. VerdiSoft including its technology know-how was sold to [[Yahoo]] in February 2005, where Börries worked as an Executive Vice President in the ''Connected Life'' division until April 2009.&lt;ref name="Kuri_2009"/&gt;

Until 2008 Börries lived with his wife and three children in California,&lt;ref name="Lemm_2005"/&gt; but then moved to Hamburg and Berlin in Germany.

On 1 September 2009, Marco Börries launched his latest business idea, NumberFour AG, based in Berlin. The company developed an open software platform ([[Platform as a Service|PaaS]]) for the development, distribution and marketing of [[vertical solution]]s for [[small business]]es. After four years of development, Börries gathered 38 million USDs from financial investors in mid 2013.&lt;ref name="Hofmann_2014"/&gt; Renamed enfore&amp;nbsp;AG, the company launched a platform for small business in March 2017 connecting online services, software and hardware ([[Point-of-sale|PoS]] terminals).&lt;ref name="Hüsing_2017"/&gt;

Other entrepreneurial activities that did not lead to market entries were Adhoc Mobile GmbH, founded in 2009, and Mag10 GmbH, founded in 2010. This was a company to develop a solution for tablet publishing, but was shelved at the end of 2011.&lt;ref name="Treiß_2012"/&gt;

== Gamatex and TV Markíza ==
Kočner first gained public notoriety for his attempt to take over [[Markíza|TV Markíza]] in 1998.

[[Markíza|TV Markíza]], one of the first private television channels in Slovakia, was founded by [[Pavol Rusko]] and Sylvia Volzová in partnership with [[Central European Media Enterprises|CME Media Enterprises B.V.]] in 1996. Initially the channel was not successful in acquiring broadcasting license, licensing board objected that Rusko did not disclose Volzová as co-owner.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zivot.sk/clanok/14901/pribeh-jednej-televizie-toto-vsetko-si-preskakala-markiza|title=Príbeh jednej televízie: Toto všetko si preskákala Markíza|last=|first=|date=4 October 2013|website=www.zivot.sk|language=Slovak|trans-title=Story of a TV channel: This is what Markíza went through|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rusko had entered into an agreement with Espé štúdio, company owned by Siloš Pohanka to pay 3 million DEM in exchange for help in getting broadcasting license for [[Markíza]]. Eventually the cast of licensing board changed, Markíza had secured broadcasting license and launched on 31 August 1996. However Rusko declared agreement with Espé štúdio invalid, as he argued that Markíza acquired license without help of Siloš Pohanka.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After unsuccessful attempts at getting money from Rusko, Pohanka sold his claim to Gamatex, company owned by Kočner. Kočner persuaded Volzová to acknowledge the claim and Kočner started court procedures to have the claim paid out.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://strategie.hnonline.sk/media/1049630-ako-rusko-a-volzova-spoluzakladali-markizu|title=Ako Pavol Rusko a Sylvia Volzová zakladali a predávali Markízu|last=Petronela|first=Ševčíková|date=23 October 2017|website=strategie.hnonline.sk|trans-title=How Pavol Rusko and Sylvia Volzová founded and sold Markíza|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1998 Kočner appeared at Markíza offices with court order giving him control over the TV station. When negotiations with Rusko regarding ownership dispute failed, Kočner occupied the TV station with hired private security and fired TV channel's top managers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sme.sk/c/2165289/televizia-markiza-obsadena.html|title=Televízia Markíza obsadená|last=Tóth|first=Peter|date=16 September 1998|work=SME|access-date=8 April 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=Slovak|trans-title=TV Markíza occupied}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused public outrage, as the takeover took place only 10 days before parliamentary elections. At that time TV Markíza was deemed the main news outlet opposing the government of [[Vladimír Mečiar]] and an attempt at takeover was considered an attack on press freedom. Several thousand&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; of angry citizens gathered in front of Markíza's offices as a show of support and several politicians from opposition parties gave speeches at the rally. After two days, Kočner and his associates left the building&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sme.sk/c/2165498/gamatex-s-ochrankou-opustil-markizu-zamestnanci-dostali-zaruky-do-11-oktobra.html|title=Gamatex s ochrankou opustil Markízu, zamestnanci dostali záruky do 11. októbra|last=|first=|date=18 September 1998|work=SME|access-date=8 April 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=Slovak|trans-title=Gamatex and private security have left Markíza, employees got guarantees until 11th October}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ownership dispute continued in courts. According to news reports,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dennik.hnonline.sk/153247-rusko-v-markize-skoncil-televiziu-ovladli-americania|title=Rusko v Markíze skončil, televíziu ovládli Američania|last=Tettinger|first=Marek|date=2 November 2005|work=Hospodárske Noviny|access-date=8 April 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=Slovak|trans-title=Rusko is done with Markíza, channel taken over by Americans}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kočner's involvement in TV Markíza seemingly ended in 2000 when Rusko bought Gamatex through intermediaries.

In a 2006 interview with ''aktualne.sk'' (not to be confused with ''aktuality.sk'') Kočner said the security firm involved in takeover of Markíza belonged to Peter Čongrády, a local mafia boss, however in later interviews he denied hiring Čongrády.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In June 2016 Kočner's company "Správa a inkaso zmeniek" initiated court proceedings with [[Pavol Rusko]] and [[Markíza|TV Markíza]] to collect money owed to him under four promissory notes amounting to approx. €69 million. Kočner claimed that Rusko issued those promissory notes in June 2000 with Markíza providing endorsement for the notes. At that time Rusko was the executive director of TV Markíza as well as one of its shareholders&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/925645/000092564517000003/cetv-1231201610k.htm#sDD7836481E5EC03FE544BC286EF01E82|title=CME Enterprises Ltd. annual report|last=|first=|date=|website=US Securities and Exchange Commission website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Rusko acknowledged Kočner's claim in court and declared that the promissory notes were intended to resolve ownership dispute with Gamatex&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4773">The '''modified internal rate of return''' ('''MIRR''') is a [[finance|financial]] measure of an [[investment]]'s attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, S. A. Y., "The modified internal rate of return and investment criterion," ''The Engineering Economist'' 21(4), 1976, 237-247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaves, R. G., "Net present value and the rate of return: Implicit and explicit reinvestment assumptions," ''The Engineering Economist'' 33, 1988, 275-302.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[capital budgeting]] to rank alternative investments of equal size. As the name implies, MIRR is a modification of the [[internal rate of return]] (IRR) and as such aims to resolve some problems with the IRR.

==Problems with the IRR==
While there are several [[Internal rate of return#Problems with using internal rate of return|problems with the IRR]], MIRR resolves two of them.

Firstly, IRR is sometimes misapplied, under an assumption that interim positive cash flows are reinvested at the same rate of return as that of the project that generated them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3304945 Internal Rate of Return: A Cautionary Tale]&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually an unrealistic scenario and a more likely situation is that the funds will be reinvested at a rate closer to the firm's cost of capital. The IRR therefore often gives an unduly optimistic picture of the projects under study. Generally for comparing projects more fairly, the [[weighted average cost of capital]] should be used for reinvesting the interim cash flows.

Secondly, more than one IRR can be found for projects with alternating positive and negative cash flows, which leads to confusion and ambiguity. MIRR finds only one value.

==Calculation of the MIRR==
MIRR is calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{MIRR}=\sqrt[n]{\frac{FV(\text{positive cash flows, reinvestment rate})}{-PV(\text{negative cash flows, finance rate})}}-1&lt;/math&gt;, 

where ''n'' is the number of equal periods at the end of which the cash flows occur (not the number of cash flows), ''PV'' is [[present value]] (at the beginning of the first period), ''FV'' is [[future value]] (at the end of the last period).

The formula adds up the negative cash flows after discounting them to time zero using the external cost of capital, adds up the positive cash flows including the proceeds of reinvestment at the external reinvestment rate to the final period, and then works out what rate of return would cause the magnitude of the discounted negative cash flows at time zero to be equivalent to the future value of the positive cash flows at the final time period.

[[Spreadsheet|Spreadsheet applications]], such as [[Microsoft Excel]], have inbuilt functions to calculate the MIRR. In Microsoft Excel this function is "=MIRR(...)".

===Example===
If an investment project is described by the sequence of cash flows:

{| class="wikitable" align="left"
|-
! Year
! Cash flow
|- align="center"
| 0
| -1000
|- align="center"
| 1
| -4000
|- align="center"
| 2
| 5000
|- align="center"
| 3
| 2000
|}
{{-}}

then the IRR &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{NPV} = -1000 + \frac{-4000}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{5000}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{2000}{(1+r)^3} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, the answer is 25.48% (with this conventional pattern of cash flows, the project has a unique IRR).

To calculate the MIRR, we will assume a finance rate of 10% and a reinvestment rate of 12%. First, we calculate the present value of the negative cash flows (discounted at the finance rate):

&lt;math&gt;PV(\text{negative cash flows, finance rate}) = -1000 + \frac{-4000}{(1+10\%)^1} = -4636.36&lt;/math&gt;.

Second, we calculate the future value of the positive cash flows (reinvested at the reinvestment rate):

&lt;math&gt;FV(\text{positive cash flows, reinvestment rate}) = 5000\cdot(1+12\%)^1 + 2000 = 7600&lt;/math&gt;.

Third, we find the MIRR:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{MIRR}=\sqrt[3]{\frac{7600}{4636.36}}-1=17.91\%&lt;/math&gt;.

The calculated MIRR (17.91%) is significantly different from the IRR (25.48%).

==Comparing projects of different sizes==
Like the internal rate of return, the modified internal rate of return is not valid for ranking projects of different sizes, because a larger project with a smaller modified internal rate of return may have a higher net present value.  However, there exist variants of the modified internal rate of return which can be used for such comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Shull, D. M., "Efficient capital project selection through a yield-based capital budgeting technique," ''The Engineering Economist'' 38(1), 1992, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hajdasinski, M., "Remarks in the context of 'The case for the generalized net present value formula'," ''The Engineering Economist'' 40(2), 1995, 201-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is associated with a social consensus (usually expressed through [[democratic election]]s) that certain services should be available to all, regardless of [[income]], [[physical ability]] or [[intelligence|mental acuity]]. Even where public services are neither publicly provided nor publicly financed, for social and political reasons they are usually subject to [[regulation]] going beyond that applying to most [[economic sectors]].

Public service is also a course that can be studied at a college or university. Examples of public services are the [[fire brigade]], [[police]], [[air force]], and [[paramedics]].

==Sectors==
Public services may be associated with fundamental [[human rights]] (such as the right to water). The Volunteer Fire Dept. and Ambulance Corps. are institutions with the mission of servicing the community. A service is helping others with a specific need or want. Here, service ranges from a doctor curing an illness, to a repair person, to a food pantry.

In modern [[developed countries]], the term "public services" (or "services of general interest") often includes:{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* [[Court|Courts]]
* [[Electricity]]
* [[Education]], [e.g. state (public) schools, public universities, etc...]
* [[Emergency service]]s, (e.g. Fire, EMS, Law Enforcement, Search and Rescue, etc...)
* [[Environmental protection]]
* [[Health care]]
* [[Military]]
* [[Public transportation]]
* [[Public buildings]]
* [[Social services]], (e.g. public housing, social welfare, food subsidies, etc...) 
* [[Telecommunications]]
* [[Urban planning]]
* [[Transportation infrastructure]]
* [[Waste management]], (e.g. wastewater, solid waste, recycling, etc...)
* [[Water supply network]]

==Public administration==
{{Main article|Public Administration}}In modern democracies, public service is often performed by [[Employment|employees]] known as [[Civil service|civil servants]] who are hired by elected [[officials]]. Government agencies are not profit-oriented and their employees are motivated very differently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Studies of their work have found contrasting results including both higher levels of effort&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Government Employees: Working Hard or Hardly Working? |journal=The American Review of Public Administration |first1=Sue A. |last1=Frank |first2=Gregory B. |last2=Lewis |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=36-51 |date=March 2004 |doi=10.1177/0275074003258823}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fewer hours of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/government-employees-work-less-private-sector-employees |title=Government Employees Work Less than Private-Sector Employees |journal=Backgrounder |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |first=Jason |last=Richwine |issue=2724 |pages=1-6 |date=11 September 2012 |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in the UK found that private sector hiring managers do not credit government experience as much as private sector experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://business.financialpost.com/executive/careers/public-sector-stigma |title=Public sector stigma: The 100,000 workers Tim Hudak removes from the provincial payroll could have a tough transition to the private sector |work=Financial Post |first=Dan |last=Ovsey |date=27 May 2014 |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public workers tend to make less in wages when adjusting for education, although that difference is reduced when benefits and hours are included.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/07/are-public-sector-employees-overpaid/ |title=Are public-sector employees “overpaid”? |work=The Washington Post |first=Sasha |last=Volokh |date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public workers have other intangible benefits such as increased job security.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
A public service may sometimes have the characteristics of a [[public good]] (being [[non-rivalrous]] and [[non-excludable]]), but most are services which may (according to prevailing [[social norms]]) be under-provided by the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In most cases public services are [[Service (economics)|services]], i.e. they do not involve manufacturing of [[good (accounting)|goods]]. They may be provided by local or national monopolies, especially in sectors which are [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]].

They may involve outputs that are hard to attribute to specific individual effort or hard to measure in terms of key characteristics such as quality. They often require high levels of training and education. They may attract people with a public service ethos who wish to give something to the wider public or community through their work.

==History==

Governing bodies have long provided core public services. The tradition of keeping citizens secure through organized military defence dates to at least four thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J53rAgAAQBAJ |title=The Power of the Bull |publisher=Routledge |location=London |last1=Rice |first1=Michael |page=13 |date=1998 |isbn=978-1-317-72583-1 |quote=As the more advanced social institutions began to take shape they contributed to some counterbalancing of the essential insecurity of man's condition. It was inevitable that ambitious and assertive men should see an opportunity for establishing for themselves positions of power and influence. No doubt many such occasions had their origins in a genuine concern for the public good [...] The position of [...] the war-band leader as the strong arm of the community's defence would increasingly be confirmed by the subjection of the community to the members of what [...] were becoming, demonstrably, elites, [...] This period, embracing part of the fifth and all of the fourth and third millennia before the present era, is absolutely pivotal to the development of the modern world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining order through local delegated authority originated at least as early as the [[Warring States period]] (5th to 3rd centuries BCE) in ancient China with the institution of ''xian'' (prefectures) under the control of a centrally-appointed prefect. Historical evidence of state provision of [[dispute resolution]] through a legal/justice system goes back at least as far as ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3pmDAAAQBAJ |title=Law's Political Foundations: Rivers, Rifles, Rice, and Religion |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=Cheltemham, Gloucestershire |last1=Haley |first1=John O. |pages=43-44 |date=2016 |isbn=978-1-78536-850-9 |quote=Pharaonic Egypt epitomizes a regulatory, public law regime. [...] The principal function of this elaborate apparatus was to maintain order and security, and, above all, to acquire as much of the surplus agricultural wealth and labor as possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary public service in ancient history involved ensuring the general favor of the [[gods]] through a theologically and ceremonially correct [[state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcvZCgAAQBAJ |title=The Cambridge Companion to Political Theology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |last1=Hovey |first1=Craig |last2=Phillips |first2=Elizabeth |page=4-5 |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-107-05274-1 |quote=To ensure the favor of the gods was the preeminent task of ancient rulers worldwide, for they all were priestly kings. The Roman Caesar was the ''pontifex maximus'' of Rome's state god. The Chinese emperor certainly stood over his subjects as 'Son of Heaven,' but if he fell into disfavor with heaven and his country was visited by famine, plague, earthquakes, and floods, he could be overthrown. The Moloch of Carthage demanded children as sacrifices; the Aztecs and Mayas offered their Gods still-quivering hearts. These political religions were ''do ut des'' religions in which the relationship between deity and worshippers was one of contractual exchange.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread provision of [[public utility|public utilities]] as public services in developed countries usually began in the late nineteenth century, often with the [[municipal]] development of [[gas]] and [[water]] services. Later, governments began to provide other services such as [[electricity]] and [[healthcare]]. In most developed countries local or national governments continue to provide such services, the biggest exceptions being the [[United States|U.S.]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where private provision is arguably proportionally more significant.{{citation needed|reason=Compare: National Health Service in the UK|date=March 2015}} Nonetheless, such privately provided public services are often strongly regulated, for example (in the US) by [[Public Utility Commission]]s.

In [[developing countries]] public services tend to be much less well developed. For example, water services might only be available to the [[wealthy]] [[middle class]]. For [[political]] reasons the service is often [[subsidized]], which reduces the finance potentially available for expansion to [[Poverty|poorer]] communities.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Nationalization==
{{main|Nationalization}}
Nationalization took off following the [[World War]]s of the first half of the twentieth century. Across [[Europe]], because of the extreme demands on industries and the economy, [[central planning]] was required to make production maximally efficient. Many public services, especially electricity, gas and public transport are products of this era. Following the Second World War, many countries also began to implement [[universal health care]] and expanded [[education]] under the funding and guidance of the state.

==Privatization==
[[File:A group of Damas de Rojo.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Chile]]an 'Damas de Rojo', volunteers on their local hospital.]]
{{main|Privatization}}
There are several ways to privatize public services. A free-market corporation may be established and sold to private investors, relinquishing government control altogether. Thus it becomes a private (not public) service. Another option, used in the [[Nordic countries]], is to establish a corporation, but keep ownership or voting power essentially in the hands of the government. For example, the [[Finland|Finnish state]] owned 49% of [[Kemira]] until 2007, the rest being owned by private investors. A 49% share did not make it a "government enterprise", but it meant that all other investors together would have to oppose the state's opinion in order to overturn the state's decisions in the shareholder's meeting. Regulated corporation can also acquire permits on the agreement that they fulfill certain public service duties. When a private corporation runs a [[natural monopoly]], then the corporation is typically heavily regulated, to prevent abuse of monopoly power. Lastly, the government can buy the service on the free market. In many countries, [[medication]] is provided in this manner: the government reimburses part of the price of the medication. Also, bus traffic, electricity, healthcare and waste management are privatized in this way. One recent innovation, used in the UK increasingly as well as Australia and Canada is [[public-private partnership]]s. This involves giving a long lease to private consortia in return for partly funding infrastructure.

[[File:Erddig Mortar making machine - geograph.org.uk - 351058.jpg|thumb|An old fashioned type of pug mill in Wales. Attribution: Betty Longbottom, geograph.org.uk - 351058]]
A '''pugmill''' or '''pug mill''' is a machine in which clay or other materials are mixed into a plastic state or a similar machine for the [[trituration]] of ore.&lt;ref&gt;"Pug-mill" def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; Industrial applications are found in [[pottery]], [[brick]]s, [[cement]] and some parts of the [[concrete]] and [[asphalt]] mixing processes. A pugmill may be a fast continuous mixer. A continuous pugmill can achieve a thoroughly mixed, homogeneous mixture in a few seconds, and the right machines can be matched to the right application by taking into account the factors of agitation, drive assembly, inlet, discharge, cost and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bulk-solids-handling.com/?q=topics/processing/mixing-blending/pugmill-mixer-selection-guide {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101542/http://www.bulk-solids-handling.com/?q=topics%2Fprocessing%2Fmixing-blending%2Fpugmill-mixer-selection-guide |date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing materials at optimum moisture content requires the forced mixing action of the pugmill paddles, while soupy materials might be mixed in a drum mixer. A typical pugmill consists of a horizontal boxlike chamber with a top inlet and a bottom discharge at the other end, 2 shafts with opposing paddles, and a drive assembly. Some of the factors affecting mixing and residence time are the number and the size of the paddles, paddle swing arc, overlap of left and right swing arc, size of mixing chamber, length of pugmill floor, and material being mixed.

==Common construction and industrial uses==

Road Base - Dense well-graded aggregate, uniformly mixed, wetted, and densely compacted for building the foundation under a pavement.

Lime Addition to asphalt – Lime may be added to the cold feed of an [[asphalt plant]] to strengthen the binding properties of the asphalt.

Flyash Conditioning – Wetting [[fly ash]] in a pugmill to stabilize the ash so that it won’t create dust. Some flyashes have cementitious properties when wetted and can be used to stabilize other materials.

Waste stabilization – various waste streams are remediated with pugmills forcing the mixing of the wastes with remediation agents.

[[Roller-compacted concrete]] – (RCC) or rolled concrete is a special blend of concrete that has the same ingredients as conventional concrete but in different ratios. It has cement, water, and aggregates, but RCC is much drier and essentially has no slump. RCC is placed in a manner similar to paving, often by dump trucks or conveyors, spread by bulldozers or special modified asphalt pavers. After placement it is compacted by vibratory rollers.  
The “stiff” nature of RCC may require a paddle type pugmill to force the materials to mix completely and discharge easily.

[[Ceramic]]s pug mills, or commonly just "pugs", are not used to grind or mix, rather they extrude clay bodies prior to shaping processes. Some can be fitted with a vacuum system that ensures the extruded clay bodies have no entrapped air. According to the 1913 edition of [[Webster's Dictionary]], a clay pug mill typically consists of an upright shaft armed with projecting knives, which is caused to revolve in a hollow cylinder, tub, or vat, in which the clay body is placed.

Pugmills that run intermittently are used in the [[kaolin]] mining industry to mix certain grades of [[kaolin]] clay with water.

==Biography==

It is located roughly 20&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Malmö]] and 10&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Lund]]. He was raised by his mother, father and has one younger sister.

==The Pan Capital Group==
Upon graduation from Lund University, Sandå commenced his professional career in the financial world as an institutional broker at [[Stockholm]] Brokerage. His strengths and prowess were recognized early, especially by trading director Bo Mattsson. When Mattsson was recruited to [[Swedbank]] in 1990, he brought Sandå with him as an institutional broker with the intention to further develop Sandå’s potential and talent.

During his employment at Swedbank, Sandå and colleague Bengt Larsson attended Tony Saliba’s trading school in Chicago for three months in 1991. The knowledge Sandå gained here greatly influenced the success he went on to experience. Sandå and Larsson returned to Swedbank and commenced building the trading department. The duo expanded to include Claes-Henrik Julander, Henrik Hedman, Magnus Hedman, Fredrik Landin, and Richard Warneker. The close-knit group’s practice of aggressive trading brought the company increased market share as well as earnings.
 
In September 1996, the group joined Rivus, a subsidiary of Oresund, but after building up the company, Sandå and the group moved on to a new partner. The group’s next partnership began in 1997 with [[Erik Penser]], Swedish financier and businessman. The group established Pan Capital in 1998 and their joint venture with Penser resulted in earning Penser a very healthy profit. Their relationship lasted until 2009 when the partners split up and Pan Capital &lt;ref name="Beyond the Swedish financial miracle"&gt;[http://www.affarsvarlden.se/hem/nyheter/article2593557.ece Beyond the Swedish financial miracle], ''Affärsvärldens'' Website&lt;/ref&gt; became independent.

The company now has offices in Stockholm and Florida.&lt;ref name="Hotels and trading attracts Pan Capital to Florida"&gt;[http://www.va.se/nyheter/2013/01/28/hotell-och-trading-lockar-pan-capital-till-florida/ Hotels and trading attracts Pan Capital to Florida], ''Veckans Affärer'' Website&lt;/ref&gt; Pan Capital is extremely private about its business practices and tries to keep out of the public eye.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2015}} According to [[Affärsvärlden]], a Swedish business magazine, “the company is a member of several of the world's major stock exchanges, with about 95 per cent of their transactions are made outside Sweden.”

In September 2013, Pan Capital, along with 22 other investment firms were charged with "violating a rule that prohibits firms from shorting a stock within a five-day window of a public offering, and then buying the same security through the offering."&lt;ref name="U.S. SEC charges 23 firms in short-sale crackdown; 22 settle"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/17/us-sec-shortselling-idUSBRE98G0TP20130917 U.S. SEC charges 23 firms in short-sale crackdown; 22 settle] ''Reuters''&lt;/ref&gt; Pan Capital settled the charges and agreed to pay back profits made from the stock and the fines to the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] which totaled over $660,000.&lt;ref name="ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING File No. 3, 15492 In the Matter of PAN CAPITAL AB"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2013/34-70409.pdf ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING File No. 3, 15492 In the Matter of PAN CAPITAL AB] ''[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The village's title comes from the name of the zoning district: North Beach Residential Area.

Most of the properties purchased by Pan Capital are 1950’s mid-century modern hotels and resorts. Sandå &lt;ref name="Pär becomes obsessed and learn all about it"&gt;[http://www.va.se/nyheter/2013/01/28/par-blir-helt-besatt-och-lar-sig-allt-om-det/ Pär becomes obsessed and learn all about it], ''Veckans Affärer'' Website&lt;/ref&gt; is redeveloping the area, renovating and updating the properties one by one, re-opening them as distinctive boutique hotels, each with their own personality and theme.

The North Beach Village Resorts offer a mixture of accommodations catering to families and singles in addition to [[LGBT tourism]] travelers.

The work in progress is intended to be a pedestrian friendly European-style village area where visitors and locals alike can stroll along streets lined with art galleries, cafes, and retail shops. Sandå wishes to make the cornerstones of this project - peace, love and happiness - evident in all facets of the North Beach Village.

'''Raja Pervaiz Ashraf''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|راجہ پرویز اشرف}}}}; born 26 December 1950), is a [[businessman]], [[agriculturist]], and [[politician]] who served as 19th [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] from 22 June 2012 until completing his designated term on 16 March 2013.&lt;ref name="Raja Pervez Ashraf elected PM"&gt;{{cite news|title=Raja Pervez Ashraf declared new Pakistani PM|url=http://dawn.com/2012/06/22/parliament-begins-new-pm-election/|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN]] |date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pmo.gov.pk/former_pms.php|title=FORMER PRIME MINISTERS |publisher=pmo.gov.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently resides in Sanghar House,[[ Gujar Khan Tehsil|Gujar Khan]].

Prior to be elevated as Prime minister, he previously served as the [[Minister for Water and Power (Pakistan)|Minister for Water and Power]] in the [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]]-led government from March 2008 to February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\04\01\story_1-4-2008_pg1_5 |title=24-member federal cabinet takes oath|newspaper=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]| first=Sajjad|last=Malik|accessdate=1 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A senior-ranking leader in the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) from [[Rawalpindi District]], Ashraf assumed premiership on 22 June 2012 after Yousaf Raza Gillani was disqualified over [[contempt of court]] charges. Shortlisted by the PPP as a candidate for the post, he was eventually elected based on a 211–89 vote in the National Assembly. Tackling the corruption scandals, one of the major achievements during his premiership was his interest to develop and implement hydro projects in particular Neelum-Jhelum project of 970 MW.

The project had received a big jolt when the Chinese Exim Bank refused to release $448 million loan linking it to the restoration of the Safe City Project in Islamabad which has been stopped by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-20043-Rs24-bn-diverted-to-Neelum-Jhelum-project |title=Rs24 bn diverted to Neelum-Jhelum project|work=[[The News International]]|date=6 January 2013|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure [[Water and Power Development Authority]] (WAPDA) had launched a number of mega and medium-sized projects in [[Gilgit–Baltistan]].&lt;ref name="pakobserver.net"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=198920 |title=PPP govt pursuing multi-pronged strategy for GB development|work=[[Pakistan Observer]]|date=6 March 2013|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report opined that Ashraf's performance as minister was "tainted by failures to overcome the power shortfall that continued to aggravate even after he was replaced" and that his actions and responses both inside and outside the National Assembly had "not been translated into actions" &lt;ref name= "dailytimes"/&gt; Nevertheless, about 3,570 megawatts of power was added to the national grid during the PPP government, a major portion of which came during Ashraf's term in office. His term is said to have overseen relatively more megawatts being added to the national grid when compared to other ministers of power and energy since [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s last government.&lt;ref name="dailytimes"/&gt; He was accused of receiving kickbacks in the rental power projects, and of using illegal money to buy foreign property.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; Ashraf denied the charges, and as of June 2012, was defending himself before the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; No official charges have been framed against him as no evidence could be presented so far.

One of the main reasons for power crisis, which have never received due attention and focus is the circular debt and which continued to increase over the years. The government has time and again tried to clear the circular debt, however it comes again. This is because of the structural issues including power theft,  poor recovery from other government departments, difference between cost of generation and actual cost charged to customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=: [https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/05/pakistan’s-energy-crisis] |title=Pakistan’s energy crisis Power politics|work=[[The Economist]]|date=21 May 2012|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During Ashraf`s government prioritised hydro power projects in particular Neelum Jhelum 970 MW. During his term, WAPDA initiated several hydro projects in Gilgit Baltistan (GB) including the Satpara Dam having 17 MW power generation capacity and 0.093 million acre feetwater storage capacity and Diamer-Bhasha Dam having 4,500 MW power generation capacity and 8.1 million acre feet water storage capacity, along with hydropower projects of 7,100 MW Bunji, 34 MW Harpo, 80 MW Phandar and 40 MW Basho.&lt;ref name="pakobserver.net"/&gt;

Hydro power is the cheapest energy source and as Minister and PM he gave special attention, however hydro power projects take long time to complete and the electricity from the projects will be available after 10 years. In order to resolve short term energy crisis, Ashraf implemented power project on rental basis, following the rental policy approved in Mushrrafs tenure. However the projects became controversial.

==Prime Minister of Pakistan==

===Early days===
On 26 April 2012, Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] was convicted of being in contempt of court for refusing to bring charges against President [[Asif Ali Zardari]]. On 19 June 2012, Gillani was retroactively ruled ineligible to hold the office by the Supreme Court. The ruling [[Pakistan People's Party]] nominated textile minister [[Makhdoom Shahabuddin]] to replace Gillani, but the nomination failed when the [[Anti-Narcotics Force]] issued a warrant for Shahabuddin's arrest on drug charges.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Ashraf was then selected as the party's next option.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

On 22 June 2012, Raja Pervez Ashraf was elected [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] of [[Pakistan]] by a 211–89 vote.&lt;ref name="Raja Pervez Ashraf elected PM"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Raja-Pervez-Ashraf-elected-new-PM-of-Pakistan/articleshow/14342856.cms| title=Raja Pervez Ashraf elected new PM of Pakistan| newspaper=[[The Times of India]]| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622181805/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Raja-Pervez-Ashraf-elected-new-PM-of-Pakistan/articleshow/14342856.cms| archivedate=22 June 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashraf and his cabinet were sworn in on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-55575-Raja-Parvaiz-Ashraf-and-federal-cabinet-to-take-oath-tonight|newspaper=[[The News International]]|title=Raja Pervaiz to be sworn in tonight| date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His selection as Prime Minister restored the country's government after several days of turmoil where officially the country was without a government.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|title=Raja Pervaiz Ashraf Is Pakistan's New Prime Minister|author=Rebecca Santana|author2=Chris Brummitt|author3=Zarar Khan|date=22 June 2012|agency=Associated Press|work=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/22/raja-pervaiz-ashraf-pakistan-prime-minister_n_1618675.html|accessdate=23 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803061417/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/22/raja-pervaiz-ashraf-pakistan-prime-minister_n_1618675.html|archivedate=3 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] said Ashraf's election was "unlikely to calm the tensions roiling the country" and noted that many observers expected him be eventually be ousted like his predecessor.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Political analyst Raza Rumi said Ashraf was likely chosen by the PPP because they knew he would not last long.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; On 24 July 2012, the Government informed the Supreme Court, one day before expiry of the court's deadline, that it has not taken a decision on reopening of the graft cases against President Zardari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-gilani-ashraf-defies-pak-sc-order-to-reopen-case-against-zardari/978742/0|title= After Gilani, Ashraf defies Pak SC order to reopen case against Zardari|date= 24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socioeconomic challenges===

Immediately after his election, Ashraf said that the economy, inflation, and the country's power crisis would be his top concerns. "Our country cannot afford politics of confrontation at this time," he said.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;  Within 24 hours of being elected, Ashraf held a meeting to resolve the energy crisis in the country and directed the Ministry of Petroleum to ensure the supply of 28,000 tonnes of fuel daily to power plants, so as to add 1200 mega watts to the national grid system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/398102/first-task-prime-minister-ashraf-calls-conference-on-energy-crisis/|title=Ensure 28000 tonnes per day fuel to power plants: Ashraf|work=The Express Tribune|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were power protests erupting throughout the country for continual load shedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-7-118582-Power-protesters-block-roads-as-PM-visits-Peshawar|title=Power protesters block roads as PM visits Peshawar|work=The News|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pakistan Economy Watch]]  (PEW) was critical of this renewed focus on energy, calling it a "useless effort" with the president of PEW, Murtaza Mughal, remarking that load shedding had only "increased in the harrowing summer", making life difficult for the ordinary citizen; Mughal further noted that the announcement of adding more fuel into independent power producers had been portrayed positively, despite the fact that the actual problem did not lie in scarcity of fuel but rather in non-payment of dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/403718/energy-woes-pms-efforts-unproductive-says-pew/|title=Energy woes: PM’s efforts unproductive, says PEW|work=The Express Tribune|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesspeople and economists in Pakistan had a mixed response to Ashraf's appointment; while some appreciated the prime minister's focus on the energy crisis and hoped for greater cooperation between key institutions and political parties as being good for economic stability, others questioned his reputation related to rental power and expressed anxiety over the government's ongoing clash with the judiciary which could cause uncertainty and scare businesses away. A government official praised the smooth transition of power and said that the country's economic policy would stay the same, adding that the government's economic team will carry on with implementing the [[2012 Pakistan federal budget|budget]] and other economic functions as present before Gillani's disqualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=516508&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=41&amp;parent_id=23|title=Business community expects no wonders from PM Raja|work=[[Gulf Times]]|date=3 July 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an initiative to overcome the energy crises, Ashraf announced his intention to build several small dams across the country. He said that these projects would start from his native Potohar plateau, as part of a development programme for the Potohar region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/405258/pm-ashraf-wants-small-dams-to-meet-power-needs/|title=PM Ashraf wants small dams to meet power needs|work=The Express Tribune|date=8 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from energy, he identified the deteriorating law and order situation of Karachi, especially with regards to [[Target killings in Karachi|target killings]], as a second major challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/06/26/news/national/energy-karachi-security-major-challenges-pm/|title=Energy, Karachi security major challenges: PM|work=[[Pakistan Today]]|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, during his maiden trip to [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], Ashraf announced a [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]] 2 billion development package for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/444249/pm-announces-rs2b-package-for-g-b/|title=PM announces Rs2b package for G-B|date=29 September 2012|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2012, The Supreme Court in its NRO implementation case order has ruled that Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf must write the letter to Swiss authorities to reopen graft cases against President Asif Ali Zardari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-58528-SC-orders-PM-Ashraf-to-write-letter-|title=SC orders PM Ashraf to write letter|work=The News International|date=12 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July 2012, The Supreme Court gave Raja Pervaiz Ashraf to 8 August 2012 to implement its order by writing a letter to Swiss authorities to reopen graft cases against President Asif Ali Zradari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-60410-NRO-Implementation:-SC-orders-PM-Ashraf-to-write-letter-by-August-8|title=NRO: PM ordered to write letter by Aug 8|work=The News International|date=25 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2012, the supreme court adjourned the hearing till 18 September 2012

===Political developments===
Three days after his election, Ashraf visited [[Nine Zero]] and met with leaders of the [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]] in Karachi. He also visited the leader of the [[Pakistan Muslim League (F)]]. The visits were seen as part of a fresh move to reaffirm ties with coalition political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dawn.com/2012/06/25/pm-ashraf-visits-nine-zero-kingri-house-during-karachi-visit/|title=PM Ashraf visits Nine Zero, Kingri House during Karachi visit|work=Dawn|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first significant milestone Ashraf performed after taking charge of his office was an approval for the creation of a post of [[Deputy Prime Minister of Pakistan]] to fulfill a demand of the coalition party [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)]] (PML-Q). The post was inaugurated on 25 June and [[Chaudhry Pervez Elahi]] of PML-Q was appointed as the first deputy prime minister of the country.&lt;ref name="demands_fulfilled"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dawn.com/2012/06/25/demands-fulfilled-15-ministries-granted-to-pml-q/|title=PML-Q’s demands fulfilled; Elahi made Deputy PM, 15 ministries granted|work=Dawn|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the position is largely symbolic and has no legal constitutional duties.

On 27 June 2012, the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] gave prime minister Ashraf two weeks to indicate whether he would ask Swiss authorities to reopen [[corruption]] cases against president Zardari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=162193|title=SC wants Swiss letter by PM in two weeks|work=[[Pak Observer]]|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ayl4EWFi?url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=162193|archivedate=27 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ashraf stated that his position on the issue was no different from that of previous prime minister Gillani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C06%5C27%5Cstory_27-6-2012_pg7_2|title=Petition filed against new PM over Swiss letter|work=Daily Times|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week of July, he directed attention on the [[Balochistan conflict]] and called for a high-level meeting to discuss the issue of [[Missing persons (Pakistan)|missing persons]] in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dunyanews.tv/index.php?key=Q2F0SUQ9MiNOaWQ9ODgwNDU=|title=High-level meeting on missing persons’ issue today|work=Dunya News|date=3 July 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week of July, Ashraf announced the government's plans to establish legislation which would remove the bar on dual nationality holders from contesting in elections. If passed, the legislation would enable [[Overseas Pakistanis]] holding dual nationalities eligible to participate in elections and hold public office. The enforcement of such a legislation remains a controversial issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C07%5C02%5Cstory_2-7-2012_pg1_3|title=Govt will bring law to allow dual nationals contest elections: PM|work=Daily Times|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a visit to [[Peshawar]] a few days later, where he met local politicians, during which he expressed his views on the parliament being "the mother of all institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/05-Jul-2012/parliament-is-the-mother-of-all-institutions-pm|title=Parliament is the mother of all institutions: PM|work=The Nation|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has praised the role of [[Democracy in Pakistan|democracy]] in creating an "independent media, judiciary and parliament." He further paid tribute to the [[Pakistan Army]] in its [[Pakistan's role in the War on Terror|role in the War on Terror]] and military operations in the troubled northwestern areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C07%5C11%5Cstory_11-7-2012_pg7_16|title=Independent media, judiciary, parliament fruits of democracy: PM|date=11 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fraud case against [[Asif Ali Zardari]], he indicated in September 2012 that he would be willing to open the pending fraud cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2012/09/20129181154102792.html|title=Pakistan to 'reopen Zardari fraud cases' – Central &amp; South Asia|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=18 September 2012|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
When commenting on [[Foreign relations of Pakistan|foreign policy]] after assuming premiership, Ashraf said that he wanted to deal with the [[United States]] on "an equal footing".&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; However, he will likely have to deal with the court's demands to charge Zardari before doing much else.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] of [[India]] congratulated Ashraf shortly after his election, and anticipated greater progress in bilateral [[India–Pakistan relations|relations between the two countries]] during Ashraf's term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pmindia.nic.in/press-details.php?nodeid=1453|title=PM congratulates Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf|work=[[Prime Minister's Office (India)]]|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government greeted Ashraf and pledged [[China–Pakistan relations|closer ties with Pakistan]] to strengthen their "all-weather friendship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-06-25/news/32409313_1_yousuf-raza-gilani-ministry-spokesman-hong-lei-friendly-neighbour|title=China greets new Pakistan PM Raja Pervez Ashraf; pledges close partnership|work=The Economic Times|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable messages of congratulation came from U.S.&amp;nbsp;Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] and Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-56909-Clinton-hopes-relations-will-improve-during-PM-Raja-Pervaiz's-tenure|title=Hillary Clinton calls PM Raja Pervaiz|work=Dawn|date=1 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.gov.af/en/news/10794|title=President Karzai Congratulates Pakistan’s New Prime Minister|work=Office of the President of Afghanistan|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2012, several [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Tehrik-i-Taliban]] militants from Afghanistan entered Pakistan's [[Durand Line|bordering]] [[FATA|tribal areas]] killing 13 Pakistani troops, of which seven were beheaded. During the conflict, Pakistani troops killed fourteen of the raiding militants. The attack, one of several such [[Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes|cross-border skirmishes]], was strongly condemned with Raja Pervaiz Ashraf stating that the matter would be directly taken to Afghan president Hamid Karzai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/26/militants-behead-pakistani-troops-afghanistan|title=Militants 'behead Pakistani troops after crossing border from Afghanistan'|work=The Guardian|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/world/asia/taliban-kill-13-soldiers-in-pakistan-raid.html|title=Taliban Kill 13 Soldiers in Pakistan Raid|work=The New York Times|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/410064/cross-border-attacks-high-on-agenda-for-ashrafs-afghanistan-tour/|title=Cross-border attacks high on agenda for Ashraf's Afghanistan tour|work=The Express Tribune|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his stand on the [[Kashmir conflict]] with India, Ashraf has categorically stated that Pakistan would continue providing moral, political, and diplomatic support to the [[Kashmiri people]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] until a solution was to be reached for the issue in accordance with UN&amp;nbsp;resolutions and Kashmiri aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-06/pakistan/32565564_1_kashmir-issue-indian-counterpart-ranjan-mathai-india-and-pakistan|title=Pakistan to continue support to Kashmir cause: PM Raja Pervez Ashraf|work=The Times of India|date=6 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/410381/pm-ashraf-calls-for-resolving-tensions-with-india/|title=PM Ashraf calls for resolving tensions with India|work=The Express Tribune|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=19 July 2012|first=A. H.|last=Nizami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashraf is expected to visit [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], to hold talks with the Afghan leadership on the peace process in Afghanistan amidst the ongoing Afghan war and to discuss the status of Afghan-led reconciliation with the [[Afghan Taliban]]. The visit comes at a time when Pakistan's relations with the United States have improved in the aftermath of the 2011 NATO attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/406063/pm-ashraf-to-visit-kabul-to-expedite-peace-efforts/|title=PM Ashraf to visit Kabul to expedite peace efforts|work=The Express Tribune|date=10 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July, he performed a two-day state visit to [[Saudi Arabia]], his first official tour since becoming prime minister. During the visit, he would perform [[Umrah]], meet with King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]], discuss the status of [[Pakistan-Saudi Arabia relations|relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia]] and also meet members of the [[Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia|Pakistani community in Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=58966|title=GeoTV Geo News Latest News Breaking News Pakistan Live Videos|work=geo.tv|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his visit to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], in late July 2012, Ashraf met with Karzai government officials and engaged in talks with the two main opposition leaders [[Abdullah Abdullah]] from the [[National Coalition of Afghanistan]] and [[Ahmad Zia Massoud]] from the [[National Front of Afghanistan]]. Among other things they discussed the need for increased and regular dialogue between leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etelaf-melli.com/contents.php?lang=fa&amp;section=interviews&amp;id=591 Ashraf in Kabul] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130122154401/http://www.etelaf-melli.com/contents.php?lang=fa&amp;section=interviews&amp;id=591 |date=22 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March, the apex court had directed the National Accountability Bureau to proceed against those who were in the post of minister for water and power from 2006 till the next general elections. As a result, on 20 April, NAB issued arrest warrants for 33 persons, including Ashraf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2013/01/15/supreme-court-orders-to-arrest-prime-minister-raja-pervez-ashraf/ |title=Rental power case: Supreme Court orders to arrest Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf |publisher=The News Tribe |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Arrest order===
On 15 January 2013, the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ordered the arrest of Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for alleged [[Political corruption|corruption]] as Ashraf was accused of [[kickbacks]] from rental [[Power station|power plants]] that were part of a project intended to serve as part of the solution to Pakistan's power problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Alex|title=Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf ordered arrested|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/15/world/la-fg-pakistan-corruption-20130116|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media derided Raja Pervaiz Ashraf as ''Rental Raja''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awaztoday.com/News-Talk-Shows/24470/Raja-Pervaiz-Ashraf-Raja-Rental-History.aspx Raja Pervaiz Ashraf ‘Raja Rental’ History]&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest order came at the same time as the [[Long March (Pakistan)|Long March]] culminated in the national capital of [[Islamabad]]. None of the accused in the rental case has been convicted so far. The rental power case is pending with independent Supreme court for nearly four years and no conviction has been made. Ashraf has time and again demanded clearance of his name and denies all the charges. Ashraf in his appearance in the Supreme Court categorically denied such charges and offered his complete cooperation  with all authorities and courts.  A member of the ruling [[Pakistan People's Party]] referred to the arrest order as "a conspiracy" while Pakistan's interior minister [[Rehman Malik]], claimed that "Even after this order, (Ashraf) is the prime minister and, God willing, he will continue as prime minister."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Habib|first=Nasir|title=Pakistani Supreme Court orders arrest of prime minister in corruption case|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/15/world/asia/pakistan-politics/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=17 January 2013|author2=Jethro Mullen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Accountability Bureau|accountability court]] in Islamabad [[Indictment|indicted]] former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] Raja Pervez Ashraf and six others in the rental power case on 16 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/islamabad/17-Jan-2014/raja-pervez-ashraf-indicted-in-rental-power-case|title=Raja Pervez Ashraf indicted in rental power case|date=17 January 2014|work=The Nation|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Nepotism===
Raja Pervez Ashraf appointed his son-in-law Raja Azeem in World Bank (Executive Director-Pakistan and others) in violation of rules and an example of Nepotism prevalent in Pakistani political elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/480045/pm-appoints-son-in-law-to-key-world-bank-post/|title=PM appoints son-in-law to key World Bank post|date=15 December 2012|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roberto Luiz Justus''' (born 30 April 1955) is a [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] businessman and television personality.

==Biography and career==
Justus was born in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], to a Jewish [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] immigrant family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/carnaval/2012/noticia/2012/02/rosas-de-ouro-vai-homenagear-povo-hungaro-no-anhembi.html|title=Rosas de Ouro vai homenagear povo húngaro no Anhembi|date=7 February 2012|publisher=G1|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for ''O Aprendiz'', which is the Brazilian version of [[The Apprentice (TV series)]]. He married  Ticiane Pinheiro who is the daughter [[Helô Pinheiro]], a Brazilian socialite. The couple, who divorced in 2013, have one daughter, Rafaella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://diversao.terra.com.br/gente/nao-tenho-trauma-de-casamento-diz-ticiane-pinheiro,809df60b92693410VgnVCM3000009af154d0RCRD.html|title="Não tenho trauma de casamento", diz Ticiane Pinheiro|date=15 January 2014|publisher=[[Terra Networks]]|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosts the TV show ''[[1 vs. 100|Um Contra Cem]]'' on [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]] and ''Roberto Justus +'' on [[Rede Record|Record]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3681">'''''SEMMA''''' is an  acronym that stands for ''Sample'', ''Explore'', ''Modify'', ''Model'', and ''Assess''. It is a list of sequential steps developed by [[SAS Institute]], one of the largest producers of [[statistics]] and [[business intelligence]] software. It guides the implementation of [[data mining]] applications.&lt;ref name="AzevedoSantos"&gt;Azevedo, A. and Santos, M. F.

==Background==
In the expanding field of data mining, there has been a call for a standard methodology or a simply list of [[best practices]] for the diversified and iterative process of data mining that users can apply to their data mining projects regardless of industry. While the [[Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining]] or CRISP-DM, founded by the [[European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology]] initiative, aimed to create a neutral methodology, SAS also offered a pattern to follow in its data mining tools.

==Phases of SEMMA==
The phases of SEMMA and related tasks are the following:&lt;ref name="sasweb"/&gt;
* '''Sample'''. The process starts with [[sampling (statistics)|data sampling]], e.g., selecting the data set for modeling. The data set should be large enough to contain sufficient information to retrieve, yet small enough to be used efficiently. This phase also deals with data partitioning.
* '''Explore'''. This phase covers the understanding of the data by discovering anticipated and unanticipated relationships between the variables, and also abnormalities, with the help of [[data visualization]].
* '''Modify'''. The Modify phase contains methods to select, create and transform variables in preparation for data modeling.
* '''Model'''.  In the Model phase the focus is on applying various modeling (data mining) techniques on the prepared variables in order to create models that possibly provide the desired outcome.
* '''Assess'''. The last phase is Assess. The evaluation of the modeling results shows the reliability and usefulness of the created models.

==Criticism==
SEMMA mainly focuses on the modeling tasks of data mining projects, leaving the business aspects out (unlike, e.g., CRISP-DM and its Business Understanding phase). Additionally, SEMMA is designed to help the users of the SAS Enterprise Miner software. Therefore, applying it outside Enterprise Miner can be ambiguous.&lt;ref name="RohanizadehMoghadam"&gt;Rohanizadeh, S. S. and Moghadam, M. B.

'''Silicon Taiga''' is a [[nickname]] for [[Akademgorodok]], a [[Russia]]n research and development center that is located near [[Novosibirsk]]. The nickname is a reference to the [[Silicon Valley]], a renowned IT region found in [[Northern California]]. The term was first introduced to the Western press by [[Newsweek|Newsweek magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;Newsweek magazine, [http://www.newsweek.com/1999/05/02/better-spell-it-cyberia.html First mention of Silicon Taiga in press], May 03, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999.

== Location ==

The town is situated partly on the [[Ob River|River Ob]], and partly on the shore of a [[Novosibirsk reservoir|Novosibirsk artificial reservoir]] that was created by a [[dam]] on the river. Informally, this reservoir is called the [[Ob Sea]]. The dam contains a large [[hydroelectric power plant]] that was constructed in the 1950s.

The town itself has no skyscrapers, and only one remote speedway connecting it to the city of Novosibirsk. Office buildings and residences are connected by many intertwined, footworn paths.

==History==
In the 1950s the former [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] founded its Siberian Division, today known as the [[Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], with a center of [[scientific research]] in Akademgorodok, where they established a dozen research institutes. To keep institutes supplied with fresh minds, [[Novosibirsk State University]] (NSU) was founded by the resolution of the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR]] on January 9, 1958.

===Distinctive===
The distinctive feature of NSU is its system of competitive selection and its training of talented youth. NSU is the only university in Siberia to have developed a multilevel model of continuing education. The University was built and developed simultaneously with the Novosibirsk scientific center and is focused on training highly qualified specialists for scientific work and tutoring. Since its foundation in 1958, more than fifty thousand specialists graduated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/university/463/novosibirsk-state-university NSU on QS World University Rankings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201141934/http://topuniversities.com/university/463/novosibirsk-state-university |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from Novosibirsk State University; more than six thousand have defended their [[PhD]] dissertations, and over one thousand five hundred have received [[doctor of science|doctoral degrees]]. In 2009, NSU achieved the status of a national research university. This high honor was granted by the [[Russian Government]] on a competitive basis for a period of ten years.

===Information Technology Outsourcing===
The first [[Information Technology Outsourcing|IT]] companies were established in Akademgorodok in the 1990s. After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the government's investments into scientific activity were greatly reduced, and many scientists left long established institutions on a quest for better conditions. Some of these scientists decided to leave Russia in search of jobs in foreign scientific organizations all over the world. Others established their own [[private business]]es, which were [[software]]-related [[High tech|high-tech]] IT companies. Many of these companies grew up into large, internationally recommended providers of software products and services. Their strategy was simple: the new IT companies would adopt the tried and true principles of the already established, famous IT corporations.

All IT companies in the Silicon Taiga can be divided into the two categories according to the [[offshore programming]] [[business model]] they employ: The firms that provide [[Offshore Development Center]] (ODC), and mostly develop new custom products ([[New product development|NPD]]), and the firms that are oriented to the [[Software as a service|SAAS]] model. Meantime the global giants in the field of software and high-tech products, such as [[IBM]], [[Intel Corporation]], and [[Schlumberger]], saw this growing trend and established [[branch office]]s in the Silicon Taiga.

===Innovative technology park===
The summer of 2010 saw the launch of an innovative technology park&lt;ref&gt;[http://marchmontnews.com/story.php?story_id=9924&amp;story=Novosibirsk%92s-Akademgorodok-eyes-$5m-nano-center Novosibirsk’s Akademgorodok eyes $5m nano-center]&lt;/ref&gt; in Akademgorodok, which brought together economic and intellectual power in the area, thus expanding innovation in Russia. Today, the Silicon Taiga is not just a collection of IT companies; it is a beneficial environment, in which the Russian national system of innovations can continue to flourish.&lt;ref name="Venture investment"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marya Smorgonskaya|url=http://www.marchmontnews.com/journals/viewJournal.php?articleId=233|title=Novosibirsk Modern Technologies Venture investment|work=MarchmontNews.com|publisher=Marchmont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[simulation game]] is "a [[game]] that contains a mixture of [[game of skill|skill]], [[game of chance|chance]], and [[game of strategy|strategy]] to simulate an aspect of reality, such as a [[stock exchange]]". Similarly, Finnish author [[Virpi Ruohomäki]] states that "a simulation game combines the features of a game (competition, cooperation, rules, participants, roles) with those of a simulation (incorporation of critical features of reality). A game is a simulation game if its rules refer to an empirical model of reality."&lt;ref name="Riis"&gt;{{cite book | author= Ruohomaki, V. | title= Viewpoints on Learning and Education with Simulation Games in Simulation Games and Learning in Production Management edited by Jens O. Riis | publisher= Springer | year=1995| id=ISBN O-412-72100-7 | pages = 14–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A properly built simulation game used to teach or learn [[economics]] would closely follow the assumptions and rules of the [[Model (economics)|theoretical model]]s within this discipline.

==In economics education==

[[Economics education]] studies recommend the adoption of more active and collaborative learning methodologies (Greenlaw, 1999).&lt;ref name="Greenlaw"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Greenlaw, S.A.| year = 1999| title = Using groupware to enhance teaching and learning in undergraduate economics | journal = Journal of Economic Education | volume = 30 (Winter) | pages =33–42 | doi = 10.2307/1183031 | issue = 1 | jstor = 1183031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simkins (1999) stated "… ''teaching practices, which rely heavily on the lecture format, are not doing enough to develop students' cognitive learning skills, attract good students to economics, and motivate them to continue coursework in the discipline.''" (p. 278).&lt;ref name="Simkins"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Simkins, S.P.| year = 1999| title = Promoting active-student learning using the World Wide Web in economics courses| journal = Journal of Economic Education | volume = 30 (Summer) | pages =278–91 | doi = 10.2307/1183067 | issue = 3 | jstor = 1183067}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the results of a survey published in the American Economic Review by Allgood (2004) that shows that students "rarely take economics as a free elective – especially beyond  principles." (p.&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;ref name="Allgood"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allgood, S.Bosshardt, W., Van der Klaauw, W., and Watts, M. | year = 2004| title = What Students Remember and Say about College Economics Years Later| journal = American Economic Review | volume = 94 | pages =259–65 | doi = 10.1257/0002828041301731 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More is needed to be done in the classroom to excite students about economics education.

Simulations supplement the standard lecture.  Both computerized and non-computer based simulation and games show significant levels of growth in education (see Lean, Moizer, Towler, and Abbey, 2006;&lt;ref name="Lean"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lean, J., Moizer, M., Towler, C. A.| year = 2006| journal = Active Learning in Higher Education| title = Simulation and games | volume = 7 | pages =227–42 | issue=3 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00571951/document}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbins, Boehlje, Erickson and Taylor, 1995;&lt;ref name="Dobbins"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dobbins, C. L., Boehlje, M., Erickson, S., and Taylor, R. | year = 1995| title = Using Games to Teach Farm and Agribusiness Management| journal = Review of Agricultural Economics| volume = 17 | pages =247–55 | doi = 10.2307/1349570 | issue = 3 | jstor = 1349570}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gentry, 1990;.&lt;ref name="Gentry"&gt;{{cite book | author= Gentry, J. | title= Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning | publisher= ABSEL and Nichols/GP Publishing | year=1990| id=ISBN O-89397-369-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example in monopolistic competition==

Through a simulation game, students may participate directly in a market by managing a simulated firm and making decisions on price and production to maximize profits.  An excellent review of the use of a successful market simulation is given by Motahar (1994) in the Journal of Economics Education.&lt;ref name="Motahar"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Motahar, E. | year = 1994| title = Teaching Modeling and Simulation in Economics: A Pleasant Surprise | journal = Journal of Economics Education| volume = 25 | pages =335–342 | doi = 10.2307/1182981 | issue = 4 | jstor = 1182981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monopolistic competition simulation game can be used as an example in the standard economics classroom or for [[experimental economics]]. Economic experiments using monopolistic competition simulations can create real-world incentives that may be used in the teaching and learning of economics to help students better understand why markets and other exchange systems work the way they do.  An explanation of experimental economics is given by Roth (1995).
&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;{{cite book | author= Roth, A.E. | title= Introduction to experimental economics in The Handbook of Experimental Economics by Kagel, J.H. and Roth, A.E.| publisher= Princeton University Press | year=1995|  pages = 3–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assumptions of monopolistic competition'''

A simulation game in [[monopolistic competition]] needs to incorporate the standard theoretical assumptions of this market structure, including: 
* Many buyers and sellers
* Easy entry and exit
* Some degree of product differentiation
* Zero economic profits in the long-run

In a simulation of monopolistic competition, each firm must be small in size, and should not be able to influence the direction of the overall market.  Yet each firm has some control over price owing to product differentiation.  To be consistent with economic theory, the simulation model should allow entry of new firms to occur as long as profits are greater than normal, and economic profits exist. The entry of new firms will decrease the market price, and eventually cause economic profits to return to zero (see Baye, 2009).&lt;ref name="Baye"&gt;{{cite book | author=Baye, Michael | title= Managerial Economics and Business Strategy | publisher= McGraw-Hill/Irwin | year=2009| pages = 294–304 | isbn=978-0-07-337568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Controllable decisions in monopolistic competition'''

To simulate monopolistic competition, the controllable firm decisions of the participants (students) must include, at a minimum, those specified in the standard theoretical model, including (see Baye, 2009):&lt;ref name="Baye"/&gt; 
* Firm price
* Advertising
* Firm production
* Plant Size

'''Simulation game experience'''

From an educational point of view, students will have an "opportunity" to learn by their own observations and experience through participation in a simulation game (see Schmidt, 2003).&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00220480309595209 | author = Schmidt, Stephen J. | year = 2003| title = Active and cooperative learning using Web-based simulations | journal = Journal of Economics Education| volume = 34 | pages =151–167 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the theoretical model of monopolistic competition (see Baye, 2009),&lt;ref name="Baye"/&gt; student participants would observe and experience that their pricing decisions are controlled by the market. They would "experience" that in the simulation they would have to lower their firm's price to be competitive as new firms entered the market.  In the long-run, they would see the impact of changing plant size.  They would observe that the successful firms would take advantage of economies of scale, but would also be careful not to incur [[diseconomies of scale]] in the long-run.  Students would experience that economic profits cannot be maintained in the long-run. They would see, first hand, that their accounting profits will inevitably decline and move closer to normal profits.  This experience provides students an opportunity to learn (as a supplement to the lecture and readings) the economic messages of monopolistic competition.

== Example in Macroeconomics ==
In 2018, Harvard Business Publishing published "Macroeconomics Simulation: Econland". This 30-minute simulation brings economic policymaking to life by allowing students to make monetary and fiscal policy decisions and consider their impact on the economy of a fictional country. Students manage the economy through a 7-year business cycle in an effort to maximize the approval rating from their population. Exploring the trade-offs of economic policy decision-making and the effects of the global economic environment on a country, students consolidate their understanding of core macroeconomic concepts, including GDP, unemployment, inflation, and budget deficit. At a deeper level, students develop critical thinking skills and learn about economic modeling and system dynamics. The simulation won a Silver Medal at the International Serious Play Awards.

The '''Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science''' is a [[marketing research]] [[institute]] within the [[University of South Australia|School of Marketing]] at the [[University of South Australia]] in [[Adelaide]], Australia. It is an independent, not-for-profit institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitypanel.com.au/teatreegully/teatreegully/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502042944/http://www.communitypanel.com.au/teatreegully/teatreegully/about.html |archivedate=2 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously named the Marketing Science Centre, it was elevated to institute status in 2005 after recognition of over a decade of achievements. It is the first university institute devoted to marketing science. To signal the Institute's research [[philosophy]] it was renamed after two marketing academics, Professor [[Andrew Ehrenberg]] and Professor [[Frank Bass]]. Both Ehrenberg and Bass have championed the development of simple generalised laws that can be described mathematically and can be widely applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unisa.edu.au/ehrenberg-bass/about/history.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009175208/http://www.unisa.edu.au/ehrenberg-bass/about/history.asp |archivedate=9 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute aims to uncover law-like patterns and relationships and build empirically grounded theory to explain and predict buyer behaviour and brand performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unisa.edu.au/ehrenberg-bass/about/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009174624/http://www.unisa.edu.au/ehrenberg-bass/about/default.asp |archivedate=9 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute Director is Professor [[Byron Sharp]] and it is governed by three Advisory Boards that meet annually to discuss research directions and key priorities. These are held in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketingscience.info/Advisory/BoardMembers.html{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services provided==

===Corporate Sponsorship===
The Institute's research into marketing is sponsored by corporations such as The [[Coca-Cola Company]], [[Unilever]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] and [[Turner Broadcasting]] through the Corporate Sponsorship Program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketingscience.info/members/whojoins.htm{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[R&amp;D]] program has been established to research some of the fundamental issues of marketing and [[buyer behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/bus-ehrenberg/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical]] Generalisations have been established through this R&amp;D program. The Institute's Corporate Sponsors receive discoveries in reports and in-house briefings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketingscience.info/members/rd.html{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract Research===
Contract research is tailored to the client's specific needs and can be both [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative research|quantitative]]. The Institute interprets raw data and draws [[logical consequence|implications]] for marketing strategy. Most aspects of market research can be undertaken at the Institute as there is an in-house computer-assisted telephone survey facility. The Institute also runs focus groups, in-depth interviews, on-line surveys and undertakes [[mystery shopping]] research. There are experts in the areas of [[brand]]ing, [[advertising]], [[Mass media|media]], [[buyer behaviour]], [[pricing]], [[sustainable]] marketing, wine marketing and service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unisa.edu.au/research/concentrations/docs/UNIVSA_EB_Brochure.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203120457/http://unisa.edu.au/research/concentrations/docs/UNIVSA_EB_Brochure.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community Panel===
The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute in conjunction with six South Australian councils established the Community Panel. The joint-initiative with The [[City of Tea Tree Gully]], [[City of Burnside]], [[City of Unley]], [[City of Holdfast Bay]], [[City of Campbelltown (South Australia)|City of Campbelltown]] and [[City of West Torrens]] has been set up to allow the local community to participate in the council's decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communitypanel.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute establishes online surveys which are emailed to registered residents allowing them to participate. The response rate is around 90%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/councils-take-to-net/story-e6frgamf-1111116583981&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a new opportunity for residents to express their thoughts, ideas and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campbelltown.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1594 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112054941/http://www.campbelltown.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1594 |archivedate=12 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Wine Marketing &amp; Wine Tourism Database===
The Institute has established an online wine resource titled the International Wine Marketing &amp; Wine Tourism Database. It is a [[bibliographic]] database that [[Bibliographic index|indexes]] and [[abstracts]] articles from published material on all aspects of the global wine industry. Documents include journal articles, books, government publications, research reports, statistical documents and conference papers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winesea.unisa.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;

==International collaboration==

===Wharton Business School===
The Institute Director Professor [[Byron Sharp]], co-hosted an advertising conference with [[Jerry Wind|Professor Yoram (Jerry) Wind]] from [[The Wharton School]] in the US in December 2008. The conference explored the digital revolution within advertising and how advertising may work in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/sa-business-journal/unisa-wharton-to-unlock-future-of-ads/story-e6fredel-1111118501884&lt;/ref&gt; The event was attended by over 100 senior [[advertising professional]]s.

'''Venero Frank "Benny Eggs" Mangano''' (September 7, 1921 – August 18, 2017) was the [[underboss]] of the [[Genovese crime family]]. Since boss [[Daniel Leo (mobster)|Daniel "Danny the Lion" Leo]] was imprisoned in 2007, Mangano was the family's senior leader outside prison. The nickname "Benny Eggs" came from his mother running an egg farm. He was released from prison on November 2, 2006, after serving a 15-year sentence for [[extortion]].

==Business interests==
Venero Mangano was related to [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[Vincent Mangano]] (1888–1951), [[Philip Mangano]], [[Lawrence Mangano]] and Anthony Mangano. Venero Mangano was listed as a [[caporegime]] twice by the [[New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement]] in a 1987 exclusion order.

Mangano was for several years an independent [[wholesaler]] and the head of a surplus stock distribution company; one of his prominent customers was [[Calvin Klein]].  During this time, Venero even became friends with Klein's business partner, [[Barry K. Schwartz]].

During [[World War II]], Mangano served as a bomber [[tail gunner]] with the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in Europe. In recognition of his service, the Army decorated Mangano with a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and an [[Air Medal]] with four [[Oak leaf cluster|Oak Leaf Clusters]] and three [[Service star|Battle Stars]].&lt;ref name="Capeci"&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/40123 NY Sun.com; Rough Prison Treatment for a Fragile Benny Eggs] by Jerry Capeci&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Mangano joined a crew in [[Greenwich Village]] that would later belong to [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent "The Chin" Gigante]]. Mangano oversaw his businesses out of a [[social club]] at 110 [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]].  These operations included an immensely profitable monopoly on window replacement in the [[New York City metropolitan area]].

===Convictions prior to 1991===
As a member of the Genovese crime family, Mangano had a notable criminal record;
* October 7, 1946 - [[Bookmaking]] - $50 fine
* May 15, 1947 - Bookmaking - $200 fine
* October 8, 1950 - Bookmaking - $200 fine and 60 days imprisonment
* February 21, 1961 - Bookmaking - $250 fine and 90 days imprisonment
* August 6, 1981 - [[Contempt of court|Civil contempt]] for refusing to testify once granted immunity - incarcerated from August 18, 1981 to April 22, 1982.

===1991 Windows Case===
From 1978 to 1990, four of the [[Five Families|five crime families of New York]] formed a [[cartel]] of window replacement companies. Each family assigned one or more men to control their share in the cartel (''as shown below'').
*[[Lucchese crime family]] - [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio Amuso]], [[Anthony Casso]] and [[Peter Chiodo]] - had the largest share in the window racket.
*[[Genovese crime family]] - Venero Mangano, [[Gerard Pappa]] (deceased) and Peter Savino (associate)
*[[Gambino crime family]] - [[Peter Gotti]]
*[[Colombo crime family]] - [[Benedetto Aloi|Benedetto "Benny" Aloi]]

The cartel eventually controlled over $150 million in contracts from the [[New York City Housing Authority]] (NYCHA).  The cartel monopolized the industry through Local 580, a Lucchese family-controlled local of the [[International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers|Iron Workers Union]].  Through the union, the cartel could [[bribery|solicit bribes]], [[extortion|extort payoffs]] and enforce its monopoly. The cartel worked their controlled industry by charging a tax of approximately $1.00 to $2.00 for almost every window replacement, public and private, sold in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="windows jury"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|title=Windows Jury Finds 3 Guilty And Acquits 5|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/19/nyregion/windows-jury-finds-3-guilty-and-acquits-5.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fW%2fWindows|accessdate=29 April 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 19, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2 men"&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Men Sentenced In 'Windows Trial'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/nyregion/2-men-sentenced-in-windows-trial.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fW%2fWindows|accessdate=29 April 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 28, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indictment==

By 1990, law enforcement had crushed the window replacement cartel. It started in 1988, when prosecutors  persuaded cartel member Savino to become an informant and wear a wire. It was Savino's information over a two-year period that led to the indictments.

The sweep of indictments was wide. In 1990, [[Peter Gotti]] was tried and acquitted; Mangano, Aloi, and Colombo crime family soldier Dennis DeLucia were convicted. Sentencing guidelines should have seen Venero and Aloi get three-year sentences, but both men received more than 15 years each (Mangano - 188 months, Aloi - 200 months).

Nearly all the members of the Local 580 were indicted on charges ranging from bid rigging to extortion. Gigante was indicted but found [[Competence (law)|mentally unfit]] to stand trial; he was later convicted in 1997. Amuso and Casso went into hiding, appointing [[Alphonse D'Arco]] as acting boss of the Lucchese family on January 9, 1991. In 1992, Amuso was captured and later convicted in a superseding indictment that included the "Windows Case" charges. In 1993, Casso was captured, took a [[plea bargain]], and started cooperation with authorities himself. Chiodo pleaded guilty after an assassination attempt and admitted killing potential witness John Morrissey, a business agent for Local 580.

==After the Windows Case==
In 1997, while still in prison, Mangano was called to testify against boss Gigante. He refused to testify, saying, "What do you want to do, shoot me?" and "Shoot me, but I'm not going to answer any questions".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/19/nyregion/a-jailed-mobster-refuses-to-testify-in-mafia-case.html A Jailed Mobster Refuses To Testify in Mafia Case] By Joseph P. Fried, July 19, 1997. New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; He later took the witness stand, but refused to answer any questions, invoking his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights. Mangano tried several times to get a new sentencing or hearing, but to no avail. On November 2, 2006, Mangano was released from prison. The future was uncertain for Mangano and he was fortunate to have lived out his sentence. While in prison, he survived two heart attacks and three emergency heart operations. Upon Mangano's release, it was speculated that he would become the boss of the Genovese family, but there is no evidence that this happened. His post-prison life involvement in organized crime is unknown, as he was partially blind and confined to a wheelchair. He died of natural causes in 2017.
