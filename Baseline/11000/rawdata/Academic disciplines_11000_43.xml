'''Aniridia'''  is the absence of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], usually involving both eyes. It can be congenital or caused by a penetrant injury.&lt;ref  name="Lang2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ophthalmology: A Pocket  Textbook Atlas  (2nd ed.) |page=208 |author=Lang, K |year=2007  |publisher=Thieme  |isbn=1-58890-555-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Isolated aniridia is a [[congenital]] disorder which is not limited to a defect in iris development,  but is a  panocular condition with [[macular hypoplasia|macular]] and [[optic nerve hypoplasia]], [[cataract]],  and [[cornea]]l changes.&lt;ref name="eMedicine"&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1208379-overview  |title=Aniridia |publisher=eMedicine |first=Daljit |last=Singh |author2=Arun Verma  |accessdate=2 February 2010 |date=17 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vision may be severely compromised and the disorder is frequently associated with a number of ocular complications: [[nystagmus]], [[amblyopia]], [[buphthalmos]], and [[cataract]].&lt;ref  name="Lang2" /&gt; Aniridia in some individuals occurs as part of a syndrome, such as [[WAGR syndrome]] ([[Wilms tumour|kidney nephroblastoma]] (Wilms tumour), genitourinary anomalies and intellectual disability), or [[Gillespie syndrome]] ([[cerebellar ataxia]]).

==PAX6==

[[File:Human eyeball with phenotypic expression of aniridia with PAX6 gene mutation.jpg|thumb|left|Phenotypic expression of aniridia with [[PAX6]] gene mutation. The aniridic  probands showed typical features of [[sclerocornea]] with nystagmus in proband 28–1 (A); Foveal hypoplasia in  proband 27–1 (B);  Ptosis, microcornea with dislocated cataractous lens in proband 10–1 (C); Ectopia lentis in  proband 16–1 (D).]]

The AN2 region of the short  arm of [[chromosome 11]] (11p13) includes the [[PAX6]] gene (named for its PAired boX status), whose gene product helps regulate a cascade of other genetic processes involved in the development of the eye (as well as other non-ocular structures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal |vauthors=Lee H, Khan R, O'Keefe M |title=Aniridia: current pathology and management |journal=Acta Ophthalmol |volume=86  |issue=7  |pages=708–15 | date=November 2008 |pmid=18937825  |doi=10.1111/j.1755-3768.2008.01427.x  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This PAX6 gene is around 95% similar to the pax gene found in [[zebrafish]], a creature whose ancestors diverged from human evolutionary development around 400 million years ago. Thus the PAX6 gene is  highly conserved across [[evolution]]ary  lineages.

Defects in the PAX6 gene cause aniridia-like ocular defects in [[mice]] (as well as ''[[Drosophila]]''). Aniridia is a [[heterozygous]] disorder, meaning that only one of the two [[chromosome 11]] copies is affected. When both copies are altered ([[homozygous]] condition), the result is a uniformly fatal condition with near complete failure of entire eye formation. In 2001, two cases of  homozygous aniridia patients were reported; the fetuses died prior to birth and had severe brain damage. In mice, homozygous ''small eye'' defect (mouse Pax-6) leads to loss of the eyes and nose and the murine fetuses suffer severe brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal |last=Gehring |first=W. J. | date= 2001 |title=The genetic control of eye development and its implications for the evolution of various eye-types |journal=Zoology  |volume=104 |issue=3–4 |pages=171–181 |doi=10.1078/0944-2006-00022 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Aniridia may be broadly divided  into hereditary and sporadic forms. Hereditary aniridia is usually transmitted in an [[autosomal dominant]] manner (each offspring has a 50% chance of being affected), although rare [[autosomal recessive]] forms (such as [[Gillespie syndrome]]) have also been reported. Sporadic aniridia [[mutations]] may affect the WT1 region adjacent to the AN2 aniridia region, causing a kidney cancer called [[nephroblastoma]] ([[Wilms tumor]]). These patients often also have genitourinary abnormalities and [[intellectual disability]] ([[WAGR syndrome]]).

Several different mutations may affect the PAX6 gene. Some mutations appear to inhibit gene function more than others, with subsequent variability in the severity of the disease. Thus, some aniridic individuals are only missing a relatively small amount of iris, do not have [[foveal hypoplasia]], and retain relatively normal [[Visual perception|vision]]. Presumably, the genetic defect in these individuals causes less "heterozygous insufficiency," meaning they retain enough gene function to yield a milder [[phenotype]].

==Mutational analysis==
Molecular ([[DNA]]) testing for PAX6 gene mutations (by [[sequencing]] of the entire [[coding region]] and [[deletion/duplication analysis]]) is available for isolated aniridia and the Gillespie syndrome. For the WAGR syndrome, [[high-resolution cytogenetic analysis]] and [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) can be utilized to identify deletions within chromosome band 11p13, where both the PAX6 and WT1 genes are located.

==Treatment==
In May 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the CustomFlex Artificial Iris, the first [[artificial iris|synthetic iris]] for use in adults and children with congenital aniridia or iris defects related to other conditions, such as [[albinism]], traumatic injury, or surgical removal due to [[ocular melanoma]]. The artificial iris is a surgically implanted device made of thin, foldable, medical-grade [[silicone]] and is custom-sized and colored for each individual patient. The prosthetic iris is held in place by the anatomical structures of the eye or, if needed, by sutures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/897386&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bacterial senescence''' or '''bacterial aging''' refers to the gradual decrease in [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] function in individual [[bacterium]] as they increase in age. Indicators of senescence include a decelerated division rate and an increase likelihood of death.

The fundamental cause of aging in bacteria is thought to be the accumulation of deleterious components (aging factors). Asymmetrically dividing bacteria, such as ''[[Caulobacter crescentus]]'', show signs of replicative aging.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ackermann | first1 = M. | last2 = Stearns | first2 = S.

For example, ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', under certain experimental conditions, may exhibit signs of replicative aging caused by subtle asymmetries in its division.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = E.

== Factors contributing to aging==
Aging factors can be defined as irreparable damages to cellular components which ultimately contribute to the decreased fitness of the individual harbouring them. Putative aging factors include  damaged DNA strands, old cell-surface material, and mis-folded or aggregated protein. The cell poles of replicating ''[[E. coli]]'' are often used as a proxy for aging factors as each bacterium inherits an old cell-pole (mother’s pole) and a newly synthesized new cell-pole. Inclusion bodies, masses of aggregated damaged or mis-folded proteins, have recently been shown to contribute to the aging of cellular organisms.


Senescence in single celled organisms is thought to arise via the asymmetric partitioning of aging factors between daughter cells. It has long been argued that, on theoretical grounds, the preferential segregation of damage in unicellular organisms would contribute to the fitness of the overall population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/103/40/14831.full|title = Aging may be a conditional strategic choice and not an inevitable outcome for bacteria|last = Watve|first = Milind|date = October 2006|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume = 103|issue = 40|pages = 14831–5|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0606499103 |pmid = 17001004|last2 = Parab|first2 = S.|last3 = Jogdand|first3 = P.|last4 = Keni|first4 = S.|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10314831W|pmc=1595437}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, T. B. L. (1981). Repair and its evolution: survival versus reproduction. Physiological Ecology ; an Evolutionary Approach to Resource Use.&lt;/ref&gt; The single celled eukaryotic organism, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', retains deleterious aging factors in the mother cell leading to rejuvenation of the daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aguilaniu | first1 = H. | last2 = Gustafsson | first2 = L. | last3 = Rigoulet | first3 = M. | last4 = Nystroem | first4 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Asymmetric inheritance of oxidatively damaged proteins during cytokinesis | url = | journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5613| pages = 1751–1753 | doi = 10.1126/science.1080418 | pmid = 12610228 | bibcode = 2003Sci...299.1751A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging in Asymmetrically dividing Bacteria==
	A well established example of bacterial aging is ''[[Caulobacter crescentus]]''. This bacteria begins its life as a motile swarmer cell. Once it has found a suitable substrate, the swarmer cell will differentiate into a non-motile stalked cell. The stalked cell then becomes reproductively active and gives rise to new swarmer cells. The number of progeny produced per hour by individual swarmer cells was shown to decrease with age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This was the first evidence of bacterial aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nystroem | first1 = T | year = 2007 | title = A bacterial kind of aging | url = | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 12| pages = 2355–2357 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging in Symmetrically dividing Bacteria==
Organisms which replicate via symmetric division, such as ''[[E. coli]]'', are thought to be immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moseley | first1 = J.

A cell which has consecutively inherited the old cell pole has been shown to exhibit a significantly decreased growth rate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The decline in growth rate in Stewart et al. appears to be at least partially attributed to the preferential localization of inclusion bodies near the old cell wall.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This localization is thought to be the passive result of the slow diffusion of the large aggregate, and the exclusion of the aggregate by the nucleoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coquel | first1 = A.-S. | last2 = Jacob | first2 = J.-P. | last3 = Primet | first3 = M. | last4 = Demarez | first4 = A. | last5 = Dimiccoli | first5 = M. | last6 = Julou | first6 = T. | display-authors = 6 | last7 = Moisan | first7 = Lionel | last8 = Lindner | first8 = Ariel B. | last9 = Berry | first9 = Hugues | year = 2013 | title = Localization of Protein Aggregation in Escherichia coli Is Governed by Diffusion and Nucleoid Macromolecular Crowding Effect | url = | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 4| page = 4 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003038 | bibcode = 2013PLSCB...9E3038C |arxiv = 1303.1904 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar mechanism of aging has been found to occur in ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'', which divides via symmetrical binary fission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coelho | first1 = M. | last2 = Dereli | first2 = A. | last3 = Haese | first3 = A. | last4 = Kühn | first4 = S. | last5 = Malinovska | first5 = L. | year = 2013 | title = Fission yeast does not age under favorable conditions, but does so after stress | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2013.07.084 | journal = Current Biology | volume = 23| issue = | pages = 1844–52| pmid=24035542 | pmc=4620659}}&lt;/ref&gt;


However, the original findings of ''E. coli'' aging have been partially refuted by more recent microfluidics-based studies, in which individual ''E. coli'' showed a constant growth rate for hundreds of consecutive cell divisions, although the death rate increased in each cell division.&lt;ref  name="pmid20537537" /&gt; This discrepancy may be due to the different culturing methods used in the two studies, i.e., growth on agar pads vs. in a microfludic device.

The '''Bible Companion''' (or '''Bible Reading Planner''') is a guide developed by the [[Christadelphians]] to aid reading the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christadelphia.org/biblestudy/planner.htm |title=The Bible Reading Planner |accessdate=2007-02-13 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070203025901/http://www.christadelphia.org/biblestudy/planner.htm| archivedate= 3 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first produced by Robert Roberts when he was just 14 years of age, in about 1853,&lt;ref name="exhort"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christadelphianbooks.org/agora/read_exh/index.html |title=Daily Bible Reading Exhortations |accessdate=2007-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and revised by him over a number of years into its current format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Roberts | first =Robert | authorlink =Robert Roberts (Christadelphian) | title =My Days and My Ways | publisher =CMPA | year =1894 | location =Birmingham | page =15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Christadelphians believe that reading the Bible is very important: they believe that it is 'essential if one is to discover—and remember—God's revelation of Himself and His purpose';&lt;ref name="exhort"/&gt; citing Bible verses such as Psalm 119:105, they believe the Bible gives moral direction for the life of a Christian - thus the Bible Companion is designed to aid the Christian in their Bible reading to this end.&lt;ref name="exhort"/&gt;

==The Bible Companion as a reading aid==
By following the ''Bible Companion'' the reader is led, in small portions, through the whole Bible in a year. The [[Old Testament]] is read once in the year, and the [[New Testament]] is read twice. The plan starts on January 1 in the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Book of Psalms]] and [[Book of Matthew]] and works its way through the scriptures as the year goes along providing around 4 chapters per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyreadings.org.uk/ |title=Welcome to DailyReadings.org.uk |accessdate=2007-02-13 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070210031847/http://www.dailyreadings.org.uk/| archivedate= 10 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here is an example of a section from the ''Bible Companion'':

==Current usage==
Although the ''Bible Companion'' was developed over 100 years ago by the Christadelphians it is still widely used, year by year, within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thechristadelphian.com/ |title=''The Christadelphian'' |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ecclesias (individual churches) read the allotted chapters of the Bible as found in the companion during their Sunday services. Many people have the Bible Companion printed on book marks so they can easily find and follow the day's readings. There is an increasing number of [[Mobile app|apps]] for [[mobile phones]] and [[Tablet computer|tablets]] which also show the daily readings. Use of the 'Bible Companion' is down to the individual's choice.

'''Boaz Tsaban''' (born February 1973) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] mathematician on the faculty of [[Bar-Ilan University]]. His research interests include [[selection principle]]s within set theory and [[non-commutative cryptography|nonabelian cryptology]], within mathematical cryptology.

==Biography==
Boaz Tsaban grew up in [[Or Yehuda]], a city near Tel Aviv. At the age of 16 he was selected with other high school students to attend the first cycle of a [[Or Yehuda#Education|special preparation program]] in mathematics, at Bar-Ilan University, being admitted to regular mathematics courses at the University a year later. He completed his B.Sc., M.Sc. and [[Ph.D.]]&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=74323}}&lt;/ref&gt; degrees with highest distinctions. 
Two years as a post-doctoral fellow at [[Hebrew University]] were followed by a three-year Koshland Fellowship at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] before he joined the Department of Mathematics, Bar-Ilan University in 2007.

==Academic career==
In the field of selection principles, Tsaban devised the method of omission of intervals

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7601">'''Building performance''' is an attribute of a [[building]] that expresses how well that building carries out its functions. It may also relate to the [[performance]] of the building [[construction]] process. Categories of building performance are quality (how well the building fulfils its functions), [[resource]] saving (how much resource is needed to fulfil its functions) and [[workload]] capacity (how much the building can do). The performance of a building depends on the response of the building to an external [[structural load|load]] or shock. Building performance plays an important role in [[architecture]], [[building services engineering]], [[building code|building regulation]], [[architectural engineering]] and [[construction management]]. Prominent building performance aspects are [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[thermal comfort]], [[indoor air quality]] and [[daylighting]].

==Background==
{{cleanup rewrite|date=October 2016}}
Building performance has been of interest to humans from the very first shelters built to protect us from the weather, natural enemies and other dangers. Initially design and performance were managed by craftsmen who combined expertise in both domains. More formal approaches to building performance appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, with seminal works being the book on ''Building Performance''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Performance|last=Markus et al|first=|publisher=Applied Science Publishers LTD|year=1972|isbn=085334 542 2|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''CIB Report 64''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CIB Report 64 - Working with the Performance Approach in Building|last=CIB Working Commission W60|first=|publisher=International Council for Building Research Studies and Documentation|year=1982|isbn=|location=Rotterdam|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Further progress on building performance studies took place in parallel with the development of building science as a discipline, and with the introduction of personal computing (especially computer simulation) in the field; for a good overview of the role of simulation in building design see the chapter by Augenbroe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The role of simulation in performance based building. In: Hensen and Lamberts (eds), Building performance simulation for design and operation.|last=Augenbroe|first=Godfried|publisher=Spon Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-47414-6|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=15-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A more general overview that also includes physical measurement, expert judgement and stakeholder evaluation is presented in the book ''Building Performance Analysis''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Performance Analysis|last=de Wilde|first=Pieter|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2018|isbn=9781119341925|location=Hoboken / Chichester|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== '''ASHRAE Performance Measurement Protocols''' ===
Although many buildings in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and elsewhere claim to be “green,” “low energy,” or “high performance,” it is rarely clear on what evidence or data these claims are based. Such claims cannot be credible without standardized performance measurement protocols that are applied consistently. If claims of superior building performance are to be believed, it is essential that a common set of measurements be used and the results reported against meaningful benchmarks. Such protocols are also needed to give usable feedback to building designers and operators when measured performance does not match design intent.  &lt;ref name="ASHRAE"&gt;https://www.ashrae.org/resources--publications/periodicals/ashrae-journal/features/measuring-commercial-building-performancel{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This article describes ASHRAE’s Performance Measurement Protocols for Commercial Buildings (PMP), which provides a standardized, consistent set of protocols, for a range of cost/accuracy, to facilitate the appropriate comparison of measured energy, water, and indoor environmental quality (thermal comfort, indoor air quality [IAQ], lighting, and acoustics) performance of commercial buildings, while maintaining acceptable levels of building service for the occupants. Benchmarks are included in the protocols to facilitate comparison to peer buildings or for self-reference over time (often before and after retrofit). A recent article describing just the acoustic performance measurement protocols in the PMP has been published in the ASHRAE Journal. 
The PMP is a collaborative effort of ASHRAE, the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), and the Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers (CIBSE). It began with a detailed evaluation of literature related to measured building performance that included databases, measurement techniques, M&amp;V protocols, and available instrumentation. A project committee representing several ASHRAE Technical Committees (TCs 7.6, 7.9, 4.7, and others) developed the content.

The protocols identify what to measure, how it is to be measured (instrumentation and spatial resolution), and how often it is to be measured for inclusion in the building’s operation and maintenance plan. For each of the six measure categories (energy, water, thermal comfort, IAQ, lighting, and acoustics), protocols are developed at three levels: low, medium and high cost and accuracy, providing a range of choices for levels of effort, detail, and rigor to characterize the building stock, and comparison to appropriate benchmarks.

For each measure category and each level, the following characteristics are described: 
* Objectives of the measurement. 
* Metrics to be used, including instrumentation and units of measure.  
* Performance evaluation and benchmarks. Estimates of initial and recurring costs are included. 
In the PMP, first the six measure categories are addressed at the basic level. This is followed by a presentation of the intermediate level protocols and then the advanced level protocols. However, here we will primarily discuss the basic level protocols, with only a brief description of higher levels; details of the intermediate and advanced levels are described in the PMP.  

Representative measures at each level were tested by applying them to the newly renovated ASHRAE Headquarters Building in Atlanta (facing page). Measurements were taken by the commissioning authority for the renovation during 2009 and 2010, after the renovated building was reoccupied and was undergoing post-occupancy commissioning. Occupant surveys were taken before and after the renovation to evaluate indoor environmental quality.

The '''[[Cantilever]] method''' is an approximate method for calculating [[shear force]]s and [[moment (physics)|moments]] developed in [[beam (structure)|beam]]s and [[column]]s of a [[structural system|frame]] or [[structure]] due to lateral loads. The applied lateral loads typically include [[wind]] loads and earthquake loads, which must be taken into consideration while designing buildings. The assumptions used in this method are that the points of [[contraflexure]] (or points of inflection of the moment diagram) in both the vertical and horizontal members are located at the midpoint of the member, and that the direct [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]es in the columns are proportional to their distances from the centroidal [[axis (mathematics)|axis]] of the frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Theory_of_Structures.html?id=7wMkywAACAAJ | title=Theory of Structures | author=S. Ramamrutham}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frame is analysed in step-wise (iterative) fashion, and the results can then be described by force [[diagram]]s drawn up at the end of the process. The method is quite versatile and can be used to analyse frames of any number of [[storey]]s or floors.

The position of the centroidal axis (the [[center of gravity]] line for the frame) is determined by using the areas of the end columns and interior columns. The cantilever method is considered as one of the two primary approximate methods (the other being the [[portal method]]) for indeterminate structural analysis of frames for lateral loads. Its use is recommended for frames that are taller than they are wide, and therefore behave similar to a beam cantilevered up from the ground.

The '''Catalan Institute of Nanotechnology (ICN)''' (NanoCAT or Institut Català de Nanotecnologia) was established in 2003, at the initiative of the Catalan government and the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (UAB), Catalonia, with the aim of attracting international research talent to create a world renowned centre for [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]] research. 

Research focused in the following areas:
* Synthesis and applications of [[nanoparticles]] and [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]]
* Design and synthesis of [[macromolecules]] for the integration of nanodevices
* [[Magnetism]] of thin films and spintronics
* Imaging and manipulation of [[atoms]] and [[molecules]]
* Theory of surfaces and inter-phases
* Interaction of [[biomaterials]] with inorganic matter

Following collaborations between the ICN and the Spanish government's Centre for Research in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (CIN2), the ICN and the Spanish Research Council (CSIC) agreed to put their collaboration on an official footing and signed a memorandum of understanding to this effect in 2006. 

This agreement was formalised in 2011, when CSIC representatives joined the ICN's board of patrons and then in 2013, when the ICN changed its name to the [[Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2)]].

'''CEAR''' namely  '''Central Electricity Authority (Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply) Regulations, 2010'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cea.nic.in/notifiedregulations.html]; Central Electricity Authority&lt;/ref&gt; are regulations framed by Central Electricity Authority of India  under  Indian Electricity Act, 2003, to regulate measures relating to safety and electric supply in India.

==History==
CEAR came into effect 20 September 2010, in place of The Indian Electricity Rules, 1956.

The Electricity Act, 2003, was formulated combining the Indian Electricity Act 1910 and Indian Electricity (supply) Act 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/118072046/CEA-Reg-2010]; [http://cea.nic.in/reports/regulation/public_notice_safety_electric_supply.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earthing provisions and safety==
Under CEAR, rule 41, there is specific provision of  earthing neutral wire of a 3-phase, 4-wire system and the additional third wire of a 2- phase, 3-wire system. Earthing is to be done with two separate connections.  Grounding system also to have minimum two or more earth pits (electrode) such that proper grounding takes place. As per the rule 42, installation with  load above 5 KW exceeding 250Volt shall have suitable Earth leakage protective device to isolate the load in case of earth fault or leakage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://as1.ori.nic.in/eicelectricity/ECNotification/Safety%20Regulation%20English.pdf]; Central Electricity Authority-(Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply). Regulations, 2010; rule 41 and 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutral and earth run separately on overhead line/cables. Separate conductor for overhead lines and armoring of cables are used for earth connection. Additional earth electrodes/pits are installed at user ends for proper earth.

===Earthing in mines===
Earthing in an underground mine  shall be carried out by connection to an earthing system at the surface of the mine as per rule 99.

As per rule 100, protective equipment is to be placed in the mines for automatic disconnection of supply  when there is earth fault exceeding 750 milliampere in 250 V to 1000 Volt installations. For open cast mine the limit is 50 ampere in installations of voltage exceeding 1100 V and up to 11 kV. The earth leakage current is to be restricted by placing suitable neutral grounding resistance (NGR) in all the distribution transformers.

'''Cirrus cloud thinning''' is a proposed form of [[climate engineering]]. [[Cirrus cloud]]s are high cold ice that, like other [[cloud]]s, both reflect [[sunlight]] and absorb warming [[infrared radiation]]. However, they differ from other types of clouds in that, on average, infrared absorption outweighs sunlight reflection, resulting in a net warming effect on the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Joonsuk|last2=Yang|first2=Ping|last3=Dessler|first3=Andrew E.|last4=Gao|first4=Bo-Cai|last5=Platnick|first5=Steven|title=Distribution and Radiative Forcing of Tropical Thin Cirrus Clouds|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=December 2009|volume=66|issue=12|pages=3721–3731|doi=10.1175/2009JAS3183.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, thinning or removing these clouds would reduce their heat trapping capacity, resulting in a cooling effect on Earth's [[climate]]. This could be a potential tool to reduce [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell and Finnegan, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=David L.|last2=Finnegan|first2=William|title=Modification of cirrus clouds to reduce global warming|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=2009|volume=4|issue=4|page=045102|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cirrus cloud thinning is an alternative category of climate engineering, in addition to [[solar radiation management]] and [[greenhouse gas removal]].

==Basic principles==

Typical cirrus clouds may be susceptible to modification to reduce their lifetime and [[Optical depth|optical thickness]], and hence their net positive [[radiative forcing]] (in contrast to the typical low, warm liquid clouds). Material to seed such modification could be delivered via [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] or by aircraft. Scientists believe that cirrus clouds in the high [[latitude]] upper [[troposphere]] are formed by homogeneous [[freezing]], resulting in large numbers of small [[ice crystals]]. If effective [[ice nuclei]] were introduced into this environment, the cirrus may instead form by heterogeneous freezing. If the concentration of ice nuclei is seeded such that the resulting cloud particle density is less than that for the natural case, the cloud particles should grow larger due to less water vapor competition and attain higher settling velocities. By seeding with [[aerosol]]s, ice crystals could grow rapidly and deplete water vapor, suppress nucleation and any growth of ice crystals by homogeneous nucleation. The net effect would be a reduced optical thickness and a reduced cloud lifetime, allowing more infrared radiation to be emitted at the top of the atmosphere, as the ice particles sediment out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storelvmo|first1=Trude|last2=Kristjánsson|first2=Jón Egill|last3=Muri|first3=Helene|last4=Pfeffer|first4=Melissa|last5=Barahona|first5=Donifan|last6=Nenes|first6=Athanasios|title=Cirrus cloud seeding has potential to cool climate|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|date=15 January 2013|volume=40|pages=178–182|doi=10.1029/2012GL054201|bibcode=2013GeoRL..40..178S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less upper tropospheric water vapor and infrared radiation in the atmosphere would consequently cool the climate.

[[Bismuth(III) iodide|Bismuth tri-iodide]] (BiI3) has been proposed as the seeding material, as it is effective as ice nuclei for temperatures colder than -10&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name="Mitchell and Finnegan, 2009"/&gt; non-toxic and relatively inexpensive compared to e.g. [[silver iodide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruppacher|first1=Hans R.|last2=Klett|first2=James D.|title=Microphysics of clouds and precipitation|date=1997|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-0-306-48100-0|edition=2nd rev. and enl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seeding aerosols would need to be added regularly, as it would sediment out along with the large ice crystals.

== Current research ==

In contrast to solar radiation management techniques, which would be most effective during the day time at lower latitudes, cirrus cloud thinning would be most effective at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles, where the background concentrations of aerosol are low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storelvmo|first1=T.|last2=Herger|first2=N.|title=Cirrus cloud susceptibility to the injection of ice nuclei in the upper troposphere|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|date=16 March 2014|volume=119|issue=5|pages=2375–2389|doi=10.1002/2013JD020816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloud-aerosol-climate interactions important for cirrus cloud thinning are not well understood. Factors that related to the heterogeneous freezing process are uncertain, as ice growth kinetics are not well documented. Vertical velocities are essential for the activation of ice nuclei, but remain uncertain due to lack of observations. Heterogeneous freezing may already be common in cirrus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cziczo|first1=D. J.|last2=Froyd|first2=K. D.|last3=Hoose|first3=C.|last4=Jensen|first4=E.

There are significant uncertainties associated with not only ice nucleation processes in cirrus clouds and the fraction of nucleation that occurs via heterogeneous and homogeneous freezing, but also its representation in climate models. “Over-seeding” might lead to warming, as opposed to the desired cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storelvmo|first1=T.|last2=Kristjansson|first2=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2444">'''Coh-Metrix''' is a computational tool that produces indices of the [[natural language|linguistic]] and [[discourse]] representations of a text. Developed by
[[Arthur C. Graesser]] and [[Danielle McNamara]], Coh-Metrix calculates the [[Coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] of texts on many different measures.

==Coh-Metrix Measurements==
Coh-Metrix can be used in many different ways to investigate the cohesion of the explicit text and the coherence of the [[mental representation]] of the text. "Our definition of [[Cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]] consists of characteristics of the explicit text that play some role in helping the reader mentally connect ideas in the text" (Graesser, McNamara, &amp; Louwerse, 2003). The definition of coherence is the subject of much debate. Theoretically, the coherence of a text is defined by the interaction between linguistic representations and knowledge representations. While coherence can be defined as characteristics of the text (i.e., aspects of cohesion) that are likely to contribute to the coherence of the mental representation, Coh-Metrix measurements provide indices of these cohesion characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Graesser,A.C., McNamara,D.S.,&amp; Louwerse,M.M (2003).   What do readers need to learn in order to process coherence relations in narrative and expository text.  In A.P. Sweet and C.E. Snow (Eds.), Rethinking reading comprehension (pp.&amp;nbsp;82–98). New York: Guilford Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an empirical study, the Coh-Metrix L2 Reading Index performs significantly better than traditional [[readability]] formulas.&lt;ref&gt;

The normal way that a [[computer]] functions manually is through a person that controls the computer. An individual generates computer actions with the use of either a [[computer mouse]] or [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]].  However the latest [[technology]] and computer innovation might allow a computer to not only detect [[body language]] but also respond to it. Modern devices are being experimented with, that may potentially allow that computer related device to [[gesture recognition|respond to and understand an individual's hand gesture]], specific movement or [[facial expression]].

==Relating to computer science==

Being able to read body language is an example of [[artificial intelligence]].  As stated by the man who came up with the term, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], artificial intelligence is “the [[science]] and [[engineering]] of making intelligent machines”.  In relation to computers and body language, research is being done with the use of [[mathematics]] in order to teach computers to interpret human movements, hand gestures and even facial expressions. This is different from the normal way people generally communicate with computers for example with the click of the mouse, keyboard, or any [[physical contact]] in general between the user and the computer.

==Background information on research being done==

===MIAUCE and Chaabane Djeraba===

This type of research is being done by a group of European researchers and other scientists as well. There is also a project called [[MIAUCE]]  (Multimodal interactions analysis and exploration of users within a Controlled Environment). This project has scientists working on making this sort of new advance in [[computer technology]] a reality. [[Chaabane Djeraba]], the project coordinator stated "The motivation of the project is to put humans in the loop of interaction between the computer and their environment."

===Aims and motives of this project===

Researchers and scientists are trying to use their [[innovation]] and ideas in a way that can help them apply these modern technological devices to the daily needs of businesses and places people visit such as the [[Shopping mall|mall]] or an [[airport]]. The project coordinator of MIAUCE stated "We would like to have a form of ambient intelligence where computers are completely hidden…this means a [[multimodal interface]] so people can interact with their environment. The computer sees their behavior and then extracts information useful for the user.” This specific research group has developed a couple of different real life models of computer technology that will use body language as a means of [[communication]] and way to function.

==Prototypes created by scientists and researchers==

===General personal use===

Scientists and researchers experimented with people and computers. A certain number of [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s were gathered to test out if computers could function by interpreting what the individual was physically doing without actually having to touch the computer itself. In this specific experiment researchers asked the volunteers to try to control the computer using nothing but their [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]. The science behind this involves the use of [[electrooculography]], also referred to as EOG. This is basically a technique used to examine someones eye movements. This is then made into a [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] on the computer screen for the individual, in this case the volunteers. The volunteers were then shown a display on the [[computer screen]] of the letters in the alphabet. With their eye movements, the volunteers were now able to use this cursor on the computer screen and perform tasks such as typing words.

===Security purposes in busy and overcrowded areas===

An example of the applied version of this computer technology is controlling the [[safety]] of people in heavily populated areas such as [[Bus station|bus terminals]], airports or even [[shopping complex]]es. To monitor such places you definitely need a [[security camera]] at the site itself. However, researchers are trying to make use of computers to manage such areas aside from just [[video camera]]s alone. Basically a [[video stream]] is evaluated and examined which involves a bit of math, for example a description of shapes, the flow of people and their movements. Then that data is analyzed in terms of [[crowd density]], their pace and the direction in which they are moving.  At last is when the use of the computer comes in. The computer aids in evaluating any type of activity in these types of crowded areas that seems fairly irregular. The information that the computer gives will help provide an alert or warning that something is not going the way it should. In the example of a mall, this sort of computer will provide an alert to something like an individual that has fallen from an [[escalator]].

===Marketing purposes===

Helping businesses and local stores analyze how their customers behave while [[shopping]] is another example of how this type of computer technology will be implemented. The scientists and researchers that are creating a computer that runs on this type of technology are making use of the idea of body language being used to work with computers for reasons relating to [[marketing]] purposes. This involves monitoring how many people there are in the street next to that certain shop as well as the use of a [[heat map generator]]. The heat map generator will basically allow the manager or staff at a store to observe how exactly people are moving. It will also allow staff workers to see what things in the store are attracting the attention of the customers the most.

==Controversy and privacy concerns==

Although this sort of technology does seem helpful and practical, certain issues and concerns arise among everyday people who are doubtful about how such computers are going to be used.  Some people debate on the issue of [[security]] and [[privacy]] with such computer technologies. With this new technology comes a bit of concern with the public. Therefore, researchers and scientists have to take into perspective that such computer devices that can read body language have to give people a warning of that kind of a capability. So when building and putting into effect this type of computer, so to say as a means of security, there has to be concern over whether or not to take into consideration if this kind of computer technology would be accepted by the [[general public]]. That includes people who are possibly going to be observed and monitored by a kind of computer that analyzes their body movements and gestures when they are doing something as simple as shopping at a mall or traveling through airports.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Convergent evolution''' is the independent [[evolution]] of similar features in species of different lineages. Convergent evolution creates '''analogous structures''' that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups. The [[cladistic]] term for the same phenomenon is [[Cladogram#Measuring homoplasy|homoplasy]]. The [[recurrent evolution]] of flight is a classic example, as flying [[insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[pterosaurs]], and [[bat]]s have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight. Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are ''analogous'', whereas ''[[homology (biology)|homologous]]'' structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions.  Bird, bat, and pterosaur [[wings]] are analogous structures, but their forelimbs are homologous, sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions.

The opposite of convergence is [[divergent evolution]], where related species evolve different traits. Convergent evolution is similar to [[parallel evolution]], which occurs when two independent species evolve in the same direction and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, [[flying frog|gliding frog]]s have evolved in parallel from multiple types of [[tree frog]].

Many instances of convergent evolution are known in [[plant]]s, including the repeated development of [[C4 photosynthesis|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis]], [[seed dispersal]] by fleshy [[fruit]]s adapted to be eaten by animals, and [[carnivorous plant|carnivory]].

==Overview==
[[File:Analogous &amp; Homologous Structures.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Homology (biology)|Homology]] and analogy in mammals and insects: on the horizontal axis, the structures are homologous in morphology, but different in function due to differences in habitat. On the vertical axis, the structures are analogous in function due to similar lifestyles but anatomically different with different [[phylogeny]].{{efn|However, [[evolutionary developmental biology]] has identified [[deep homology]] between insect and mammal body plans, to the surprise of many biologists.}}]]
{{further|List of examples of convergent evolution}}

In morphology, analogous traits arise when different species live in similar ways and/or a similar environment, and so face the same environmental factors. When occupying similar [[ecological niche]]s (that is, a distinctive way of life) similar problems can lead to similar solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=John Thomas Osmond|title=Science &amp; Certainty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTr5BTxMpFYC&amp;pg=PA79|year=2007|publisher=Csiro Publishing|isbn=978-0-643-09391-1|page=79 |quote=evolutionary convergence, which, quoting ..

In biochemistry, physical and chemical constraints on [[enzyme mechanism|mechanisms]] have caused some [[active site]] arrangements such as the [[catalytic triad]] to evolve independently in separate [[enzyme superfamilies]].&lt;ref name="Buller&amp;Townsend_2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buller |first=A. R. |author2=Townsend, C. A. |title=Intrinsic evolutionary constraints on protease structure, enzyme acylation, and the identity of the catalytic triad.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=19 Feb 2013 |volume=110 |issue=8 |pages=E653–61 |pmid=23382230|doi=10.1073/pnas.1221050110 |bibcode=2013PNAS..110E.653B |pmc=3581919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1989 book ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that if one could "rewind the tape of life [and] the same conditions were encountered again, evolution could take a very different course".&lt;ref name="wonderfullife"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History| author=Gould, S.J.| authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould| year=1989| publisher=W.W. Norton |pages=282–285 |isbn=978-0-09-174271-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Conway Morris]] disputes this conclusion, arguing that convergence is a dominant force in evolution, and given that the same environmental and physical constraints are at work, life will inevitably evolve toward an "optimum" body plan, and at some point, evolution is bound to stumble upon intelligence, a trait presently identified with at least [[primates]], [[corvids]], and [[cetaceans]].&lt;ref name=SCM2005/&gt;

== Distinctions ==

===Cladistics===
In [[cladistics]], a homoplasy is a trait shared by two or more [[Taxon|taxa]] for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry are part of the same [[clade]]; cladistics seeks to arrange them according to their degree of relatedness to describe their [[phylogeny]]. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, from the point of view of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Chirat | first1=R. | last2=Moulton | first2=D.

===Atavism===
{{main|Atavism}}

In some cases, it is difficult to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an [[atavism]]. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene ([[genetic drift|selectively neutral]]) has a steadily decreasing [[probability]] of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Collin | first1=R.| last2=Cipriani | first2=R.| year=2003| title=Dollo's law and the re-evolution of shell coiling| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B| volume=270 | issue=1533 | pages=2551–2555| doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2517| pmc=1691546| pmid=14728776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallel vs. convergent evolution===

[[File:Evolutionary trends.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Evolution at an [[amino acid]] position. In each case, the left-hand species changes from having alanine (A) at a specific position in a protein in a hypothetical ancestor, and now has serine (S) there. The right-hand species may undergo [[divergent evolution|divergent]], parallel, or convergent evolution at this amino acid position relative to the first species.]]

When two species are similar in a particular character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors were also similar, and convergent if they were not.{{efn|However, all organisms share a common ancestor more or less recently, so the question of how far back to look in evolutionary time and how similar the ancestors need to be for one to consider parallel evolution to have taken place is not entirely resolved within evolutionary biology.}} Some scientists have argued that there is a continuum between parallel and convergent evolution, while others maintain that despite some overlap, there are still important distinctions between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arendt |first=J |author2=Reznick, D |title=Convergence and parallelism reconsidered: what have we learned about the genetics of adaptation?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=January 2008|volume=23|issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2007.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearce |first=T. |title=Convergence and Parallelism in Evolution: A Neo-Gouldian Account |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |date=10 November 2011 |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=429–448 |doi=10.1093/bjps/axr046}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zhang | first1=J. | last2=Kumar | first2=S. | year=1997 | title=Detection of convergent and parallel evolution at the amino acid sequence level | journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. | volume=14 | issue=5| pages=527–36 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025789| pmid=9159930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ancestral forms are unspecified or unknown, or the range of traits considered is not clearly specified, the distinction between parallel and convergent evolution becomes more subjective.  For instance, the striking example of similar placental and marsupial forms is described by [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' as a case of convergent evolution, because mammals on each continent had a long evolutionary history prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs under which to accumulate relevant differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Dawkins| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Dawkins| year= 1986| title=[[The Blind Watchmaker]]| publisher=W. W. Norton | isbn=0-393-31570-3| pages=100–106|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At molecular level==
[[File:Triad convergence ser cys.svg|thumb|400px|Evolutionary convergence of [[serine protease|serine]] and [[cysteine protease]] towards the same catalytic triads organisation of acid-base-nucleophile in different [[protein superfamily|protease superfamilies]]. Shown are the triads of [[subtilisin]], [[prolyl oligopeptidase]], [[TEV protease]], and [[papain]].]]

===Protease active sites===
{{main| catalytic triad}}
The [[enzymology]] of [[proteases]] provides some of the clearest examples of convergent evolution. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to converge on equivalent solutions independently and repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Buller&amp;Townsend_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dodson |first=G. |author2=Wlodawer, A. |title=Catalytic triads and their relatives |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |date=September 1998 |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=347–52 |pmid=9787641 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serine and cysteine proteases use different amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a [[nucleophile]]. In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a [[catalytic triad]]. The chemical and physical constraints on [[enzyme catalysis]] have caused identical triad arrangements to evolve independently more than 20 times in different [[enzyme superfamilies]].&lt;ref name="Buller&amp;Townsend_2013"/&gt;

[[Threonine protease]]s use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic [[nucleophile]]. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a [[secondary alcohol]] (i.e. has a methyl group). The methyl group of threonine greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate, as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or the histidine base. Consequently, most threonine proteases use an N-terminal threonine in order to avoid such [[steric clash]]es.
Several evolutionarily independent [[enzyme superfamilies]] with different [[protein fold]]s use the N-terminal residue as a nucleophile. This commonality of [[active site]] but difference of protein fold indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those families.&lt;ref name="Buller&amp;Townsend_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ekici|first=O.

===Eyes===
[[File:Evolution eye.svg|thumb|The camera eyes of [[vertebrate]]s (left) and [[cephalopod]]s (right) developed independently and are wired differently; for instance, [[optic nerve]] fibres reach the vertebrate [[retina]] from the front, creating a [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts MBV (1986) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ASADBUVAiDUC&amp;pg=PA574 ''Biology: A Functional Approach''] Nelson Thornes, page 274. {{ISBN|978-0-17-448019-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Eye evolution}}

One of the best-known examples of convergent evolution is the camera eye of [[Cephalopod eye|cephalopods]] (such as squid and octopus), [[vertebrate]]s (including mammals) and [[cnidaria]] (such as jellyfish).&lt;ref name="Kozmik2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozmik|first=Z |author2=Ruzickova, J |author3=Jonasova, K |author4=Matsumoto, Y. |author5=Vopalensky, P. |author6=Kozmikova, I. |author7=Strnad, H. |author8=Kawamura, S. |author9=Piatigorsky, J. |author10=Paces, V. |author11=Vlcek, C. |title=From the Cover: Assembly of the cnidarian camera-type eye from vertebrate-like components|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1 July 2008 |volume=105|issue=26 |pages=8989–8993|doi=10.1073/pnas.0800388105|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/26/8989.full |accessdate=2013-05-03 |pmid=18577593 |pmc=2449352 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.8989K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their last common ancestor had at most a simple photoreceptive spot, but a range of processes led to the [[evolution of the eye|progressive refinement of camera eyes]] — with one sharp difference: the cephalopod eye is "wired" in the opposite direction, with blood and nerve vessels entering from the back of the retina, rather than the front as in vertebrates. As a result, cephalopods lack a [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]].&lt;ref name=SCM2005/&gt;

===Flight===
[[File:Homology.jpg|thumb|upright|Vertebrate wings are partly [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] (from forelimbs), but analogous as organs of flight in (1) [[pterosaurs]], (2) [[bat]]s, (3) [[birds]], evolved separately.]]
{{further|Flying and gliding animals#Evolution and ecology of aerial locomotion}}

[[Birds]] and [[bat]]s have [[homology (biology)|homologous]] limbs because they are both ultimately derived from terrestrial [[tetrapod]]s, but their flight mechanisms are only analogous, so their wings are examples of functional convergence. The two groups have powered flight, evolved independently.  Their wings differ substantially in construction. The bat wing is a membrane stretched across four extremely elongated fingers and the legs. The airfoil of the bird wing is made of [[feather]]s, strongly attached to the forearm (the ulna) and the highly fused bones of the wrist and hand (the [[carpometacarpus]]), with only tiny remnants of two fingers remaining, each anchoring a single feather. So, while the wings of bats and birds are functionally convergent, they are not anatomically convergent.&lt;ref name=BerkeleyHomologyAnalogy&gt;{{cite web |title=Homologies and analogies |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_09 |publisher=University of California Berkeley |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plant and Animal Evolution |url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/Homology.shtml |publisher=University of Waikato |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds and bats also share a high concentration of [[cerebroside]]s in the skin of their wings. This improves skin flexibility, a trait useful for flying animals; other mammals have a far lower concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ben-Hamo |first=Miriam|last2=Muñoz-Garcia |first2=Agustí |last3=Larrain |first3=Paloma |last4=Pinshow |first4=Berry |last5=Korine |first5=Carmi |last6=Williams |first6=Joseph B.|date=June 2016 |title=The cutaneous lipid composition of bat wing and tail membranes: a case of convergent evolution with birds |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1833/20160636 |journal=Proc.

[[Flying squirrel]]s and [[sugar glider]]s are much alike in their body plans, with gliding wings stretched between their limbs, but flying squirrels are placental mammals while sugar gliders are marsupials, widely separated within the mammal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Analogy: Squirrels and Sugar Gliders |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/analogy_02 |publisher=University of California Berkeley |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insect mouthparts===
Insect mouthparts show many examples of convergent evolution. The mouthparts of different insect groups consist of a set of [[homology (biology)|homologous]] organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that insect group. Convergent evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the [[proboscis]] of flower-visiting insects such as [[bee]]s and [[flower beetle]]s,&lt;ref name="Krenn-2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krenn |first1=Harald W. |last2=Plant |first2=John D. |last3=Szucsich |first3=Nikolaus U. |year=2005 |title=Mouthparts of flower-visiting insects |journal=Arthropod Structure &amp; Development |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=1–40 |doi=10.1016/j.asd.2004.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krenn-2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bauder |first1=Julia A.S. |last2=Lieskonig |first2=Nora R. |last3=Krenn |first3=Harald W. |year=2011 |title=The extremely long-tongued Neotropical butterfly Eurybia lycisca (Riodinidae): Proboscis morphology and flower handling |journal=Arthropod Structure &amp; Development |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=122–7 |doi=10.1016/j.asd.2010.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krenn-2012-1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilhelmi |first1=Andreas P. |last2=Krenn |first2=Harald W. |year=2012 |title=Elongated mouthparts of nectar-feeding Meloidae (Coleoptera) |journal=Zoomorphology |volume=131 |issue=4 |pages=325–37 |doi=10.1007/s00435-012-0162-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the biting-sucking mouthparts of blood-sucking insects such as [[flea]]s and [[mosquito]]s.

===Opposable thumbs===
[[Opposable thumb]]s allowing the grasping of objects are most often associated with [[primates]], like humans, monkeys, apes, and lemurs. Opposable thumbs also evolved in [[giant pandas]], but these are completely different in structure, having six fingers including the thumb, which develops from a wrist bone entirely separately from other fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When is a thumb a thumb?|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/analogy_06|website=Understanding Evolution|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convergent evolution in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour. When humans migrated [[Out of Africa hypothesis|out of Africa]], they moved to more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their [[human skin color|skin pigmentation]]. It appears certain that there was some lightening of skin colour ''before'' European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to ''different'' genetic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=M.| display-authors=etal |title=Association of the OCA2 Polymorphism His615Arg with Melanin Content in East Asian Populations: Further Evidence of Convergent Evolution of Skin Pigmentation |journal=PLOS Genetics |date=2010 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000867 |volume=6 |issue=3|pages=e1000867 |pmid=20221248 |pmc=2832666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

[[Lemurs]] and [[humans]] are both primates. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans has been studied in detail and much is known about it. It is not the case that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue [[eye colour]]. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the differences between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meyer |first1=W.

While convergent evolution is often illustrated with animal examples, it has often occurred in [[plant]] evolution.

===Fruits===

A good example of convergence in plants is the evolution of edible [[fruit]]s such as [[apple]]s.

[[File:Chitinase4TC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5&lt;!--fmt for low image--&gt;|Molecular convergence in [[carnivorous plant]]s]]

[[Carnivory]] has evolved multiple times independently in plants in widely separated groups. In three species studied, ''[[Cephalotus|Cephalotus follicularis]]'', ''[[Nepenthes alata]]'' and ''[[Sarracenia purpurea]]'', there has been convergence at the molecular level. Carnivorous plants secrete [[enzymes]] into the digestive fluid they produce. By studying [[Purple acid phosphatases|phosphatase]], [[Glycoside hydrolase family 19|glycoside hydrolase]], [[glucanase]],  [[RNASET2|RNAse]] and [[chitinase]] [[enzyme]]s as well as a [[pathogenesis-related protein]] and a [[thaumatin]]-related protein,  the authors found many convergent [[amino acid]] substitutions. These changes were not at the enzymes' catalytic sites, but rather on the exposed surfaces of the proteins, where they might interact with other components of the cell or the digestive fluid. The authors also found that [[homologous gene]]s in the non-carnivorous plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' tend to have their expression increased when the plant is stressed, leading the authors to suggest that stress-responsive proteins have often been co-opted{{efn|The prior existence of suitable structures has been called [[pre-adaptation]] or [[exaptation]].}} in the repeated evolution of carnivory.&lt;ref name=Fukushima2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fukushima |first1=K |last2=Fang |first2=X |display-authors=etal |title=Genome of the pitcher plant Cephalotus reveals genetic changes associated with carnivory |journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution |date=2017 |volume=1 |issue=3 |doi=10.1038/s41559-016-0059 |doi-access=free |page=0059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of inference==

Phylogenetic reconstruction and [[Ancestral reconstruction|ancestral state reconstruction]] proceed by assuming that evolution has occurred without convergence. Convergent patterns may, however, appear at higher levels in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators. The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Stayton2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stayton |first=C. Tristan |date=2015 |title=The definition, recognition, and interpretation of convergent evolution, and two new measures for quantifying and assessing the significance of convergence |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12729/abstract |journal=Evolution |volume=69 |issue=8 |pages=2140–2153 |doi=10.1111/evo.12729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pattern-based measures ===
Earlier methods for measuring convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and [[phylogenetic]] distance by simulating evolution with a [[Brownian motion]] model of trait evolution along a phylogeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stayton |first=C. Tristan|title=Is convergence surprising?

Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.&lt;ref name="Stayton2" /&gt;

Distance-based measures assess the degree of similarity between lineages over time. Frequency-based measures assess the number of lineages that have evolved in a particular trait space.&lt;ref name="Stayton2" /&gt;

=== Process-based measures ===

Methods to infer process-based convergence fit models of selection to a phylogeny and continuous trait data to determine whether the same selective forces have acted upon lineages. This uses the [[Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process|Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process]] to test different scenarios of selection. Other methods rely on an ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' specification of where shifts in selection have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Travis |last2=Mahler |first2=D.

The '''Cross of Saint Euphrosyne''' was a revered [[relic]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and [[Belarus]], which was made in 1161 by Lazar Bohsha for the order of Saint [[Euphrosyne of Polatsk]] and lost in June 1941 in [[Mahilyow]].

Euphrosyne, [[Abbess|mother superior]] of Polatsk Convent, ordered the cross to decorate the new Transfiguration church. The simple [[cypress]] cross was decorated with gold, gemstones and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], depicting [[Jesus Christ]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Theotokos]], the [[Four Evangelists]], archangels Gabriel and Michael, and three patron saints of Euphrosyne and her parents. The work cost 120 [[hryvna]]s. Inside, the cross contained pieces of the [[True Cross|Holy Cross]] and other relics.

In the 13th century, the cross was relocated to [[Smolensk]]; after a long travel across the country, it was returned to [[Polatsk]] in 1841. The cross was thoroughly photographed for the record in 1896. In 1928 the nationalized relic was taken to [[Minsk]], then, in 1929, to [[Mahilyow]], and was locked in a safe box of the regional [[Communist Party|communist party]] headquarters.

==Disappearance==

The cross disappeared during the swift [[Operation Barbarossa|occupation of Belarus]] by German forces (June–July 1941).

There are no reliable accounts of what happened to the cross in 1941. There are at least three different versions (other than destruction by fire or plunder):

* The official Soviet version abruptly stated that the cross was looted by Germans.
* In 1991, the minister of culture of [[Belarus]] asserted that the cross, together with other Belarusian treasures, had been evacuated to [[Moscow]].
* German paperwork of the [[Alfred Rosenberg]] organization recorded a ''Mahilyow treasure'' captured by Germans in Smolensk. However, there is no evidence of the Polatsk Cross itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Nikolay Petrovsky. Who stole the cross of St. Euphrosyne // Echo Planety, No. 11, 2000 [http://www.explan.ru/archive/2000/11/s1.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228204653/// |date=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Nikolay Kuzmich, a craftsman from [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], completed an officially endorsed replica of the cross, now on display in the Polatsk cathedral.

==Modern symbolic usage==

The Cross of St. Euphrosyne is often used as a national symbol of Belarus. The 1991 version of the Belarusian coat of arms [[Pahonia]] features a cross resembling the Cross of St. Euphrosyne on the knight's shield.

The Cross is the subject of two [[Postage stamps and postal history of Belarus|postage stamps of Belarus]], issued in 1992 and 2001, and a [[commemorative coin]] of Belarus issued in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Cross of Euphrosyne will appear on a Belarusian coin [http://naviny.by/rubrics/finance/2007/10/17/ic_articles_114_153420/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The national-democratic opposition movement [[Young Front]] has the cross as main element of its symbol.

== Previous Cross-Cultural Research ==
While the field of cultural neuroscience may still be growing, there are studies conducted by various researchers that have looked at cross-cultural similarities and differences in human attention, visual perception, and the understanding of others and the self &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ames |first1=D. L. |last2=Fiske |first2=S. T. |journal=Cultural Neuroscience |date=May 20, 2010 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3714113/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Previous behavioral research has focused on the cultural differences in perception, particularly between people from East Asian and Western regions. The results from these studies have suggested that East Asians focus their visual perception more on the backgrounds and contexts of their environment, while Westerners focus on individual stimuli/objects. To further explore these findings, more research was done to specifically look at the neurological similarities and differences in attention and visual perception of people in East Asian and Western cultures.

Results from a 2008 study by Hedden et al. support the previous findings by showing how East Asians require more attention than Americans for individually processing objects &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hedden |first1=T. |last2=Ketay |first2=S. |last3=Aron |first3=A. |last4=Markus |first4=H. R. |last5=Gabrieli |first5=J. D. |title=Cultural Influences on Neural Substrates of Attentional Control |journal=Psychological Science |date=2008 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=12-17 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02038.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Brain regions more focused on attention, such as areas in the parietal and prefrontal lobes as well as the inferior parietal lobule and precentral gyrus, were found to be highly active in East Asian subjects compared to American subjects, during individual object processing. A visual perception study conducted by Gutchess et al. in 2006, also found neurological differences between Chinese and American subjects as they completed tasks of encoding images of individual objects, backgrounds, and objects with backgrounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gutchess |first1=A. H. |last2=Welsh |first2=R. C. |last3=Boduroglu |first3=A. |last4=Park |first4=D. C. |title=Cultural differences in neural function associated with object processing |journal=Cognitive, Affective, &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience |date=2006 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=102-109 |doi=10.3758/cabn.6.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The fMRI results from the study presented that during visual processing of objects, there was greater neural activity in the middle temporal gyri, right superior temporal gyri, and superior parietal lobules of the American subjects than that of the Chinese subjects. Such results indicate a focus on object processing among Westerners compared to East Asians. Insignificant differences in neural activity between subjects were found during the visual processing of images with backgrounds.

People from East Asian and Western cultures were also studied to learn more about cross-cultural differences in understanding both the self and other people. Findings from a 1991 study by Markus and Kitayama presented that people from Eastern cultures view the self in relation to others in their community, while people from Western cultures have a more independent perspective of the self &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Markus |first1=H. R. |last2=Kitayama |first2=S. |title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation |journal=Psychological Review |date=1991 |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=224-253 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A 2007 fMRI study observed differences in activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, a brain region highly active during self perception, when Western and Chinese subjects were thinking about themselves versus when they were thinking about their mothers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhu |first1=Y. |last2=Zhang |first2=L. |last3=Fan |first3=J. |last4=Han |first4=S. |title=Neural basis of cultural influence on self-representation |journal=NeuroImage |date=2007 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=1310-1316 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.08.047}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The results interestingly showed that there was still activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortices of Chinese subjects even when they thought about their mothers, while activity was only detected in American subjects when they thought about themselves.

A different study conducted by psychologist Joan Chiao found that due to cultural differences, East Asians are more likely to suffer from depression than Americans. She found that East Asians are more likely to carry the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (STG) which leads to depression while Americans carry the long allele which doesn't lead to depression. Yet due to difference in cultural structure they found that collectivist societies are more likely to find happiness than individual societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2009/10/chiao.html|title='Culture of We' Buffers Genetic Tendency to Depression: Northwestern University News|website=www.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study done by psychologists Nalini Ambady and Jonathan Freeman showed a difference in brain activity between Japanese and Americans when shown different body posture. They found that the [[Reward system|reward circuitry]] in the [[limbic system]] would light up when Japanese participants saw submissive body posture while the reward circuitry would activate when Americans saw dominant body posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/11/neuroscience.aspx|title=Your brain on culture|website=www.apa.org|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture differences in visual stimuli ==
Cultural differences exist in the ventral visual cortex and many studies have shown this. In a study conducted in 2005 they found that East Asians were more likely to keep their eyes focused on background scenes than westerners who would instead focus more on the central object such as a giraffe in a savanna. In a similar 2006 study it showed that in congruence to the difference in society structure westerners showed more activation in object processing regions, including the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus, although no activation differences were observed in context-processing regions such as the [[hippocampus]]. However, there has been some research contradicting cultural bias in the [[Oculomotor nerve|oculomotor]] control such as one conducted in 2007 by Rayner, Li, Williams, Cave, and well who failed to find evidence that East Asians focus more on context although they did find evidence that they are more likely to focus less on central objects. In a different study they focused more on difference in attention towards faces. They proved that Americans focus more broadly on the entire face such as both the eyes and mouth while Asians focus more on a single part, such as the mouth. The authors point out that this happens due to gaze avoidance in east Asian culture as a way of politeness. In 2008, another study focusing on context showed that East Asians were more likely to include greater details and background when taking photographs of a model when they were free to set the zoom function of the camera as they saw fit. In 2003, a group of researchers used the Frame-Line Test and asked the participants to draw a line of either exactly the same length as the one showed or one that was proportional in size. Americans were more accurate in the absolute task, suggesting better memory for the exact or absolute size of the focal object, but East Asians were more accurate in the relative (proportional) task, suggesting better memory for contextual relationships. In a later study conducted by the same group they found a pattern within the cultures when processing emotions. East Asians were less likely to know the difference between fear and disgust than Americans when sampling faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Denise C.|last2=Huang|first2=Chih-Mao|date=2010-07-01|title=Culture Wires the Brain: A Cognitive Neuroscience Perspective|journal=Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science|volume=5|issue=4|pages=391–400|doi=10.1177/1745691610374591|issn=1745-6916|pmc=3409833|pmid=22866061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies conducted proves that constant repetition in a certain skill has an effect on brain activity. For example, in a 2000 study they showed that taxi drivers in London showed larger gray matter in the [[Hippocampus|posterior hippocampi]] than the average civilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maguire|first=Eleanor A.|last2=Woollett|first2=Katherine|last3=Spiers|first3=Hugo J.|date=2006-01-01|title=London taxi drivers and bus drivers: a structural MRI and neuropsychological analysis|journal=Hippocampus|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1091–1101|doi=10.1002/hipo.20233|issn=1050-9631|pmid=17024677}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study in 2004 showed that those who know how to juggle have an increase in volume of the cortical tissue in the bilateral midtemporal area and left posterior [[intraparietal sulcus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Driemeyer|first=Joenna|last2=Boyke|first2=Janina|last3=Gaser|first3=Christian|last4=Büchel|first4=Christian|last5=May|first5=Arne|date=2008-07-23|title=Changes in Gray Matter Induced by Learning—Revisited|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=3|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002669|issn=1932-6203|pmc=2447176|pmid=18648501|pages=e2669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings from many neuroimaging studies reflect the behavioral patterns observed in previous anthropological and cultural research. Such comparisons that were made between particular behavioral and neural activity across different cultures, have already provided the scientific community with more insight into the cultural influences on human behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5798">The '''Day of Archaeology''' is an annual, 24-hour, international online event in which archaeologists and those in related fields write [[blog]] posts about their work.  It was inspired by the Day of Digital Humanities&lt;ref name="DoA Bckgrd"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/project-background/ | title=Day of Archaeology: Project Background | year=2013 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, similarly, allows practitioners of many kinds, to document their work informally and 'provide a window into the daily lives of archaeologists from all over the world'.&lt;ref name="DoAAbout"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/about-the-project/ | title=Day of Archaeology: About the Project | year=2013 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it encourages diversity rather than thematic posts, the project has some similarities to [[Blog Action Day]].

==Overview==
The first event took place on 27 July 2011. The event is organised by a voluntary committee of archaeologists based in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States of America]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="DoA Bckgrd" /&gt; The main site runs a customised [[WordPress]] [[content management system]] and the event is promoted through [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] pages (see [[#External links|External links]]).

The project is supported by several British archaeological and academic organisations: server space is provided on the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] servers&lt;ref name="PAS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://finds.org.uk/news/stories/article/id/213 | title=Portable Antiquities Scheme: Day of Archaeology 2011 | date=2011-04-28 | accessdate=2013-04-19 | author=Pett, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and long-term [[digital preservation]] is provided by the [[Archaeology Data Service]]. [http://www.lparchaeology.com/ L-P Archaeology] and the [[UCL Centre for Digital Humanities]] provide technical and management advice.&lt;ref name="DoA Bckgrd" /&gt; In 2011 and 2013 the event was timed to coincide with the [[Festival of British Archaeology]].&lt;ref name="Festival"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeologyfestival.org.uk/events/490 | title=Festival Listing: Day of Archaeology | publisher=Council for British Archaeology | date=July 2013 | accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project covers any form of work that could be considered archaeology and encourages contributions from any level of professionalism.&lt;ref name="DoAAbout" /&gt;



==External coverage==

Several archaeologists have blogged about the project in official&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/news/day-of-archaeology-2012 | title=RCAHMS: Day of Archaeology 2012 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and personal&lt;ref name="Netzschichten"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://netzschichten.de/2011/07/day-of-archaeology-2011/ | title=Netzschichten: Day of Archaeology | date=2011-07-28 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; capacities and the project committee wrote posts on various other sites,&lt;ref name="PAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCLDH DoA2012" /&gt; notably the [[Society for Historical Archaeology]]&lt;ref name="SHA Blog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sha.org/blog/index.php/2012/06/the-day-of-archaeology-2012 | title=Society for Historical Archaeology: The Day of Archaeology 2012 | date=2012-06-22 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="BM Blog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/tag/day-of-archaeology/ | title=A day in the life of a lot of archaeologists | date=2011-07-27 | accessdate=2013-04-19 | author=Pett, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2011 event a preliminary [[data mining]] analysis was conducted.&lt;ref name="Data Mining"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://electricarchaeology.ca/2012/07/09/mining-a-day-of-archaeology/ | title=Electric Archaeology: Mining a Day of Archaeology | date=2012-07-09 | accessdate=2013-04-19 | author=Graham, Shawn}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly, after the 2014 event a [[topic model|topic modelling]] and keyword analysis was published. &lt;ref name="Topic models"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://github.com/benmarwick/dayofarchaeology | title=A Distant Reading of the Day of Archaeology | date=2014-05-29 | accessdate=2018-02-04 | author=Marwick, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Day of Archaeology project was nominated for a British Archaeology Award in July 2011 in the 'Best Representation of Archaeology in the Media' category and was highly commended.&lt;ref name="BAA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/awards/baa2012.html#media | title=British Archaeology Awards 2012 | date=2012-07-09 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DQZ transform is the product of the [[Alpha-beta transformation|Clarke transform]] and the Park transform, first proposed in 1929 by [[Robert H. Park]].&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;R.H. Park ''Two Reaction Theory of Synchronous Machines'' AIEE Transactions 48:716-730 (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

The DQZ transform is often used in the context of electrical engineering with [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase circuits]]. The transform can be used to rotate the reference frames of ac waveforms such that they become dc signals. Simplified calculations can then be carried out on these dc quantities before performing the inverse transform to recover the actual three-phase ac results. As an example, the DQZ transform is often used in order to simplify the analysis of three-phase synchronous machines or to simplify calculations for the control of three-phase [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]]. In analysis of three-phase synchronous machines the transformation transfers three-phase stator and rotor quantities into a single rotating reference frame to eliminate the effect of time-varying inductances.

==Introduction==
The DQZ transform is made of the Park and Clarke transformation matrices. The Clarke transform (named after [[Edith Clarke]]) converts vectors in the ''ABC'' reference frame to the ''XYZ'' (often ''&amp;alpha;&amp;beta;z'') reference frame. The primary value of the Clarke transform is isolating that part of the ''ABC''-referenced vector which is common to all three components of the vector; it isolates the common-mode component (i.e., the ''Z'' component). The power-invariant, right-handed, uniformly-scaled Clarke transformation matrix is
:&lt;math&gt;K_{C} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

To convert an ''ABC''-referenced column vector to the ''XYZ'' reference frame, the vector must be pre-multiplied by the Clarke transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
\vec{u}_{XYZ} = K_{C}\cdot \vec{u}_{ABC}
&lt;/math&gt;.
And, to convert back from an ''XYZ''-referenced column vector to the ''ABC'' reference frame, the vector must be pre-multiplied by the inverse Clarke transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
\vec{u}_{ABC} = K_{C}^{-1}\cdot \vec{u}_{XYZ}
&lt;/math&gt;.

The Park transform (named after [[Robert H. Park]]) converts vectors in the ''XYZ'' reference frame to the ''DQZ'' reference frame. The primary value of the Park transform is to rotate the reference frame of a vector at an arbitrary frequency. The Park transform shifts the frequency spectrum of the signal such that the arbitrary frequency now appears as "dc" and the old dc appears as the negative of the arbitrary frequency. The Park transformation matrix is
:&lt;math&gt;K_{P} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''&amp;theta;'' is the instantaneous angle of an arbitrary ''&amp;omega;'' frequency. To convert an ''XYZ''-referenced vector to the ''DQZ'' reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre-multiplied by the Park transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
u_{DQZ} = K_{P}\cdot u_{XYZ}
&lt;/math&gt;.
And, to convert back from a ''DQZ''-referenced vector to the ''XYZ'' reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre-multiplied by the inverse Park transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
u_{XYZ} = K_{P}^{-1}\cdot u_{DQZ}
&lt;/math&gt;.

The Clarke and Park transforms together form the ''DQZ'' transform:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{CP} = K_{P}\cdot K_{C}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to\begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; \frac{-1}{2} &amp; \frac{-1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \to \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \cos{\left(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; \cos{\left(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} \\
   \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
      &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
      &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The inverse transform is:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{CP}^{-1} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
   \cos{\left(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
   \cos{\left(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
      &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

To convert an ''ABC''-referenced vector to the ''DQZ'' reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre-multiplied by the DQZ transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
u_{DQZ} = K_{CP}\cdot u_{ABC}
&lt;/math&gt;.
And, to convert back from a ''DQZ''-referenced vector to the ''ABC'' reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre-multiplied by the inverse DQZ transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
u_{ABC} = K_{CP}^{-1}\cdot u_{DQZ}
&lt;/math&gt;.

To really understand this transform better, a derivation of the transform is included.

==Derivation==

===The Park transform derivation===

The Park transform is based on the concept of the [[dot product]] and projections of vectors onto other vectors. First, let us imagine two unit vectors, &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; (the unit vectors, or axes, of the new reference frame from the perspective of the old reference frame), and a third, arbitrary, vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt;. We can define the two unit vectors and the arbitrary vector in terms of their [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] coordinates in the old reference frame:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{D} =
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)}\hat{u}_{X}
   + \sin{\left(\theta\right)}\hat{u}_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{Q} =
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)}\hat{u}_{X}
   + \cos{\left(\theta\right)}\hat{u}_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY} =
   v_{X}\hat{u}_{X}
   + v_{Y}\hat{u}_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{Y}&lt;/math&gt; are the unit basis vectors of the old coordinate system and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{D}&lt;/math&gt; unit vectors (i.e., the angle between the two reference frames). The projection of the arbitrary vector onto each of the two new unit vectors implies the dot product:
:&lt;math&gt;v_{D} =
   \hat{u}_{D}\cdot \vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to \cos{\left(\theta\right)} v_{X}
   + \sin{\left(\theta\right)} v_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_{Q} =
   \hat{u}_{Q}\cdot \vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to -\sin{\left(\theta\right)} v_{X}
   + \cos{\left(\theta\right)} v_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;.
So, &lt;math&gt;v_{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt; onto the &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{D}&lt;/math&gt; axis, and &lt;math&gt;v_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt; onto the &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; axis. These new vector components, &lt;math&gt;v_{D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, together compose the new vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{DQ}&lt;/math&gt;, the original vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the new ''DQ'' reference frame.
[[File:DQZ 8.svg|frameless|center|358px|Projection of &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt; onto the ''DQ'' reference frame.]]

Notice that the positive angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; above caused the arbitrary vector to rotate backwards when transitioned to the new ''DQ'' reference frame. In other words, its angle with respect to the new reference frame is less than its angle to the old reference frame. This is because the reference frame, not the vector, was rotated forwards. Actually, a forwards rotation of the reference frame is identical to a negative rotation of the vector.


The operation above can be summarized by a single matrix equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{DQ} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \sin{\left(\theta\right)} \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \vec{v}_{XY}&lt;/math&gt;.
This tensor can be expanded to three-dimensional problems, where the axis about which rotation occurs is left unaffected. In the following example, the rotation is about the ''Z'' axis, but any axis could have been chosen:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{P} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \sin{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; 0 \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
      &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Clarke transform derivation===

====The ABC unit basis vectors====
Consider a three-dimensional space with unit basis vectors ''A'', ''B'', and ''C''. The sphere in the figure below is used to show the scale of the reference frame for context and the box is used to provide a rotational context.
[[File:DQZ 1.svg|frameless|center|358px|''ABC'' unit basis vectors.]]

Typically, in electrical engineering (or any other context that uses three-phase systems), the three-phase components are shown in a two-dimensional perspective. However, given the three phases can change independently, they are by definition orthogonal to each other. This implies a three-dimensional perspective, as shown in the figure above. So, the two-dimensional perspective is really showing the projection of the three-dimensional reality onto a plane.
[[File:DQZ 6.svg|frameless|center|358px|Two-dimensional perspective of a three-dimensional reality.]]
Three-phase problems are typically described as operating within this plane. In reality, the problem is likely a balanced-phase problem (i.e., ''v&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0) and the net vector
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v} = v_{A}\hat{u}_{A} + v_{B}\hat{u}_{B} + v_{C}\hat{u}_{C}&lt;/math&gt;
is always on this plane.

====The AYC' unit basis vectors====
To build the Clarke transform, we actually use the Park transform in two steps. Our goal is to rotate the ''C'' axis into the corner of the box. This way the rotated ''C'' axis will be orthogonal to the plane of the two-dimensional perspective mentioned above. The first step towards building the Clarke transform requires rotating the ''ABC'' reference frame about the ''A'' axis. So, this time, the 1 will be in the first element of the Park transform:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; \cos{\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} &amp; \sin{\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\
   0 &amp; -\sin{\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} &amp; \cos{\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The following figure shows how the ''ABC'' reference frame is rotated to the ''AYC' '' reference frame when any vector is pre-multiplied by the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; matrix. The ''C' '' and ''Y'' axes now point to the midpoints of the edges of the box, but the magnitude of the reference frame has not changed (i.e., the sphere did not grow or shrink).This is due to the fact that the norm of the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; tensor is 1: ||''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|| = 1. This means that any vector in the ''ABC'' reference frame will continue to have the same magnitude when rotated into the ''AYC' '' reference frame.
[[File:DQZ 2.svg|frameless|center|358px|''AYC' '' unit basis vectors. The ''C' '' and ''Y'' axes now point to the edges of the box, but the magnitude has not changed.]]

====The XYZ unit basis vectors====
Next, the following tensor rotates the vector about the new ''Y'' axis in a counter-clockwise direction with respect to the ''Y'' axis (The angle was chosen so that the ''C' '' axis would be pointed towards the corner of the box.):
:&lt;math&gt;K_{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 &amp; -\sin{\left(\theta\right)} \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
   \sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; : \theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right) \to 35.26^\circ&lt;/math&gt;,
or
:&lt;math&gt;K_{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &amp; 0 &amp; \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.
Notice that the distance from the center of the sphere to the midpoint of the edge of the box is {{math|{{radical|2}}}} but from the center of the sphere to the corner of the box is {{math|{{radical|3}}}}. That is where the 35.26° angle came from.

The norm of the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrix is also 1, so it too does not change the magnitude of any vector pre-multiplied by the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrix.
[[File:DQZ 3.svg|frameless|center|358px|''XYZ'' unit basis vectors. The ''Z'' axis (rotated ''C' '' axis) now points into the corner of the box.]]

====The zero plane====
At this point, the ''Z'' axis is now orthogonal to the plane in which any ''ABC'' vector without a common-mode component can be found. Any balanced ''ABC'' vector waveform (a vector without a common mode) will travel about this plane. This plane will be called the zero plane and is shown below by the hexagonal outline.
[[File:DQZ 4.svg|center|358px|Plane of the vectors without common mode indicated by the hexagonal outline. The ''Z'' axis is orthogonal to this plane, and the ''X'' axis is parallel to the projection of the ''A'' axis onto the zero plane.]]

The ''X'' and ''Y'' basis vectors are on the zero plane. Notice that the ''X'' axis is parallel to the projection of the ''A'' axis onto the zero plane. The ''X'' axis is slightly larger than the projection of the ''A'' axis onto the zero plane. It is larger by a factor of {{math|{{radical|3/2}}}}. The arbitrary vector did not change magnitude through this conversion from the ''ABC'' reference frame to the ''XYZ'' reference frame (i.e., the sphere did not change size). This is true for the power-invariant form of the Clarke transform. The following figure shows the common two-dimensional perspective of the ''ABC'' and ''XYZ'' reference frames.
[[File:DQZ 7.svg|center|358px|Two-dimensional perspective of the ''ABC'' and ''XYZ'' reference frames.]]

It might seem odd that though the magnitude of the vector did not change, the magnitude of its components did (i.e., the ''X'' and ''Y'' components are longer than the ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' components). Perhaps this can be intuitively understood by considering that for a vector without common mode, what took three values (''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' components) to express, now only takes 2 (''X'' and ''Y'' components) since the ''Z'' component is zero. Therefore, the ''X'' and ''Y'' component values must be larger to compensate.

====Combination of tensors====
The power-invariant Clarke transformation matrix is a combination of the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tensors:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{C} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
   \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &amp; 0 &amp; \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}
\end{bmatrix}}_{K_2}\cdot\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}}_{K_1}&lt;/math&gt;,
or
:&lt;math&gt;K_{C} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to \begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that when multiplied through, the bottom row of the ''K&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' matrix is 1/{{math|{{radical|3}}}}, not 1/3. (It should be noted that Edith Clarke did use 1/3 for the power-variant case.) The ''Z'' component is not exactly the average of the ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' components. If only the bottom row elements were changed to be 1/3, then the sphere would be squashed along the ''Z'' axis. This means that the ''Z'' component would not have the same scaling as the ''X'' and ''Y'' components.
[[File:DQZ 9.svg|frameless|center|358px|''K&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' frame (blue) and the original Edith matrix (green).]]
As things are written above, the norm of the Clarke transformation matrix is still 1, which means that it only rotates an ''ABC'' vector but does not scale it. The same cannot be said for Clarke's original transform.

====Power-variant form====

It is sometimes desirable to scale the Clarke transformation matrix so that the ''X'' axis is the projection of the ''A'' axis onto the zero plane. To do this, we uniformly apply a scaling factor of {{math|{{radical|2/3}}}} to get the power-variant Clarke transformation matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\hat{C}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot 
\underbrace{\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}}_{K_C}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to \frac{2}{3}\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\hat{C}} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{2}{3} &amp; -\frac{1}{3} &amp; -\frac{1}{3} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\
   \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

This will necessarily shrink the sphere by a factor of {{math|{{radical|2/3}}}} as shown below. Notice that this new ''X'' axis is exactly the projection of the ''A'' axis onto the zero plane.
[[File:DQZ 5.svg|center|358px|The scaled ''XYZ'' reference frame of the power-variant Clarke transform.]]

With the power-variant Clarke transform, the magnitude of the arbitrary vector is smaller in the ''XYZ'' reference frame than in the ''ABC'' reference frame (the norm of the transform is {{math|{{radical|2/3}}}}), but the magnitudes of the individual vector components are the same (when there is no common mode). So, as an example, a signal defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
   A \\
   B \\
   C
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\omega t\right)} \\
   \cos{\left(\omega t - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} \\
   \cos{\left(\omega t + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
becomes, in the ''XYZ'' reference frame,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
   X \\
   Y \\
   Z
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\omega t\right)} \\
   \cos{\left(\omega t - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \\
   0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;,
a new vector whose components are the same magnitude as the original components: 1. In many cases, this is an advantageous quality of the power-variant Clarke transform.

===The DQZ transform===

The DQZ transformation uses the Clarke transform to convert ''ABC''-referenced vectors into two differential-mode components (i.e., ''X'' and ''Y'') and one common-mode component (i.e., ''Z'') and then applies the Park transform to rotate the reference frame about the ''Z'' axis at some given speed. The ''X'' component becomes the ''D'' component, which is in ''direct'' alignment with the vector of rotation, and the ''Y'' component becomes the ''Q'' component, which is at a ''quadrature'' angle to the direct component. The DQZ transform is
:&lt;math&gt;K_{CP} = K_{P}\cdot K_{C}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\to\begin{bmatrix}
   \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   -\sin{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; \cos{\left(\theta\right)} &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; \frac{-1}{2} &amp; \frac{-1}{2} \\
   0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Code implementation==

For computational efficiency, it makes sense to keep the Clarke and Park transforms separate and not combine them into one transform.

A computationally-efficient implementation of the power-invariant Clarke transform is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
X = (2*A – B – C)*(1/sqrt(6));
Y = (B – C)*(1/sqrt(2));
Z = (A + B + C)*(1/sqrt(3));
&lt;/source&gt;
while its inverse is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
A = (1/sqrt(3))*Z;
B = A - (1/sqrt(6))*X;
C = B – (1/sqrt(2))*Y;
B += (1/sqrt(2))*Y;
A += (sqrt(2/3))*X;
&lt;/source&gt;
A computationally-efficient implementation of the power-variant Clarke transform is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
X = (2*A – B – C)*(1/3);
Y = (B – C)*(1/sqrt(3));
Z = (A + B + C)*(sqrt(2)/3);
&lt;/source&gt;
while its inverse is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
A = (1/sqrt(2))*Z;
B = A – (1/2)*X;
C = B – (sqrt(3)/2)*Y;
B += (sqrt(3)/2)*Y;
A += X;
&lt;/source&gt;
Evidently, the constant coefficients could be pre-calculated.

A computationally-efficient implementation of the Park transform is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
co = cos(theta);
si = sin(theta);

D = co*X + si*Y;
Q = co*Y - si*X;
&lt;/source&gt;
while its inverse is
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
co = cos(theta);
si = sin(theta);

X = co*D - si*Q;
Y = si*D + co*Q;
&lt;/source&gt;
Of course, it makes sense to only calculate &lt;tt&gt;co&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;si&lt;/tt&gt; once if both the Park and inverse Park transforms are going to be used.

==Example==
In electric systems, very often the ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' values are oscillating in such a way that the net vector is spinning. In a balanced system, the vector is spinning about the ''Z'' axis. Very often, it is helpful to rotate the reference frame such that the majority of the changes in the abc values, due to this spinning, are canceled out and any finer variations become more obvious.

The DQZ transformation can be thought of in geometric terms as the projection of the three separate sinusoidal phase quantities onto two axes rotating with the same angular velocity as the sinusoidal phase quantities.
[[File:Geometric interpretation of dqo transform.jpg|frameless|center|716px|DQZ example.]]
Shown above is the DQZ transform as applied to the stator of a synchronous machine. There are three windings separated by 120 physical degrees. The three phase currents are equal in magnitude and are separated from one another by 120 electrical degrees. The three phase currents lag their corresponding phase voltages by &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. The ''DQ'' axes are shown rotating with angular velocity equal to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, the same angular velocity as the phase voltages and currents. The ''D'' axis makes an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta = \omega t&lt;/math&gt; with the phase ''A'' winding which has been chosen as the reference.The currents &lt;math&gt;I_D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_Q&lt;/math&gt; are constant dc quantities.

==Comparison with other transforms==

===Park's transformation===

The transformation originally proposed by Park differs slightly from the one given above. In Park's transformation q-axis is ahead of d-axis, qd0, and the \theta angle is the angle between phase-a and q-axis, as given below:

:&lt;math&gt;P= \frac{2}{3}\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta)&amp;\cos(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp;\cos(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}) \\
\sin(\theta)&amp; \sin(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp; \sin(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}) \\
\frac{1}{2}&amp;\frac{1}{2}&amp;\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;P^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}\cos(\theta)&amp; \sin(\theta)&amp;1\\
\cos(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp; \sin(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp;1\\
\cos(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp; \sin(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3})&amp;1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===αβγ transform===
{{Main article|αβγ transform}}

The dqo transform is conceptually similar to the [[αβγ transform]]. Whereas the dqo transform is the projection of the phase quantities onto a rotating two-axis reference frame, the αβγ transform can be thought of as the projection of the phase quantities onto a stationary two-axis reference frame.

{{Contains Tibetan text}}
'''Dzong architecture''' is a distinctive type of fortress ({{bo|w=rdzong}}, {{IPA-all|tz&lt;sup&gt;ɦ&lt;/sup&gt;oŋ˩˨}}) [[architectural style|architecture]] found mainly in [[Bhutan]] and [[Tibet]]. The architecture is massive in style with towering exterior walls surrounding a complex of [[courtyard]]s, temples, administrative offices, and monks' accommodation.

==Characteristics==
Distinctive features include:
* High inward sloping walls of brick and stone painted white with few or no windows in the lower sections of the wall
* Use of a surrounding red ochre stripe near the top of the walls, sometimes punctuated by large gold circles.
* Use of unique style flared roofs atop interior temples.
* Massive entry doors made of wood and iron
* Interior courtyards and temples brightly colored in Buddhist-themed art [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] such as the [[ashtamangala]] or [[swastika]], for example.

==Regional differences==

===Bhutan===
{{See also|History of Bhutan}}
Dzongs serve as the religious, military, administrative, and social centers of their district. They are often the site of an annual ''[[tsechu]]'' or religious festival.

The rooms inside the dzong are typically allocated half to administrative function (such as the office of the ''[[penlop]]'' or governor), and half to religious function, primarily the temple and housing for monks. This division between administrative and religious functions reflects the idealized [[dual system of government|duality of power]] between the religious and administrative branches of government.

===Tibet===
{{Further|List of administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region}}
Tibet used to be divided into 53 prefecture districts also called ''dzongs''.&lt;ref name=Tibet&gt;''Le Tibet'', Marc Moniez, Christian Deweirdt, Monique Masse, Éditions de l'Adret, Paris, 1999, {{ISBN|2-907629-46-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two [[dzongpen|dzongpöns]] for each dzong, a [[lama]] and a layman. They were entrusted with both civil and military powers and are equal in all respects, though subordinate to the generals and the Chinese [[amban]] in military matters,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarat Chandra Das|Das, Sarat Chandra]]. (1902). ''Lhasa and Central Tibet''. Reprint (1988): Mehra Offset Press, Delhi, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; until the expulsion of the ambans following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=Tibet/&gt; Today, 71 [[List of administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region|counties]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] are called ''dzong''s in the [[Tibetic languages]].

==Siting of dzongs==
[[Image:TrongsaDzong.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Trongsa Dzong]], the largest dzong fortress in [[Bhutan]].]]
Bhutanese dzong architecture reached its zenith in the 17th century under the leadership of [[Ngawang Namgyal]], the 1st [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]]. The Zhabdrung relied on visions and omens to site each of the dzongs. Modern military strategists would observe that the dzongs are well-sited with regard to their function as defensive fortresses. [[Wangdue Phodrang]] dzong, for instance, is set upon a spur overlooking the confluence of the [[Sankosh River|Sankosh]] (Puna Tsang) and [[Tang Chuu|Tang]] Rivers, thus blocking any attacks by southern invaders who attempted to use a river route to bypass the trackless slopes of the middle Himalayas in attacking central Bhutan. [[Drukgyel]] Dzong at the head of the [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] valley guards the traditional [[Tibet]]an invasion path over the passes of the high Himalayas.
[[Image:Wangdue Phodrang Dzong.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Dzong at [[Wangdue Phodrang]], Bhutan.]]
Dzongs were frequently built on a hilltop or mountain spur. If the dzong is built on the side of a valley wall, a smaller dzong or watchtower is typically built directly uphill from the main dzong with the purpose of keeping the slope clear of attackers who might otherwise shoot downward into the courtyard of the main dzong below (see image at head of article).

[[Punakha Dzong]] is distinctive in that it is sited on a relatively flat spit of land at the confluence of the [[Mo Chhu|Mo]] and [[Pho Chhu|Pho]] Rivers. The rivers surround the dzong on three sides, providing protection from attack. This siting proved inauspicious, however, when in 1994 a glacial lake 90 kilometers upstream burst through its [[Ice jam|ice dam]] to cause a massive flood on the Pho Chhu, damaging the dzong and taking 23 lives.

==Construction==
[[Image:Bhutan architecture dzong roof.jpg|thumb|upright|Roof construction at Tongsa dzong.]]
By tradition, dzongs are constructed without the use of architectural plans. Instead construction proceeds under the direction of a high [[lama]] who establishes each dimension by means of spiritual inspiration.

In previous times the dzongs were built using [[corvée]] labor which was applied as a tax against each household in the district. Under this obligation each family was to provide or hire a decreed number of workers to work for several months at a time (during quiet periods in the agricultural year) in the construction of the dzong.

Dzongs comprise heavy [[masonry]] curtain walls surrounding one or more courtyards. The main functional spaces are usually arranged in two separate areas: the administrative offices; and the religious functions - including temples and monks' accommodation. This accommodation is arranged along the inside of the outer walls and often as a separate stone tower located centrally within the courtyard, housing the main temple, that can be used as an inner defensible citadel. The main internal structures are again built with stone (or as in domestic architecture by rammed clay blocks), and whitewashed inside and out, with a broad red [[ochre]] band at the top on the outside. The larger spaces such as the temple have massive internal timber columns and beams to create galleries around an open central full height area. Smaller structures are of elaborately carved and painted timber construction.

The roofs are massively constructed in [[hardwood]] and [[bamboo]], highly decorated at the [[eaves]], and are constructed traditionally without the use of nails. They are open at the eaves to provide a ventilated storage area. They were traditionally finished with timber [[Roof shingle|shingle]]s weighted down with stones; but in almost all cases this has now been replaced with [[corrugated galvanised iron]] roofing. The roof of Tongsa Dzong, illustrated, is one of the few shingle roofs to survive and was being restored in 2006/7.

The courtyards, usually stone-flagged, are generally at a higher level than the outside and approached by massive staircases and narrow defensible entrances with large wooden doors. All doors have thresholds to discourage the entrance of spirits. Temples are usually set at a level above the courtyard with further staircases up to them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern architecture in the dzong style==
Larger modern buildings in Bhutan often use the form and many of the external characteristics of dzong architecture in their construction, although incorporating modern techniques such as a concrete frame.

===University of Texas at El Paso===
The campus architecture of the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] (UTEP) is a rare example of dzong style seen outside the Himalayas. Initial phases were designed by El Paso architect [[Trost &amp; Trost|Henry Trost]], and later phases have continued in the same style.&lt;ref&gt;For more details see the ''[http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?PageContentMode=1&amp;tabid=30289 UTEP Handbook of Operations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210043029/http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?PageContentMode=1&amp;tabid=30289 |date=2012-02-10 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==UNESCO Tentative Listing==
In 2012, the Butanese government listed five dzongs to its tentative list for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] inscription in the future. The five dzongs are Punakha Dzong, Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, Paro Dzong, Trongsa Dzong and Dagana Dzong.&lt;ref&gt;https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5695/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food energy''' is [[chemical energy]] that [[animal]]s (including [[human]]s) derive from [[food]] through the process of [[cellular respiration]]. Cellular respiration may either involve the chemical reaction of food molecules with molecular [[oxygen]]&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schmidt-Rohr K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 2094–2099}}&lt;/ref&gt; (aerobic respiration) or the process of reorganizing the food molecules without additional oxygen ([[anaerobic respiration]]).

==Overview==
Humans and other animals need a minimum intake of food energy to sustain their [[metabolism]] and to drive their muscles. Foods are composed chiefly of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, [[protein in nutrition|proteins]], [[water]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[dietary mineral|minerals]]. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water represent virtually all the weight of food, with vitamins and minerals making up only a small percentage of the weight. (Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins comprise ninety percent of the dry weight of foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec12/ch152/ch152b.html |title=Carbohydrates, Proteins, Nutrition|work= The Merck Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Organisms derive food energy from carbohydrates, fats and proteins as well as from [[organic acid]]s, [[polyol]]s, and [[ethanol]] present in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, K. A. (2000c) Energy and fuel, in Littledyke M., Ross K. A. and Lakin E. (eds), Science Knowledge and the Environment. London: David Fulton Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] components that provide little or no food energy, such as water, minerals, vitamins, [[cholesterol]] and insoluble fiber, may still be necessary to health and survival for other reasons. Water, minerals, vitamins, and cholesterol are not broken down (they are used by the body in the form in which they are absorbed) and so cannot be used for energy. Fiber cannot be completely digested by most animals, including humans, who can only extract 2 kcal/g of food energy. [[Ruminant]]s can extract nearly 4 kcal/g from fiber because of the [[bacteria]] in their [[rumen]]s.

Using the [[International System of Units]], researchers measure energy in [[joule]]s (J) or in its multiples; the [[kilojoule]] (kJ) is most often used for food-related quantities. An older [[metric system]] unit of energy, still widely used in food-related contexts, is the [[calorie]]; more precisely, the "food calorie", "large calorie" or [[kilocalorie]] (kcal or Cal), equal to 4184 joules. (Contrast the "small calorie" (cal), equal to {{sfrac|1|1000}} of a food calorie, that is often used in [[chemistry]] and in [[physics]].) Within the [[European Union]], both the kilocalorie ("kcal") and kilojoule ("kJ") appear on [[nutrition facts label|nutrition labels]]. In many countries, only one of the units is displayed; in Canada and the United States labels spell out the unit as "calorie" or as "Calorie".

Fats and ethanol have the greatest amount of food energy per gram, 37 and 29&amp;nbsp;kJ/g (8.8 and 6.9&amp;nbsp;kcal/g), respectively. Proteins and most carbohydrates both have about {{convert|17|kJ/g|kcal/g|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;The heats of combustion for glucose, sucrose, and starch are 15.57, 16.48 and 17.48&amp;nbsp;kJ/g respectively, or 3.72, 3.94 and 4.18&amp;nbsp;kcal/g.&lt;/ref&gt; The differing [[energy density]] of foods (fat, alcohols, carbohydrates and proteins) lies mainly in their varying proportions of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms: For food of elemental composition C&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;''o''&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the heat of combustion underlying the food energy is 100&amp;nbsp;kcal/g (''c'' + 0.3 ''h'' − 0.5 ''o'')/(12 ''c'' + ''h'' + 16 ''o'' + 14 ''n'') to a good approximation (±3%).&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15"/&gt; Carbohydrates that are not easily absorbed, such as fiber, or [[lactose]] in lactose-intolerant individuals, contribute less food energy. Polyols (including [[sugar alcohol]]s) and organic acids contribute {{convert|10|kJ/g|kcal/g|abbr=on}} and {{convert|13|kJ/g|kcal/g|abbr=on}} respectively.&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt;

==Measure==
Theoretically, one could measure food energy in different ways, using (say) the [[Gibbs free energy]] of combustion, or the amount of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] generated by metabolizing the food. However, the convention is to use the heat of the oxidation reaction producing liquid water. Conventional food energy is based on heats of combustion in a [[bomb calorimeter]] and corrections that take into consideration the efficiency of digestion and absorption and the production of [[urea]] and other substances in the urine. The American chemist [[Wilbur Atwater]] worked these corrections out in the late 19th century&lt;ref name="Trivedi"/&gt; (see [[Atwater system]] for more detail). Based on the work of Atwater, it became common practice to calculate energy content of foods using 4&amp;nbsp;kcal/g for carbohydrates and proteins and 9&amp;nbsp;kcal/g for [[lipid]]s.&lt;ref name="Trivedi"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bijal Trivedi|title=The calorie delusion: Why food labels are wrong|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=Jul 15, 2009|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327171-200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was later improved by [[Annabel Merrill]] and [[Bernice Watt]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], who derived a system whereby specific calorie conversion factors for different foods were proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabel Merrill|author2=Bernice Watt|title=Energy Values of Food ... basis and derivation|date=1973|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/Classics/ah74.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122060858/https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/Classics/ah74.pdf|archivedate=November 22, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nutrition labels ==

[[Image:Nutrition-label.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The nutritional information label on a pack of [[Basmati rice]] in the United Kingdom]]

Many governments [[Mandatory labelling|require food manufacturers to label]] the energy content of their products, to help consumers control their energy intake.&lt;ref name="eu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l21092.htm |title=European Union regulations on nutrition labeling |access-date=2009-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304000550/http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l21092.htm |archive-date=2009-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union, manufacturers of packaged food must label the nutritional energy of their products in both kilocalories and kilojoules, when required. In the United States, the equivalent mandatory labels display only "Calories" (kilocalories),&lt;ref name="us-21cfr101"&gt;United States federal food-labeling regulations [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2004/aprqtr/21cfr101.9.htm 21CFR101.9]&lt;/ref&gt; often as a substitute for the name of the quantity being measured, food energy; an additional kilojoules figure is optional and is rarely used. In Australia and New Zealand, the food energy must be stated in kilojoules (and optionally in kilocalories as well), and other nutritional energy information is similarly conveyed in kilojoules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/labelling/panels/Pages/default.aspx |title=Australian &amp; New Zealand Food Standards, Nutrition Information Panels |publisher=Foodstandards.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8700.com.au |title=NSW Government's 8700 (kJ) dietary information website |publisher=8700.com.au |date= |accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy available from the respiration of food is usually given on labels for 100&amp;nbsp;g, for a typical serving size (according to the manufacturer), and/or for the entire pack contents.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The amount of food energy associated with a particular food could be measured by completely burning the dried food in a [[calorimeter|bomb calorimeter]], a method known as direct [[calorimetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youdim |first=Adrienne |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders_of_nutrition/overview_of_nutrition/calories.html |title=Calories: Overview of Nutrition: Merck Manual Home Edition |publisher=Merckmanuals.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the values given on food labels are not determined in this way. The reason for this is that direct calorimetry also burns the [[dietary fiber]], and so does not allow for fecal losses; thus direct calorimetry would give systematic overestimates of the amount of fuel that actually enters the blood through digestion. What are used instead are standardized chemical tests or an analysis of the recipe using reference tables for common ingredients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Health Canada, [[PDF]] p. 4| year=1997|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/fiche-nutri-data/nutrient_value-valeurs_nutritives-eng.php|format=PDF|title=Nutrient Value of Some Common Foods|accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to estimate the product's digestible constituents ([[protein]], [[carbohydrate]], [[fat]], etc.). These results are then converted into an equivalent energy value based on the following standardized table of energy densities.&lt;ref name="uk"&gt;United Kingdom [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/contents/made The Food Labelling Regulations 1996] – [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/schedule/7/made Schedule 7: Nutrition labelling]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="std-table"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1990L0496:20081211:EN:PDF |title=Council directive 90/496/EEC of 24 September 1990 on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs |date= |accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However "energy density" is a misleading term for it once again assumes that energy is IN the particular food, whereas it simply means that "high density" food needs more oxygen during respiration, leading to greater transfer of energy.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example the Energy section (follow "Fuels") in Science Issues http://scienceissues.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the following standardized table of energy densities&lt;ref name="std-table" /&gt; is an approximation and the value in kJ/g does not convert exactly to kcal/g using a conversion factor.

The use of such a simple system has been criticized for not taking into consideration other factors pertaining to the influence of different foods on obesity.&lt;ref name=Trivedi/&gt;

All the other nutrients in food are noncaloric and are thus not counted.

==Recommended daily intake==
Increased mental activity has been linked with moderately increased [[Brain metabolism|brain energy consumption]].&lt;ref name="Larsen et al. 1995"&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/01602896/1995/00000021/00000003/art90017;jsessionid=1vc0khhvsj1vg.alice?format=print Evaluation of a ''mental effort'' hypothesis for correlations between cortical metabolism and intelligence], Intelligence, Volume 21, Number 3, November 1995, pp. 267–278(12), 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
Older people and those with [[sedentary lifestyle]]s require less energy; children and physically active people require more.

According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]], the average minimum energy requirement per person per day is about {{convert|1800|kcal|kJ|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/hunger/en/#jfmulticontent_c130584-2|title=Hunger – FAO – Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommendations in the United States are {{convert|2600|and|2000|kcal|kJ|abbr=on}} for men and women (respectively) between 31 and 35, at a physical activity level equivalent to walking about {{convert|1+1/2|to|3|mi|abbr=on|order=flip|0}} per day at {{convert|3|to|4|mph|abbr=on|order=flip|0}} in addition to the light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life.&lt;ref name="Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 8th Edition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-2/ |title=Appendix 2. Estimated Calorie Needs per Day, by Age, Sex, and Physical Activity Level - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines |publisher=health.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; French guidance suggests roughly the same levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anses.fr/Documents/ANC-Ft-TableauxApportsE.pdf |title=Recommended energy intake |accessdate=30 April 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126032442/http://www.anses.fr/Documents/ANC-Ft-TableauxApportsE.pdf |archivedate=26 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For young children, estimated caloric needs range from 1,000 to 2,000 kilocalories per day. The recommended caloric intake for older children and adolescents, on the other hand, varies greatly from 1,400 to 3,200 kilocalories per day. Boys in general require higher caloric intake than girls.&lt;ref name="Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 8th Edition" /&gt;

Recognizing that people of different age and gender groups have varying daily activity levels, Australia's [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] recommends no single daily energy intake but instead prescribes an appropriate recommendation for each age and gender group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrv.gov.au/energy.htm|title=Dietary Energy|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, nutrition labels on Australian food products typically recommend the average daily energy intake of {{convert|2100|kcal|kJ|abbr=on}}.

== Energy usage in the human body ==
{{Main article|Bioenergetics|Energy balance (biology)}}

The human body uses the energy released by respiration for a wide range of purposes: about 20% of the energy is used for brain metabolism, and much of the rest is used for the basal metabolic requirements of other organs and tissues. In cold environments, metabolism may increase simply to produce heat to maintain body temperature. Among the diverse uses for energy, one is the production of mechanical energy by skeletal muscle to maintain posture and produce motion.

The conversion efficiency of energy from respiration into mechanical (physical) [[power (physics)|power]] depends on the type of food and on the type of physical energy usage (e.g., which muscles are used, whether the muscle is used [[Aerobic exercise|aerobically]] or [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobically]]). In general, the efficiency of muscles is rather low: only 18 to 26% of the energy available from respiration is converted into mechanical energy.&lt;ref name="seiler"&gt;Stephen Seiler, [http://home.hia.no/~stephens/effiperf.htm Efficiency, Economy and Endurance Performance]. (1996, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; This low efficiency is the result of about 40% efficiency of generating [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] from the respiration of food, losses in converting energy from ATP into mechanical work inside the muscle, and mechanical losses inside the body. The latter two losses are dependent on the type of exercise and the type of muscle fibers being used (fast-twitch or slow-twitch). For an overall efficiency of 20%, one watt of mechanical power is equivalent to {{convert|4.3|kcal|kJ|abbr=on}} per hour. For example, a manufacturer of rowing equipment shows calories released from 'burning' food as four times the actual mechanical work, plus {{convert|300|kcal|kJ|abbr=on}} per hour,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concept2.com/us/support/manuals/pdf/B_UsersManual.pdf Concept II Rowing Ergometer, user manual] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226185824/http://www.concept2.com/us/support/manuals/pdf/B_UsersManual.pdf |date=December 26, 2010 }}. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; which amounts to about 20% efficiency at 250 watts of mechanical output. It can take up to 20 hours of little physical output (e.g., walking) to "burn off" {{convert|4000|kcal|kJ|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Guyton AC, Hall JE Textbook of medical physiology 11ed p. 887 Elsevier Saunders 2006&lt;/ref&gt; more than a body would otherwise consume. For reference, each kilogram of body fat is roughly equivalent to {{convert|32,300|kJ|kcal|disp=or}} of food energy (i.e., 3,500 kilocalories per pound).&lt;ref&gt;[Wishnofsky, M. Caloric Equivalents of Gained or Lost Weight. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, (1958).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in body temperature&amp;nbsp;– either hotter or cooler&amp;nbsp;– increase the metabolic rate, thus burning more energy. Prolonged exposure to extremely warm or very cold environments increases the [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR). People who live in these types of settings often have BMRs 5–20% higher than those in other climates.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]], '''Functional Sentence Perspective''' (FSP) is a theory describing the information structure of the sentence and language communication in general. It has been developed in the tradition of the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague School]] of Functional and Structural Linguistics together with its sister theory, Topic-Focus Articulation.

The key concepts of FSP were laid down by [[Jan Firbas]] in the mid-1950s on the basis of the linguistic work of [[Vilém Mathesius]], especially his idea of functional syntax in linguistic characterology of language.

==Terminology==
The term '''Functional Sentence Perspective''' was created by Jan Firbas as a more convenient English equivalent of Mathesius’ Czech term [[:cz:aktuální členění větné|aktuální členění větné]]:

{{quote|“It is not without interest to note that Mathesius, who knew [[Henri Weil|Weil]]’s work, coined the felicitous term ‘aktuální členění větné. … As English ‘actual’ is not an exact equivalent of Czech ‘aktuální’, another term had to be found for English. I accepted Professor [[Josef Vachek]]’s suggestion and started using the term ‘functional sentence perspective’ (FSP; Firbas 1957). The term is based on Mathesius’ term ‘Satzperspektive’. Vachek’s suggestion has added the qualification ‘functional’. This is the way the term ‘functional sentence perspective’ (FSP) has found its way into the literature.”|Firbas, 1994, p. 4}}

Within Czech linguistics the Czech calque of the English term Functional Sentence Perspective '''funkční větná perspektiva''' is nowadays used to refer to the approach stemming from the writings of Jan Firbas and his followers, while the original Mathesius’ Czech term '''aktuální členění větné''' tends to be associated with the group of linguists developing the Topic-Focus Articulation, i.e. [[Petr Sgall]], [[Eva Hajičová]], [[Jarmila Panevová]] and their disciples, despite the fact that both terms are still sometimes used interchangeably in some Czech contributions to the topic of information structure of language. (Cf.  Karlík - Nekula - Pleskalová (2002))

The '''Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey''', or '''GOODS''', is an [[astronomical survey]] combining deep observations from three of [[NASA]]'s [[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]]: the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], and the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], along with data from other [[Space observatory|space-based telescopes]], such as [[XMM Newton]], and some of the world's most powerful ground-based telescopes.

GOODS is intended to enable astronomers to study the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of galaxies]] in the distant, early universe.

[[File:Galaxy history revealed by the Hubble Space Telescope (GOODS-ERS2).jpg|thumb|center|600px|GOODS Field (Hubble component)]]

The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey consists of optical and near-infrared imaging taken with the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the [[Very Large Telescope]] and the 4-m telescope at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]]; [[infrared]] data from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].  These are added to pre-existing x-ray data from the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[ESA]]s [[XMM-Newton]], two fields of 10' by 16'; one centered on the [[Hubble Deep Field]] North (12h 36m 55s, +62° 14m 15s) and the other on the [[Chandra Deep Field South]] (3h 32m 30s, -27° 48m 20s).  

The two GOODS fields are the most data-rich areas of the sky in terms of depth and wavelength coverage.

==Instruments==
[[File:GOODS-South field.jpg|thumb|Composite image of the GOODS-South field, result of a deep survey using two of the four giant 8.2-metre telescopes composing [[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope]]]]

GOODS consists of data from the following space-based observatories:
*The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (optical imaging with the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]])
*The [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] ([[infrared]] imaging)
*The [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] ([[X-ray]])
*[[XMM-Newton]] (an X-ray telescope belonging to the [[European Space Agency]])
*The [[Herschel Space Observatory]] (an infrared telescope belonging to the ESA)

==Hubble Space Telescope images==
GOODs used the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] with four filters, centered at 435, 606, 775 and 850&amp;nbsp;nm. The resulting map covers 30 times the area of the [[Hubble Deep Field]] to a photometric magnitude less sensitivity, and has enough resolution to allow the study of 1&amp;nbsp;[[parsec|kpc]]-scale objects at redshifts up to 6. It also provides photometric redshifts for over 60,000 galaxies within the field, providing an excellent sample for studying bright galaxies at high redshifts.&lt;ref name="Beckwith2006"&gt;{{cite journal

==Herschel==
In May 2010, scientists announced that the [[infrared]] data from the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] was joining the GOODS dataset, after initial analysis of data using Herschel's [[Herschel Space Observatory#Instrumentation|PACS and SPIRE]] instruments. In October 2009, Herschel observed the GOODS-North field, and in January 2010 the GOODS-South field. In so doing, Herschel identified sources for the [[Cosmic infrared background|Cosmic Infrared Background]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Herschel_Reveals_Galaxies_In_The_Goods_Fields_In_A_Brand_New_Light_999.html Herschel Reveals Galaxies In The GOODS Fields In A Brand New Light], spacedaily.com, 12 May 2009, accessed 13 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2177">'''Hajar Am-Dhaybiyya''' ([[Arabic]]: هجر امذيبية) is an ancient settlement that date back to the kingdom of Hadramawt in [[Nisab District|Nisab]] district of [[Shabwah Governorate]] in [[Yemen]]. The site [[necropolis]] (100 m large) revealed elaborate and extraordinary burial objects. Though the findings was concentrated in a small portion of the general area. Four burials only were excavated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=dasi_prj_sit&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=0&amp;colId=0&amp;navId=36512484&amp;recId=279/ DASI: Hajar am-Dhaybiyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
[[File:Shabwa2.jpg||thumb|250px| Silver ladle found in one of the burials]]
The city sequence is divided into 5 phases based on major changes of the site architecture. The initial phase on the hill top is usually dated to first centuries AD and was dominated by a single building constructed using characteristic technique of pre-Islamic south Arabia. Only one room in the structure with preserved floor exist. It appears, from the fill beneath the plaster floor, that at one point, the building was renewed. Glacis (4–6 m wide) was also constructed on the site, however whether it encircle the entire tell is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Two seasons at Hajar Am-Dhaybiyya, Yemen, Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy (AEE):  P.93&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging from the surface layers of the necropolis, the tombs appear to span over several centuries. Grave 3 is dated approximately between 1st to 4th century AD. And the artifacts found there shows detectable Roman artistic influence.

Four burials had been excavated in the site necropolis, only grave 3 was intact, and it yielded great amount of funerary possessions. Which apparently belonged to either an upper class individual, or rather a soldier as suggested by the presence of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=dasi_prj_sit&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=0&amp;colId=0&amp;navId=36512484&amp;recId=279/ DASI: Hajar am-Dhaybiyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program''' ('''HAARP''') was initiated as an [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] research program jointly funded by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], and the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).&lt;ref name="FAQ Sheet"&gt;

The most prominent instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power [[radio frequency]] [[transmitter]] facility operating in the [[high frequency]] (HF) band. The IRI is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the [[ionosphere]]. Other instruments, such as a [[VHF]] and a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[radar]], a [[fluxgate compass|fluxgate]] [[magnetometer]], a digisonde (an [[ionospheric sounding]] device), and an induction magnetometer, are used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region.

Work on the HAARP facility began in 1993. The current working IRI was completed in 2007; its prime contractor was [[BAE Systems Inc.|BAE Systems Advanced Technologies]].&lt;ref name="FAQ Sheet" /&gt; As of 2008, HAARP had incurred around $250 million in tax-funded construction and operating costs. In May 2014, it was announced that the HAARP program would be permanently shut down later in the year.&lt;ref name="ADNCole2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/2014/05/14/3470442/air-force-prepares-to-dismantle.html |title=Air Force prepares to dismantle HAARP ahead of summer shutdown |author=Dermot Cole |date=2014-05-14 |publisher=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517010257/http://www.adn.com/2014/05/14/3470442/air-force-prepares-to-dismantle.html |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After discussions between the parties, ownership of the facility and its equipment was transferred to the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] in August 2015.&lt;ref name="UAF"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rozell |first=Ned |date=6 September 2015 |title=Under new management, Alaska's HAARP facility open for business again |url=http://www.adn.com/article/20150906/under-new-management-alaskas-haarp-facility-open-business-again |newspaper=Alaska Dispatch News |access-date=10 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HAARP is a target of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]], who claim that it is capable of [[Weather warfare|"weaponizing" weather]]. Commentators and scientists say that advocates of this theory are uninformed, as claims made fall well outside the abilities of the facility, if not the scope of natural science.&lt;ref name=PopSci /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naiditch"/&gt;

==History==
HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) began in 1990. [[Ted Stevens]], Republican U.S. senator from Alaska, helped win approval for the facility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nature.com/news/us-ionospheric-research-facility-to-close-1.15243|title = US ionospheric research facility to close|date = 16 May 2014|accessdate = 18 August 2014|website = Nature|publisher = Nature|last = Weinberger|first = Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and construction began in 1993.

In early May 2013, HAARP was temporarily shut down, awaiting a change between contractors to operate the facility. In July 2013, HAARP program manager James Keeney said, "[[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] is expected on site as a client to finish up some research in fall 2013 and winter 2014."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HAARP Facility Shuts Down|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/view/haarp-facility-shuts-down|publisher=ARRL|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EarthSky"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrd|first=Deborah|title=Crazy weather?

[[Ahtna, Incorporated]], the [[Alaska native corporation|Alaska Native corporation]] serving the region of Alaska where the HAARP site is located, was reportedly in talks to take over the facility administration contract from Marsh Creek, LLC.&lt;ref name="AK"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Ben|title=Alaska's controversial HAARP facility closed – will it come back online?|url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20130717/alaska-s-controversial-haarp-facility-closed-will-it-come-back-online|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=Alaska Dispatch|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project overview==
[[File:HAARP20l.jpg|thumb|HAARP antenna array]]
The HAARP project directs a 3.6 [[megawatt|MW]] signal, in the 2.8–10 [[megahertz|MHz]] region of the HF (high-frequency) band, into the [[ionosphere]]. The signal may be pulsed or continuous. Effects of the transmission and any recovery period can be examined using associated instrumentation, including VHF and UHF radars, HF receivers, and optical cameras. According to the HAARP team, this will advance the study of basic natural processes that occur in the ionosphere under the natural but much stronger influence of solar interaction. HAARP also enables studies of how the natural ionosphere affects radio signals.

The insights gleaned at HAARP will enable scientists to develop methods to mitigate these effects to improve the reliability or performance of communication and navigation systems which would have a wide range of both civilian and military uses, such as an increased accuracy of GPS navigation and advances in underwater and underground research and applications. This may lead, among other things, to improved methods for submarine communication or an ability to remotely sense and map the mineral content of the terrestrial subsurface, and perhaps underground complexes, of regions or countries. The current facility lacks range to be used in regions like the oil-rich Middle East, according to one of the researchers involved, but the technology could be put on a mobile platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/01/irans-nuclear-molemen/ Pentagon Scientists Target Iran’s Nuclear Mole Men]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was originally funded by the [[Office of Naval Research]] and jointly managed by the ONR and [[Air Force Research Laboratory]], with principal involvement of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Many other US universities and educational institutions were involved in the development of the project and its instruments, namely the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], [[Stanford University]], [[Penn State University]] (ARL), [[Boston College]], [[UCLA]], [[Clemson University]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Cornell University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[University of Maryland, College Park]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University]], [[Virginia Tech]] and the [[University of Tulsa]]. The project's specifications were developed by the universities, who continued to play a major role in the design of future research efforts.

According to HAARP's original management, the project strove for openness, and all activities were logged and publicly available, a practice which continues under the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Scientists without security clearances, even foreign nationals, were routinely allowed on site, which also continues today. HAARP hosts an open house annually, during which time any civilian can tour the entire facility. In addition, scientific results obtained using HAARP are routinely published in major research journals (such as ''[[Geophysical Research Letters]]'' and ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]''), written both by university scientists (American and foreign) and by [[U.S. Department of Defense]] research lab scientists.

==Research==
HAARP's main goal is basic science research in the uppermost portion of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], termed the [[ionosphere]]. Essentially a transition between the atmosphere and the [[magnetosphere]], the ionosphere is where the atmosphere is thin enough that the sun's X-rays and UV rays can reach it, but thick enough that there are enough molecules present to absorb those rays. Consequently, the ionosphere consists of a rapid increase in density of free electrons, beginning at {{abbr|~|approximately}}70&amp;nbsp;km, reaching a peak at ~300&amp;nbsp;km, and then falling off again as the atmosphere disappears entirely by ~1,000&amp;nbsp;km. Various aspects of HAARP can study all of the main layers of the ionosphere.

The profile of the ionosphere is highly variable, changing constantly on timescales of minutes, hours, days, seasons, and years. This profile becomes even more complex near Earth's magnetic poles, where the nearly vertical alignment and intensity of earth's magnetic field can cause physical effects like [[aurora (astronomy)|the aurora]].

The ionosphere is traditionally very difficult to measure. Balloons cannot reach it because the air is too thin, but satellites cannot orbit there because the air is too thick. Hence, most experiments on the ionosphere give only small pieces of information. HAARP approaches the study of the ionosphere by following in the footsteps of an ionospheric heater called [[EISCAT]] near [[Tromsø]], Norway. There, scientists pioneered exploration of the ionosphere by perturbing it with radio waves in the 2–10&amp;nbsp;MHz range, and studying how the ionosphere reacts. HAARP performs the same functions but with more power and a more flexible and agile HF beam.

Some of the main scientific findings from HAARP include:
#Generating [[very low frequency]] (VLF) radio waves by modulated heating of the auroral [[electrojet]], useful because generating VLF waves ordinarily requires gigantic antennas
#Generating weak luminous glow (measurable, but below that visible with a naked eye) from absorbing HAARP's signal
#Generating [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) waves in the 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz range. These are next to impossible to produce any other way, because the length of an antenna is dictated by the wavelength of the signal it emits or receives.
#Generating [[Whistler (radio)|whistler-mode]] VLF signals that enter the [[magnetosphere]] and propagate to the other hemisphere, interacting with [[Van Allen radiation belt]] particles along the way
#VLF remote sensing of the heated ionosphere

[[Research]] at the HAARP has included:

#[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] line observations
#Stimulated electron emission observations
#[[Gyro frequency]] heating research
#Spread F observations (blurring of ionospheric echoes of radio waves due to irregularities in electron density in the [[Ionosphere#F layer|F layer]])

#[[Radio]] observations of [[meteor]]s
#[[Polar mesospheric summer echoes]] (PMSE) have been studied, probing the [[mesosphere]] using the IRI as a powerful [[radar]], and with a 28&amp;nbsp;MHz radar and two VHF radars at 49&amp;nbsp;MHz and 139&amp;nbsp;MHz. The presence of multiple radars spanning both [[High frequency|HF]] and [[Very high frequency|VHF]] bands allows scientists to make comparative measurements that may someday lead to an understanding of the processes that form these elusive phenomena.

== Instrumentation and operation ==
The main instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI). This is a high-power, high-frequency [[phased array]] radio [[transmitter]] with a set of 180 [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], disposed in an array of 12x15 units that occupy a rectangle of about {{convert|30-40|acre|ha|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nap.edu/read/18620/chapter/2 "Opportunities for High-Power, High-Frequency Transmitters to Advance Ionospheric/Thermospheric Research: Report of a Workshop"], National Academies Press. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2014. Retrieved 8 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9jsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq "Ionospheric Manipulation Made Easy"], Abe Streep. Popular Science Vol. 273, No. 1. July 2008. Retrieved 8 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The IRI is used to temporarily energize a small portion of the [[ionosphere]]. The study of these disturbed volumes yields important information for understanding natural ionospheric processes.

During active ionospheric research, the signal generated by the transmitter system is delivered to the [[Antenna array (electromagnetic)|antenna array]] and transmitted in an upward direction. At an altitude between {{convert|70|to|350|km|0|abbr=on}} (depending on operating frequency), the signal is partially absorbed in a small volume several tens of kilometers in diameter and a few meters thick over the IRI. The intensity of the [[High frequency|HF]] signal in the ionosphere is less than 3&amp;nbsp;µW/cm², tens of thousands of times less than the Sun's natural electromagnetic radiation reaching the earth and hundreds of times less than even the normal random variations in intensity of the Sun's natural [[ultraviolet]] (UV) energy which creates the ionosphere. The small effects that are produced, however, can be observed with the sensitive scientific instruments installed at the HAARP facility, and these observations can provide information about the dynamics of [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] and insight into the processes of solar-terrestrial interactions.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each part of the two section crossed dipoles are individually fed from a specially designed, custom-built transmitter that operates at very low distortion levels. The [[Effective Radiated Power]] (ERP) of the IRI is limited by more than a factor of 10 at its lower operating frequencies. Much of this is due to higher antenna losses and a less efficient antenna pattern.

The IRI can transmit between 2.7 and 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, a frequency range that lies above the AM radio broadcast band and well below Citizens' Band frequency allocations. However, HAARP is licensed to transmit only in certain segments of this frequency range. When the IRI is transmitting, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is 100&amp;nbsp;kHz or less. The IRI can transmit in continuous waves (CW) or in pulses as short as 10 microseconds (µs). CW transmission is generally used for ionospheric modification, while transmission in short pulses frequently repeated is used as a radar system. Researchers can run experiments that use both modes of transmission, first modifying the ionosphere for a predetermined amount of time, then measuring the decay of modification effects with pulsed transmissions.

There are other geophysical instruments for research located at the HAARP facility. Some of them are:
* A [[fluxgate compass|fluxgate]] [[magnetometer]] built by the University of Alaska Fairbanks [[Geophysical Institute]], available to chart variations in the Earth's magnetic field. Rapid and sharp changes of the magnetic field may indicate a [[geomagnetic storm]].
* A [[ionospheric sounding|digisonde]] that can provide ionospheric profiles, allowing scientists to choose appropriate frequencies for IRI operation. The HAARP makes current and historic digisonde information available online.
* An induction magnetometer, provided by the [[University of Tokyo]], that measures the changing geomagnetic field in the [[Ultra Low Frequency]] (ULF) range of 0–5&amp;nbsp;Hz.
The facility is powered by a set of five (5) 2500 kilowatt generators being driven by EMD 20-645-E4 diesel locomotive engines.

== Site ==
The project site ({{Coord|62|23|30|N|145|09|03|W|}}) is north of [[Gakona, Alaska|Gakona]], [[Alaska]] just west of [[Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park]]. An [[environmental impact statement]] led to permission for an array of up to 180 [[antennas]] to be erected.&lt;ref&gt;

#The '''Developmental Prototype''' (DP) had 18 antenna elements, organized in three columns by six rows. It was fed with a total of 360 kilowatts (kW) combined transmitter output power. The DP transmitted just enough power for the most basic of ionospheric testing.
#The '''Filled Developmental Prototype''' (FDP) had 48 antenna units arrayed in six columns by eight rows, with 960&amp;nbsp;kW of transmitter power. It was fairly comparable to other [[Ionospheric heater#Current facilities|ionospheric heating facilities]]. This was used for a number of successful scientific experiments and ionospheric exploration campaigns over the years.
#The '''Final IRI''' (FIRI) is the final build of the IRI. It has 180 antenna units, organized in 15 columns by 12 rows, yielding a theoretical maximum gain of 31&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]]. A total of 3.6&amp;nbsp;MW of transmitter power will feed it, but the power is focused in the upward direction by the geometry of the large [[phased array]] of antennas which allow the antennas to work together in controlling the direction. {{As of|March 2007}}, all the antennas were in place, the final phase was completed and the [[Antenna array (electromagnetic)|antenna array]] was undergoing testing aimed at fine-tuning its performance to comply with safety requirements required by regulatory agencies. The facility officially began full operations in its final 3.6 MW transmitter power completed status in the summer of 2007, yielding an effective radiated power (ERP) of 5.1 [[Gigawatts]] or 97.1 [[dBW]] at maximum output. However, the site typically operates at a fraction of that value due to the lower [[antenna gain]] exhibited at standard operational frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;

HAARP is the subject of numerous [[conspiracy theories]]. Various individuals have speculated about hidden motivations and capabilities of the project. For example, [[Rosalie Bertell]] warned in 1996 about the deployment of HAARP as a military weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Rosalie Bertell}}, [http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/212/45492.html Background on the HAARP Project]. Global Policy Forum, 5 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Chossudovsky]] stated in a book published by the [[Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform]] that "recent scientific evidence suggests that HAARP is fully operational and has the capability of triggering [[flood]]s, [[hurricane]]s, [[drought]]s and  [[earthquake]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Michel Chossudovsky}}, ''Climate Manipulation as a War Weapon'', p181-182. In {{aut|William Krehm}},''Meltdown : Money, Debt and Wealth of Nations : how Zero Inflation Policy is Leading the World's Monetary and Economic Systems to Collapse : an Anthology from the First Decade of Economic Reform''], [[Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform|COMER]] Publications, 1 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, HAARP has been blamed for generating such catastrophes, as well as [[thunderstorm]]s, in [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Haiti]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]] and the [[Philippines]], and even major [[power outage]]s, the downing of [[TWA Flight 800]], [[Gulf War syndrome]], and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Naiditch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alaska Dispatch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baird|first=Austin|title=HAARP conspiracies: Guide to most far-out theories behind government research in Alaska|url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/haarp-conspiracies-guide-most-far-out-theories-behind-government-research-alaska|accessdate=8 December 2012|newspaper=Alaska Dispatch|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USNews&gt;{{cite news|last=Flock|first=Elizabeth|title=Conspiracy Theorists Say Obama Engineered Hurricane Sandy|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/10/29/conspiracy-theorists-say-obama-engineered-hurricane-sandy|accessdate=8 December 2012|newspaper=US News &amp; World Report|date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations include the following:
* Nick Begich Jr., the son of the late [[U.S. Representative]] [[Nick Begich]] and brother of former [[U.S. Senator]] [[Mark Begich]], is the author of ''Angels Don't Play This HAARP.'' He has claimed that the HAARP facility could trigger earthquakes and turn the upper atmosphere into a giant lens so that "the sky would literally appear to burn." He maintains a website that claims HAARP is a mind control device.&lt;ref name=Shachtman&gt;{{cite news|last=Shachtman|first=Noah|title=Strange New Air Force Facility Energizes Ionosphere, Fans Conspiracy Flames|url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/17-08/mf_haarp?currentPage=all|publisher=Wired Magazine|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=About us - Dr. Nick Begich|url=http://www.earthpulse.com/src/category.asp?catid=13|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Russian Armed Forces|Russian military]] journal wrote that ionospheric testing would "trigger a cascade of electrons that could flip Earth's magnetic poles".&lt;ref name=Shachtman /&gt;
* The [[Alaska Legislature|Alaska state legislature]] and the [[European Parliament]] held hearings about HAARP, the latter citing environmental concerns.&lt;ref name=physicsworld.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/3302|title=EU clashes with US over atmosphere tests|website=physicsworld.com|publisher=IOP Publishing, 27 February 1998|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Former [[Governor of Minnesota]], ex-professional wrestler, and documentary maker [[Jesse Ventura]] questioned whether the government is using the site to manipulate the weather or to bombard people with mind-controlling radio waves. An Air Force spokeswoman said Ventura made an official request to visit the research station but was rejected. "He and his crew showed up at HAARP anyway and were denied access."&lt;ref name=JuneauEmpire&gt;{{cite web|last=Baenen|first=Jeff|title=Ventura seeks out conspiracy theories at Alaska station|url=http://juneauempire.com/stories/120309/sta_531557452.shtml|publisher=Juneau Empire|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physicist [[Bernard Eastlund]] claimed that HAARP includes technology based on his own patents that has the capability to modify weather and neutralize satellites.&lt;ref name=PopSci/&gt;
* It has been proposed as a cause of [[The Hum|low frequency background hums]] said to be heard in various locales.&lt;ref name=SYSK/&gt;

Two Georgia men arrested on drug charges in November 2016 were reportedly plotting domestic terrorism based on conspiracy theories about HAARP. The Coffee County Sheriff's Office said the men possessed a "massive arsenal" that included [[Colt AR-15|AR-15]] rifles, [[Glock]] handguns, a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] rifle and thousands of rounds of ammunition. According to police, the men wanted to destroy HAARP because they believed the facility manipulates the weather, controls minds and even traps the souls of people. Police say the men confessed that "God told them to go and blow this machine up that kept souls, so souls could be released."&lt;ref name="ADN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zak|first1=Annie|title=Georgia men plotted attack on Alaska aurora research facility to 'release souls,' detective says|url=https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2016/11/01/2-men-arrested-in-georgia-planned-to-attack-alaska-aurora-research-facility-investigators-say/|website=ADN.com|publisher=Alaska Dispatch News|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WALB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckets|first1=Re-Essa|title=Suspected terrorists believe research facility controls minds, traps souls|url=http://www.walb.com/story/33541811/suspected-terrorists-believes-research-facility-controls-minds-traps-souls|website=WALB.com|publisher=WALB news|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanford University]] professor [[Umran Inan]] told ''[[Popular Science]]'' that weather-control conspiracy theories were "completely uninformed," explaining that "there's absolutely nothing we can do to disturb the Earth's [weather] systems. Even though the power HAARP radiates is very large, it's minuscule compared with the power of a lightning flash—and there are 50 to 100 lightning flashes every second. HAARP's intensity is very small."&lt;ref name=PopSci&gt;{{cite web|last=Streep|first=Abe|title=The Military's Mystery Machine: The High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program, or HAARP, has been called a missile-defense tool and a mind-control device.

The facility doesn't open its doors in the same way as other federally-funded research facilities around the country, and it doesn't go to great efforts to explain the importance of its research to the public."&lt;ref name="Alaska Dispatch"/&gt; In 2016, in response to these claims, the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] [[Geophysical Institute]], which manages the facility, announced that HAARP will host an annual open house in August, allowing visitors to tour the complex.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adn.com/alaska-news/science/2016/08/24/haarps-new-owner-holds-open-house-to-prove-facility-is-not-capable-of-mind-control/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6509">The '''ICMJE recommendations''' (full title, '''''Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals''''') are a set of guidelines produced by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for standardising the [[ethics]], preparation and formatting of [[manuscript]]s submitted for publication by [[biomedical]] journals.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations&gt;{{Citation |author=ICMJE |title=Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals |url=http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf |postscript=.|date=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compliance with the ICMJE Recommendations is required by most leading biomedical journals. As of 2017, over ~3274 journals worldwide followed the Uniform Requirements.&lt;ref name="ICMJEjournallist"&gt;International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Journals that have Requested Inclusion on the List of Publications that follow the ICMJE's Uniform Requirements For Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals [homepage on the Internet]. Philadelphia: ICMJE; c2005 [updated 27 May 2006; cited 30 May 2006]. Available from: [http://www.icmje.org/journals.html http://www.icmje.org/journals.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendations were formerly called the '''''Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals''''' (abbreviated '''URMs''' and often shortened to '''''Uniform Requirements''''').

==International Committee of Medical Journal Editors==
The '''International Committee of Medical Journal Editors''' ('''ICMJE''') was originally known as the '''Vancouver Group''', after the location of their first meeting in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] in [[Canada]]. {{As of|2017}} members of the ICMJE are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/icmje-membership/ |title=ICMJE Membership |publisher=International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citation style==
{{Main|Vancouver system}}

The citation style recommended by the ICMJE Recommendations, which is also known as the [[Vancouver system]], is the style used by the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), codified in ''[[Citing Medicine]]''.

References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text&amp;nbsp;– they are identified by [[Arabic numerals]] enclosed in [[bracket|parentheses]].

Example of a journal citation:
* Leurs R, Church MK, Taglialatela M. H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-antihistamines: inverse agonism, anti-inflammatory actions and cardiac effects. Clin Exp Allergy 2002 Apr;32(4):489-98.

==Manuscripts describing human interventional clinical trials==
URM includes a mandate for manuscripts describing human interventional trials to register a trial in a clinical trial registry (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) and to include the trial registration ID in the abstract of the article. The URM also requires that this registration is done prior enrolling the first participant. A study of five high impact factor journals (founders of [[ICMJE]]) showed that only 89% of published articles (articles published during   2010-2011; about trials that completed in 2008) were properly registered prior enrolling the first participant.&lt;ref name=adherence&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huser | first1 = V. | last2 = Cimino | first2 = J.

==Disclosure of Competing Interests==
The ICMJE also developed a uniform format for disclosure of competing interests in journal articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Drazen JM, Van der Weyden MB, Sahni P, Rosenberg J, Marusic A, Laine C, Kotzin S, Horton R, Hébert PC, Haug C, Godlee F, Frizelle FA, de Leeuw PW, DeAngelis CD |title=Uniform format for disclosure of competing interests in ICMJE journals |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=361 |issue=19 |pages=1896–7 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19825973 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0909052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grey literature==
The ''Uniform Requirements'' were adapted by the Grey Literature International Steering Committee [[GLISC]] for the production of scientific and technical [[reports]] included in the wider category of [[grey literature]]. These ''GLISC Guidelines for the production of scientific and technical reports'' are translated to French, German, Italian and Spanish and are available on the GLISC website [https://web.archive.org/web/20090918235208/http://www.glisc.info/].

In [[computer science]], '''interactive computation''' is a [[mathematical model]] for [[computation]] that involves [[input/output]] communication with the external world ''during'' computation. This is in contrast to the traditional understanding of computation which assumes reading input only before computation and writing output only after computation, thus defining a kind of "closed" computation.

The [[Church-Turing thesis]] attempts to define computation and computability in terms of [[Turing machines]]. Because the Turing machine model only provides an answer to the question of what computability of ''functions'' means, but interactive tasks are not always reducible to functions,{{clarify|date=November 2018}} it fails to capture a broader intuition of computation and computability. It was not until recently{{when|date=November 2018}} that the theoretical computer science community realized the necessity to define adequate mathematical models of interactive computation.

==Uses==

Among the currently studied mathematical models of computation that attempt to capture interaction are [[Giorgi Japaridze]]'s hard- and easy-play machines elaborated within the framework of [[computability logic]], [[Dina Q. Goldin]]'s Persistent Turing Machines (PTMs), and [[Yuri Gurevich]]'s [[abstract state machine]]s. [[Peter Wegner]] has additionally done a great deal of work on this area of computer science {{cn|date=August 2018}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">Across the many fields concerned with '''interactivity''', including [[information science]], [[computer science]], [[human-computer interaction]], [[communication]], and [[industrial design]], there is little agreement over the meaning of the term "interactivity", although all are related to [[interaction]] with computers and other machines with a [[user interface]].

Multiple views on interactivity exist. In the "contingency view" of interactivity, there are three levels: 
#Not interactive, when a message is not related to previous messages; 
#Reactive, when a message is related only to one immediately previous message; and
#Interactive, when a message is related to a number of previous messages and to the relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheizaf Rafaeli]] defined Interactivity as "an expression of the extent that in a given series of communication exchanges, any third (or later) transmission (or message) is related to the degree to which previous exchanges referred to even earlier transmissions. Rafaeli, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

One body of research has made a strong distinction between interaction and interactivity. As the suffix 'ity' is used to form nouns that denote a quality or condition, this body of research has defined interactivity as the 'quality or condition of interaction'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sedig | first=K. | last2=Parsons | first2=P. | last3=Babanski | first3=A. | year=2012 | title=Towards a characterization of interactivity in visual analytics | journal= Journal of Multimedia Processing and Technologies, Special Issue on Theory and Application of Visual Analytics | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=12–28 | url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pparsons/papers/JMPT2012.pdf | accessdate=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Parsons | first=P. | last2=Sedig | first2=K. | year=2014 | title=Adjustable properties of visual representations: Improving the quality of human-information interaction | journal= Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume=65 | issue=3 | pages=455–482 | doi=10.1002/asi.23002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Liang | first=H.-N. | last2=Parsons | first2=P. | last3=Wu | first3=H.-C. | last4=Sedig | first4=K. | year=2010 | title=An exploratory study of interactivity in visualization tools: 'Flow' of interaction | journal= Journal of Interactive Learning Research | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=5–45 | url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pparsons/papers/JILR2010.pdf | accessdate=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers suggest that the distinction between interaction and interactivity is important since interaction may be present in any given setting, but the quality of the interaction varies from low and high.

==Human to human communication==
Human communication is the basic example of [[interactive communication]] which involves two different processes; human to human interactivity and human to computer interactivity. Human-Human interactivity is the communication between people.

On the other hand, human to computer communication is the way that people communicate with [[new media]]. According to Rada Roy, the "[[Human Computer interaction]] model might consists of 4 main components which consist of HUMAN, COMPUTER, TASK ENVIRONMENT and MACHINE ENVIRONMENT. The two basic flows of information and control are assumed. The communication between people and computers; one must understand something about both and about the tasks which people perform with computers. A general model of human - computer interface emphasizes the flow of information and control at the human computer interface."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Rada | first1 = R. | last2 = Michailidis | first2 = Antonios | title = Interactive media | year = 1995 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | isbn = 0-387-94485-0 | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human to Human interactivity consists of many conceptualizations which are based on anthropomorphic definitions. For example, complex systems that detect and react to human behavior are sometimes called interactive. Under this perspective, interaction includes responses to human physical manipulation like movement, body language, and/or changes in [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]]s.

Media theorist Fernando Arturo Torres defined interactivity as, "a particular medium's ability to facilitate the properties necessary in an ideal conversation" ("Towards A Universal Theory Of Media Interactivity:  Developing A Proper Context," 1995, "Definition of Interactivity," para. 1).  His research determined that interactivity should be defined by "how well a medium facilitates two-way communication rather than by the technology of the medium."

==Human to artifact communication==
In the context of communication between a human and an [[Cultural artifact|artifact]], interactivity refers to the artifact’s interactive behaviour as experienced by the human user. This is different from other aspects of the artifact such as its visual appearance, its internal working, and the meaning of the signs it might mediate. For example, the interactivity of an [[iPod]] is not its physical shape and colour (its so-called "[[design]]"), its ability to play music, or its storage capacity—it is the behaviour of its [[user interface]] as experienced by its user. This includes the way the user moves their finger on its input wheel, the way this allows the selection of a tune in the playlist, and the way the user controls the volume.

An artifact’s interactivity is best perceived through use. A bystander can imagine how it would be like to use an artifact by watching others use it, but it is only through actual use that its interactivity is fully experienced and "felt". This is due to the [[kinesthetic]] nature of the interactive experience. It is similar to the difference between watching someone drive a car and actually driving it. It is only through the driving that one can experience and "feel" how this car differs from others.

New Media academic Vincent Maher defines interactivity as "the relation constituted by a symbolic interface between its referential, objective functionality and the subject."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nml.ru.ac.za/maher/?p=7 Vincent Maher - Media in Transition » Towards a definition of interactivity suitable for Critical Theory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computing science ==
The term "[[look and feel]]" is often used to refer to the specifics of a computer system's [[user interface]]. Using this [[metaphor]], the "look" refers to its visual design, while the "feel" refers to its interactivity. Indirectly this can be regarded as an informal definition of interactivity.

For a more detailed discussion of how interactivity has been conceptualized in the human-computer interaction literature, and how the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the French philosopher [[Merleau-Ponty]] can shed light on the user experience, see (Svanaes 2000).

In [[computer science]], interactive refers to software which accepts and responds to input from people—for example, data or commands. Interactive software includes most popular programs, such as [[word processor]]s or [[spreadsheet]] [[application software|applications]]. By comparison, '''noninteractive''' programs operate without human contact; examples of these include [[compiler]]s and [[batch processing]] applications. If the response is complex enough it is said that the system is conducting social interaction and some systems try to achieve this through the implementation of [[social interface]]s.

Also, there is the notion of kinds of user interaction, like the [[Rich UI]].

==Creating interactivity==
Web page authors can integrate [[JavaScript]] coding to create interactive web pages. Sliders, date pickers, drag and dropping are just some of the many enhancements that can be provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://friendlybit.com/js/improving-interactivity-with-javascript/ |title=Improving interactivity with Javascript |publisher=Friendly Bit |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various authoring tools are available for creating various kinds of interactivities. Some common platforms for creating interactivities include [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Microsoft Silverlight]]. Notable authoring tools for creating interactivities include Harbinger's [[Elicitus]].

eLearning makes use of a concept called an [[interaction model]]. Using an interaction model, any person can create interactivities in a very short period of time. Some of the interaction models presented with authoring tools fall under various categories like games, puzzles, simulation tools, presentation tools, etc., which can be completely customized.

The '''International Society for Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization''' is a [[learned society]] in the field of [[multidisciplinary design optimization]] that was founded in October 1991. It has more than 1000 members in 45 countries.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.issmo.net/about/welcome.asp|title=About ISSMO|publisher=International Society for Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization|date=|accessdate=2013-06-11|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130620204222/http://www.issmo.net/about/welcome.asp|archive-date=2013-06-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current president is [[Ole Sigmund]] ([[Technical University of Denmark]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.issmo.net/about/committee.asp|title=Executive Committee|publisher=International nongovernmental organizations|date=|accessdate=2013-06-11|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130620204250/http://www.issmo.net/about/committee.asp|archive-date=2013-06-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society is an affiliated organization of the [[International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics]] (IUTAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iutam.org/?page_id=1049 |title=Affiliated Organizations |publisher=International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics |date=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
The objectives are:&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* to stimulate and promote research into all aspects of the optimal design of structures and related topics, including engineering systems consisting partially of structures and/or fluids;
* to encourage practical applications of optimization methods and the corresponding software development in all branches of technology;
* to foster the interchange of ideas amongst various fields contributing to structural and multidisciplinary optimization;
* to support the role of optimization in multidisciplinary design;
* to provide a framework for the organization of meetings and other means for the dissemination of knowledge on structural optimization; and
* to promote teaching of structural optimization in tertiary institutions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The society works towards these objectives by organizing a biennial "World Congress of Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization" and publishing an official journal, ''[[Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization]]'', in collaboration with [[Springer Science+Business Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/materials/mechanics/journal/158 |title=Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12699">'''J. William Lloyd''' (never using his given name John) (June 4, 1857 – October 23, 1940) was an [[United States|American]] [[individualist]] [[anarchist]] from 1884 to around 1904. He was born in [[Westfield, New Jersey]]; he later moved to Kansas, then Iowa, then to experimental colonies in [[Tennessee]] and [[Florida]], before returning to New Jersey in 1888.  He based his anarchism upon [[natural law]], rather than on [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as [[Benjamin Tucker]] did.  His first book, "Wind-Harp Songs" (poetry), was published in 1895 ("Anarchists' March," a printed musical score with words by Lloyd, had been issued by Tucker in 1888).  He founded an anarchist group, The Comradeship of Free Socialists, in 1897.  His work, "The Red Heart in a White World: A Suggestive Manual of Free Society; Containing a Method and a Hope," formed the basis for it.  Lloyd later modified his position to [[minarchism]].

His life changed when in that year, reading Edward Carpenter while riding on a train to N.Y., he experienced "Cosmic Consciousness" (R.M. Bucke devoted a chapter to Lloyd in his 1901 book of that title).  This inspired his book, "Dawn-Thought on the Reconciliation: a Volume of Pantheistic Impressions and Glimpses of Larger Religion" (1900). 

He founded his magazine, "The Free Comrade," which first ran from 1900 to 1902.  There he championed anarchism, free love, Whitman ("Our American Shakespeare, and greater than he") and Edward Carpenter ("The greatest man of modern England").  In 1902 and 1904 were published his two utopian novels, "The Natural Man: A Romance of the Golden Age" and  "The Dwellers in Vale Sunrise: How They Got Together and Lived Happy Ever After.  A Sequel to 'The Natural Man,' Being an Account of the Tribes of Him."  

''The Free Comrade'' resumed publication in a new series, which ran from 1910 to 1912.  Lloyd now co-edited it with his friend Leonard D. Abbott, who financed its publication.  Between the end of the original series and the beginning of the new, Lloyd had stopped considering himself a pure anarchist, indeed joining the Socialist Party ("I am still anarchistic in the essential sense.... the great need of Socialism is a stronger infusion of Anarchism....").   Meanwhile his friend Abbott had moved from socialism towards anarchism.  They saw the new series "as an advocate of the juncture of the Anarchist and Socialist forces." 

Lloyd's writings appeared in [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s "[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]"; in [[Moses Harman]]'s anarchist and free love journal, "Lucifer the Light Bearer";  the anarchist and sex-radical newspaper "Fair Play"; the anarchist paper "[[Free Society]],"  Horace Traubel's "Conservator";  etc.   He had  a column in "Ariel," published by the Christian Socialist George Littlefield.

He wrote hundreds of poems, many of which appeared in anarchist periodicals.

He wrote many books.  Besides those listed above, they include "Aw-Aw Tam Indian Nights: Being the Myths and Legends of the Pimas of Arizona" (1911);  "Karezza Method," a sex manual (first published clandestinely ca. 1918); "Eneres," published by Allen &amp; Unwin in 1929 and Houghton Mifflin in 1930, with an introduction by Havelock Ellis; and at least 14 other works, mostly poetry.

In "Edward Carpenter: In Appreciation," edited by Gilbert Beith (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1931), Will S. Monroe wrote, "Carpenter's most devoted American disciple is J. William Lloyd, who did more than any other follower in the United States (Ernest Crosby excepted) to familiarize our countrymen with his doctrines."

He contrasted his idea of free love to that of "the artistic free-lovers, the Bohemians":  "My view of sex is religious, I might almost say, touched with austerity.  Sex and love to me are sacred and woman their priestess.  Sex should not be cultivated as a sybaritic indulgence, but with reference always to spiritual uplift, mental inspiration, physical health, individual fulfillment and racial progress-- always with reference to higher uses." (Free Comrade, July 1910). 

Lloyd supported the Allies in World War I.  He moved to California in 1922.  In the 1930's he promoted the ideas of Edward Bellamy.  But throughout his life he maintained friendly relations with former associates.  He died in 1940.

Though at times called a "drugless physician," Lloyd never graduated from the water-cure medical college he attended as a young man.

Archival material by Lloyd can be found in the Labadie collection at the [[University of Michigan]] and at the von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama.

==Sex theorist==
A sex theorist, Lloyd strongly criticized patriarchy and sexual possessiveness and exclusivity. He viewed the historical fall of Matriarchy as "the great crime," and saw jealousy as akin to monopoly attained by legal power. He developed a concept which he called "The Larger Love."  As he wrote in 1929, "In my later twenties I conceived the most beautiful ideal of my whole life; one that has remained with me ever since, thru [sic] all the years, and which I feel is my special message to  humanity, my gospel and prophecy for the future....  The Larger Love, actualized, would be a state of human love- and sex-relation in which each human being of adult age, male or female, would normally have a Central Love, that is a mate who in loyalty, tenderness, reliability and fitness would fill the place of the mate in monogamic ideals, excepting that it would be expected and usually occur that each partner in this union would also have one or several Side Lovers, that is, close friends or mates of the opposite sex, whose affection might not express itself sexually, but could do so without any social surprize [sic] or reproach, and probably usually would do so, at least at certain times.  This whole group to form affectionally and spiritually a Love Family, or Love Group, socially recognized and approved as such, but not legally bound together in any way.  But as each side Lover would also normally have a Central Lover and center another group, it is plain that these love groups would be very closely intertwined and woven together."

His "Karezza Method" advocated sexual intercourse without seminal emission.   ("In the highest form and best expression of the art neither man nor woman has or desires to have the orgasm...")

In his Karezza book, Lloyd addresses such concerns as the question of semen buildup. He concluded from examples of sterilized men that semen is absorbed back into the body, if it is not let out.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1931"&gt;{{cite book

Lloyd openly questioned the trend toward viewing orgasm as purely beneficial. Concerning the male, he pointed to a standard stockbreeder practice to not let a bull or a stallion serve too many or too often so as not to devitalize him. This practical knowledge of businessmen to him was unbiased evidence on the effects of ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd observed that [[Coitus reservatus|karezza]] offered health benefits. For example, he said he knew it to “act like magic in painful menstruation,” and as a remarkable nerve sedative, even curing nervous headache. He also found it one of the best agents “for the benefit and cure of ordinary sexual weaknesses and ailments, including [[urethritis]] and [[prostatitis]].”

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In successful Karezza the sex-organs become quiet, satisfied, demagnetized, as perfectly as by the orgasm, while the rest of the body of each partner glows with a wonderful vigor and conscious joy … tending to irradiate the whole being with romantic love; and always with an after-feeling of health, purity and well-being. We are most happy and good-humored as after a full meal.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he was “willing to concede that where the intercourse is of such a nature as to cause a congestion that is not sublimated, or where sexual congestion occurs and sublimation and [karezza] are not available, the orgasm may have a necessary place.”

In Lloyd’s day, some people objected to karezza on the grounds that it would encourage excessive indulgence in sexual relations. He responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Those who do not use Karezza are vastly more liable to excess, and this usually from too frequent and intense orgasms, too frequent pregnancies, or too coarse, cynical and invasive an attitude. Where there is merely a physical itch or craving gratified, with no mutual tenderness or kindness, or perhaps actually against the desire or protest of one party, sex is always excessive.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lloyd offered many practical ideas for successful karezza, including the need for lovers to give in order to benefit from controlled intercourse. “Try to feel yourself a magnetic battery,” he advised.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As you acquire the habit of giving your sexual electricity out in blessing to your partner from your sex-organs, hands, lips, skin, eyes and voice, you will acquire the power to satisfy yourself and her without an orgasm. Soon you will not even think of self-control, because you will have no desire for the orgasm, nor will she.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Karezza, said Lloyd, is the greatest beautifier because it increases and makes enduring heart love. He advised that to increase sexual control, “keep the spiritual on top, dominant—loving is the first thing, and at-one-ment … of your souls, your real end.” “Sex is very close to soul.… [It only satisfies] when it unites souls, not merely copulates bodies for a thrill.”

In a chapter called “Does the Woman Need the Orgasm?” he explained in karezza, the lady “melts” her whole being to her partner and there is not an orgasm in the ordinary definition of the word, yet beneficial physical relaxation also occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote that the full magnetic rapport of karezza occurs when:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Two souls and bodies seem as one, supported and floating on some divine stream in Paradise.… This is the real ideal and end of Karezza. You will finally enter into such unity that in your fullest embrace you can hardly tell yourselves apart and can read each other’s thoughts. You will feel a physical unity as if her blood flowed in your veins, her flesh were yours. For this is the Soul-Blending Embrace.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1931), p. 48, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) format. Its API strives to attain a strong similarity to the Java binding of the corresponding library [[libSBML]], but is entirely implemented in Java and therefore [[platform independent]]. JSBML provides an elaborated abstract type hierarchy, whose data types implement or extend many interfaces and abstract classes from the standard Java library. In this way, JSBML integrates smoothly into existing Java projects, and provides methods to read, write, evaluate, and manipulate the content of SBML documents.

__TOC__

== Development ==

In May 2009 the [[SBML]] team conducted a community survey for requests of potential further software development. It turned out that, even though the library [[libSBML]] provides a generated binding for the [[programming language]] [[Java (programming language)|Java™]], its internal [[C (programming language)|C]] code makes it difficult to implement [[platform independent]] or [[Web Start]] applications.

Around that time, several groups from multiple institutes had already implemented small Java versions of [[libSBML]], each being a customized library covering the needs of the particular research project. In order to avoid unnecessary duplications of work and to unify existing development, the international community project JSBML was launched in September 2009, mainly by groups from [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]], [[Caltech]], and the [[University of Tuebingen]].

Since JSBML has been implemented considerably later than the first version of [[libSBML]], it could therefore benefit from the existence of the specifications of [[SBML]] in the Levels 1-3. Hence, JSBML has not just been developed by porting existing [[C (programming language)|C]] code from the [[libSBML]] project into a new [[Java (programming language)|Java™]]. Instead, the developers used this as a chance to completely redesign the class and [[API]] structure. This is why JSBML provides a much richer abstract type hierarchy compared to [[libSBML]]. Furthermore, the development of JSBML enabled making design decisions that are not possible in [[libSBML]] because no backward compatibility had to be considered at this time.

The first stable release version 0.8 of JSBML was made publicly available for download in February 2011. Since then, support for multiple SBML extension packages is being implemented and will be included with the release of JSBML 1.0.

== Aims ==

The development of JSBML is driven by three aims:
# Provide a pure [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[API]] without any native dependency.
# Achieve the highest possible compatibility to [[libSBML]] but at the same time make the library behave like other native [[Java (programming language)|Java]] libraries, i.e., as expected by experienced Java developers.
# Support for all level/version combinations and extension packages of [[SBML]]

== Usage ==

The following example assumes that a [[JAR (file format)|JAR]] file of JSBML has been included into the class path and that a local installation of a [[Java Virtual Machine]] is available on the platform where the code is executed.

{|-
| 
&lt;div width="80%"&gt;
The following coding example shows how an [[SBML]] file can be parsed and its content can be displayed in form of a tree in a window.
The result can look, e.g., as the image on the right. It can be seen that the actual parsing of SBML is done in a single line, by calling a static method in the class SBMLReader. The creation of the [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] for the display is also trivial, because the entire data structure in JSBML is organized as a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]].
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="Java"&gt;
import javax.swing.*;
import org.sbml.jsbml.*;

/** Displays the content of an SBML file in a {@link JTree} */
public class JSBMLvisualizer extends JFrame {

  /** @param document The sbml root node of an SBML file */
  public JSBMLvisualizer(SBMLDocument document) {
    super(document.getModel().getId());
    getContentPane().add(new JScrollPane(new JTree(document)));
    pack(); // make the frame compact
    setLocationRelativeTo(null); // Place it at the center of the screen
    setVisible(true);
  }
  /** @param args Expects a valid path to an SBML file. */ 
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    new JSBMLvisualizer(SBMLReader.read(args[0]));
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in kinesics specifically and nonverbal behavior generally was popularized in the late 1960s and early 1970s by such popular mass market (nonacademic) publications as ''How to Read a Person Like a Book''.&lt;ref&gt;Nierenberg, G. I., &amp; Calero, H. H. (1971). ''How to Read a Person Like a Book''. New York: Hawthorn Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Birdwhistell's work involved filming people in social situations and analyzing them to show elements of communication that were not clearly seen otherwise. One of his most important projects was ''The Natural History of an Interview,'' a long-term interdisciplinary collaboration including [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]], Norman A. McQuown, Henry W. Brosin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Jump up ^ Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (1987). The Social History of The Natural History of an Interview: A multidisciplinary investigation of social communication. ''Research on Language and Social Interaction'', 20, 1-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing heavily on [[descriptive linguistics]], Birdwhistell argued that all movements of the body have meaning and that nonverbal behavior has a [[grammar]] that can be analyzed in similar terms to spoken language. Thus, a "kineme" is "similar to a [[phoneme]] because it consists of a group of movements which are not identical, but which may be used interchangeably without affecting social meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, M. 1972. ''Nonverbal Communication in Human Interaction''. Reinhart and Winston, New York, pp. 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birdwhistell estimated that no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, R. 1980. Profile: Ray L. Birdwhistell. ''The Kinesis Report'', 2, 3: 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He also concluded that there were no universals in these kinesic displays, a claim that was disputed by [[Paul Ekman]], who was interested in analysis of universals, especially in [[facial expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= P|last2= Friesen|first2= W|year= 1971|title= Constants across cultures in the face and emotion|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 17|issue= 2|pages=124–9 |url=http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Constants-Across-Cultures-In-The-Face-And-Emotion.pdf|pmid= 5542557|doi= 10.1037/h0030377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern applications==
In a current application, kinesic behaviors are sometimes used as signs of [[deception]] by interviewers looking for clusters of movements to determine the veracity of the statement being uttered, although kinesics can be equally applied in any context and type of setting to construe innocuous messages whose carriers are indolent or unable to express verbally.

Relevant concepts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= Paul|year= 2004|title= Emotional and conversational nonverbal signals|journal= Language, knowledge, and representation|pages=39–50 |url= http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PHS120/%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7%20%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9%20%CE%9D%CF%8C%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7_2015/Ekman%20vs%20Russell/Ekman_Basic-Emotions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:
*'''Emblems''' - Body movements or gestures that are directly translatable into a word or phrase
*'''Illustrators''' - Accompany or reinforce verbal messages
**Batons - Temporally accent or emphasize words or phrases
**[[Ideogram|Ideographs]] - Trace the paths of mental journeys
**Deitic movements - Point to a present object
**Kinetographs - Depict a bodily action
**Spatial movements - Depict a spacial relationship
**[[Pictogram|Pictographs]] - Draw a picture of their referent
**Rhythmic movements - Depict the rhythm or pacing of an event
*'''Affect Displays''' - Show emotion
*'''Regulators''' - Control the flow and pace of communication
*'''Manipulators''' - Release physical or emotional tension

Kinesic behaviors are an important part of [[nonverbal communication]]. Body movements convey information, but interpretations vary by culture. As many movements are carried out at a subconscious or at least a low-awareness level, kinesic movements carry a significant risk of being misinterpreted in an intercultural communication situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11594">'''Mediterranean Editors and Translators''' ('''MET''') is a non-profit, interdisciplinary association for [[language professional]]s who work mainly with or into English within the Mediterranean area. The association's members include [[translators]], [[authors' editor]]s, [[copy editors]], writing and presentation coaches, teachers of [[academic writing]], applied linguists, interpreters, professional writers and more. MET offers training workshops, an annual conference, networking and other opportunities of continuing professional development for its members. The activities of the association are guided by six objectives, summarized as follows:

# Maintain a stable network and means to hold events for English language consultants 
# Communicate knowledge that can contribute to improving the quality of language support services available in the Mediterranean 
# Be a conduit for exchanging information between language consultants in our geographic area and those in other parts of Europe and the world 
# Stimulate research in Mediterranean communities on the needs of academics, scientists and others and on promising practices that meet their needs well 
# Identify local expertise in language support and help our experts share their knowledge with a wider audience 
# Help users of language support services locate appropriate solutions to their needs and promote mutual understanding between suppliers and users of these services

== History and organization ==
MET was founded in Barcelona, Spain, in the spring of 2006 after an initial, exploratory meeting the preceding autumn. It is registered in the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] and has a legally binding charter (written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] but translated into English). Its activities are directed by a Governing Council. The council, elected every two years, is composed of council chair and vice-chair, secretary, treasurer, officers for membership, continuing professional development and promotion, and a webmaster.

MET is a member of the VERTICE network of Spanish associations of translators, interpreters and editors, and of the Spanish Network of the [[Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures|Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialog Between Cultures]]. It also maintains relationships with the Society for Editors and Proofreaders (SfEP), [[European Association of Science Editors]] (EASE), SENSE (based in the Netherlands), Eastern Mediterranean Association of Medical Editors (EMAME), Associazione Italiana Traduttori e Interpreti (AITI), APTIC (association of translators and interpreters in Catalunya), and Nordic Editors and Translators (NEaT). The founding of NEaT was inspired by, and based on information from, MET.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juhola|first1=Virve|last2=Uusinarkaus|first2=Julie|title=Nordic Editors and Translators: founding a new networking and peer-training association (with thanks to MET)|url=http://www.metmeetings.org/en/neat:774|website=www.metmeetings.org|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MET and all these "sister associations" support each other to further the development of the language profession.

== Members and membership ==

MET's members are mostly based in the Mediterranean region and elsewhere in Europe, but some members from further away join because of their shared interests. MET has both individual and institutional members.

MET's more than 300 individual members hail from about 25 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, Africa, Australia and Canada (data of August 2017). They are employed in freelance, entrepreneurial and institutional settings and work in a wide range of subject areas including science, technology, engineering, medicine, business, commerce, finance, law, politics, art and other cultural areas. Because of the association's focus on communication in the English language, many members originate from countries where English is the vernacular.

MET’s institutional membership is a way for institutions and companies to access continuing professional development activities for their staff and to support the association’s mission. Currently there are about 10 institutional members.

== Conferences ==
MET holds a conference every year, usually in early autumn. This is also the occasion for the general assembly of the members. Conferences tend to last 1.5 days and are preceded by two half-days of training workshops. Each “MET meeting” is named with the acronym of METM followed by the last two digits of the year. For example, METM18 is the name given to next year's meeting, to be held on 4-6 October 2018 in [[Girona]], Spain.

== Workshop program ==
MET organizes a workshop day every spring. A full day of workshops is also offered prior to the annual conference. The workshops are usually developed and delivered by MET members and offer continuing professional development for editors and translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coveney|first1=Kymm|title=Mediterranean Editors and Translators: All About Editing|url=http://blog.sfep.org.uk/editing-translators/|website=SfEP blog|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topics dealt with include knowledge updates in specialized fields, language issues, tools for language professionals, and business development.

== Publications ==
MET members have written a guide entitled "The English-Language Consultant: MET’s guidelines for choosing an editor, translator, interpreter or other language service provider"; the second, revised edition is available on the association's website. 

Discussions at two MET conferences have led to the publication of multiauthor, edited volumes about academic writing. In 2013, a limited group of MET members and their colleagues published the edited volume ''Supporting Research Writing: Roles and challenges in multilingual settings''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supporting Research Writing: Roles and challenges in multilingual settings|year=2013|publisher=Chandos|location=Oxford|isbn=1 84334 666 4|editor=Matarese, Valerie|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/supporting-research-writing/matarese/978-1-84334-666-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (based on a panel discussion at METM09). In 2017, another group of members, invited speakers and colleagues published the edited volume ''Publishing Research in English as an Additional Language: Practices, pathways and potentials''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cargill|editor1-first=Margaret|editor2-last=Burgess|editor2-first=Sally|title=Publishing Research in English as an Additional Language: Practices, pathways and potentials|date=2017|publisher=University of Adelaide Press|isbn=978-1-925261-52-3|url=https://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/titles/english-pathways/|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (based on talks presented at METM15; free e-book).

Additional publications by MET members related to the annual conferences, including reviews of the meetings and papers based on the presentations, are listed on the association's website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28450">In [[aerodynamics]], the '''normal shock tables''' are a series of tabulated data listing the various properties before and after the occurrence of a [[Normal shock|normal shock wave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Anderson, John D.| title=Fundamentals of Aerodynamics | publisher=McGraw-Hill | edition=4th |year=2007 | isbn=0-07-125408-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a given upstream [[Mach number]], the post-shock Mach number can be calculated along with the [[pressure]], [[density]], [[temperature]], and [[stagnation pressure]] ratios.  Such tables are useful since the equations used to calculate the properties after a normal shock are cumbersome.

The tables below have been calculated using a [[heat capacity ratio]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, equal to 1.4.  The upstream Mach number, &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;, begins at 1 and ends at 5.  Although the tables could be extended over any range of Mach numbers, stopping at Mach 5 is typical since assuming &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; to be 1.4 over the entire Mach number range leads to errors over 10% beyond Mach 5.

==Normal shock table equations==
Given an upstream Mach number, &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;, and the ratio of specific heats, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the post normal shock Mach number, &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;, can be calculated using the equation below.
:&lt;math&gt; M_2 = \sqrt{\frac{M_1^2\left(\gamma - 1\right)+2}{2\gamma M_1^2 - \left(\gamma - 1\right)}}&lt;/math&gt;

The next equation shows the relationship between the post normal shock pressure, &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the upstream ambient pressure, &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p_2}{p_1} = \frac{2\gamma M_1^2}{\gamma + 1} - \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between the post normal shock density, &lt;math&gt;\rho_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the upstream ambient density, &lt;math&gt;\rho_1&lt;/math&gt; is shown next in the tables.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \frac{\left(\gamma + 1\right)M_1^2}{\left(\gamma - 1\right)M_1^2 + 2}&lt;/math&gt;

Next, the equation below shows the relationship between the post normal shock temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the upstream ambient temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_1^2\right)\left(\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1}M_1^2 - 1\right)}{M_1^2\left(\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1} + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the ratio of stagnation pressures is shown below where &lt;math&gt;p_{01}&lt;/math&gt; is the upstream stagnation pressure and &lt;math&gt;p_{02}&lt;/math&gt; occurs after the normal shock.  The ratio of stagnation temperatures remains constant across a normal shock since the process is [[Adiabatic Process|adiabatic]].
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p_{02}}{p_{01}} = \left(\frac{\frac{\gamma + 1}{2}M_1^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_1^2}\right)^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}\left(\frac{1}{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma + 1}M_1^2 - \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1}}\right)^\frac{1}{\gamma - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to semiotics:

'''[[Semiotics]]''' &amp;ndash; study of [[meaning-making]], signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of linguistics, which, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of language more specifically. Also called semiotic studies, or semiology (in the Saussurean tradition).

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is semiotics? ==

Semiotics can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* [[Social science]] &amp;ndash; field of study concerned with society and human behaviours.

== Branches of semiotics ==

=== Three main branches ===
* [[Semantics]] &amp;ndash; relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their ''denotata'', or [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]
* [[Syntax|Syntactics]] &amp;ndash; relations among signs in formal structures
* [[Pragmatics]] &amp;ndash; relation between signs and the effects they have on the people who use them

=== Subfields ===
* [[Biosemiotics]] &amp;ndash; growing field that studies the production, action and [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and [[code]]s in the [[Biology|biological]] realm. Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the findings of scientific biology and [[semiotics]], representing a [[Paradigm shift|paradigmatic shift]] in the [[Western world|occidental]] scientific view of [[life]], demonstrating that [[semiosis]] (sign process, including [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and interpretation) is its immanent and intrinsic feature.
* [[Cognitive semiotics]] &amp;ndash; study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences as well as in the human sciences. It involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental and ethnographic investigations.
* [[Computational semiotics]] &amp;ndash; attempts to engineer the process of [[semiosis]], in the study of and design for [[Human-Computer Interaction]], and mimic aspects of human [[cognition]] through [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge representation]].
* [[Cultural semiotics]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Design semiotics]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Product semiotics]] &amp;ndash; study of the use of signs in the design of physical products. Introduced by [[Rune Monö]] while teaching Industrial Design at the Institute of Design, Umeå University, Sweden.
* [[Law and semiotics]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Semiotic literary criticism|Literary semiotics]] &amp;ndash; approach to literary criticism informed by the theory of signs or semiotics. Semiotics, tied closely to the structuralism pioneered by Ferdinand de Saussure, was extremely influential in the development of literary theory out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.
* [[Music semiology]] &amp;ndash; "There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both ontogenetic and phylogenetic levels, has developmental priority over verbal language." (Middleton 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;172)  See Nattiez (1976, 1987, 1989), Stefani (1973, 1986), Baroni (1983), and ''Semiotica'' (66: 1–3 (1987)).
* [[Semiology (Gregorian Chant)|Gregorian chant semiology]] &amp;ndash; current avenue of [[palaeography|palaeographical]] research in [[Gregorian chant]] which is revising the [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]] school of interpretation.
* [[Organisational semiotics]] &amp;ndash; examines the nature, characteristics and features of information, and studies how information can be best used in the context of organised activities and business domains. Organisational semiotics treats organisations as information systems in which information is created, processed, distributed, stored and used.
* [[Semiotic anthropology]] &amp;ndash; semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce and Roman Jakobson applied to anthropology.
* [[Semiotic engineering]] &amp;ndash; views HCI as computer-mediated communication between designers and users at interaction time. The system speaks for its designers in various types of conversations specified at design time. These conversations communicate the designers' understanding of who the users are, what they know the users want or need to do, in which preferred ways, and why.
* [[Semiotic information theory]] &amp;ndash; considers the information content of signs and expressions as it is conceived within the semiotic or sign-relational framework developed by Charles Sanders Peirce.
* [[Social semiotics]] &amp;ndash; expands the interpretable semiotic landscape to include all cultural codes, such as in slang, fashion, and advertising. It considers social connotations, including meanings related to ideology and power structures, in addition to denotative meanings of signs.
** [[Urban semiotics]] &amp;ndash; study of meaning in urban form as generated by signs, symbols, and their social connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller, Suzanne |title=Review |journal=Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 17, No. 3. (May, 1988), pp. 346-348 |jstor=2069642}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on material objects of the built environment, such as streets, squares, parks, and buildings, but also abstract cultural constructs such as building codes, planning documents, unbuilt designs, real estate advertising, and popular discourse about the city,&lt;ref&gt;Gottdienier, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.5&lt;/ref&gt; such as architectural criticism and real estate blogs.
* [[Theatre semiotics]] &amp;ndash; extends or adapts semiotics onstage. Key theoricians include [[Keir Elam]].
* [[Visual semiotics]] &amp;ndash; analyses visual signs. See also [[visual rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visual_Rhetoric/Semiotics_and_Visual_Rhetoric Wikibooks.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zoosemiotics]] &amp;ndash; study of animal meaning-making and communication.

== History of semiotics ==

* [[Semiotics#History|History of semiotics]]
* [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School]] &amp;ndash; scientific school of thought that was formed in 1964 and led by [[Juri Lotman]]. Among the other members of this school were [[Boris Uspensky]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Mikhail Gasparov]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], [[Isaak I. Revzin]], and others. As a result of their collective work, they established a theoretical framework around the semiotics of culture.

[[File:Fleeting-glimpse-bryan-zanisnik.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Bryan Zanisnik]], performance of ''When I Was a Child I Caught a Fleeting Glimpse'', 2009]]

'''Performance art''' is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated, spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.

==Visual arts, performing arts, art performance==
[[File:Lubo Kristek,2007,Requiem für die Mobiltelephone,Wien.jpg|thumb|left|''Requiem für die Mobiltelephone'' by [[Lubo Kristek]], 2007, [[Vienna]]]]
Performance art is an essentially contested concept: any single definition of it implies the recognition of rival uses. As concepts like "democracy" or "art", it implies productive disagreement with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Marvin | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction | publisher = Routledge | year = 1998 (first 1996) | location = London and New York | pages = 1, 2 | isbn = 0-415-13703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term in the narrower sense is related to postmodernist traditions in Western culture. From about the mid-1960s into the 1970s, often derived from concepts of visual art, with respect to [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Dada]], the [[Situationist]]s, [[Fluxus]], [[installation art]] and [[conceptual art]], performance art tended to be defined as an [[antithesis]] to [[theatre]], challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms. The ideal had been an ephemeral and authentic experience for performer and audience in an event that could not be repeated, captured or purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Parr | first1 = Adrian | title = Becoming + Performance Art | editors = Adrian Parr | work = The Deleuze Dictionary | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 25, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OsVOy4s1QLMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-10-26 | isbn = 0748618996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widely discussed difference, how concepts of visual arts and concepts of performing arts are utilized, can determine the meanings of a performance art presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Marvin | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction | publisher = Routledge | year = 1998 (first 1996) | location = London and New York | pages = 103–105 | isbn = 0-415-13703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance art is a term usually reserved to refer to a [[conceptual art]] which conveys a content-based meaning in a more drama-related sense, rather than being simple performance for its own sake for entertainment purposes. It largely refers to a performance presented to an audience, but which does not seek to present a conventional theatrical play or a formal linear narrative, or which alternately does not seek to depict a set of fictitious characters in formal scripted interactions. It therefore can include action or spoken word as a communication between the artist and audience, or even ignore expectations of an audience, rather than following a script written beforehand.

Some kinds of performance art nevertheless can be close to performing arts. Such performance may utilize a script or create a fictitious dramatic setting, but still constitute performance art in that it does not seek to follow the usual dramatic norm of creating a fictitious setting with a linear script which follows conventional real-world dynamics; rather, it would intentionally seek to satirize or to transcend the usual real-world dynamics which are used in conventional theatrical plays.

Performance artists often challenge the audience to think in new and unconventional ways, break conventions of traditional arts, and break down conventional ideas about "what art is". As long as the performer does not become a player who repeats a role, performance art can include satirical elements; utilize robots and machines as performers, as in pieces of the [[Survival Research Laboratories]]; involve ritualised elements (e.g. [[Shaun Caton]]); or borrow elements of any [[performing arts]] such as dance, music, and [[circus (performing art)|circus]].

Some artists, e.g. the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]] and [[neo-Dada]]ists, prefer to use the terms "live art", "action art", "actions", "intervention" (see [[art intervention]]) or "manoeuvre" to describe their performing activities. As genres of performance art appear [[body art]], fluxus-performance, [[happening]], [[action poetry]], and [[intermedia]].

==Origins==
[[Image:Le Saut Dans le Vide.jpg|thumb|left|Conceptual work by [[Yves Klein]] at Rue Gentil-Bernard, Fontenay-aux-Roses, October 1960, photo by Shunk Kender. ''Le Saut dans le Vide'' (''Leap into the Void'')]]
Performance art activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events. In an episode of ''[[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]]'' broadcast on Thu, 20 Oct 2005, 21:30 on BBC Radio 4, [[Angie Hobbs]], Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Warwick; [[Miriam Griffin]], Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford; and [[John Moles]], Professor of Latin, University of Newcastle discussed with [[Melvyn Bragg]] the idea that [[Antisthenes]] and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] in ancient Greece practiced a form of performance art and that they acquired the epithet of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] which means "dog" due to Diogenes behaving repeatedly like a dog in his performances.

Western cultural theorists often trace performance art activity back to the beginning of the 20th century, to the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian constructivists]], [[Futurism|Futurists]] and [[Dada]]. Dada provided a significant progenitor with the unconventional performances of poetry, often at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], by the likes of [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] and [[Tristan Tzara]]. [[Russian Futurist]] artists could be identified as precursors of performance, such as [[David Burliuk]], who painted his face for his actions (1910–20) and [[Alexander Rodchenko]] and his wife [[Varvara Stepanova]].

According to the art critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the 1940s and 1950s [[Action Painting]] gave artists the freedom to perform—the canvas as "an arena in which to act", thereby rendering the paintings as traces of the artist's performance in his/her studio. [[Abstract expressionism]] and [[Action painting]] preceded the [[Fluxus movement]], [[Happenings]] and the emergence of Performance Art.

Performance art was anticipated, if not explicitly formulated, by [[Japan]]'s [[Gutai group]] of the 1950s, especially in such works as [[Atsuko Tanaka (artist)|Atsuko Tanaka]]'s ''Electric Dress'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9937/|title=Everything Is Illuminated|website=NYMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yves Klein]] had been a precursor of performance art with the conceptual pieces of ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle]]'' (''Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility'') 1959–62, ''Anthropométries'' (1960), and works like the photomontage, Saut dans le vide (Leap into the Void). In the late 1960s [[Land art|Earth artists]] as diverse as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Michael Heizer]] and [[Carl Andre]] created environmental pieces that predict the performance art of the 1970s. Works of conceptual artists in the early 1980s, like [[Sol LeWitt]], who converted mural-style drawing into an act of performance by others, were influenced by Yves Klein and the Earth artists as well.

==1960s==
[[Image:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|[[Carolee Schneemann]], performing her piece ''Interior Scroll.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.]]
In the 1960s a variety of new works, concepts and the increasing number of artists led to new kinds of performance art.  Prototypic for the artform later explicitly labeled "performance art", were works of artists like [[Yoko Ono]] with her ''Wall piece for orchestra'' (1962), [[Carolee Schneemann]] with pieces like ''Meat Joy'' (1964) and ''Interior Scroll'' (1975);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolf Vostell]] with his Happening ''YOU'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/you/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: YOU|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=12 April 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964 in New York); [[Joseph Beuys]] with ''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare'' (1965); [[Yayoi Kusama]], with actions such as a naked flag-burning on the Brooklyn Bridge (1968) and [[Allan Kaprow]] in his many ''Happenings''.

Kaprow had coined the term [[Happening]] describing a new artform, at the beginning of the 1960s. A ''Happening'' allows the artist to experiment with body motion, recorded sounds, written and spoken texts, and even smells. One of Kaprow's earliest was "Happenings in the New York Scene," written in 1961 as the form was developing.&lt;ref&gt;Montfort, Nick, and Noah Wardrip-Fruin. The New Media Reader. Cambridge, Massachusetts [u.a.: MIT, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably in the Happenings of Allan Kaprow, the audience members become performers. While the audiences in Happenings had been welcomed as the performers, it is only sometimes and often unwittingly that they become an active part in a Performance. Other artists who created Happenings besides Kaprow include [[Jim Dine]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Whitman]], and [[Wolf Vostell]]: ''Theater is in the Street'' (Paris in 1958).

[[Hermann Nitsch]] in 1962 presented his "Theatre of Orgies and Mysteries" (Orgien- und Mysterien Theater), a precursor to performance art, close to the performing arts.

[[Andy Warhol]] during the early 1960s beginning to create films and video,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy_warhol_films.html|title=Andy Warhol Films|author=|date=|website=www.warholstars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-60s sponsored the [[Velvet Underground]] and staged events and performances in New York, like the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] (1966) that featured live Rock music, exploding lights, and film.

Indirectly influential for art-world performance, particularly in the United States, were new forms of theatre, embodied by the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]] and the [[Living Theatre]] and showcased in Off-Off Broadway theaters in SoHO and at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club|La MaMa]] in New York City. The Living Theatre chiefly toured in Europe between 1963 and 1968, and in the U.S. in 1968. A work of this period, ''Paradise Now'' was notorious for its audience participation and a scene in which actors recited a list of social taboos that included nudity, while disrobing.

The work of performance artists after 1968 often showed influences of the cultural and political events of that year. [[Barbara T. Smith]] with ''Ritual Meal'' (1969) was at the forefront of the feminist body-, and performance art of the 1970s; among others including: [[Carolee Schneemann]], and [[Joan Jonas]]. Schneemann and Jonas along with [[Yoko Ono]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Chris Burden]] and [[Dennis Oppenheim]] pioneered the relationship between ''[[Body art]]'' and performance art.

== 1970s ==
[[Image:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Jeder Mensch ein Künstler — Auf dem Weg zur Freiheitsgestalt des sozialen Organismus'' ("Every person an artist — On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism")]]
At the beginning of the 1970s, artists whose work already before tended to be a performance art, as well as new artists, began to present performance art in a stricter form.

New artists with radical performances were [[Chris Burden]], with the 1971 performance piece ''Shoot'', in which he was shot in his left arm by an assistant from a distance of about five meters, and [[Vito Acconci]] in the same year with ''[[Seedbed (performance piece)|Seedbed]]''.

The book ''[[Expanded Cinema]]'', by [[Gene Youngblood]], marked a shift in the use of media by performance artists. The first book considering video art as an art form, mentions [[Jud Yalkut]] as a pioneering video artist. Since 1965 he had collaborated in dozens of intermedia performances throughout the United States, also with [[Nam June Paik]], who beginning of the 1960s already had been a fluxus performer on the way to become a media artist. As to the art of Paik, Youngblood refers to works of Carolee Schneemann and [[Robert Whitman]] from the 1960s, which had been pioneering for performance art, becoming an independent artform at the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Youngblood | first1 = Gene | title = Expanded Cinema | publisher = A. Dutton | year = 1970 | location = New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British-based pair [[Gilbert and George]], already in 1970, had documented actions of themselves on video, and created their "living sculpture" performance, being painted in gold and singing "Underneath The Arches" for extended periods. [[Joan Jonas]] began to include video in her experimental performances in 1972.

In 1973, [[Laurie Anderson]] performed ''Duets on Ice'', on the streets of New York City. [[Marina Abramović]], in the performance ''Rhythm 10'', conceptually included the violation of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/rhythm-10-2/ | title = Marina Abramović Rhythm 10 | accessdate = 2011-03-24 | publisher = Media Art Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, the theme of violation, shame, and sexual exploitation would be re-imagined in the contemporary performance works of artists such as  Clifford Owens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|title=This Sunday MoMA PS1 May Or May Not Host A "Performance Art Rape"|work=[[Gothamist]]|date=9 March 2012|first=Jen|last=Carlson|accessdate=16 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231244/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillian Walsh, [[Pat Oleszko]] and [[Rebecca Patek]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/arts/dance/the-margins-of-a-form-are-increasingly-not-where-they-used-to-be.html?smid=fb-share&amp;_r=0 |title=The Margins of a Form Are, Increasingly, Not Where They Used to Be |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=30 July 2013|first=Gia|last=Kourlas|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1973, the Feminist Studio Workshop at the [[Woman's Building]] in Los Angeles had a formative impact on the wave of performances with feminist background.

[[Carolee Schneemann]] work in 1963, ''Eye Body'', already had been a prototype of performance art. Schneemann in 1975 drew on with innovative solo performances, like ''Interior Scroll'', showing the female body as an artistic medium.

In the mid seventies, behind the iron curtain, in the Eastern European capitals: Budapest, Kraków, Belgrade, Zagreb, Novi Sad and other cities, the performing art was flourishing. Against the political and social control, emerged [[Orshi Drozdik]] performance series, titled ''Individual Mythology'' 1975/77 and the ''NudeModel'' 1976/77. Critical of the patriarchal discourse of art and the equally patriarchal state forced "emancipation program", pioneering feminist point of view on both, made her forerunner in the 70s political and artistic environment.

In 1976, [[HA Schult]] filled [[Piazza San Marco|St. Mark's Square]] in [[Venice]] with old newspapers in an overnight action he called ''Venezia vive.''&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Battcock and Robert Nickas, ''The Art of Performance: A Critical Anthology'' (Boston, MA: E.P. Dutton, 1984), pp. 330-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Wines, ''De-Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli International, 1987), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1977 performance, "Crash", the same artist let a [[Cessna]] crash into the garbage dump on [[Staten Island]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Art in the Seventies'' (Cornell University Press, 1980), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance art, because of its relative transience, by the 1970s, had a fairly robust presence in the [[avant-garde]] of [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, especially [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

== 1980s ==
[[File:Intervention-58-02.jpg|thumb|[[Jocelyn Maltais]] in ''Intervention 58'', 1980]]
Until the 1980s, performance art had been demystifying virtuosity. Now it began to embrace technical brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Banes | first1 = Sally | title = Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85 | publisher = The University of Michigan Press | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 120, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=1980s+performance+art&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=1980s%20performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | isbn = 0-472-09678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to ''Presence and Resistance''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Auslander | first1 = Philip | title = Presence and Resistance: Postmodernism and Cultural politics in Contemporary American Performance | publisher = University of Michigan Press | year = 1992 | location = Ann Arbour | pages = 64–65, 78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Philip Auslander]], dance critic [[Sally Banes]] writes "... by the end of the 1980s, performance art had become so widely known that it no longer needed to be defined; [[mass culture]], especially television, had come to supply both structure and subject matter for much performance art; and several performance artists, including [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Spalding Gray]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Willem Dafoe]], and [[Ann Magnuson]], had indeed become crossover artists in mainstream entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Banes | first1 = Sally | title = Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85 | publisher = The University of Michigan Press | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 10, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=1980s+performance+art&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=1980s%20performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | isbn = 0-472-09678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that many performances are held within the circle of a small art-world group, [[RoseLee Goldberg]] notes in ''Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present'' that "performance has been a way of appealing directly to a large public, as well as shocking audiences into reassessing their own notions of art and its relation to culture. Conversely, public interest in the medium, especially in the 1980s, stems from an apparent desire of that public to gain access to the art world, to be a spectator of its ritual and its distinct community, and to be surprised by the unexpected, always unorthodox presentations that the artists devise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0500203393|title=Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present|first=Roselee|last=Goldberg|date=1 June 2001|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the performance art most discussed in the art-world of this decade were a performance by [[Linda Montano]] and [[Tehching Hsieh]] between July 1983 and July 1984, ''Art/Life: One Year Performance'' (Rope Piece), and [[Karen Finley]]'s ''I'm an Ass Man'' 1987.

Until the decline of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, performance art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it could be like a playful protest or like a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | title = Reclaiming the Invisible Past of Eastern Europe | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | last = Zajanckauska | first = Zane | author2 = Interview with Ieva Astahovska | publisher = map - media archive performance | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110416151339/http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | archivedate = 2011-04-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1982, [[Hedwig Gorski]] designated the term [[performance poetry]], to distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

From 1981 to 1994, the Dutch visual artist [[PINK de Thierry]] created what she came to call meta-performances: a conceptual mix of intervention art in public space, performance art—interacting with an audience, installation art—utilizing large structures to perform in or with, and media art—photography and film to register and exhibit.

== 1990s ==
[[File:Trash People Roma 2007.JPG|thumb|''Trash People'' by [[HA Schult]], Rome, 2007]]
While the [[Soviet bloc]] disintegrated, formerly repressed activities of performance artists like [[György Galántai]] in Hungary, or the Collective Action Group in Russia, became better known. Young artists from all over the former Eastern bloc, including Russia, turned to performance. Performance art at about the same time appeared in Cuba, the Caribbean and China. Chinese performance artists like [[Zhang Huan]] had been performing underground since the late 1980s. In the early 1990s [[Chinese performance art]] already was acclaimed in the international art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Montano | first1 = Linda M. | title = Performance artists talking in the eighties | publisher = University of California Press Berkeley | year = 2000 | location = Los Angeles, London | pages = 479, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 0-520-21022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In these contexts performance art became a critical new voice with a social force similar to that found in Western Europe, the United States and South America in the 1960s and early 1970s. It should be emphasized that the eruption of performance art in the 1990s in Eastern Europe, China, South Africa, Cuba, and elsewhere should never be considered either secondary to or imitative of the West."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Montano | first1 = Linda M. | title = Performance artists talking in the eighties | publisher = University of California Press University of California Press Berkeley | year = 2000 | location = Los Angeles, London | pages = 479, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 0-520-21022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, [[HA Schult]] has installed one thousand life sized "Trash People" made from garbage as "silent witnesses to a consumer age that has created an ecological imbalance worldwide". They travelled to [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] (1999), the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] (2002) and the [[Great Wall of China]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IaIwmEh-OpsC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carlos Rojas, ''The Great Wall: A Cultural History''] (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 163-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ina-Maria Greverus and Ute Ritschel, eds., ''Aesthetics and Anthropology: Performing Life, Performed Lives'' (Berlin: LIT Verlag, 2009), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kim Levin]], ''ARTnews'', volume=6, 2011, pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the western world in the 1990s, even sophisticated performance art became part of the cultural mainstream: performance art as a complete artform gained admittance into art museums and became a museal topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Targ Brill | first1 = Marlene | title = America in the 1990s | publisher = Lerner Publishing Group | year = 2009 | pages = 93, 1 | location = Minneapolis | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BNXeIFQScocC&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;q=performance#v=snippet&amp;q=performance&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 978-0-8225-7603-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the decade, computer-aided forms of performance art began to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Nate (2009), [https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/09/horrifically-bad-software-demos-become-performance-art.ars "Horrifically bad software demo becomes performance art"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2003, Tate Modern in London has had a curated programme of live art and performance and in 2012 The Tanks at Tate Modern were opened: the first dedicated spaces for performance, film, and installation in a major modern and contemporary art museum.

From March 14 to May 31, 2010, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] held a major retrospective and performance recreation of [[Marina Abramović]]'s work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history.&lt;ref&gt;Kino, Carol (March 10, 2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14667">{{About|the mechanical device used in construction}}A '''pile driver''' is a device used to drive [[Deep foundation|piles]] (poles) into soil to provide [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] support for buildings or other structures. The term is also used in reference to members of the construction crew that work with pile-driving rigs.

One type of pile driver uses a weight placed between guides so that it can slide vertically. It is placed above a [[Deep foundation|pile]] (pole). The weight is raised, which may involve the use of [[hydraulics]], [[steam power|steam]], [[Diesel engine|diesel]], or manual labour. When the weight reaches its highest point it is released, and hits the pile, driving it into the ground.

==History==
[[Image:Roman Pile Driver, Festung Ehrenbreitstein, Koblenz, Germany.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] pile driver (replica) used at the construction of [[Caesar's Rhine bridges]] (55 BC)]]

There are a number of claims to the invention of the pile driver. A mechanically sound drawing of a pile driver appeared as early as 1475 in [[Francesco di Giorgio Martini]]'s treatise ''Trattato di Architectura''.&lt;ref name="Ladislao Reti 297f."&gt;Ladislao Reti, "Francesco di Giorgio Martini's Treatise on Engineering and Its Plagiarists", ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 4, No. 3. (Summer, 1963), pp. 287–298 (297f.)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, several other prominent inventors &amp;mdash; [[James Nasmyth]] (son of [[Alexander Nasmyth]]), who invented a steam-powered pile driver in 1845,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YWfvDkECNO4C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=Nasmyth+Steam+Piledriver&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VVZDHHaWfw&amp;sig=hl2pZ5Rqm4TZSOb8cEeDXMf6WwA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRzbqy6NrNAhVLlxoKHQCuCzYQ6AEIWjAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Nasmyth+Steam+Piledriver&amp;f=false|title=Engineers|first=Adam|last=Hart-Davis|date=3 April 2017|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; watchmaker [[James Valoué]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10211995&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=1 Science &amp; Society Picture Library] Image of Valoué's design&lt;/ref&gt; [[Count Giovan Battista Gazzola]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.fis.uc.pt/museu/37ing.htm Pile-driver] Information on Gazzola's design&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoscienza.org/english/leonardo/battipalo.html Leonardo da Vinci &amp;mdash; Pile Driver] Information at Italy's ''National Museum of Science and Technology''&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; have all been credited with inventing the device.

==Types==
Ancient pile driving equipment used human or animal labor to lift weights, usually by means of [[pulleys]], then dropping the weight onto the upper end of the pile. Modern piledriving equipment uses various methods to raise the weight and guide the pile.

===Diesel hammer===
[[File:Berminghammer B6505 Diesel Impact Hammer Driving 30-in Pipe Piles.jpg|thumbnail|left|Berminghammer B6505 Diesel Impact Hammer Driving 30" Pipe Piles]]
A modern diesel pile hammer is a large [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] diesel engine. The weight is the [[piston]], and the apparatus which connects to the top of the pile is the cylinder. Piledriving is started by raising the weight; usually a cable from the crane holding the pile driver &amp;mdash; This draws air into the cylinder. Diesel fuel is injected into the cylinder. The weight is dropped, using a quick-release. The weight of the piston compresses the air/fuel mixture, heating it to the ignition point of diesel fuel. The mixture ignites, transferring the energy of the falling weight to the pile head, and driving the weight up. The rising weight draws in fresh air, and the cycle continues until the fuel is depleted or is halted by the crew.

From an army manual on pile driving hammers:
The initial start-up of the hammer requires that the piston (ram) be raised to a point where the trip automatically releases the piston, allowing it to fall. As the piston falls, it activates the fuel pump, which discharges a metered amount of fuel into the ball pan of the impact block. The falling piston blocks the exhaust ports, and compression of fuel trapped in the cylinder begins. The compressed air exerts a pre-load force to hold the impact block firmly against the drive cap and pile. At the bottom of the compression stroke, the piston strikes the impact block, atomizing the fuel and starting the pile on its downward movement. In the instant after the piston strikes, the atomized fuel ignites, and the resulting explosion exerts a greater force on the already moving pile, driving it further into the ground. The reaction of the explosion rebounding from the resistance of the pile drives the piston upward. As the piston rises, the exhaust ports open, releasing the exhaust gases to the atmosphere. After the piston stops its upward movement, it again falls by gravity to start another cycle.

===Vertical Travel Lead Systems===
[[File:Berminghammer Vertical Travel Leads.ogv|thumb|left|Berminghammer Vertical Travel Leads in Action]]
The vertical travel lead, referred to as "VTL" system, was first developed and patented by C.W. Bermingham in the 1970s. This lead system was developed in response to the fundamental limitations of either a fixed lead or swinging lead system. The fixed lead system is well suited to level job sites with few obstructions and has the advantage of faster positioning of the lead. The hanging lead is very adaptable to different elevations and batter piles but takes much longer to position. The Vertical Travel Lead was developed to combine the fast and accurate positioning of fixed leads, with the ability to adjust the height of the lead base up or down. The VTL lead is connected to the boom by a sliding connection, which allows the lead to be elevated or lowered below grade. The VTL system has become the industry standard in Canada, US Railway Construction, and many parts of the USA.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Vertical Travel Leads come in two main forms: Spud and Box Lead types. Box leads are very common in the Southern United States and Spud Leads are common in the Northern United States, Canada and Europe.

===Hydraulic hammer===
A hydraulic hammer is a modern type of piling hammer used instead of diesel and air hammers for driving steel pipe, precast [[concrete]], and timber piles. Hydraulic hammers are more environmentally acceptable than older, less efficient hammers as they generate less noise and pollutants. In many cases the dominant noise is caused by the impact of the hammer on the pile, or the impacts between components of the hammer, so that the resulting noise level can be similar to diesel hammers.

===Hydraulic press-in===
[[Image:Wintersburg canal Huntington Beach CA.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A steel sheet pile being hydraulically pressed]]
Specialty equipment which installs piles using hydraulic rams to press piles into the ground. This system is preferred where vibration is a concern. There are press attachments that can adapt to conventional pile driving rigs to press 2 pairs of sheet piles simultaneously. Other types of press equipment sit atop existing sheet piles and grip previously driven piles. This system allows for greater press-in and extraction force to be used since more reaction force is developed. The reaction-based machines operate at only 69&amp;nbsp;dB at 23&amp;nbsp;ft allowing for installation and extraction of piles in close proximity to sensitive areas where traditional methods may threaten the stability of existing structures.

Such equipment and methods are specified in portions of the internal drainage system in the [[New Orleans]] area after [[Hurricane Katrina]], as well as projects where noise, vibration and access are a concern.

===Vibratory pile driver/extractor===
[[Image:Vibratorypiledriver05.JPG|thumb|left|185px|A vibratory pile driver on a steel H-pile powered by a diesel engine.]]
Vibratory pile hammers contain a system of counter-rotating eccentric weights, powered by hydraulic motors, and designed so that horizontal vibrations cancel out, while vertical vibrations are transmitted into the pile. The pile driving machine positioned over the pile with an excavator or crane, and is fastened to the pile by a clamp and/or bolts. Vibratory hammers can drive or extract a pile. Extraction is commonly used to recover steel "H" piles used in temporary foundation shoring. [[Hydraulic fluid]] is supplied to the driver by a diesel engine-powered pump mounted in a trailer or van, and connected to the driver head via hoses. When the pile driver is connected to a [[dragline excavator]], it is powered by the excavator's diesel engine. Vibratory pile drivers are often chosen to mitigate noise, as when the construction is near residences or office buildings, or when there is insufficient vertical clearance to permit use of a conventional pile hammer (for example when [[retrofitting]] additional piles to a bridge column or abutment footing). Hammers are available with several different vibration rates, ranging from 1200 vibrations per minute to 2400 VPM. The vibration rate chosen is influenced by soil conditions and other factors, such as power requirements and equipment cost.

[[Image:Turkey feather close sdetwiler.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The dark rachis of a [[wild turkey|turkey]] feather]]

'''Rachis''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|k|ᵻ|s}} is a [[biological]] term for a main axis or "shaft" (from the Greek ''ράχις, backbone, spine''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*r%3Aentry+group%3D5%3Aentry%3Dr%28a%2Fxis Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, ράχις]&lt;/ref&gt;).

==In zoology/microbiology==
In [[vertebrate]]s a ''rachis'' can refer to the series of articulated [[vertebrae]], which encase the [[spinal cord]]. In this case the ''rachis'' usually forms the supporting axis of the body and is then called the [[Vertebral column|spine]] or [[vertebral column]].  ''Rachis'' can also mean the central shaft of [[pennaceous feather]]s.

In the gonad of the invertebrate nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', a ''rachis'' is the central cell-free core or axis of the gonadal arm of both adult males and [[hermaphrodite]]s where the [[germ cell]]s have achieved [[pachytene]] and are attached to the walls of the gonadal tube.  The rachis is filled with [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref name="Schedl2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Schedl|title=Germ Cell Development in C. elegans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2poB6z05ZlsC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=6 August 2013|date=9 August 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4614-4015-4|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In botany==
In [[plant]]s, a ''rachis'' is the main axis of a compound structure. It can be the main stem of a compound [[leaf]], such as in ''[[Acacia]]'' or [[fern]]s, or the main, flower-bearing portion of an [[inflorescence]] above a supporting [[Peduncle_(botany)|peduncle]].

A ripe head of wild-type wheat is easily [[shattering (agriculture)|shattered]] into dispersal units when touched or blown by the [[wind]]. A series of [[Wiktionary:abscission|abscission]] layers forms that divides the rachis into dispersal units consisting of a small group of flowers (a single spikelet) attached to a short segment of the rachis. This is significant in the [[history of agriculture]], and referred to by [[archaeologists]] as a "brittle rachis", one type of [[shattering (agriculture)|shattering]] in crop plants.

'''Reading Recovery''' is a school-based, short-term intervention designed for children aged five or six, who are the lowest achieving in [[literacy]] after their first year of school. For instance, a child who is unable to read the simplest of books or write their own name, after a year in school, would be appropriate for a referral to a Reading Recovery program. The intervention involves intensive one-to-one lessons for 30 minutes a day with a trained literacy teacher, for between 12 and 20 weeks.

Reading Recovery was developed in the 1970s by New Zealand educator [[Marie Clay]]. After lengthy observations of early readers, Clay defined reading as a message-getting, problem-solving activity, and writing as a message-sending, problem-solving activity. Clay suggested that both activities involved linking invisible patterns of oral language with visible symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Reading Recovery is an application of [[Whole Language]] instructional principles in an attempt to address the needs of struggling readers.

== Description of the program ==

A combination of teacher judgment and systematic evaluation procedures identify those lowest-achieving children for whom Reading Recovery was designed. The lowest performing children (the bottom 5-20% depending on the context) are identified using the Observation Survey (Clay, 2002), a multi-faceted series of assessment tools covering early reading and writing. The Observation Survey has been standardized in the UK and US to determine its validity and reliability, however coefficients have not been reported. 
Once a child has been identified and referred to the Reading Recovery program, intervention is developed. The intervention is different for every child, assessing what the child knows and what s/he needs to learn next. The focus of each lesson is to understand and construct "messages"—to understand messages in reading and construct messages in writing—and to learn how to attend to detail without losing focus on meaning.

Daily 30 minute lessons are individually designed and delivered by specially trained teachers. Drawing from their training, Reading Recovery teachers make moment-to-moment decisions to support the child's learning. During each lesson, children read many little books. These include two to three familiar books, a rereading of the previous day's new book and the introduction and reading of a new story. Teachers take a [[running record]] of the previous day's new book to analyse the child's independence and reading behaviour. Children also compose, write and read their own messages or stories. Magnetic alphabet letters are used for sorting, to assist visual discrimination, and to look closely at how words work. Reading skills, including phonetic skills, are taught in the context of extended reading and writing by Reading Recovery teachers who have completed a year-long inservice education program that focuses on moment-to-moment responses to children's actions and behaviour.

The intervention goal is to bring children up to the level of their peers and to give them the assistance they need to develop independent reading and writing strategies. Once they are reading and writing at a level equivalent to that of their peers, their series of lessons is discontinued.

The intervention is not intended as an alternative to classroom teaching, but is complementary, to enable children to engage in their classroom program.

==Professional development for teachers ==

An essential component of the Reading Recovery program is the training of the teachers who provide the tutorial instruction. Reading Recovery teachers learn to observe, analyse, and interpret the reading and writing behaviours of individual students and to design and implement an individual program to meet each student's needs. Just as the Reading Recovery children engage in learning through social interaction with the teacher, Reading Recovery teachers engage in learning through social interaction with their colleagues and mentors to construct a view of learning and teaching that supports literacy development. Reading Recovery has one of the best professional development protocols in the field of beginning reading.

'''Research Institute for Aquaculture No 1''', or '''RIA1''', is a government organization under the Fisheries Ministry of [[Vietnam]]. RIA1 is responsible for carrying out basic and applied research programs for inland, coastal, and marine [[aquaculture]], including involvement in planning and development activities. RIA1 is now considered a national multifunction institute dealing with research, education, and extension in aquaculture and aquatic resources management. The Institute also plays an advisory role for many other aquaculture development projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Institute for Aquaculture No1|url=http://www.ria1.org/ria1/Defaults.aspx?ctl=newsdetail&amp;LangID=2&amp;p=2&amp;aID=70&amp;stID=246|website=www.ria1.org|accessdate=24 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RIA1 was established in 1963 initially as a freshwater fish research centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Institute for Aquaculture No1|url=http://www.ria1.org/ria1/Defaults.aspx?ctl=newsdetail&amp;LangID=2&amp;p=3&amp;aID=71&amp;stID=250|website=www.ria1.org|accessdate=24 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RIA1 is an R&amp;D aquaculture centre in the [[Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asia-Pacific|first1=Network of Aquaculture Centres in|title=Directory of participating research and development centres|url=https://enaca.org/?id=42&amp;title=participating-research-centres|website=enaca.org|accessdate=24 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5865">If an aircraft in flight suffers a disturbance in pitch that causes an increase (or decrease) in [[angle of attack]], it is desirable that the aerodynamic forces on the aircraft cause a decrease (or increase) in angle of attack so that the disturbance does not cause a continuous increase (or decrease) in angle of attack.  This is [[longitudinal static stability]].

''Static margin'' is a concept used to characterize the static longitudinal stability and controllability of aircraft and missiles.

In aircraft analysis, static margin is defined as the distance between the center of gravity and the neutral point of the aircraft, expressed as a percentage of the mean aerodynamic chord of the wing.  The greater this distance and the narrower the wing, the more stable the aircraft.  Conventionally, the neutral point is aft of the c.g., although in rare cases (computer controlled fighter aircraft) it may be forward of the c.g., i.e. slightly unstable, to obtain quickness of response in combat.  Too great longitudinal stability makes the aircraft "stiff" in pitch, resulting in such undesirable features as difficulty in obtaining the necessary stalled nose-up pitch when landing.

The position of the neutral point is found by taking the algebraic net moment of all horizontal surfaces, measured from the nose of the aircraft, in the same manner as the c.g. is determined, i.e. the sum of all such moments divided by their total area.  The stabilizer and elevator dominate this result, but it is necessary to account for all surfaces such as fuselage, landing gear, prop-normal, etc.  It is also necessary to take account of the center of pressure of the wing, which can move a good deal fore and aft as angle of attack of a flat-bottom wing section (Clark Y) changes, or not at all in the case of self-stabilizing sections such as the M6.

The neutral point in conventional aircraft is a short distance behind the c.g. ("The feathers of the arrow must be at the back"); but in unconventional aircraft such as canards and those with dual-wings, such as the Quickie, this will not be so.  The overall rule stated above must hold, i.e. the neutral point must be aft of the c.g., wherever that may be. 

The position of the center of gravity is determined by factors such as the positions of  loads, e.g. passengers, fuel, weapons, etc.; whether such loads can vary, e.g. presence or absence of luggage, ammunition, etc.; and how fuel is consumed during flight.  Additional information regarding the usual position of the neutral point aft of the center of gravity is at  [[longitudinal static stability]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_02/textonly/fo01txt.html Effect of CG on handling of swept-wing airplanes]&lt;/ref&gt; (For an aircraft this may be described as positive static margin.)  The response of an aircraft or missile to an angular disturbance such as a [[Tait-Bryan angles|pitch]] disturbance is determined by its static margin.

In missile analysis, static margin is defined as the distance between the center of gravity and the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]].  Missiles are symmetric vehicles and if they have airfoils they too are symmetric.  

For missiles, positive static margin implies that the complete vehicle makes a restoring moment for any angle of attack from the trim position.  If the [[center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] is behind the center of gravity then the moment will be restoring.  For missiles with symmetric airfoils, the neutral point and the center of pressure are coincident and the term neutral point is not used.

== Relationship to aircraft and missile stability and control==
* If the center of gravity (CG) of an aircraft is forward of the neutral point, or the CG of a missile is forward of the center of pressure, the vehicle will respond to a disturbance by producing an aerodynamic moment that returns the [[angle of attack]] of the vehicle towards the angle that existed prior to the disturbance.
* If the CG of an aircraft is behind the neutral point, or the CG of a missile is behind the center of pressure, the vehicle will respond to a disturbance by producing an aerodynamic moment that continues to drive the angle of attack of the vehicle further away from the starting position. 

The first condition above is positive static stability.  In missile analysis this is described as positive static margin.  (In aircraft analysis it may be described as negative static margin.)&lt;br /&gt;
The second condition above is negative static stability.  In missile analysis this is defined as negative static margin.  (In aircraft analysis it may be described as positive static margin.)  

Depending on the static margin, humans may not be able to use control inputs to the elevators to control the pitch of the vehicle.  Typically, computer based [[autopilot]]s are required to control the vehicle when it has negative static stability - usually described as negative static margin.

The purpose of the reduced stability (low static margin) is to make an aircraft more responsive to pilot inputs.  An aircraft with a large static margin will be very stable and slow to respond to the pilot inputs.  The amount of static margin is an important factor in determining the handling qualities of an aircraft.  For an unguided rocket, the vehicle must have a large positive static margin so the rocket shows minimum tendency to diverge from the direction of flight given to it at launch.  In contrast, guided missiles usually have a negative static margin for increased maneuverability.

[[File:Peter Fendi - Der Gemeinsame Freund (1910).jpg|thumb|250px|"''Der Gemeinsame Freund''" by Peter Fendi, ca.1910]]

In [[human sexuality]], a '''threesome''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] that involves three people at the same time.&lt;ref name="Frayser"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Suzanne G. Frayser, Thomas J. Whitby| title = Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide | publisher = [[Libraries Unlimited]]|pages=340–341|isbn = 1563081318|year=1995|accessdate = October 3, 2013 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tasha R.

Though ''threesome'' is most commonly applied to a [[casual sex|casual sexual activity]] involving sexual activity among three participants, a threesome may also be found in a long-term domestic relationship, such as [[polyamory]] or a [[ménage à trois]].&lt;ref name="Frayser"/&gt;

A threesome is a form of [[group sex]], but involving only three people. It may occur more frequently in private situations, such as spontaneous sexual activity among three friends, or arranged in a community of like-minded [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]] or planned as a once-only experience;&lt;ref&gt;Marie Claire, September 10, 2011: [http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/relationship-issues/threesome-sex-menage-a-trois-planning How I Planned a Ménage à Trois]&lt;/ref&gt; and rarely in anonymous settings, such as at [[orgy|orgies]] or other [[sex party (group sex)|sex parties]]. Among swinging couples, one of the two partners is often the driving force and the other is more passive-supportive of the addition of additional sex parties.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Some couples use a threesome as a way to develop a love triangle (''[[ménage à trois]]'').&lt;ref name=Hite&gt;[[Shere Hite]], The Hite Report: The sexual experience of women, Munich, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

A threesome is a common element of [[sexual fantasy]].&lt;ref name="Frayser"/&gt; It is commonly depicted in [[pornography]], but very rarely in mainstream cinema.

== Types ==
The people involved in a threesome may have any combination of [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]]. Each participant may engage in any type of sex act with one or both of the others, such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]], [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sex or [[mutual masturbation]]. One or more of the participants may engage in [[Autoeroticism|autoerotic]] sexual activity, such as [[masturbation]], possibly without physical contact with the other participants. It is a matter of subjective definition whether participation of a third person without physical contact constitutes a threesome. This may relate to fetishes such as [[voyeurism]] or [[cuckolding#Cuckoldry as a fetish|cuckolding]]. ''Lucky Pierre'' is slang for a person performing both receptive and insertive anal and/or vaginal sex simultaneously during a threesome, being positioned between the two partners. 

A [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] threesome may involve two men and a woman, for example, in [[double penetration]], or two women and a man. A bisexual threesome may involve a man having sex with a man and a woman, the woman having sex with a man and a woman, or all three having sex with each other. A homosexual threesome would involve either three men or three women. Other possibilities are possible, such as a man having sex with two women who are having sex with each other.&lt;ref name=Hite /&gt;

== Sex positions ==
Threesome sexual activity may take place in a number of [[Sex position#Threesomes|sex positions]]; for example, the following:

'''Tobii''' (formerly known as Tobii Technology AB) is a Swedish high-technology company that develops and sells products for eye control and [[eye tracking]].

== History ==

[[John Elvesjo]], Mårten Skogö and Henrik Eskilsson founded the company in 2001. All three founders play an active role in the company: Henrik Eskilsson is the [[CEO]], John Elvesjö is [[vice president]] and [[Chief technology officer|CTO]], and Mårten Skogö is [[Chief Science Officer]]. The Tobii Group consists of three business units: Tobii Dynavox from an acquisition of US based [[DynaVox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Tobii Acquires AAC leader DynaVox Systems LLC |url=http://www.tobii.com/group/news-media/press-releases/tobii-acquires-aac-leader-dynavox-systems-llc/ |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobii Pro, and Tobii Tech. Tobii is based in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, with offices in the US, Japan, China, Germany, Norway and Ukraine. Tobii became publicly traded on April 22, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sweden's Tobii sets IPO price range at 22-25 SEK/share |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/13/tobii-ipo-idUSL5N0XA09I20150413 |publisher=Reuters |date=13 April 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; trading on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

In 2007, the company got $14 million in [[venture capital]] from Investor Growth Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Tobii Technology Raises $14M in Funding From Investor Growth Capital |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070326005524/en/Tobii-Technology-AB-Tobii-Technology-Raises-14M |agency=[[Businesswire]] |date=26 March 2007 |access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Investor, Amadeus Capital Partners and Northzone Ventures invested an additional $16 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Tobii Technology raises $16M funding |url=http://www.mrweb.com/drno/news9974.htm |agency=MrWeb |date=15 May 2009 |access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the start of 2012, [[Intel Capital]] invested $21 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/03/16/intel-invests-in-tobii-eye-tracker/ |title=Intel invests in Tobii eye tracker |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Sven |last=Grundberg |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Tobii won the Swedish Grand Award of Design together with the design company Myra Industriell Design, for the technology and design in their eye controlled screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.di.se/artiklar/2008/5/6/ogonstyrda-bildskarmar-tilldelas-stora-designpriset/ |title=Ögonstyrda bildskärmar tilldelas Stora designpriset |trans-title=Grand Award of Design awarded for eye tracking screens |last=Bergsell |first=Thomas |date=6 May 2008 |accessdate=17 March 2016 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Tobii won the SIME Grand Prize for having the most innovative technology concept. In 2011, Tobii Glasses won the [[red dot design award]], an international product design competition and later the same year, Tobii won the Bully Award. In 2012, Tobii took home the award for best [[prototype]] at the consumer technology tradeshow 2012 [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] and Laptop Magazine named Tobii the winner in its best new technology category.

{{no footnotes|date=November 2009}}

The '''tyranny of numbers''' was a problem faced in the 1960s by [[computer engineering|computer engineers]].  Engineers were unable to increase the performance of their designs due to the huge number of components involved. In theory, every component needed to be wired to every other component (or at least many other components), and were typically strung and [[soldering|soldered]] by hand. In order to improve performance, more components would be needed, and it seemed that future designs would consist almost entirely of wiring.

==History==
The first known recorded use of the term in this context was made by the Vice President of [[Bell Labs]] in an article celebrating the 10th anniversary of the invention of the [[transistor]], for the "Proceedings of the IRE" (Institute of Radio Engineers), June 1958 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3BLGWnmQJ9IC&amp;pg=PA21]. Referring to the problems many designers were having, he wrote:

{{Quotation|For some time now, electronic man has known how 'in principle' to extend greatly his visual, tactile, and mental abilities through the digital transmission and processing of all kinds of information. However, all these functions suffer from what has been called 'the tyranny of numbers.' Such systems, because of their complex digital nature, require hundreds, thousands, and sometimes tens of thousands of electron devices.|Jack Morton|[http://everything2.com/e2node/The%2520Tyranny%2520of%2520Numbers The Tyranny of Numbers]}}

At the time, computers were typically built up from a series of "modules", each module containing the electronics needed to perform a single function. A complex circuit like an [[adder (electronics)|adder]] would generally require several modules working in concert. The modules were typically built on [[printed circuit boards]] of a standardized size, with a connector on one edge that allowed them to be plugged into the power and signaling lines of the machine, and were then wired to other modules using [[twisted pair]] or [[coaxial cable]].

Since each module was relatively custom,  modules were assembled and soldered by hand or with limited automation. As a result, they suffered major reliability problems. Even a single bad component or solder joint could render the entire module inoperative. Even with properly working modules, the mass of wiring connecting them together was another source of construction and reliability problems. As computers grew in complexity, and the number of modules increased, the complexity of making a machine actually work grew more and more difficult. This was the "tyranny of numbers".

It was precisely this problem that [[Jack Kilby]] was thinking about while working at [[Texas Instruments]]. Theorizing that germanium could be used to make all common electronic components - resistors, capacitors, etc. - he set about building a single-slab component that combined the functionality of an entire module. Although successful in this goal, it was [[Robert Noyce]]'s silicon version and the associated fabrication techniques that make the [[integrated circuit]] (IC) truly practical.

Unlike modules, ICs were built using [[photoetching]] techniques on an [[assembly line]], greatly reducing their cost. Although any given IC might have the same chance of working or not working as a module, they cost so little that if they didn't work you simply threw it away and tried another. In fact, early IC assembly lines had failure rates around 90% or greater, which kept their prices high. The [[U.S. Air Force]] and [[NASA]] were major purchasers of early ICs, where their small size and light weight overcame any cost issues. They demanded high reliability, and the industry's response not only provided the desired reliability, but meant that the increased yield had the effect of driving down prices.

ICs from the early 1960s were not complex enough for general computer use, but as the complexity increased through the 1960s, practically all computers switched to IC-based designs. The result was what are today referred to as the [[history of computing hardware|third-generation computers]], which became commonplace during the early 1970s. The progeny of the integrated circuit, the [[microprocessor]], eventually superseded the use of individual ICs as well, placing the entire collection of modules onto one chip.

[[Seymour Cray]] was particularly well known for making complex designs work in spite of the tyranny of numbers. His attention to detail and ability to fund several attempts at a working design meant that pure engineering effort could overcome the problems they faced. Yet even Cray eventually succumbed to the problem during the [[CDC 8600]] project, which eventually led to him leaving [[Control Data]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5352">A '''video plankton recorder''' (VPR) is towed underwater video [[microscope]] system, which photographs small to fine-scale structure of [[plankton]], from 50 micrometers and up to a few centimeters in size.&lt;ref&gt;Benfield, M.C., et al Video Plankton Recorder estimates of copepod, Pteropod and larvacean distributions from a stratified region of Georges Bank with comparative measurements from a MOCNESS sampler. Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 1996. 43(7-8): p. 1925-1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. Video Plankton Recorder (VPR).  2010  [cited 2010 10/25/2010]; Available from: http://www.whoi.edu/instruments/viewInstrument.do?id=1007#1034.&lt;/ref&gt; A VPR consists of five general components: cameras (with magnifying optics &lt;ref&gt;Cabell, D. and G. Scott. The Video Plankton Recorder.  1993; 3:[Available from: http://www.usglobec.org/newsletter/news3/news3.contents.html.{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;), strobe, additive sensor and flight control,  underwater platform and interface software for plankton identification.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, C.S., et al., A three-axis fast-tow digital video plankton recorder for rapid surveys of plankton taxa and hydrography. Limnology and Oceanography: Methods, 2005. 3(FEB.): p. 59-74.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
In order to obtain high-quality and low-noise images, [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) sensors are used in the [[camera]] system. In the early design system, the CCD cameras were mounted in one of the arm of the platform. The developments in the recent years made the cameras system possible to be mounted in the platform body along with other sensors and flight control. The magnification power on the cameras should be vary, with high [[magnification]] power on the camera, we can obtain detail observation result on the plankton sample,  such as [[protozoan]] that has &lt;1&amp;nbsp;µm resolution . In other hand, the high magnification is able to identify plankton into [[genus]] level while low magnification of the camera will provide the rare and larger taxa.

The xenon strobe (red-filtered 80 W) provides the VPR systems with the [[Lighting]] to support the work of the video camera. It is placed in the other side of the platform arm. This design is intended to provide the area between camera and strobe as undisturbed water volume for continuous observation in the VPR system.

As a complex system, VPR can also carry several oceanographic sensors in the same time such as, CTD, transmissometer, fluorometer and flowmeter. These sensors enable the system to measure temperature, conductivity, depth, [[flow measurement]], fraction of light in the water and the [[fluorescence]].

The housing or platforms for this instrument is varying depend on the purpose of the survey. These are the particular platform that has been tested and used to mount the VPR:
	
# Towed device
# [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle]](ROV)
# [[Autonomous underwater vehicle]] (AUV)
# Autonomous profiling mooring
The improvements of imaging system to observe, calculate and measure [[plankton]] in the ocean enable the detail observation on the specific plankton community. This early development was conducted by enumerating and counting the [[silhouette]] photography of plankton, the result then is processed with software package such as [[Matlab]].&lt;ref&gt;Benfield, M.C., et al., RAPID Research on Automated Plankton Identification. Oceanography, 2007. 20(2): p. 172-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imaging software===

The most important part in VPR is the plankton identification software. Any developments of the software should improve the required task performed by VPR. In a nutshell, the software should have the ability of:
#Importing the plankton images [[database]] in to the system.
#Validate the object and evaluate from the background of the sample. This qualification should include the capability of the software to discriminate unknown object from plankton.
#Identify and classify the samples therefore plankton can be distinguished from each other.
#Presenting the result in the form of; abundance, size of distribution and biomass.

==Observation result==

The study conducted by Benfield, M.C., et al. has discovered that VPR provided comparable data on the taxonomic composition of the plankton compared to physical plankton survey taken by [[MOCNESS]].

The figure in the right side shows us the general trends in abundance and detail scale patchiness along the observation area.

==Advantage and Disadvantages==

Although a VPR has a drawback for not being able to identify plankton into species level, the advantages to use this instrument has gone beyond its limitation to provide us with convenient and accurate result. The high resolution result on plankton taxa observation along with synchronized measurement environmental variables from another oceanographic sensor attached in VPR body can be considered as the milestone of this device. In addition, since the observation is conducted visually by photographing the sample, the observation of delicate plankton and gelatinous species can be done accurately without having them destroyed in the net.
