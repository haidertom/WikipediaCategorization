The '''Academy of San Carlos''' ({{lang-es|Academia de San Carlos}}) is located at 22 Academia Street in just northeast of the [[Zocalo|main plaza]] of [[Mexico City]]. It was the first major [[art school|art academy]] and the first [[art museum]] in the [[Americas]]. It was founded in 1781 as the School of Engraving and moved to the Academia Street location about 10 years later. It emphasized classical European training until the early 20th century, when it shifted to a more modern perspective. At this time, it also integrated with the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], eventually becoming the [[Faculty of Arts and Design]], which is based in [[Xochimilco]]. Currently, only graduate courses of the modern school are given in the original academy building.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/| title= Academia de San Carlos| language= Spanish| accessdate= 2009-03-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090409140215/http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/| archivedate= 2009-04-09| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=70–72 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos was founded in 1781 under the name of the School of Engraving.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; From that time to the present, it has been renamed many times to The Royal Academy of the Three Noble Arts of San Carlos (Real Academia de la Tres Nobles Artes de San Carlos) (1783),&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; Academia Nacional de San Carlos de México (1821); Academia Imperial de San Carlos de México (1863); Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (1867) and Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (1929).&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;  

Mexican painter [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] iterated the need for an art academy as early as 1753 but attempts by him and other prominent Mexican artists of the time to gain royal permission for such was never obtained.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt; The School of Engraving was begun later in the building that used to be the [[mint (coin)|mint]], and would later become the modern-day [[National Museum of Cultures]]. Ten years later, it moved to the former Amor de Dios Hospital, where it remains to this day.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The street it is located on was renamed from Amor de Dios Street to Academia Street in its honor.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;

The Academy was originally sponsored by the [[Spanish Crown]] and a number of private patrons.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The academy was inaugurated on 4 November 1781 on the saint's day of [[King Carlos III]],&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; operating for its first ten years in the old mint building (now the [[National Museum of Cultures]]).&lt;ref name="GTM"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Turistica de Mexico – Distrito Federal Centro 3 |last= Bueno de Ariztegui (ed) |first=Patricia |year=1984 |publisher=Promexa |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-34-0319-0 |pages=94–98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not obtain its royal seal until 1783 and was not fully functional until 1785.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The school moved into the old "Hospital del Amor de Dios" building in 1791, where it has remained ever since.&lt;ref name="GTM"/&gt; The academy was the first major art institution in the Americas.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;

[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Manuel Tolsá - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Manuel Tolsá]], by [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]]]]
The school's first director, Italian Jeronimo Antonio Gil, was appointed by Carlos III and gathered prominent artists of the day including José de Alcíbar, [[Santiago Sandoval]], Juan Sáenz, [[Manuel Tolsá]] and [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]].  Tolsá and Ximeno would later stay on to become directors of the school.  The new school began to promote [[Neoclassicism]], focusing on Greek and Roman art and architecture, advocating European-style training of its artists.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt; To this end, plaster casts of classic Greek and Roman statues were brought to Mexico from Europe for students to study.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;
[[File:UpperfloorSanCarlosDF.JPG|thumb|Upper floor of the building]]
Since its founding, it attracted the country's best artists, and was a force behind the abandonment of the [[Baroque]] style in Mexico, which had already gone out-of-fashion in Europe.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;

In the early 19th century, the academy was closed for a short time due to the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. When it reopened, it was renamed the National Academy of San Carlos and enjoyed the new government's preference for Neoclassicism, as it considered the Baroque reminiscent of colonialism. Despite the school's association with the independent Mexican government, [[Emperor Maximilian I]] (installed in Mexico by the French) protected the school during his reign, although foreign artists were shunned there.  When [[Benito Juárez]] ousted the emperor and regained the presidency of Mexico, he was reluctant to support the school and its European influence, which he considered to be a vestige of colonialism.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

The academy continued to advocate classic, European-style training of its artists until 1913. In that year, a student and teacher strike advocating a more modern approach ousted director [[Antonio Rivas Mercado]]. It was also partially integrated into University of Mexico (now UNAM) at that time, although it initially kept a large degree of autonomy.  In 1929, the architecture program was separated from the rest of the academy,&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt; and in 1953, this department was moved to the newly built [[Ciudad Universitaria|campus of UNAM]] in the south of the city. The remaining programs in painting, sculpture and engraving were renamed National School of Expressive Arts [[National School of Arts (UNAM)|Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas]]. Later, the undergraduate fine arts programs were moved to a facility in [[Xochimilco]], leaving only some graduate programs in the original Academy of San Carlos building.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

==Associated artists==
[[Image:Jose Maria Velasco.jpg|thumb|left|[[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]] ''Self-portrait'' (1894). Velasco dominated 19th c Mexican landscape painting.]]
Some of its most famous first teachers included [[Miguel Constanzó]] in architecture, [[José Joaquín Fabregat]] in metal engraving, Rafael Ximeno y Planes in painting and Manuel Tolsá in sculpture. Another notable teacher here was [[Pelegrí Clavé]], who was noted for his expertise in creating portraits of heroes and biblical figures.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

[[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Antonio Fabres]] was a dominant force at the Academy during early 20th century. He would mentor later Mexican artists such as [[Saturnino Herrán]], [[Roberto Montenegro]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[José Clemente Orozco]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

[[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]] is considered the greatest artist associated with the Academy, famous for his landscapes of the [[Valley of Mexico]] and a mentor of Diego Rivera. Other artists linked to the Academy are [[Manuel Rodríguez Lozano]], [[Alfredo Zalce]], [[Andrés José López]], [[José Chávez Morado]], [[Francisco Moreno Capdevila]], [[Luis Sahagún Cortés]], [[Gabriel Fernández Ledesma]] and [[Jorge Figueroa Acosta]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; [[Matusha Corkidi]] studied at the Academy after emigrating from Egypt.&lt;ref name="HellerHeller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G.

==Building==
[[File:AfricanartExpoSanCarlosDF.JPG|thumb|Exhibition of children's art from Africa on 25 May 2009]]
The building originally was as the Amor de Dios Hospital, which had closed by the time the School of Engraving decided to move there from the mint building. Founding director Jeronimo Antonio Gil took charge of the restoration and remodeling work. Artist [[Javier Cavallari]] created the Academy's Neoclassic facade, which is embellished with six medallions. Four of these represent the Academy's founders: Carlos III, [[Carlos IV]], Jeronimo Antonio Gil and [[Fernando José Manguino]], and the other two are of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].  Cavallari also finished the patio, the conference room and the painting and sculpture galleries. The painting gallery contains portraits by [[Ramon Sagredo]] and the sculpture room contains works by [[José Obregón]] and [[Manuel Ocaranza]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

A number of plaster casts of classic statues from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|San Fernando Fine Arts Academy]] in Spain were brought here for teaching purposes. These casts still exist and can be seen on display in the Academy's central patio. Some of these statues include casts of statues from the [[Medici]] tombs, [[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses by Michelangelo]], The [[Victory of Samothrace]] and [[Venus de Milo]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

==Gallery==
[[File:Antiguadireccionacademiasancarlos.jpg|thumb|Old photo of the dean's office]]
The academy once had a very large collection of art in the Gallery of the San Carlos Academy, considered the first museum of art in the Americas.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mexicocity.ciudadmexico.com.mx/attractions/san_carlos.htm |title=Nacional Museum of San Carlos |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203151944/http://mexicocity.ciudadmexico.com.mx/attractions/san_carlos.htm |archivedate=2008-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its art collection began with plaster casts of original Greek, Roman and European works used as teaching aids. It also gained other European works such as engravings from the 16th to 19th centuries from Spain, France, England, Italy, Germany, and Holland. The school also collected works from students and teachers from its founding to beginning of the 20thcentury. However, the collection outgrew the original academy building as it received donations from private sources and purchases made by the Mexican government after independence. The collection was divided, some going to the [[Museo Universitario de la Academia]], also in the historic center of town, some going to the [[National Museum of San Carlos]], northeast of the historic center and the rest remaining in the original building.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plaster"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plastercastcollection.org/en/database.php?d=lire&amp;id=109 |title= Academia San Carlos, Mexico City |accessdate=2009-03-30 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503210030/http://www.plastercastcollection.org/en/database.php?d=lire&amp;id=109| archivedate= 3 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancona S.Ciriaco (43).JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ancona Cathedral, facade]]
'''Ancona Cathedral''' ({{lang-it|Duomo di Ancona}}, ''Basilica Cattedrale Metropolitana di San Ciriaco'') is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[cathedral]] in [[Ancona]], central [[Italy]], dedicated to Saint [[Cyriacus of Ancona]]. It is the seat of the [[Archbishop of Ancona]]. The building is an example of mixed [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]-Byzantine and [[Gothic architecture in Italy|Gothic]] elements, and stands on the site of the former [[acropolis]] of the [[Greater Greece|Greek]] city, the Guasco hill which overlooks Ancona and its gulf.

==History==
Excavations carried on in 2016 proved that an [[Italic tribes|Italic temple]], perhaps dedicated to [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite]], existed on the site as early as the 3rd century BC. On top of it, in the 6th century CE, a Palaeo-Christian church was built: this had a nave and three aisles with the entrance facing south-east (where the current Chapel of the Crucifix is). Some remains of it still in existence include a mosaic pavement and perimeter walls.

In 995–1015 a new church was built, which kept the original walls. In 1017 the renovated [[basilica]] received the [[relics]] of Saint [[Marcellinus of Ancona]] and Saint Cyriacus. Further enlargement works occurred between the late 12th and the early 13th centuries, with the addition of a transept to obtain a [[Greek cross]] plan, and an entrance towards the south-west, resulting in the church now facing the port and the new road entering the city. The transepts were at a higher level than the previous nave, and had apses. The church, previously dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]], was re-dedicated to Saint Cyriacus the Martyr, the patron saint and (possibly) bishop of Ancona.
[[File:Ancona San Ciriaco.jpg|left|thumb|One of the red marble lions in the portal]]
An initial restoration took place in 1883. During [[World War I]], on 24 May 1915, the basilica was damaged by a bombardment of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] fleet. The damage was restored in 1920, but in [[World War II]] Anglo-American aerial bombings destroyed the south transept and the Crypt of Tears under it, along with the art treasures housed there. Once the transept was rebuilt, the church was officially reopened in 1951. Further damage was caused by an earthquake in 1972, followed by a new restoration and another official opening in 1977.

In 1926 the cathedral was declared a [[basilica minor]].

==Description==

===Exterior===
The edifice is built in white stone from [[Mount Conero]], with apses protruding from the transept's ends and an elevated body, with a dome at the crossing, in correspondence to the nave. All the external surfaces feature a decoration of [[Lombard band]]s. The bell tower is in an isolated position. It is mentioned from 1314 and was built above a pre-existing late 13th-century tower.
[[File:Ancona, Duomo di San Ciriaco, X-XII secolo (13).JPG|thumb|250px|Interior view]]
[[File:Ancona, Duomo di San Ciriaco, X-XII secolo (15).jpg|thumb|250px|The 1189 balustrade tiles]]

The façade, divided into three section, is preceded by a wide staircase; above it is a 13th-century Romanesque portal formed by a round arch supported by four columns. The anterior ones stand on lions in Veronese red marble, while the rear ones, added later by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]], are on a simple pedestal.

Under the arches are four reliefs depicting the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists]]. The portal is attributed to [[Giorgio da Como]] (c. 1228), and is in Romanesque-Gothic style, built in Conero white stone from [[Mount Conero]] and Veronese red marble. It is decorated by a series of columns holding ogival arches with reliefs of saints' busts, animal figures and vegetable motifs. Above the portal is a large [[oculus]] with a Romanesque frame between two single [[mullioned window]]s.

The dome is one of the most ancient in Italy. It has an ogival shape with a dodecagonal drum, standing on a square base with small decorative arches. It was built over the crossing in the 13th century, and is attributed to [[Margaritone d'Arezzo]] (1270). Together with the church of [[Basilica di Sant'Antonio da Padova|Sant'Antonio]] at [[Padua]] and [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]], it was one of the few contemporary examples of domes built in churches, instead than in separate baptisteries. The copper cover was added in the 16th century.

===Interior===
The interior is on the [[Greek cross]] plan. All the arms are divided into a nave and two aisles, with re-used antique Roman columns with Byzantine capitals. At the crossing is the internal part of the dome, which has [[pendentive]]s with Byzantine-style figures of praying angels. The dome is supported by cruciform cluster piers.

The side arms of the transept end in elevated apses, while the central arm of the [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] lost the original apse during the enlargement works of the 18th century. All the naves have hull-shaped, painted wooden vaults dating from the 15th century. At the beginning of the northern nave is the monument to a [[Fermo]] warrior from 1530.

The south transept is home to the Chapel of the Crucifix. Its screens (''transennae'') are formed by tiles with [[sgraffito]] decoration from a balustrade of 1189. They depict, on the left, [[Jeremiah]] and [[Habakkuk]]; the Eternal Father and the Blessed Virgin; an angel and Saint [[John the Evangelist]]; and Saint Cyriacus; and, on the right, figures of animals: two [[Crane (bird)|crane]]s on a pomegranate tree, an eagle, two peacocks on a tree and two gryphons. In the Crypt of Tears below, rebuilt after the devastation of World War II, are remains of ancient structures. The presbytery's arms house, in the northern aisles, the sepulchre of Blessed [[Girolamo Ginelli]] (d. 1506), made in 1509 by [[Giovanni Dalmata]].

The northern transept houses the Madonna Chapel, with a lavishly decorated niche designed by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]] in 1739, which is the site of a venerated 17th century image of the Madonna. Under the chapel is a crypt with the remains of [[Judas Cyriacus|Saint Cyriacus of Ancona]] (in a marble case), Saints Liberius and Marcellinus (in Sicilian jasper) and the ashes of [[Saint Palatia]]. The urns with bronze festoons were designed and executed between 1757 and 1760 by [[Gioacchino Varlè]].

'''''Arii Matamoe''''', also titled '''''The Royal End''''' ({{lang-fr|La Fin royale}}) is a painting on coarse cloth by the French artist [[Paul Gauguin]], created in 1892 during the painter's first visit to [[Tahiti]]. It depicts a man's severed head on a pillow, displayed before mourners, and although it did not depict a common or contemporary Tahitian mourning ritual, may have been inspired by the death of [[Pōmare V]] in 1891 shortly after Gauguin's arrival.&lt;ref name=Wyatt12Mar&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/arts/design/12gett.html|title=Getty Museum Buys a Seldom-Exhibited Gauguin|work=The New York Times|date=March 12, 2008|accessdate=December 16, 2015|first=Edward|last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; A curator for the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] suggested Gauguin likely painted the canvas "to shock Parisians" upon his expected return to the city.&lt;ref name=Wyatt12Mar/&gt;

==Origins and description==
[[File:Paul Gauguin 1891.png|200px|thumb|right|Paul Gauguin, c. 1891]]
In 1891, Gauguin sailed for Tahiti (a voyage lasting two months) expecting to experience an untouched Eden, far removed from his European experience. He was instead disappointed to discover that [[Papeete|Pape'ete]], the capital of the Tahitian colony, was heavily Europeanized and full of expensive distractions. Not finding life in Pape'ete conducive to his creative work, Gauguin moved after three months to the isolated village of Mataiea, near [[Papeari]]. It was here that his Tahitian-inspired vision flourished, and where he completed dozens of paintings.

"I have just finished a severed [[Kanak people|Kanak]] [Pacific Islander] head, nicely arranged on a white cushion, in a palace of my invention and guarded by women also of my invention", Gauguin wrote to his friend (and future biographer) [[George-Daniel de Monfreid|Daniel de Monfreid]] in June 1892.&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt; The death of Pōmare V not long after Gauguin's arrival, as well as Gauguin's witnessing of a public execution by guillotine several years earlier, are both thought to have informed the work;&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt; Gauguin would later write in ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Noa Noa|ca}}'', a collage book which includes a photograph of ''Arii Matamoe'' (''Noa Noa'' was compiled after Gauguin's stay in Tahiti and first published in 1901), that the death of the last Tahitian King seemed to him a metaphor for the disappearance of native Tahitian culture at the hands of Europeans.&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt;  Pōmare V, who was pressured to abdicate and give Tahiti and its island dependencies to France in 1880, and who would later succumb to alcoholism, was not decapitated or put on similar public display.&lt;ref name=Muchnic12Mar/&gt; At best, such rituals were uncommon in Tahitian history.&lt;ref name=Wyatt12Mar/&gt;

In ''Arii Matamoe'', Gauguin achieves a tropical sensibility through a color palette ranging from muted purples and browns to yellows, reds, and vivid pinks.&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt; The rustic, exotic qualities of Gauguin's imaginary "palace" are emphasized by the artist's choice of a rough, burlap-like cloth for his canvas.&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt; The severed head, displayed on a low-lying table or serving platter, is decorously presented with only a hint of blood; a despairing nude woman crouches nearby, while a figure just outside the room seems to proclaim the man's death to still more people further away.&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt; The interior is rich with [[Tiki]]-like figures and suggestive geometric patterns.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Freely mixing Eastern and Western influences, Gauguin combined motifs and imagery borrowed from Tahitian, [[Javanese mythology|Javanese]], French, and [[Peruvian art|Peruvian]] sources, and by doing so created a rich [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] mélange which, according to Gauguin scholar Elizabeth Childs, indicates that he was "interested in proving himself to a Parisian art market".&lt;ref name=Wyatt12Mar/&gt;

{{Css Image Crop|Image = Paul Gauguin (French - Arii Matamoe (The Royal End) - Google Art Project.jpg|bSize = 700|cWidth = 300|cHeight = 320|oTop = 74|oLeft = 132|Location = left|Description=&lt;center&gt;''Arii Matamoe'', enlarged detail}}
The words "ARii" (meaning "noble" or "royal", related to the Hawaiian word [[ali'i]]) and "MATAMOE" (meaning "sleeping eyes" and implying, in this context, death) are here written in the upper left background above the severed head,&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt; which itself alludes to imagery frequently seen in European painting such as of [[St. John the Baptist]] and [[Orpheus#Death|Orpheus]].&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt; The phrase "ARii MATAMOE", written in crisp capital letters, serves somewhat like the Latin phrase "[[Et in Arcadia ego|ET IN ARCADIO EGO]]" in paintings by [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], for example, reminding both the figures within the scene and the outside observer of their mortality.&lt;ref name=Allan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allan|first=Scott C.|journal=Getty Research Journal|date=2012|issue=4|pages=75–90|title="A Pretty Piece of Painting": Gauguin's "Arii Matamoe"|jstor=41413133|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Getty curator Scott C. Allan has argued that ''Arii Matamoe'' is both a "symbolic self-portrait" and a "self-mythologizing work", which serves both to fetishize Gauguin's fantasies of cultural estrangement and martyrdom while hinting of possible redemption and renewal.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

==Provenance and exhibition history==
The painting was exhibited in Paris by the dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] in November 1893,&lt;ref name=Wyatt12Mar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; along with 40 other recently created Gauguin works, but did not immediately sell; it also failed to find a buyer in the [[Bernheim-Jeune]] auction of Gauguin works in 1895.&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt; The artist [[Henry Lerolle]] would purchase ''Arii Matamoe'' at auction in 1895 for 400 francs from [[Hôtel Drouot|Drouot]],&lt;ref name=Duponchelle26Mar&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2008/03/26/03004-20080326ARTFIG00326-l-amerique-s-empare-d-un-gauguin-meconnu-.php | title=L'Amérique s'empare d'un Gauguin méconnu|work=Le Figaro|date=March 26, 2008|accessdate=December 17, 2015|first=Valérie|last=Duponchelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually bequeath it to his wife in 1929.&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt; It was briefly owned by the collaborationist writer and art collector [[Émile Roche]], who sold it "before the war"&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt; to {{Interlanguage link multi|Georges Leven|fr}}, a prominent French-Jewish lawyer and acting director of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] until his death in 1941; Leven's heirs consigned the painting to an unknown [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]] gallery between 1941 and 1945.&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt;

Although well-known to art historians and scholars, the painting was privately owned after World War II by a Swiss collector who, after 1946, lent it only once for an obscure domestic exhibition.&lt;ref name=Getty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wyatt12Mar/&gt; After eight years of negotiations, the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] announced its purchase in March 2008, declining to name the painting's last private owner or the painting's cost (estimated around $30 million by ''Le Figaro'').&lt;ref name=Duponchelle26Mar/&gt; At the time, Getty curator of paintings Scott Schaefer called ''Arii Matamoe'' "the ultimate still life" and "the most famous painting by Gauguin that no one has seen".&lt;ref name=Muchnic12Mar/&gt; After a light cleaning, the painting has been on public display since and has been lent by the Getty for several exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Getty&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/243174/paul-gauguin-arii-matamoe-the-royal-end-french-1892/|title=Arii Matamoe (The Royal End)|accessdate=December 16, 2015|website=The J.

'''Artel of Artists''' ({{Lang-ru|«Арте́ль худо́жников»}}) was a [[cooperative]] association (''[[artel]]'') and a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] of democratically-minded artists headed by [[Ivan Kramskoi]]. It was established in 1863 after some of its future organisers had been expelled from the [[Imperial Academy of Arts|St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg Academy of Arts]] because of the "revolt of fourteen".  In rebellion against the Academy's annual competition, the students refused to paint an exam picture on the given topic.

A number of members of the Artel later became ''[[Peredvizhniki|Peredvizhniks]]''.

The '''Bernie Grant Arts Centre''' (BGAC) is a £15 million purpose-built multi-[[arts centre]], which includes a 274-seat [[auditorium]], studio/rehearsal space, café/bar, enterprise centre and open spaces. It is located next to the Town Hall in [[Tottenham]], [[North London]]. The centre was designed by [[David Adjaye]] and opened in September 2007. According to its proclaimed aims:

:“The BGAC aspires to be a nationally and internationally recognised centre for the development of diverse cultural and creative practitioners, which has a demonstrably positive impact on the quality of life of local communities. The vision of the centre as an organisation dedicated to making a substantial contribution to the social and economic regeneration of Tottenham is a key objective of the organisation.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berniegrantcentre.co.uk/index.php?pid=91 "About the Centre", Bernie Grant Arts Centre website.]&lt;/ref&gt;
:
The centre organises [[performance]]s, [[exhibition]]s, [[film]]s, courses and festivals. It also houses and supports and number of start-up creative enterprises in its purpose-built Enterprise Centre with 20 units.

It is funded by the [[London Borough of Haringey]] and the [[Arts Council]].

It is named in honour of [[Bernie Grant]], MP, who represented the area. It was an initiative started before his death in 2000, through which he aspired to create "a unique showcase for international multicultural talent". Visiting the BGAC on 11 August 2010, Culture minister [[Ed Vaizey]] MP said: "What I have seen today is fantastic. It is a working example of how a community space can bring opportunities to the many people who want to work in creative industries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/8327428.Culture_minister_tours_Bernie_Grant_Arts_Centre/ Elizabeth Pears, "Culture minister tours Bernie Grant Arts Centre", ''Haringey Independent'', 12 August 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Black metal bookend.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A simple sheetmetal bookend]]

Common in [[libraries]], bookstores, and homes, the '''bookend''' is an object tall, sturdy, and heavy enough, when placed at either end of a row of upright [[book]]s, to support or [[buttress]] them.   Heavy bookends—made of [[wood]], [[bronze]], [[marble]], and even large [[geode]]s—have been used for centuries; the simple sheetmetal bookend  (originally patented in 1877 by William Stebbins Barnard)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent US186974|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US186974}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the weight of the books standing on its foot to clamp the bookend's tall brace against the last book's back; in libraries, simple metal brackets are often used to support the end of a row of books. Elaborate and decorative bookends are not uncommon as elements in [[home decor]].

[[File:Palazzo Ducale - Venice Art - Etching Collagraph.jpg|thumb|350px|a collagraph printed by re-using materials from the atelier: tarlatan, carborundum, sandpaper, and thread (Noemí Carrau Gual)]]

'''Carborundum Mezzotint''' is a [[printmaking]] technique in which the image is created by adding light passages to a dark field. It is a relatively new process invented in the US during the 1930s by Hubert Mesibov, Michael J. Gallagher, and [[Dox Thrash]], an artist working in Philadelphia with the WPA&lt;ref name="King-Hammond"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King-Hammond|first1=Leslie|title=Black Printmakers and the WPA|url=http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/vpadvance/artgallery/gallery/wpa/essay1.htm|website=Black Printmakers and the WPA|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). "Carborundum Collagraph" [[collagraph]] is a different printmaking technique, invented in 1952 by Henri Goetz, an American abstract artist living in Paris. The carborundum mezzotint uses the grits to create pits below the surface of the metal that then hold ink, like traditional mezzotint. The carborundum collagraph creates the image above the surface of the matrix, which does not have to be metal. In one method, the grits are mixed into a paste using an acrylic base that is painted onto the matrix, creating the image much like painting. Once dried, this holds the ink; the wiping and printing are done the same as etching. The techniques described following and below are alternatives to the paste mixture technique, yet all are creating the image above the surface of the matrix. Carbordundum collagraph allows artists to work on a large scale. Normally, [[Paperboard|cardboard]] or [[wood]] plates are coated in a layer of [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] or [[Screen printing|screen]], and the lights are created by filling in the texture with screen filler or glue. [[Carborundum prints]] may be printed as [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] plates.  

Carborundum was originally used by printmakers to grind down [[lithography]] stones and is now used in collagraph prints to create gradients of tone and a sandy texture. It works because when the carborundum adheres to the plate the ink sits around it. It can be applied in a number of different ways:

*Painting onto the plate with a liquid glue and then sprinkling the carborundum onto it
*Mixing different amounts of glue with it and then painting them on in sections, the more grit used the darker. Example: one spoon of carborundum to five spoons of glue will be much lighter than five spoons of carborundum to five spoons of glue.
*Using [[stencil]]s to apply the glue and sprinkling different amounts of carborundum through the different stencils.

To print a [[carborundum print]], the surface is covered in ink, and then the surface is wiped clean with ''[[tarlatan]]'' cloth or newspaper, leaving ink only in the texture of the screen or [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]].  A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper.  Very large editions are not possible as a small amount of carborundum comes off every time it is wiped down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/decode/pdfs/2.exhibition.pdf| title = Exhibition reviews| accessdate = 2009-06-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrast with [[relief print]]ing, and with [[planographic printing]] techniques such as [[lithography]].

{{Communist Romania}}
'''Ceaușescu's final speech''' was a speech delivered by [[Romania]]n [[dictator]] [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] on 21 December 1989. It was a pivotal moment in the [[Romanian Revolution]].

==Speech==
In the wake of growing tension over an uprising in [[Timișoara]] in which thousands were reportedly killed, Ceaușescu decided to give a nationally televised speech before a crowd in Palace Square (now known as [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Revolution Square]]) in [[Bucharest]]. This speech was an annual event and carefully scripted by the regime to ensure both success and the appearance of popular support.

Thousands of workers were bussed into the square under threat of being fired.  They were given red flags, banners and large pictures of Ceaușescu and his wife [[Elena Ceaușescu|Elena]]. The workers were augmented by bystanders who were rounded up on [[Calea Victoriei]].&lt;ref name=Revolution1989&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebestyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd, now totaling up to 80,000, were given orders on where to stand, when to applaud and what to sing. The front rows of the assembly were made up of low-level Communist Party officials and members who acted as cheer-leaders. Immediately before them were plainclothes [[Securitate]] agents and a row of police militia, who kept the mass of the crowd about thirty meters back from the front of the Central Committee building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Almond|pages=4–5|title=The Rise and Fall of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu|ISBN=1-85592-510-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceaușescu appeared on the balcony of the Central Committee building and began as he had in years past, with a speech laden with the usual "[[wooden language]]." However, he had badly misread the crowd's mood. Only the front rows supported Ceaușescu with cheers and applause, with most of the crowd remaining impassive. Eight minutes into the speech, some in the crowd actually began to scream because there was a shooting that occurred in the background.  Workers from a Bucharest power plant started chanting "Ti-mi-șoa-ra! Ti-mi-șoa-ra!"—a chant that was soon picked up by others in the crowd. In response, Ceaușescu raised his right hand in hopes of silencing the crowd; his stunned expression remains one of the defining moments of the end of Communism in Eastern Europe. After many people began to exit the square, both Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu shouted over the public address system for them to "remain seated". Nicolae then tried to placate the crowd by offering to raise workers' salaries by 200 [[Romanian leu|lei]] per month (about 18 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] at the time, yet a 10%-20% raise for a modest salary) and student scholarships from 100 to 110 lei while continuing to praise the achievements of the past 42 years. He did not realize, however, that a real revolution was starting right before his eyes. [[Ion Iliescu]] was his successor.

His security guard appeared, disappeared and, finally, hustled Ceaușescu off the balcony.

'''Cirebon Mask Dance''' or ''tari topeng Cirebon'' is a local indigenous art form of [[Cirebon]] in Java, including [[Indramayu]] and [[Jatibarang, Indramayu|Jatibarang]], [[West Java]] and [[Brebes]], [[Central Java]]. It is called mask dance because the dancers use masks when dancing. There is a lot of variety in Javanese mask dance, both in terms of the dance style and the stories to be conveyed. Sometimes the mask dance can be performed by solo dancers, or it can also be performed by several people.

Graceful hand and body movements, and musical accompaniment dominated by drums and fiddle, are hallmarks of  Javanese mask dance.
The dance is performed on special occasions for local officials, or for other traditional celebrations.

The one of mask dance maestro is [[Mimi Rasinah]], an active dancer and teaches studio art at the ''Tari Topeng Mimi Rasinah'' located in the village Pekandangan, Indramayu . Since 2006, Mimi Rasinah suffering from paralysis, but she was still excited to performing, dancing and teaching mask dance until the end of her life, Mimi Rasinah died in August 2010 at the age of 80.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4643">[[File:Utoronto coa.svg|thumb|250px|Coat of arms of the [[University of Toronto]]]]
The '''coat of arms of the University of Toronto''' is the primary emblem of the [[University of Toronto]], which is the largest university in [[Canada]]. It is currently used in several different contexts by the University and can be seen on its own, on the University [[banner]], as part of the [[achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]] of the University, or featured in the logos of numerous University divisions, as well as the logo of the University as a whole.&lt;ref name=Trademark&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trademarks.utoronto.ca/marks/ |title=Official Marks |work=U of T Trademark Licensing |accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its varied usage, modification of the [[coat of arms]] is extremely rare, as its use is strictly controlled by the University's Office of International, Governmental, and Institutional Relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://universityrelations.utoronto.ca/sc/u-of-t-branding/ U of T Visual Identity - Office of International, Governmental, and Institutional Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; Several University divisions, notably the [[college]]s, have their own emblems, and they do not regularly use the University coat of arms.

The [[motto]], which is not itself part of the arms but of the overall heraldic achievement, is ''velut arbor aevo'', [[Latin]] for "may it grow as a tree through the ages".&lt;ref name=Convocation/&gt;

==Blazon==
The [[blazon]] of the University coat of arms is as follows: 
{{quote|Azure two open Books and in base a Beaver all proper, upon a Chief Agent the Royal and Imperial Crown also proper, and for the crest on a wreath of the colours an Oak tree proper stemmed and fructed Or.&lt;ref name=varsity&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thevarsity.ca/2011/03/28/whats-in-a-coat-of-arms/ |title=What’s in a coat of arms? |work=The Varsity |accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The armorial bearings of the University are blazoned by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] as follows:&lt;ref name=CHA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=2794&amp;ShowAll=1 |title=Armorial bearings of the University of Toronto |work=Canadian Heraldic Authority |accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arms: Azure two open books above a beaver statant proper, on a chief Argent the Royal Crown proper
* Crest: An oak tree Or leaved Vert fructed Or
* Motto: VELUT ARBOR ӔVO (Latin for "As a tree, over time")

==History==
The origins of the coat of arms are obscure. The earliest reference to the device is an 1857 recommendation that the senate of the University adopt the coat of arms, which was accepted. From that point on, the general design has remained largely unchanged. There have been minor alterations, such as the loss of the original [[supporters]] ([[Minerva]] and [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]) and the transformation of the beaver from an aggressive to a more benign charge over time. The latter was described by University graphic designer Caz Zyvatkauskas in 2000 as the "emasculation of the U of T beaver".&lt;ref name=varsity/&gt;

In 1917, owing to a lack of uniformity among the coats of arms on campus due to decades of lax regulation, the board of governors petitioned the [[College of Arms]] to create an official description of the University coat of arms.&lt;ref name=Convocation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.convocation.utoronto.ca/graduation/tradition-history |title=Tradition &amp; History |work=U of T Office of Convocation |accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the current blazon, quoted in the preceding section. The arms of [[University College, Toronto|University College]] were completed at the same time. Both arms cost the University a combined £89, six shillings. It was at this time that the crest of the University, which was originally a [[maple tree]], became an [[oak tree]].&lt;ref name=varsity/&gt;

The armorial bearings of the University of Toronto were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on May 20, 2016.&lt;ref name=CHA /&gt;

==Associated emblems==
The University of Toronto contains many divisions, some of which use emblems distinct from those of the University. Some University divisions were founded as independent institutions and were later absorbed into the University. This, as well as the different aesthetics of those eras during which the emblems were designed, accounts for the difference in styles used by each institution.

'''Dead Kennedys''' are an American [[punk rock]] band that formed in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in 1978. The band was one of the first American hardcore bands to make a significant impact in the United Kingdom.

Dead Kennedys' lyrics were usually political in nature, satirizing establishment political figures (liberal and conservative) and authority in general, as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself. During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986, they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork. Several stores refused to stock their recordings, provoking debate about censorship in rock music; in the mid 1980s, vocalist and primary lyricist [[Jello Biafra]] became an active campaigner against the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]. This culminated in an obscenity trial between 1985 and 1986, which resulted in a [[hung jury]].

The group released a total of four studio albums and one EP before disbanding in 1986. Following the band's dissolution, Biafra continued to collaborate and record with other artists including [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], [[NoMeansNo]] and his own bands [[Lard (band)|Lard]] and the [[Guantanamo School of Medicine]], as well as releasing several spoken word performances.

In 2000 (upheld on appeal in 2003), Jello Biafra lost an acrimonious legal case initiated by his former Dead Kennedys band mates over songwriting credits and unpaid royalties. In 2001, the band reformed without Biafra; various singers have since been recruited for vocal duties.

==History==

===Formation of the band (1978–79)===
Dead Kennedys formed in June 1978 in [[San Francisco, California]], when [[East Bay Ray]] (Raymond Pepperell) advertised for bandmates in the newspaper ''[[The Recycler]]'', after seeing a [[ska-punk]] show at [[Mabuhay Gardens]] in San Francisco. The original band lineup consisted of [[Jello Biafra]] (Eric Reed Boucher) on vocals, East Bay Ray on guitar, [[Klaus Flouride]] (Geoffrey Lyall) on bass, [[Carlos Cadona|6025]] (Carlos Cadona) on rhythm guitar and [[Ted (musician)|Ted]] (Bruce Slesinger) on drums and percussion. This lineup recorded their [[The 1978 Demos|first demos]]. Their first live show was on July 19, 1978 at Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, California. They were the opening act on a bill that included DV8 and Negative Trend with The Offs headlining.

Dead Kennedys played numerous shows at local venues afterwards. Due to the provocative name of the band, they sometimes played under pseudonyms, including "The DK's", "The Sharks", "The Creamsicles" and "The Pink Twinkies". The band's real name generated controversy. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Herb Caen]] wrote in November 1978, "Just when you think tastelessness has reached its [[nadir]], along comes a punk rock group called 'The Dead Kennedys', which will play at Mabuhay Gardens on Nov. 22, the 15th anniversary of [[John F. Kennedy's assassination]]." Despite mounting protests, the owner of Mabuhay declared, "I can't cancel them NOW—there's a contract. Not, apparently, the kind of contract some people have in mind."&lt;ref&gt;Caen, Herb (November 17, 1978) "On the Rotunda." ''San Francisco Chronicle.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite popular belief, the name was not meant to insult the Kennedy family, but according to Biafra, "to bring attention to the end of the American Dream".&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt;

6025 left the band in March 1979 under somewhat unclear circumstances, generally considered to be musical differences. In June, the band released their first single, "[[California Über Alles]]", on Biafra and East Bay Ray's [[independent label]], [[Alternative Tentacles]]. The band followed with a poorly attended [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] tour, being a new and fairly unknown band at the time, without a full album release.

===''Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables'' (1980–81)===
[[File:Dead-kennedys-live.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A live performance photo.]]
In early 1980, they recorded and released the single "[[Holiday in Cambodia]]". In June, the band recorded their debut album, ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]'', released in September of that year. The album reached number 33 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Pullmystrings.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Dead Kennedys at the Bay Area Music Awards]] --&gt;On March 25, 1980, Dead Kennedys were invited to perform at the [[Bay Area Music Awards]] in an effort to give the event some "new wave credibility", in the words of the organizers. The day of the performance was spent practicing the song they were asked to play, the underground hit "California Über Alles". The band became the talking point of the ceremony when after about 15 seconds into the song, Biafra stopped the band—in a manner reminiscent of [[Radio Radio#1977 Saturday Night Live appearance|Elvis Costello's ''Saturday Night Live'' appearance]]—and said, "Hold it! We've gotta prove that we're adults now. We're not a punk rock band, we're a [[New wave music|new wave]] band." The band, all wearing white shirts with a big, black S painted on the front, pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks to form a dollar sign, then started playing a new song titled "Pull My Strings", a barbed, [[Satire|satirical]] attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry, which contained the lyrics, "Is my cock big enough, is my brain small enough, for you to make me a star?". The song also referenced [[The Knack]]'s song "[[My Sharona]]". "Pull My Strings" was never recorded for a studio release, though the performance at the Bay Area Music Awards, which was the only time the song was ever performed, was released on the band's compilation album ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]''.

In January 1981, Ted announced that he wanted to leave to pursue a career in architecture and would help look for a replacement. He played his last concert in February 1981. His replacement was [[D.H. Peligro]] (Darren Henley). Around the same time, East Bay Ray had tried to pressure the rest of the band to sign to the major record label [[Polydor Records]]; Biafra stated that he was prepared to leave the group if the rest of the band wanted to sign to the label,&lt;ref name="polydor"&gt;Nardwuar the Human Serviette, December 2005 interview with Jello Biafra and The Melvins, as reproduced in [http://www.alternativetentacles.com/batcasts/batcast-013-2006_04_25.m4a Alternative Tentacles Batcast No.&amp;nbsp;15, April 25, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; though East Bay Ray asserts that he recommended against signing with Polydor. Polydor decided not to sign the band after they learned that Dead Kennedys' next single was to be entitled "[[Too Drunk to Fuck]]".

When "Too Drunk to Fuck" came out in May 1981, the song caused much controversy in the UK as the BBC feared the single would reach the Top 30; this would require a mention of the song on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. It was never played although it was called "'Too Drunk' by the Kennedys" by presenter [[Tony Blackburn]].

===''In God We Trust, Inc.'', ''Plastic Surgery Disasters'' and Alternative Tentacles Records (1981–85)===
After Peligro joined the band, the extended play ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' (1981) saw them move toward a more aggressive hardcore/thrash sound. In addition to the EP's controversial artwork depicting a gold Christ figure on a cross of dollar bills, the lyrics contained Biafra's most biting social and political commentary yet, and songs such as "[[Moral Majority]]", "[[Nazi Punks Fuck Off!]]" and "[[California Über Alles|We've Got a Bigger Problem Now]]" placed Dead Kennedys as the spokesmen of social protest, while "Dog Bite", a cover version of ''[[Rawhide (song)|Rawhide]]'' and various joke introductions showed a much more whimsical side. In 1982, they released their second studio album, ''[[Plastic Surgery Disasters]]''. The album's cover features a withered starving African child's hand being held and dwarfed by a white man's hand, a picture that had won the World Press Photo award in 1980, taken in Karamoja district in Uganda by Mike Wells.

The band's music had evolved considerably in a short time, moving away from hardcore formulae toward a more innovative jazz-informed style, featuring musicianship and dynamics far beyond other bands in the genre (thus effectively removing the music from that genre). By now the group had become a de facto political force, pitting itself against rising elements of American social and political life such as the religious right, Ronald Reagan and the idle rich. The band continued touring all over the United States, as well as Europe and Australia, and gained a large underground following. While they continued to play live shows during 1983 and 1984, they took a break from releasing new records to concentrate on the [[Alternative Tentacles]] record label, which would become synonymous with DIY alternative culture. The band continued to write and perform new material during this time, which would appear on their next album (some of these early performances can be seen in the ''[[DMPO's on Broadway]]'' video, originally released by [[Dirk Dirksen]] and later reissued on Rhino).

===''Frankenchrist'' and obscenity trial (1985–86)===
The release of the album ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' in 1985 showed the band had grown in musical proficiency and lyrical maturity. While there were still a number of loud/fast songs, much of the music featured an eclectic mix of instruments including trumpets and synthesizers. Around this time [[Klaus Flouride]] released the similarly experimental solo EP ''[[Cha Cha Cha With Mr. Flouride]]''. Lyrically, the band continued their trademark social commentary, with songs such as "MTV Get Off The Air" and "Jock-O-Rama (Invasion of the Beef Patrol)" poking fun at mainstream America.

However, the controversy that erupted over H.R. Giger's "[[Penis Landscape]]", included as an insert with the album, dwarfed the notoriety of its music. The artwork caused a furor with the newly formed [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC). In December 1985 a teenage girl purchased the album at the Wherehouse Records store in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref name=WishniaNation&gt;Wishnia, Steven. "Of Punk and Pornography: Rockin' With the First Amendment". ''The Nation''. October 24, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The girl's mother wrote letters of complaint to the [[California Attorney General]] and to Los Angeles [[prosecutors]].&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt; In 1986, members of the band, along with other parties involved in the distribution of ''Frankenchrist'', were charged criminally with distribution of harmful matter to minors. The store where the teen actually purchased the album was never named in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt; The criminal charges focused on an illustration by [[H.R. Giger]], titled "Work 219: Landscape XX" (also known as ''[[Penis Landscape]]''). Included as a poster with the album, ''Penis Landscape'' depicts nine copulating penises and vaginas.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu [http://deflem.blogspot.com/1993/08/rap-rock-and-censorship-1993.html "Rap, Rock and Censorship: Popular Culture and the Technologies of Justice"] March 2001 revision of a paper presented originally to the Law and Society Association, Chicago, May 30-27 30, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the band and others in the chain of distribution were charged with violating the California Penal Code&lt;ref name="penalcode"&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html California Penal Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714132609/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html |date=July 14, 2009 }} at leginfo.ca.gov&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[misdemeanor]] charge carrying a maximum penalty of up to a year in county jail and a base fine of up to $2,000. Biafra says that during this time government agents invaded and searched his home. The prosecution tried to present the poster to the jury in isolation for consideration as obscene material, but Judge Susan Isacoff ruled that the poster must be considered along with the music and lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metnews.com/articles/2004/reti052804.htm "Judge Isacoff, Commissioner Duffey Slate July Retirements"] ''Metropolitan News-Enterprise''. May 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The charges against three of the original defendants, Ruth Schwartz (owner of [[Mordam Records]]), Steve Boudreau (a distributor involved in supplying ''Frankenchrist'' to the Los Angeles Wherehouse store), and Salvatore Alberti (owner of the factory where the record was pressed), were dismissed for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt;

In August 1987, the case went to the jury with two remaining defendants: Jello Biafra and Michael Bonanno (former Alternative Tentacles label manager).&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt; However, the criminal trial ended with a hung jury, split 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal. [[District Attorney]]s Michael Guarino and Ira Riener made a motion for a retrial which was denied by Judge Isacoff, [[Superior Court]] Judge for the County of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Drozdowski, Ted. [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/2503/interview06.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:47:56 "Jello Biafra cuts to the politics of pop"]&lt;/ref&gt; The album, however, was banned from many record stores nationwide.

After the break up of the band, Jello Biafra brought up the court case on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. Biafra was on the show with [[Tipper Gore]] as part of a panel discussion on the issues of "controversial music lyrics" and censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=North-Eastern Punx|title=Jello Biafra The Oprah Winfrey Show|date=2017-05-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNoEWol1wbg|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bedtime for Democracy'' and break-up (1986)===
In addition to the obscenity lawsuit, the band became increasingly disillusioned with the underground scene as well. The hardcore scene, which had been a haven for free-thinking intellectuals and downtrodden nonconformists, was attracting a more violent audience that imposed an increasing level of brutality on other concertgoers and began to alienate many of the bands and individuals who had helped pioneer the movement in the early 1980s{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. In earlier years the band had criticized neo-Nazi skinheads for trying to ruin the punk scene, but just as big a problem was the popularity of increasingly macho hardcore bands, which brought the group (and their genre) an audience that had little to do with the ideas/ideals they stood for{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. In January 1986, frustrated and alienated from their own scene, Dead Kennedys decided to break up to pursue other interests and played their last concert on February 21. The band continued to work on songs, with Biafra penning songs such as "[[Bedtime for Democracy|Chickenshit Conformist]]" and "[[Bedtime for Democracy|Anarchy for Sale]]", which articulated their feelings about the "dumbing down" of punk rock.

During the summer they recorded these songs for their final album, ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', which was released in November. The artwork, depicting a defaced [[Statue of Liberty]] overrun with Nazis, media, opportunists, Klan members, corrupt government officials, and religious zombies, echoed the idea that neither America itself or the punk scene were safe havens any more for "your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free". The album contains a number of fast/short songs interspersed with jazz ("D.M.S.O."), spoken word ("A Commercial") and psychedelia ("Cesspools In Eden"). The lyrical focus is more introspective and earnest ("Where Do Ya Draw The Line?"), with an anti-war, anti-violence ("Rambozo The Clown") bend, moving away from the violent imagery of their early records, while remaining as subversive as ever ("I Spy", "D.M.S.O."). In December, the band announced their split. Biafra went on to speak about his political beliefs on numerous television shows and he released a number of [[spoken-word]] albums. Ray, Flouride, and Peligro also went on to solo careers.

===Reforming of new band line-up===
In 2001, Ray, Peligro, and Flouride reformed the Dead Kennedys, with former [[Dr. Know (band)|Dr. Know]] singer [[Brandon Cruz]] replacing Biafra on vocals. The band played under the name "DK Kennedys" for a few concerts, but later reverted to "Dead Kennedys" permanently. They played across the continental United States, Europe, Asia, South America, and Russia. Brandon Cruz left the band in May 2003 and was replaced by [[Jeff Penalty]]. The band has released two live albums of archival performances on Manifesto Records: ''[[Mutiny on the Bay]]'', compiled from various live shows including a recording from their last show with Biafra in 1986, and ''[[Live at the Deaf Club]]'', a recording of a 1979 performance at the Deaf Club in [[San Francisco]] which was greeted with more enthusiasm.

On October 9, 2007, a [[greatest hits album|best of album]] titled ''[[Milking the Sacred Cow]]'' was released. It includes two previously unreleased live versions of "Soup Is Good Food" and "Jock-O-Rama", originally found on ''Frankenchrist''.

Jeff Penalty left the band in March 2008 in what he describes as a "not amicable split."&lt;ref name=Penalty&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/28168 |title=Jeff Penalty leaves the Dead Kennedys |work=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement released, Jeff said that, following a series of disputes, the band had secretly recruited a new singer and played a gig in his neighbourhood, although he also stated he was "really proud of what we were able to accomplish with Dead Kennedys".&lt;ref name=Penalty/&gt; He was replaced by former [[Wynona Riders]] singer Ron "Skip" Greer. D.H. also left the band to "take some personal time off". He was replaced for a tour by [[Translator (band)|Translator]] drummer Dave Scheff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.html#032408 |title=Welcome To The Official Website For Dead Kennedys |publisher=Deadkennedys.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Break from touring===
On August 21, 2008, the band announced an extended break from touring due to the health-related issues of Flouride and Peligro. They stated their plans to collaborate on new projects. The band performed a gig in [[Santa Rosa, California]] in June 2009, with Peligro returning to the drum kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadkennedys.com/tours.html |title=Official Dead Kennedys web site |publisher=Deadkennedys.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Dead Kennedys announced plans for a short East Coast tour. The lineup assembled for this tour contained East Bay Ray, Peligro, Greer, and bassist Greg Reeves replacing Flouride, who was taking "personal time off" from the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.html#081110 |title=Official web page news section |publisher=Deadkennedys.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://serviette.ca/radio_show/2011/nw20110211.mp3 Nardwuar interview with Jello Biafra], February 11, 2011, accessed April 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The tour dates included performances in [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Portland, Maine]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/39114 |title=Dead Kennedy's 2010 tour |publisher=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has played a reworked version of their song "MTV Get Off the Air", re-titled "MP3 Get Off the Web", with lyrics criticizing music piracy during their October 16, 2010, concert at the Rock and Roll Hotel in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name="newmaterial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcheavymetal.com/2010/10/18/a-post-about-the-dead-kennedys |title=A Post About The Dead Kennedys |publisher=Dcheavymetal.com |date=October 18, 2010 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back on the road===
[[File:Dead Kennedys live in Chicago at Bottom Lounge on west Lake June 27, 2014 23-32 -01 (14530182562).jpg|thumb|Dead Kennedys at the [[Bottom Lounge]] in Chicago, June 2014]]
Dead Kennedys had world tours in 2013 and in 2014, the latter mostly in North American cities. In 2015 and 2016 they toured again, including South America, where they had not played since 2001.

In 2017, East Bay Ray revealed that the band and Jello Biafra had been approached by the Punk-oriented music festival [[Riot Fest]] about a potential reunion. While Ray and the rest of the band expressed interest in the concept, Biafra refused.

==Conflicts between members==
=== Royalties lawsuit ===
In the late 1990s, former band members discovered problems with the payment of royalties they had received from [[Alternative Tentacles]]. East Bay Ray, Klaus Flouride, and D. H. Peligro claimed that Jello Biafra had conspired to pay lower royalty rates. Although both sides agreed that the failure to pay these royalties was an accounting mistake, the other members were upset that Biafra failed to inform them of the mistake after he and his co-workers discovered it and additionally claimed he intended to use the money against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Biafra concealed from the other Decay Music partners an underpayment of royalties (totaling over $110,000, with interest) by ATR to Decay Music dating back to 1989.  When, in early 1998, ATR’s then-General Manager, Kristin Von Till, brought the underpayment directly to his attention, Biafra hid the indebtedness from his partners and embarked on a course intended to prevent them from learning or confirming that ATR owed Decay Music these monies. |url=http://www.deadkennedysnews.com/news082802_2.htm#f |title=Biafra’s Deception About Underpayment of Royalties. |accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A jury found Biafra and Alternative Tentacles "guilty of [[malice (legal term)|malice]], oppression and [[fraud]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/jello-biafra-gets-shot-down-by-dead-kennedys/|title=Jello Biafra Gets Shot Down By Dead Kennedys|date=June 19, 2003|work=blabbermouth.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malice was defined for the jury as "conduct which is intended to cause injury or despicable conduct which is carried with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights of others".&lt;ref name="bs1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=17130 |title=''Music Industry News Network'' |publisher=Mi2n.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra's appeal was denied; he had to pay the outstanding royalties and punitive damages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf Dead Kennedys v. Jello Biafra Verdict] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227000532/http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf |date=February 27, 2012 }}, Cal.App.1 Dist.,2003 A094272&lt;/ref&gt; and was forced to hand over the rights to the majority of Dead Kennedys' back catalogue to the Decay Music partnership. The jury and judges also noted, in their words, that Biafra "lacked credibility" on the songwriting issue and found from evidence presented by both sides that the songwriting credits were due to the entire band.&lt;ref&gt;FN4, [http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf Dead Kennedys v. Jello Biafra Verdict] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227000532/http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf |date=February 27, 2012 }}, Cal.App.1 Dist.,2003 A094272&lt;/ref&gt;

This dispute was hotly contested by all concerned who felt passionately for their cause, and the case caused minor waves within punk circles. Biafra claims that East Bay Ray had long expressed displeasure with Alternative Tentacles and with the amount of money he received from them, thus the original incentive for the discovery of the back payments. It was found out that Alternative Tentacles was paying Dead Kennedys less per CD than all the other bands, including Biafra himself, and not informing his other bandmates, which was the fraud. Biafra accused the band of wanting to license the famous Dead Kennedys song "[[Holiday in Cambodia]]" for use in a [[Levi's]] jeans commercial, which the band denied.&lt;ref name="morphizm.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morphizm.com/recommends/jello2.html |title="I'm Not an Ad Man:" Interview with Jello Biafra (con.) |publisher=Morphizm.com |date= |accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an instrumental loop from "Holiday in Cambodia" was part of the 1981 movie "Neighbors," but wasn't included on the soundtrack.

Biafra's former bandmates maintain that they sued because of Jello Biafra's deliberate withholding of money, though when pressed they have acknowledged that the payment was an accounting mistake, but insist that Biafra was wrong in failing to inform the band directly. Details about this issue remain scarce. The band also maintains that the Levi's story was completely fictitious and invented by Biafra to discredit them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/48637/interviews-jello-biafra |title=''Punk News Network Interviews: Jello Biafra'' |publisher=punknews.org |date=August 24, 2012 |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disputes over new commercial activities===

Matters were stirred up even further when the three bandmates invited Jello Biafra to "bury the hatchet" in the form of a band reunion. Jello Biafra felt it was unprofessional because no one contacted him directly. In addition, Biafra was disdainful of the reunion, and having long expressed his disdain for nostalgia and rock reunion/oldies tours in particular, argued that the whole affair was motivated by greed.&lt;ref name="morphizm.com"/&gt;

Several DVDs, re-issues, and live albums have been released since the departure of Biafra most recently on Manifesto Records. According to Biafra, the live albums are "cash-ins" on Dead Kennedys' name and his music. Biafra also accused the releases of the new live material of having poor sound quality. Furthermore he has stated he is not receiving any royalties from the sale of any Manifesto Records releases. Consequently, he has discouraged fans from buying any Dead Kennedy reissues. The other band members denied Biafra's accusations regarding the live releases, and have defended the mixes as an effort of hard work. Biafra dismissed the new group as "the world's greediest karaoke band." Nevertheless, in 2003, [[Klaus Flouride]] said of performances without the band's former frontman: "There hasn't been a show yet that people didn't really like."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizinemag.com/music/music-0309_klausflouride.htm "Interview with Dead Kennedys' Klaus Flouride"] by Mark Prindle, ''Citizine'', September 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Biafra further criticized them for advertising shows using his own image taken from the original 1980s incarnation of the band, which he labeled as false advertising. He attacked the reformed Dead Kennedys in a song called "[[Those Dumb Punk Kids (Will Buy Anything)]]", which appears on his second collaboration with sludge metal band the [[Melvins]], ''[[Sieg Howdy!]]''.

Biafra told an audience at a speaking gig in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New Jersey]], that the remaining Dead Kennedys have licensed their single "Too Drunk to Fuck" to be used in a rape scene in a [[Robert Rodriguez]] movie. The reference is to a lounge cover of the song, recorded by the band [[Nouvelle Vague (band)|Nouvelle Vague]], played during a scene in the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' segment of ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', although no rape takes place, and in fact the would-be rapist is killed by the would-be victim. The scene in ''Planet Terror'' has would-be rapist, "Rapist No.&amp;nbsp;1" ([[Quentin Tarantino]]) order one-legged stripper "Cherry Darlin" ([[Rose McGowan]]) to get up off the floor and dance. At this point Tarantino hits play on a cassette recorder and Nouvelle Vague's cover of "Too Drunk To Fuck" plays.

Jello, clearly disapproving of the situation, later wrote, "This is their lowest point since Levi's... This goes against everything the Dead Kennedys stands for in spades... The terrified woman later 'wins' by killing Tarantino, but that excuse does not rescue this at all. I wrote every note of that song and this is not what it was meant for.... Some people will do anything for money. I can't help but think back to how prudish Klaus Flouride was when he objected to H.R. Giger's painting on the "[[Frankenchrist]]" (sic) poster, saying he couldn't bear to show it to his parents. I'd sure love to be a fly on the wall when he tries to explain putting a song in a rape scene for money to his teenage daughter... The deal was pushed through by a new business manager the other three hired."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativetentacles.com/news.php?page=3&amp;news_section=JELLO&amp;window_size=15&amp;sd=iIdfyzSpZwkE0A3pVRu "Greedy ex-DKs okay song for rape scene in new Tarantino Movie"] Alternative Tentacles news page, March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reformed Dead Kennedys followed their court victory by releasing reissues of all Dead Kennedys albums (except ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]'', to which they did not have the rights until 2005), releasing several new archival concert DVDs, and licensing several songs to ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' remake and the [[Tony Hawk Pro Skater]] video game. [[East Bay Ray]] claims he received a fax from Alternative Tentacles purporting Biafra approved the licensing for the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadkennedysnews.com/images/tonyhawk.jpg Fax from Uli Elser], previous manager of Alternative Tentacles, May 5, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The band claims on their website that they still pay close attention to an [[anti-corporate]] ideology, despite performing on September 5, 2003 at a festival in Turkey that was sponsored by [[Coca-Cola]], noting that they have since pulled out of a show in Los Angeles when they found that it was being sponsored by [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.htm#100605 DKs Pull Out of "Waking the Dead" Show]" ''DeadKennedys.com''. October 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Biafra claims the above mentioned licensing deals prove otherwise. Some have found difficulty reconciling this claim when Biafra also licensed to major corporations, approving with the other band members use of Dead Kennedys’ songs in major studio film releases such as ''[[Neighbors (1981 film)|Neighbors]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'', and ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1389065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
[[File:Dead Kennedys (logo).jpg|thumb|right|70px|"DK" logo]]The original logo was created by [[Winston Smith (artist)|Winston Smith]]. He later contributed artwork for the covers of ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'', ''[[Plastic Surgery Disasters]]'', ''[[Frankenchrist]]'', ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]'', the back cover of the "[[Kill the Poor]]" single and the [[Alternative Tentacles]] logo. When asked about the "DK" logo in an interview, Jello Biafra explained, "...I wanted to make sure it was something simple and easy to spray-paint so people would graffiti it all over the place, and then I showed it to Winston Smith. He played around with it, came back with a bunch of designs that had the circle and slightly 3-D looking letters and he had ones with different patterns behind it. I liked the one with bricks, but ultimately I thought simple red behind it was the boldest and the best."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trembleunderboomlights.blogspot.com/2007/05/interview-with-jello-biafra.html |title=Tremble Under Boom Lights: Interview with Jello Biafra |publisher=Trembleunderboomlights.blogspot.com |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and lyrics==
Dead Kennedys have been described as a [[hardcore punk]] band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-kennedys-mn0000786613/biography |title=Dead Kennedys {{!}} Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dead Kennedys were noted for the harshness of their lyrics, which generally combined biting [[Satire#Juvenalian|Juvenalian]] social satire while expressing a staunchly left-wing view of contemporary America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.msn.com/music/artist/dead-kennedys.1/ |title=Dead Kennedys on MSN Music |publisher=Music.msn.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other leftist punk bands who use more direct sloganeering, Dead Kennedys' lyrics were often snide. For example, "[[Holiday in Cambodia]]" is a multi-layered satire targeting both yuppies and Cambodia's recently deposed [[Khmer Rouge]] regime.

'''Dhon Cholechā''' ([[Devanagari]]: धों चोलेचा) is a Nepalese folk tale about a little girl and an old nanny goat. It is the most well known children's story in [[Newar]] society of the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. It tells about a little girl named Punkhu Mainchā (पुन्खु मैंचा) and the ill treatment she suffers at the hands of her cruel step-mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.reocities.com/rajumaha/dabu/vol1no5/story.htm |title= The Story of Dhon Cholecha|publisher=Dabu|accessdate=16 July 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Folk tales of Nepal: First series|chapter=The Story of Dhon Cholecha|last=Vaidya|first=Karuna Kar |year=1961 |publisher=Himalayan Pioneer Pubs|url=https://books.google.com.np/books/about/Folk_tales_of_Nepal.html?id=5aLYAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhon Cholechā means "old nanny goat" in [[Nepal Bhasa]]. 

==The story==
===Punkhu Maincha===
There was a little girl named Punkhu Maincha whose mother died when she was very young. Her father remarried and a daughter was born. Punkhu Maincha's life became hard after that. Her step-mother was a cruel woman, she would make her do all the household chores and give her very little to eat. Punkhu Maincha also had to take their old nanny goat, Dhon Cholecha, out to graze.

===Dhon Cholecha===
Despite the hard work and bad food, Punkhu Maincha always looked healthy and well fed. So the step-mother told her daughter to spy on her elder sister when she took Dhon Cholecha to graze. The nanny goat knew what a hard life Punkhu Maincha led, and so loved her very much. When the two reached the grazing spot, the goat would vomit out a delicious meal for Punkhu Maincha, which was why she looked so well.

The step-sister reported to her mother what she had seen. The jealous woman made a plan to kill Dhon Cholecha so that Punkhu Maincha wouldn't get any more food. Punkhu Maincha was distressed when she learnt that her beloved Dhon Cholecha was going to be slaughtered for a family feast. The old nanny goat tried to console her, and instructed her to bury the bones in their garden. A fig tree would grow on the spot, and she could enjoy the fruits. 

===The demons===
Punkhu Maincha did not go to the feast pretending to be ill. Later, she collected the bones and buried them in the garden. A fig tree grew there as Dhon Cholecha had said. One day, as she was sitting on a branch eating the tree's fruits, two [[Lakhey]]s (demons) disguised as an old couple came and asked her to throw them down some fruits. She did so, but the demons said they landed on dirt, and asked her to pick some more and come down herself.      

When Punkhu Maincha got down from the tree, they carried her off to their home. There the demons told Punkhu Maincha to prepare [[flatbread]]s for dinner while they went to wash up. 

===The mouse===
As she was cooking flatbreads, a mouse scurried out of a hole and said, "If you want to hear something, give me a flatbread." So Punkhu Maincha gave the mouse a flatbread. It reappeared and said the same thing. And she gave it another one. The mouse came for the third time, and she gave it another one. 

Then the mouse said, "These people are really Lakheys, and they are preparing to eat you. Pack up as much gold, silver, gems and other treasures as you can, and run away. Before you go, spit on each step of the staircase, and also leave a piece of charcoal on each one."

The demons returned and knocked on the door and called, but each time the glob of spit and the piece of charcoal replied "Yes" and "Okay". Finally, the demons forced their way in, and found that she had gone. Punkhu Maincha reached home with the treasures, and told her astounded family all that had happened. The greedy step-mother decided to send her daughter too to get more riches.

===The impatient daughter===
So the daughter sat on the tree and the demons came as expected. They took her home and told her to prepare flatbreads while they went to wash up. When the mouse came repeatedly asking for a flatbread, she became irritated and touched it with a red hot shovel, sending it running back into its hole. Since the mouse didn't tell her anything, she had no idea what was going to happen. The demons returned and the three ate flatbreads and went to bed, with the girl sleeping in the middle. 

When she was fast asleep, the male demon cut away a piece of her flesh with his knife. When she cried in pain, the female demon said, "Did grandfather pinch you?" and caressed her. A little later, she cut away a piece of her flesh too. The male demon then said, "Did grandmother pinch you? Come, lie next to me." This went on until only her bones were left.

The next day, the step-mother was combing her hair as she waited expectantly for her daughter to return with gold and silver. A crow perched on the roof and kept saying, "The mother is beautifying herself while the daughter is a skeleton." Wondering what the crow was trying to say, she went up to the roof and looked into the distance. She saw her daughter's bones kept out to dry in the demon's house. Then she beat her breast and cried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.reocities.com/rajumaha/dabu/vol1no5/story.htm |title= The Story of Dhon Cholecha|publisher=Dabu|accessdate=16 July 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Kansakar, Prem Bahadur (1966).

The '''Eagle, Globe, and Anchor''' is the official emblem and insignia of the [[United States Marine Corps]]. It is commonly referred to as an '''EGA''', although this verbiage is officially discouraged by the U.S. Marine Corps.&lt;ref name=EGA_Leatherneck&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-10

Before that time many devices, ornaments, ribbons, and distinguishing marks followed one another as official badges of the corps.

==History==
{{double image|left|Old EGA.png|150|USMC oldEGA button.jpg|150|Early insignia, seen today on modern uniform buttons|}}
[[File:Marine Hat Pin.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[American Civil War]] era insignia]]

In 1776, the device consisted of a [[Foul (nautical)|fouled]] [[anchor]] (tangled in its rope) of [[silver]] or [[pewter]]. Changes were made in 1798, 1821, and 1824. In 1834, it was prescribed that a [[brass]] eagle be worn on the cover, the eagle to measure {{convert|3.5|in|mm}} from wingtip to wingtip. An eagle clutching a fouled anchor with thirteen six-pointed [[Star (heraldry)|stars]] above was used on uniform buttons starting in 1804.&lt;ref name="RevMarines"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Charles Richard|author2=Waterhouse, Charles H.|authorlink2=Charles Waterhouse (artist)|title=A Pictoral History: the Marines in the Revolution|publisher=United States Marine Corps Historical Division|year=1975|url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/A%20Pictorial%20History-The%20Marines%20in%20the%20Revolution%20PCN%2019000317900.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815002251/http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/A%20Pictorial%20History-The%20Marines%20in%20the%20Revolution%20PCN%2019000317900.pdf|archivedate=2008-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same insignia is used today on the buttons of [[Uniforms of the United States Marine Corps|Marine dress and service uniforms]], with the six-pointed stars changed to five-pointed stars.&lt;ref name="RevMarines"/&gt;

During the early years numerous distinguishing marks were prescribed, including "black cockades", "scarlet plumes", and "yellow bands and tassels". In 1859, the first version of the present color scheme for the officer's dress uniform insignia appeared on an elaborate device of solid white metal and yellow metal. The design included a United States shield, half wreath, a [[bugle]], and the letter "M."

In 1868, the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]], Brigadier General [[Jacob Zeilin]], appointed a board "to decide and report upon the various devices of cap ornaments of the Marine Corps." On November 13, 1868, the board recommended the modern insignia. It was approved by the commandant four days later, and by the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] on November 19, 1868.

==Design and symbolism==
{{double image|right|Officer EGA.png|100|Enlisted GlobeAnchor.jpg|100|Eagle, Globe, and Anchor for the dress uniform: officer (''left'') &amp; enlisted (''right'')}}
[[File:EGA on USMC MCCUU eight-point cover, 2002.png|thumb|left|Eagle, Globe, and Anchor embroidered on an MCCUU cover in June 2002]]

The emblem recommended by the 1868 board consisted of a ''globe'' (showing the continents of the [[Western Hemisphere]]) intersected by a ''fouled anchor'', and surmounted by a ''spread eagle''. On the emblem itself, there is a ribbon, clasped in the eagle's beak, bearing the [[Latin]] motto "''[[Semper fidelis|Semper Fidelis]]''" ({{lang-en|Always Faithful}}). The uniform insignias omit the motto ribbon.

The general design of the emblem was probably derived from the Royal Marines' "Globe and Laurel."&lt;ref name=EGA_tecom&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-09-01 
|url=http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Customes_Traditions/Emblem_Seal.htm
|title=Customs and Traditions: Marine Corps Emblem and Seal
|publisher=History Division, United States Marine Corps}}&lt;/ref&gt; The globe on the U.S. Marine emblem signifies the Corps' readiness to service in any part of the world. The eagle represents the United States. The anchor, which dates back to the founding of the corps in 1775, acknowledges the naval tradition of the Marines and their continual service within the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].

There are some differences between the uniform insignia for enlisted marines and that of officers: 
The enlisted Marines' dress blue uniform insignia is die-struck from a single sheet of brass and annodized a gold color.  The service uniform insignia is coated a flat black color.

The officers' insignia is assembled from four parts: a die-struck silver colored globe with eagle, and gold colored anchor with silver colored fouling rope, and gold colored continents.

==Current emblem and seal==
[[File:USMC logo.svg|thumb|left|150px|United States Marine Corps seal]]

In 1954, the Commandant, General [[Lemuel C. Shepherd]], Jr., requested the design of an official seal for the corps. 

The new seal included the traditional Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem in gold, with the Globe and anchor rope in silver. The eagle is depicted with wings displayed, standing upon the western hemisphere of the terrestrial globe, and holding in his beak a white ribbon bearing the Marine Corps motto "''Semper Fidelis''" (Always Faithful) with the hemisphere superimposed on a fouled anchor. An American [[bald eagle]] replaced the [[crested eagle]] depicted on the 1868 emblem.

The emblem is displayed on a scarlet background encircled with a blue band bearing the phrases "Department of the Navy" above and "United States Marine Corps" below in white letters, the whole edged in a gold rope 

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] approved the design on June 22, 1954. The emblem as shown on the seal was adopted in 1955 as the official Marine Corps emblem.

The emblem of the US Marine Corps became an inspiration of the marine corps insignia of Thailand and South Korea. The [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps]] (ROKMC) and [[Royal Thai Marine Corps]] (RTMC) uses an insignia patterned after the emblem of the USMC.

The emblem of ROKMC consist of a golden star superimposed into the fouled anchor. The eagle appeared similarly to that of the USMC's.

Whereas, the insignia of RTMC appears almost similarly to that of the USMC, with the exception of the golden [[Emblem of Thailand|Garuda]] above the globe, and the silhouette map of Thailand.

      <comment>Suggestions for simplification, avoiding redundancy. Expertization is often done by individual experts, not just committees. Future tense isn't necessary when describing procedures. An "other mark" isn't really an alternative to a "mark". Cheers!</comment>

[[File:Stamp Certificate.JPG|thumb|Expertization certificate issued in 2004 for a 1915 Russian 10 [[ruble]] [[postage stamp]].]]
'''Expertization''' is the process of [[authentication]] of an object, usually of a sort that is [[collecting|collected]], by an individual [[expert|authority]] or a committee of authorities. The expert, or expert committee, examines the collectible and issues a certificate typically including:

* A statement of:
** Whether or not the item is authentic
** Identification of any damage to the item
** Identification of any repairs to the item
** Identification of any forgery or faked parts of the item
* A photo of the item

Some experts apply a mark or signature to the item attesting its genuineness.

Expertization is particularly common with valuable [[philatelic]] items, some of which are so often forged that they may be unsaleable without it.

'''Hanns Eisler''' (6 July 1898 &amp;ndash; 6 September 1962) was an Austrian composer (his father was Austrian, and Eisler fought in a Hungarian regiment in [[World War I]]).&lt;ref name="Eisler_entry_OeML_online" /&gt; He is best known for composing the [[Auferstanden aus Ruinen|national anthem]] of [[East Germany]], for his long artistic association with [[Bertolt Brecht]], and for the scores he wrote for films. The [[Hochschule für Musik "Hanns Eisler"]] is named after him.

==Family background==
Johannes Eisler was born in [[Leipzig]] in [[Saxony]], the son of [[Rudolf Eisler]], a professor of philosophy, and Marie Ida Fischer.{{sfn|Betz|1982|p=311}} His father was Jewish and his mother was Lutheran.&lt;ref name="Levi-Erik_1998-08" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LV0eAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Hanns+Eisler%22+LUTHERAN+mother | title = The men in the Trojan horse | author1 = Singer | first1 = Kurt D | year = 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, the family moved to [[Vienna]]. His brother, [[Gerhart Eisler|Gerhart]], was a Communist journalist,&lt;ref name="NYT_1949-05-22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeMag_1947-02-17" /&gt; and his sister, [[Ruth Fischer|Elfriede]], was a leader of the German Communist Party in the mid-1920s. After emigrating to America, she turned into an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], writing books against her former political affiliation, and even testifying against her brothers before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].

At age 14 Eisler joined a socialist youth group.&lt;ref name=jacobin&gt;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/10/hanns-eisler-communist-composer-artist-brecht&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and Bertolt Brecht==
[[File:Hanns Eisler 1917.jpg|thumb|Eisler in uniform, 1917.]] 
During the [[World War I|Great War]], Hanns Eisler served as a front-line soldier in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army and was wounded several times in combat. Returning to Vienna after Austria's defeat, he studied from 1919 to 1923 under [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Eisler was the first of Schoenberg's disciples to compose in the [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] or [[Serialism|serial]] technique. He married [[Charlotte Demant]] in 1920; they separated in 1934. In 1925, he moved to Berlin&amp;mdash;then a hothouse of experimentation in music, theater, film, art and politics. There he became an active supporter of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] and became involved with the [[November Group (German)|November Group]]. In 1928, he taught at the Marxist Workers' School in Berlin and his son [[Georg Eisler]], who would grow up to become an important painter, was born. His music became increasingly oriented towards political themes and, to Schoenberg's dismay, more "popular" in style with influences drawn from [[jazz]] and [[cabaret]]. At the same time, he drew close to [[Bertolt Brecht]], whose own turn towards [[Marxism]] happened at about the same time. The collaboration between the two artists lasted for the rest of Brecht's life.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht Betz. Hanns Eisler: Political Musician (1982, Cambridge University Press), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Eisler composed the song cycle ''Zeitungsausschnitte'', Op. 11. The work is dedicated to Margot Hinnenberg-Lefebre.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Hanns. ''Zeitungsausschnitte.'' Hackensack, NJ: Boonin, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not written in the twelve-tone technique, it was perhaps the forerunner of a musical art style later known as "News Items" (or perhaps better characterized as "news clippings") – musical compositions that parodied a newspaper's content and style, or that included lyrics lifted directly from newspapers, leaflets, magazines or other written media of the day. The cycle parodies a newspaper's layout and content, with the songs comprising it given titles similar to headlines. Its content reflects Eisler's socialist leanings, with lyrics memorializing the struggles of ordinary Germans subject to post–World War I hardships.&lt;ref name=TT&gt;Thomas, H. Todd. ''News Items: An Exploratory Study of Journalism in Music''. Abilene, Texas: 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisler wrote music for several Brecht plays, including ''[[The Decision (play)|The Decision (Die Maßnahme)]]'' (1930), ''[[The Mother (Brecht play)|The Mother]]'' (1932) and ''[[Schweik in the Second World War]]'' (1957). They also collaborated on protest songs that celebrated, and contributed to, the political turmoil of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] in the early 1930s. Their ''[[Solidarity Song]]'' became a popular militant anthem sung in street protests and public meetings throughout Europe, and their ''Ballad of Paragraph 218'' was the world's first song protesting laws against abortion. Brecht-Eisler songs of this period tended to look at life from "below"&amp;mdash;from the perspective of prostitutes, hustlers, the unemployed and the working poor. In 1931–32 he collaborated with Brecht and director [[Slatan Dudow]] on the working-class film ''[[Kuhle Wampe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht Betz. Hanns Eisler: Political Musician (1982, Cambridge University Press), pp. 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In exile==
After 1933, Eisler's music and Brecht's poetry were banned by the [[Nazi Party]]. Both artists went into exile. While Brecht settled in [[Svendborg]], Denmark, Eisler traveled for a number of years, working in Prague, Vienna, Paris, London, Moscow, Spain, Mexico and Denmark. He made two visits to the US, with speaking tours from coast to coast.

In 1938, Eisler finally managed to emigrate to the United States with a permanent visa. In New York City, he taught composition at [[The New School|New School for Social Research]] and wrote experimental chamber and documentary music. In 1942, he moved to Los Angeles where he joined Brecht, who had arrived in California in 1941 after a long trip eastward from Denmark across the Soviet Union and the Pacific Ocean.

In the U.S., Eisler composed music for various documentary films and for eight Hollywood film scores, two of which &amp;mdash; ''[[Hangmen Also Die!]]'' and ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (film)|None but the Lonely Heart]]'' &amp;mdash; were nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscars]] in 1944 and 1945 respectively.&lt;ref name="OscarNominee1944" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OscarNominee1945" /&gt; Also working on ''Hangmen Also Die!'' was Bertolt Brecht, who wrote the story along with director [[Fritz Lang]]. From 1927 to the end of his life, Eisler wrote the music for 40 films, making film music the largest part of his compositions after vocal music for chorus and/or solo voices.

On 1 February 1940, he began work on the "Research Program on the Relation between Music and Films" funded by a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], which he got with the help of film director [[Joseph Losey]] and The New School. This work resulted in the book ''Composing for the Films'' which was published in 1947, with [[Theodor W. Adorno]] as co-author.

In several chamber and choral compositions of this period, Eisler returned to the twelve-tone method he had abandoned in Berlin. His ''Fourteen Ways of Describing the Rain'' &amp;mdash; composed for [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s 70th birthday celebration &amp;mdash; is considered a masterpiece of the genre. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Eisler's works of the 1930s and 1940s included ''Deutsche Sinfonie'' (1935–57)&amp;mdash;a choral symphony in eleven movements based on poems by Brecht and [[Ignazio Silone]]&lt;ref name="Pistiak2009" /&gt;&amp;mdash;and a cycle of art songs published as the ''Hollywood Songbook'' (1938–43). With lyrics by Brecht, [[Eduard Mörike]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], it established Eisler's reputation as one of the 20th century's great composers of German [[lied]]er.

==The HUAC investigation==
Eisler's promising career in the U.S. was interrupted by the [[Cold War]]. He was one of the first artists placed on the [[Hollywood blacklist]] by the [[film studio]] bosses. In two interrogations by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]],&lt;ref name="Andrew-Lang-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schebera_USA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HUAC_official" /&gt; the composer was accused of being "the Karl Marx of music" and the chief Soviet agent in Hollywood. Among his accusers was his sister [[Ruth Fischer]], who also testified before the Committee that her other brother, Gerhart, was a Communist agent. The Communist press denounced her as a "German Trotskyite."{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Among the works that Eisler composed for the Communist Party was the "Comintern March", including the words "The Comintern calls you / Raise high the Soviet banner / In steeled ranks to battle / Raise sickle and hammer." {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===His supporters===
Eisler's supporters&amp;mdash;including his friend [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the composers [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Aaron Copland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=McCarthy Hearings |url=http://www.gpo.gov/congress/senate/mccarthy/83870.html |work=McCarthy Hearings 1953–54 Vol. 2 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611165521/http://www.gpo.gov/congress/senate/mccarthy/83870.html |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Bernstein]]&amp;mdash;organized benefit concerts to raise money for his defense fund, but he was deported early in 1948. Folksinger [[Woody Guthrie]] protested the composer's deportation in his lyrics for "Eisler on the Go"&amp;mdash;recorded fifty years later by [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Wilco]] on the ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' album (1998). In the song, an introspective Guthrie asked himself what he would do if called to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities: "I don't know what I'll do / I don't know what I'll do / Eisler's on the come and go / and I don't know what I'll do."&lt;ref name="Guthry_Eisler_lyrics" /&gt;

===On departing from the U.S.===
On 26 March 1948, Eisler and his wife, Lou, departed from [[LaGuardia Airport]] and flew to [[Prague]]. Before he left, he read the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I leave this country not without bitterness and infuriation. I could well understand it when in 1933 the Hitler bandits put a price on my head and drove me out. They were the evil of the period; I was proud at being driven out. But I feel heartbroken over being driven out of this beautiful country in this ridiculous way.&lt;ref&gt;http://eislermusic.com/depart.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In East Germany==
Eisler returned to Austria, and later moved to [[East Berlin]]. Back in Germany, he composed the [[Auferstanden aus Ruinen|national anthem]] of the [[German Democratic Republic]], a cycle of [[cabaret]]-style songs to satirical poems by [[Kurt Tucholsky]] and incidental music for theater, films, television and party celebrations.

His most ambitious project of the period was the opera ''Johannes Faustus'' on the [[Faust]] theme. The libretto, written by Eisler himself, was published in the fall of 1952. It portrayed Faust as an indecisive man who betrayed the cause of the [[working class]] by not joining the [[German Peasants' War]]. In May 1953, Eisler's [[libretto]] was attacked by a major article in [[Neues Deutschland]], the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] organ,&lt;ref name="ND_1953-05-14" /&gt; which disapproved of the negative depiction of Faust as a renegade and accused the work of being "a slap in the face of German national feeling" and of having "formalistically deformed one of the greatest works of our German poet Goethe" (Ulbricht). Eisler's opera project was discussed in three of the bi-weekly meetings "Mittwochsgesellschaft" [Wednesday club] of a circle of intellectuals under the auspices of the [[Berlin Academy of Arts]] beginning on 13 May 1953. The last of these meetings took place on Wednesday, 10 June 1953.&lt;ref name="Bunge1991_01" /&gt;

[[File:Grab Hanns-u-Steffy-Eisler Blumen-fuer-Hanns-Eisler 50ster-Todestag LWS1029.JPG|thumb|Grave of Eisler and his third wife Steffy, as photographed on the 50th anniversary of his death. His grave is one of 800 [[Ehrengrab|graves of honor]] maintained by the authorities.]]
A week later, the workers' rebellion of 17 June 1953 pushed those debates from the agenda. Eisler fell into a depressive mood, and did not write the music for the opera. In his last work, "Ernste Gesänge" (Serious Songs), written between spring 1961 and August 1962, Eisler attempted to work through his depression, taking up the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] with its demise of the Stalin cult, as a sign of hope for a future enabling to "live without fear". Although he continued to work as a composer and to teach at the [[Hochschule für Musik "Hanns Eisler"|East Berlin conservatory]], the gap between Eisler and the cultural functionaries of East Germany grew wider in the last decade of his life. During this period, he befriended musician [[Wolf Biermann]] and tried to promote him&lt;ref name="Biermann-interview" /&gt; (but in 1976, Biermann would be stripped of his GDR citizenship while on concert tour in West Germany).

Eisler collaborated with Brecht until the latter's death in 1956. He never recovered completely from his friend's demise, and his remaining years were marred by depression and declining health. He died of a heart attack (his second)&lt;ref name="Jackson-Margaret_2003" /&gt; in East Berlin, and is buried near Brecht in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]].

|quote=Eisler is part of the most precious legacy which they must appropriate. And if I can contribute something to that, by telling people here (in America) about Eisler – from my very limited perspective, of course – then it's a good thing and I'm happy about it. Ja.

[[File:Hawes-craven-iln.jpg|thumb|right|Hawes Craven]]
'''Henry Hawes Craven Green''' (3 July 1837 – 22 July 1910) was an English theatre scene-painter.  He collaborated with [[Henry Irving]], [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] and [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], producing stage sets of unprecedented realism.  Craven's career lasted from 1853 to 1905, spanning the end of the era of gas lighting in theatres and the beginning of electrical lighting; he developed new techniques to co-ordinate the appearance of theatre settings during the transition from gas to electricity.  He was regarded as the finest scene-painter of his day and was the last major scenic designer in the ultra-realistic tradition.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Craven was born in [[Leeds]], the son of theatrical parents.  His father, James Green (d. 1881), was a comedian and [[pantomime|pantomimist]], who had previously been an innkeeper. His mother, Elizabeth, ''née'' Craven (1802 or 1803–1866), was an actress, who left the stage, and published several volumes of prose and verse.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32617 "Craven, Hawes (1837–1910)"]. Archive version of ODNB article (dated 1912), ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 22 July 2010. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed with his father as a youth, shortening his name to Hawes Craven.  However, his aptitude for painting led him to apply for a place at the Government School of Design at [[Marlborough House]], London.  He studied there from 1851 to 1853, winning many prizes.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Ingram, Raymond (rev). [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32617 "Craven, Hawes (1837–1910)"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 22 July 2010. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; On leaving, he was a taken on as an apprentice by John Gray, scene-painter of the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, London.  When Gray moved to the [[Olympic Theatre]], Craven moved with him.  In 1857 he had his first success, when Gray was ill and Craven did the work on a set depicting the Eddystone lighthouse for [[Wilkie Collins]]'s ''The Lighthouse''.  He worked from a painting by a well-known seascape artist, [[Clarkson Stanfield]], with such fidelity that Stanfield presented him with the original painting.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In the late 1850s and early 1860s, Craven worked at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] on pantomimes, and at the [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]] on operas.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His first post as chief scene-painter was at the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin]], from 1862 to 1864.  In London, during the rest of the 1860s, Craven was an assistant at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]], Olympic and [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi]] theatres.  In June 1866 he married a dancer, Mary Elizabeth Watson Tees (1838–1891). There were three sons and three daughters of the marriage.

===Lyceum and Savoy theatres===
[[File:Harker-ivanhoe.jpg|right|thumb|Craven's scenery for ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', 1891]]
In 1871 Craven became principal scene-painter at the Lyceum Theatre, a role he held for the next thirty years, first as an employee and later as a freelance artist.  At first he worked under the management of H. L. Bateman, and then Bateman's widow.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; Despite early success with his scenery for the melodrama ''The Bells'', in which [[Henry Irving]] made his name, Craven's opportunities were restricted until Irving became lessee and manager of the Lyceum in 1878.  Craven, with Irving's support, carried scenic realism and stage illusion to new levels. 

For some productions, Irving commissioned designs from well-known painters, which Craven would then re-create as scenery.  These artists included [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].  For other productions, Craven created the original designs as well as executing them.  For his scenes in Irving's 1888 production of ''Faust'', he visited [[Nuremberg]] and the [[Harz mountains]] "with admirable results."&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; Irving became well known for his Shakespeare productions, for which Craven painted strongly naturalistic scenery, which won critical applause and occasionally threatened to outshine the performers.  His productions included ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1874 and 1878), ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1879), ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1882), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1888), ''[[Henry VIII (play)|King Henry VIII]]'' (1892), ''[[King Lear]]'' (1892), ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (1895), and ''[[Coriolanus]]'' (1902).&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=mg/&gt; By the mid-1880s, Craven was recognised as among the élite of his art.  The theatrical newspaper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' wrote, "In the art of scene painting England stands paramount. Neither Paris, not Germany, nor New York can commence to approach, let alone rival, the work of the men who furnish London with its stage scenery. Such men as  … Hawes Craven … are artists in the truest and best sense of the word."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 1 September 1888, p. 13. The article named [[William Roxby Beverly|W. R. Beverley]], William Telbin, Walter Hann, T. E. Ryan, Stafford Hall, and William Horford alongside Craven&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivanhoe-prog.jpg|left|thumb|Programme crediting Craven's sets for ''Ivanhoe'']]
For [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], Craven painted the scenery for seven of the [[Savoy opera]]s.  Carte's new theatre, the [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]], built in 1881, was lit by electricity, unlike the Lyceum, which remained gas-lit for some years.  Craven adjusted his techniques to match the stronger light produced by electric bulbs.  For the Savoy, Craven painted scenery for ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884),&lt;ref&gt;Act II only: see Rollins and Witts, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), a revival of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1887), ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1890) and ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. vii–viii&lt;/ref&gt; Settings for these works ranged from a mediaeval Hungarian castle to a Japanese garden, the interior of a picture gallery, a Royal Naval ship modelled on [[H.M.S. Victory]], the [[Tower of London]], the [[Piazza San Marco#Description of the Piazzetta|Piazzetta]] in Venice, and a South Sea island.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, unnumbered photographic pages&lt;/ref&gt; Also for Carte, Craven designed and painted scenery for [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 7 February 1891, p. 11.  Craven provided the sets for the three scenes of Act II (The Forest, and two interiors in the Castle of Torquilstone). Carte's elaborate production also featured sets by J. Harker (Act I) and Ryan and Telbin (Act III).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Hawes-craven.jpg|thumb|right|1894 cartoons of Craven]]
The pinnacle of theatrical realism was reached, with Craven's help, by [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]].  Craven painted sets for stagings that famously included live rabbits running about in the forest scenes of ''[[As You Like It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gielgud, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Craven's last substantial work was the scenery for [[Arthur Bourchier]]'s revival of  ''The Merchant of Venice'' at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in October 1905.  In the same year he was elected president of the Scenic Artists' Association.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Craven was the last great practitioner of stage realism.  In its obituary notice, ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' wrote, "The most gifted scene-painters of the coming generation will probably try to suggest more and state less, to give symbols rather than imitations of nature."&lt;ref name=mg/&gt;

Craven died of bronchitis at his home in south London on 22 July 1910, at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Obituary tributes in the newspapers declared him to have been "the greatest of English scene-painters, and perhaps the finest scene-painter who has ever lived" (''The Manchester Guardian''),&lt;ref name=mg&gt;Obituary, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 27 July 1910, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; whose "scenes were real pictures, with the atmosphere and charm of fine paintings" (''[[Evening Standard|The Standard]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard'', 27 July 1910, ''quoted'' in the ODNB.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josef Herman''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|RA}} (3 January 1911 &amp;ndash; 19 February 2000), was a highly regarded [[Poles|Polish]]-British [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] [[Painting|painter]] who influenced [[contemporary art]], particularly in the United Kingdom. His work often depicted workers as it subject and was inherently political. He was among more than a generation of eastern European Jewish artists who emigrated to escape persecution and worked abroad. For eleven years he lived in [[South Wales]].

==Early life and education==
Herman was born in [[Warsaw]] into a [[Jewish]] family, on 3 January 1911.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/josef-herman/|title=BBC - Wales  - Arts - Josef Herman  - Josef Herman|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/josef-herman-1276 |title=Josef Herman 1911–2000|accessdate=27 May 2015|website=Tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Zachęta|Warsaw School of Art]] for two years before working briefly as a [[graphic artist]].

==Career==
In 1938 at the age of 27, Herman left [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] for [[Brussels]] to escape [[anti-Semitism]].  He was introduced to many of the prominent artists then working in the city.  After the beginning of [[World War II]] and the [[Germany|German]] invasion of [[Belgium]], he escaped to [[France]] and then to Great Britain. 

He first lived in [[Glasgow]], where he met fellow artist [[Jankel Adler]] and between 1940 and 1943 he contributed to a remarkable wartime artistic renaissance in the city.&lt;ref name=benuri/&gt; He then moved to [[London]], where he met numerous other European émigrés, such as the Hungarian [[Michael Peto]], with whom he became friends. When Peto decided to go into [[photography]] after the war, Herman encouraged him in his new endeavor and supported his progress as a photojournalist. In 1942 Herman learned through the [[Red Cross]] that his entire family had perished in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].&lt;ref name=benuri/&gt; 

In 1943 he held his first London exhibition with [[L. S. Lowry]].&lt;ref name=benuri/&gt; Herman's own style was bold and distinctive, involving strong shapes with minimal detail. He continued to work up to his death in 2000.

Herman studied working people as the subjects of his art, including [[grape]] pickers, [[fishermen]] and, most notably, coal [[miners]]. The latter became a particular interest for Herman during the eleven years that he lived in [[Ystradgynlais]], a mining community in [[South Wales]], beginning in 1944.&lt;ref name=biog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://josefhermanfoundation.org/about/josef-herman/|title=Josef Herman - Josef Herman Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welshartsarchive.org.uk/heman_article.htm Sonia Williams&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Welsh Arts Archive&lt;/ref&gt; He became part of the community, where he was fondly nicknamed "Joe Bach".&lt;ref name=Swansea&gt;[http://www.swanseaheritage.net/article/gat.asp?ARTICLE_ID=1826  "Miners, 1951 - Josef Herman"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927183356/http://www.swanseaheritage.net/article/gat.asp?ARTICLE_ID=1826 |date=2011-09-27 }}, Swansea Heritage.net, accessed 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Among his creative collaborators and friends in Wales was the artist [[Will Roberts]], who lived in [[Neath]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cy/5/?article_id=2 "Will Roberts RCA Memorial Exhibition - A National Library of Wales touring exhibition"], National Museum Wales, 2001, accessed 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When commissioned in 1951 to paint a [[mural]] for the [[Festival of Britain]], Herman took coal miners as his subject. His work ''Miners'' (1951) showed six men resting above ground after their work.  Herman said, "I think it is one of my key pictures and the most important one I did in Wales."&lt;ref name=Swansea /&gt;  The mural is held in the permanent collection of the [[Glynn Vivian Art Gallery]], affiliated with the [[Swansea Museum]].

Some of Herman's work was collected by the [[Gwendoline Davies|Davies]] sisters, British art patrons and collectors in Wales, as part of their 20th-century holdings.  They bequeathed their joint collection of 260 works, particularly strong in [[Impressionist]] and [[post-Impressionist]] paintings and sculptures, to the [[National Museum Wales]] in the mid-20th century, greatly expanding its range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/106/ Art: "Davies Sisters Collection"], National Museum Wales, accessed 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving Wales in 1955 because his health was affected by the damp climate, Herman lived briefly in Spain and then in London.&lt;ref name=Swansea /&gt; All the same, he won the [[Gold Medal (National Eisteddfod of Wales)|Gold Medal for Fine Art]] at the 1962 [[Welsh National Eisteddfod|Wales National Eisteddfod]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Chamberlain (26 July 2011) [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/archbishop_of_canterbury_to_present_eisteddfod_art_award "Archbishop of Canterbury to present Eisteddfod art award"], ''BBC Wales'' (blog), accessed 20 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 he moved to Suffolk with his partner, Nini Ettlinger, whom he married in 1961. The tragic death of their young daughter prompted them to move away and from 1972 Herman lived in the house in West London where he died in February 2000.{{cn|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref name=benuri&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benuri.org.uk/collection/josef-herman-1911-2000/|title=Josef Herman (1911-2000) - Ben Uri Gallery &amp; Museum|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Herman was awarded an [[OBE]] for services to British Art and was elected to the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1990. He died in February 2000.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
*2004, the Josef Herman Foundation was established in Ystradgynlais, to honor the artist and his legacy, and encourage study of his work, as well as arts initiatives in South Wales.&lt;ref name=Swansea /&gt;
*2010, Michael Waters' play, ''The Secret of Belonging'', about Josef Herman and his years in Ystradgynlais, was produced by the [[National Theatre Wales]].  The play included a contemporary folk-influenced score by Swansea musician and composer Andy Jones, and it was performed by the Antic Theatre. They first performed at [[Swansea]], then took the play on a tour of South Wales during April/May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.nationaltheatrewales.org/events/the-secret-of-belonging-by "The Secret of Belonging"], ''Community'', National Theatre Wales, accessed 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro Kashū''''' (柿本朝臣人麿歌集, "Collection of Poems/Songs by [[Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro]]") or '''''Hitomaro Kashū''''' (人麿歌集) is a [[lost work|lost]] collection of ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poems that served as a source for the compilers of the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''. There is some disagreement among scholars as to which poems included in the surviving ''Man'yōshū'' originally came from the ''Hitomaro Kashū'', but it is between 364 and 370. Scholars have speculated on the nature of the original ''Hitomaro Kashū'' based on the surviving fragmentary and disjointed evidence.

== Authorship, compiler, date and structure ==
The compiler of the ''Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro Kashū'',{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=684}} (hereafter the ''Hitomaro Kashū''{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}}) as well as its date{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=684}} and number of books are all unknown.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=684}} While the text itself does not survive,{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}} scholars have been able to guess as to the form the work probably took based on the portions of the late eighth-century ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' that incorporate a large number of its poems.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}} Poems attributed to it were incorporated into books 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the later anthology.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1pp=684-685}}

== Contents ==
Depending on whether the ''Man'yōshū'' poems numbered 146 (book 2), 1715, 1716, 1717, 1718 and 1718 (all book 9) were originally taken from the ''Hitomaro Kashū'', the number of poems varies from 364 to 370.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}} {{illm|Mizue Aso|ja|阿蘇瑞枝}}, in her article on the work for the ''[[Nihon Koten Bungaku Daijiten]]'', gave the figure of 365.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}} These consist of two ''[[chōka]]'', 35 ''[[sedōka]]'', and 328 ''[[tanka]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}} (All the disputed poems are ''tanka'', so this figure would vary between 327 and 333.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=685}}) [[Susumu Nakanishi]], in his ''[[Man'yōshū Jiten]]'', gave a figure of 369.{{sfnm|1a1=Nakanishi|1y=1985|1p=221}}

=== Script format of ''tanka'' ===
The ''tanka'' attributed by the compiler(s) of the ''Man'yōshū'' to the ''Hitomaro Kashū'' are divided into two categories based on how distinctly particles and auxiliary words are represented therein.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=585}} The poems that carefully indicate these words are called ''hi-ryakutai-ka'' (非略体歌),{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=585}} and those that do not are called''ryakutai-ka'' (略体歌).{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=585}} Roughly 127 poems fall into the former group, with roughly 196 in the latter,{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=585}} though opinions on which poems are which group differ between various scholars.{{sfnm|1a1=Aso|1y=1983|1p=585}}

===Original cast notes===
Anne Rodgers took part in several workshops for the part of Grandma, but for unknown reasons eventually turned down the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3640223/All-singing-all-dancing-all-smoking.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=All-singing, all-dancing, all-smoking | first=Catherine | last=Shoard | date=11 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then offered to [[Ann Emery]], who previously auditioned, and performed it until 2014. On a similar note, [[Jackie Clune]] originally took part in a few workshops for Mrs Wilkinson, but became pregnant before casting was finalised. A few years later she was offered the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://london.broadway.com/tag/id/3000454/BillyElliot |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427201039/http://london.broadway.com/tag/id/3000454/BillyElliot |archivedate=27 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of finding the three Billy's  took many months.&lt;ref&gt;West End Programme - Featured Article by Jessica Ronane (Children's Casting Director)&lt;/ref&gt;

(The "final show" dates for the four boys in the show at the end of the original London production are the dates of the "normal" show where their time in the show was celebrated. In the case of Brodie, it was the matinee on the last day, which went ahead as a "normal" show, prior to the magnificent "tag-team" extravaganza in the evening.)

'''Made-to-measure''' (MTM) typically refers to custom clothing that is cut and sewn using a standard-sized base pattern. [[Suit (clothing)|Suits]] and [[sport coat]]s are the most common garments made-to-measure. The fit of a made-to-measure garment is expected to be superior to that of a [[ready-to-wear]] garment because  made-to-measure garments are constructed to fit each customer individually based on a few body measurements to customize the pre-existing pattern. 
Made-to-measure garments always involve some form of [[standardization]] in the pattern and manufacturing, whereas [[bespoke tailoring]] is  entirely made from scratch based on a customer's specifications with far more attention to minute fit details and using multiple fittings during the construction process. 
All else being equal, a made-to-measure garment will be more expensive than a ready-to-wear garment but cheaper than a bespoke one. "Custom made" most often refers to MTM. [[Country of origin]] makes a difference in pricing, with [[made in China]] MTM garments typically priced below [[made in Italy]] ready-to-wear.

== Overview ==
To order a made-to-measure garment, the customer's measurements are first taken by a made-to-measure retailer. Then a base pattern is selected that most closely corresponds with the customer’s measurements. This base pattern is altered to match the customer’s measurements. The garment is constructed from this altered pattern.

The primary benefits to the customer of made-to-measure clothing are that the garments will be well-fitted to the customer's body and the customer may have the opportunity to customize the fabric and detailing. The primary disadvantage of made-to-measure is that the customer must wait up to several weeks for the garment to be sewn and delivered. A typical price markup for a made-to-measure item is 15% over the price of its ready-to-wear counterpart.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Made-to-measure retailers often travel internationally meeting clients in cities, providing samples of the latest materials and styles.

Unlike [[bespoke tailoring|bespoke]] garments, which traditionally involves hand sewing, made-to-measure manufacturers use both machine- and hand-sewing. Made-to-measure also requires fewer fittings than bespoke, resulting in a shorter wait between customer measurement and garment delivery.

Made-to-measure is sometimes also referred to as personal [[tailoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae6e1c54-df24-11db-b5c9-000b5df10621.html|title=Just how personal can you get|last=Brooke|first=Simon|date=March 31, 2007|work=Financial Times|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years tailoring has evolved further with young companies like Artefact London, that make a blend of made-to-measure and bespoke approaches. A base pattern is used to gauge your measurements and your unique pattern is created electronically with all alterations accounted for prior to cutting. Thus alleviating the need for baste fitting that is mandatory in bespoke with very minor alterations (if any) needed at the fitting.

== Advertising Standards Authority ruling ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the legal definition of “made-to-measure” has been conflated with [[bespoke tailoring]] by a ruling of the  [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_44555.htm |title=Sartoriani London |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122150946/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_44555.htm |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling is based on the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] definition of bespoke as "made to order".  While this ruling clarified the difference between bespoke and ready-to-wear, it had the effect of blurring the line between bespoke and made-to-measure.

The ruling established that a "made-to-measure suit would be cut, usually by machine, from an existing pattern, and adjusted according to the customer's measurements," while "a bespoke suit would be fully hand-made and the pattern cut from scratch, with an intermediary baste stage which involved a first fitting so that adjustments could be made to a half-made suit." The ruling concluded, however, that a "majority of people... would not expect that bespoke suit to be fully hand-made with the pattern cut from scratch," effectively equalizing the terms bespoke and made-to-measure.

While etymologist Michael Quinion observed that by definition "it was legitimate for a tailor offering clothes cut and sewn by machine to refer to them as bespoke, provided that they were made to the customer's measurements",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bes4.htm |title= bespoke|accessdate=2008-10-09 |publisher=Michael Quinion |date= September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the traditional use of bespoke inside the tailoring community has been more nuanced than the Oxford definition,&lt;ref name="Sim"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Manufacturing clause''' is a [[clause]]{{where|date=June 2017}} specifically stating that all [[Copying|copies]] of a work must be [[printed]] or otherwise produced domestically, even if the [[copyright]] was held by a foreigner.  This was a feature of the [[International Copyright Act of 1891]], covering [[books]], [[map]]s, [[photographs]], and [[lithographs]].  Its extension to all other media was proposed in the 1897 [[Treloar Copyright Bill]], which failed in committee.  The manufacturing clause did not expire until 1986, keeping the [[United States]] out of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] until 1989.

'''''Medea''''' is an [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys|Frederick Sandys]] which was created in 1868. The painting was submitted to the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] for display in the Summer Exhibition of 1868 but it was rejected – most likely for internal politics and jealousies rather than artistic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was accepted the following year and reviewed very favourably by ''The Times'', which commented pointedly on its previous failure to win a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Times|date=1 May 1869|page=12 "...If such a picture could be classed among the "doubtfuls" who can hereafter treat that fate as a verdict of inferiority?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Medea'' was modelled on Keomi Gray, a [[Romani people|Romani]] woman whom Sandys had met in [[Norwich]], England, and taken back to London to sit for many of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandys.norfolk.gov.uk/fsbiog3.htm Sandys' Love Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724014806/http://www.sandys.norfolk.gov.uk/fsbiog3.htm |date=2011-07-24 }} in ''Frederick Sandys &amp; the Pre-Raphaelites'' at the Norfolk Museums and Archaeology service.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a contemporary critic it shows the enchantress [[Medea]] "...in the act of incantation, the baleful light of her chafing-dish playing in the folds of her robe, and making the pale cheeks look paler, and the ashy lips more ashy, and kindling the array of foul ingredients and witch's properties that surround her tripod - foul toads and strange roots, and images of strange gods, and quaint shells filled with evil compounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Times|date=1 May 1869|page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 the picture was among paintings representative of the best British art sent to Italy for the [[International Exhibition of Art (1911)|international exhibition]] at Rome held in honour of the jubilee of the Kingdom of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Times|date=20 March 1911|page=7|title=British Art for the Rome Exhibition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nef''' is an extravagant table ornament and container used in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], made of [[precious metal]]s in the shape of a ship – ''nef'' was another word for a [[carrack]] in French.  If not just used for decoration, it could hold [[salt]] or [[spice]]s (the latter being very expensive in the Middle Ages), or [[cutlery]], or even [[napkin]]s. The large nef depicted in the well-known calendar miniature for January from the ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'' is being used to hold, and perhaps wash, gilt dishes from the table service.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 2006, p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Nefs are recorded in France as early as 1239,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown 1978, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; initially consisting of just the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], and perhaps initially used to drink from; by the 14th century the most elaborate had masts, sails and even crew, and had become too crowded with such details to be used as containers for anything. The so-called [[Mechanical Galleon]] in the [[British Museum]] is a late 16th-century German nef which was also a clock and [[automaton]], with moving figures and music.

A nef was usually made of [[silver]], [[silver-gilt]] or [[gold]], often further embellished with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[Gemstone|jewel]]s.  A [[nautilus shell]] often formed the hull of the ship, as in the [[Burghley Nef]] (illustrated). Some nefs had wheels to allow them to be rolled from one end of the table to the other, but most had legs or pedestals.  The nef was placed in front of the most important person at table as a mark of their status.

The equivalent in religious plate is a ''navicula'', Latin for small ship, and also a term in English for a boat-shaped [[incense]]-holder.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Navicula. 3"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15361">[[Image:Defend equality poster.png|thumb|An example protesting [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]].]]
'''Protest art''' is a broad term that refers to creative works that concern or are produced by [[activists]] and [[social movements]].  There are also contemporary and historical works and currents of thought that can be characterized in this way.

Social movements produce such works as the signs, banners, posters, and other printed materials used to convey a particular cause or message.  Often, such art is used as part of demonstrations or acts of [[civil disobedience]].  These works tend to be ephemeral, characterized by their portability and disposability, and are frequently not authored or owned by any one person.  The various [[peace symbols]], and the [[raised fist]] are two examples that highlight the democratic ownership of these signs.

Protest art also includes (but is not limited to) performance, site-specific installations, graffiti and street art, and crosses the boundaries of art genres, media, and disciplines.
While some protest art is associated with trained and professional artists, an extensive knowledge of art is not required to take part in protest art.  Protest artists frequently bypass the art-world institutions and commercial gallery system in an attempt to reach a wider audience.  Furthermore, protest art is not limited to one region or country, but is rather a method that is used around the world. 

There are many politically charged pieces of [[fine art]] — such as [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', some of [[Norman Carlberg]]'s [[Vietnam war]]-era work, or [[Susan Crile]]'s images of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]].

==History==
It is difficult to establish a history for protest art because many variations of it can be found throughout history. While many cases of protest art can be found during the early 1900s, like Picasso's Guernica in 1937, the last thirty years{{When|date=February 2011}} has experienced a large increase in the number of artists adopting protest art as a style to relay a message to the public.

[[Image:WarProtestSign.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A piece of protest art featuring a [[parody]] of the logo of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].]]
As awareness of social justices around the world became more common among the public, an increase in protest art can be seen. Some of the most critically effective artworks of the recent period{{When|date=February 2011}} were staged outside the gallery, away from the museum and in that sense, protest art has found a different relationship to the public.

==Activist art==
Activist art represents and includes aesthetic, sociopolitical, and technological developments that have attempted to challenge and complicate the traditional boundaries and hierarchies of culture as represented by those in power.  Like protest art, activist art practice emerged partly out of a call for art to be connected to a wider audience, and to open up spaces where the marginalized and disenfranchised can be seen and heard.

Activist art incorporates the use of public space to address socio-political issues and to encourage community and public participation as a means of bringing about social change.  It aims to affect social change by engaging in active processes of representation that work to foster participation in dialogue, raise consciousness, and empower individuals and communities.  The need to ensure the continued impact of a work by sustaining the public participation process it initiated is also a challenge for many activist artists.  It often requires the artist to establish relationships within the communities where projects take place.

If social movements are understood as “repeated public displays” of alternative political and cultural values,&lt;ref&gt;Reed, T.V., The art of protest : culture and activism from the civil rights movement to the streets of Seattle.  (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005) xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; then activist art is significant in articulating such alternative views.  Activist art is also important to the dimension of culture and an understanding of its importance alongside political, economical, and social forces in movements and acts of social change.  One should be wary of conflating activist art with political art, as doing so obscures critical differences in methodology, strategy, and activist goals.

===Historical basis in art and politics===
Activist art cites its origins from a particular artistic and political climate.  In the art world, performance art of the late 1960s to the 70s worked to broaden aesthetic boundaries within [[visual arts]] and traditional [[theatre]], blurring the rigidly construed distinction between the two.  The transient, interdisciplinary, and hybrid nature of performance art allowed for audience engagement.  The openness and immediacy of the medium invited public participation, and the nature of the artistic medium was a hub for media attention.

Emerging forms of [[feminism]] and feminist art of the time was particularly influential to activist art.  The idea that “the personal is the political,” that is, the notion that personal revelation through art can be a political tool,&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Lacy, ed.  Mapping the Terrain: New Genre Public Art.  (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 27&lt;/ref&gt; guided much activist art in its study of the public dimensions to private experience.  The strategies deployed by feminist artists parallel those by artists working in activist art.  Such strategies often involved “collaboration, dialogue, a constant questioning of aesthetic and social assumptions, and a new respect for audience” and are used to articulate and negotiate issues of self-representation, empowerment, and community identity.

[[Conceptual Art]] sought to expand aesthetic boundaries in its critique of notions of the art object and the commodity system within which it is circulated as currency.  Conceptual artists experimented with unconventional materials and processes of art production.  Grounded by strategies rooted in the real world, projects in conceptual art demanded viewer participation and were exhibited outside of the traditional and exclusive space of the art gallery, thus making the work accessible to the public.  Similarly, collaborative methods of execution and expertise drawn from outside the art world are often employed in activist art so as to attain its goals for community and public participation.  Parallel to the emphasis on ideas that conceptual art endorsed, activist art is process-oriented, seeking to expose embedded power relationships through its process of creation.

In the political sphere, the militancy and identity politics of the period fostered the conditions out of which activist art arose.

===Strategy and practice===
In practice, activist art may often take the form of temporal interventions, such as performance, media events, exhibitions, and installations.  It is also common to employ mainstream media techniques (through the use of billboards, posters, advertising, newspaper inserts…etc.).  By making use of these commercial distributive channels of commerce, this technique is particularly effective in conveying messages that reveal and subvert its usual intentions.

The use public participation as a strategy of activating individuals and communities to become a “catalyst for change” is important to activist art.  In this context, participation becomes an act of self-expression or self-representation by the entire community.  Creative expression empowers individuals by creating a space in which their voices can be heard and in which they can engage in a dialogue with one another, and with the issues in which they have a personal stake.

The Artist and Homeless Collaborative is an example of a project that works with strategies of public participation as a means of individual and community empowerment.  It is an affiliation of artists, arts professionals and women, children and teenagers living in NYC shelters, the A &amp; HC believe that their work in a collaborative project of art-making offers the residents a “positive experience of self-motivation and helps them regain what the shelter system and circumstances of lives destroy: a sense of individual identity and confidence in human interaction.”&lt;ref&gt;Wolper,Andrea. ''Making Art, Reclaiming Live: The Artist and Homeless Collaborative''. (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; The process of engaging the community in a dialogue with dominant and public discourses about the issue of homelessness is described in a statement by its founder, Hope Sandrow: “The relevancy of art to a community is exhibited in artworks where the homeless speak directly to the public and in discussion that consider the relationship art has to their lives.  The practice of creating art stimulates those living in shelters from a state of malaise to active participation in the artistic process”&lt;ref&gt;Wolper,Andrea. ''Making Art, Reclaiming Live: The Artist and Homeless Collaborative''. (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 253&lt;/ref&gt;

The A &amp; HC came into being at a time when a critique of the makers, sellers, and consumers of art that addressed social concerns became increasingly pronounced.  Critics argued that the very works of art whose purpose was to provoke political, social and cultural conversation were confined within the exclusive and privileged space of galleries museums, and private collections.  By contrast, the A &amp; HC was an attempt to bridge the gap between art production and social action, thus allowing for  the work subjects that were previously excluded and silenced to be heard.

==Resistance art==
Resistance art is art used as a way of showing their opposition to powerholders.  This includes art that opposed such powers as the German Nazi party, as well as that opposed to [[apartheid in South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/18799/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311083452/http://library.thinkquest.org/18799/ |archivedate=2012-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willie Bester]] is one of South Africa's most well known artists who originally began as a resistance artist.  Using materials assembled from garbage, Bester builds up surfaces into relief and then paints the surface with oil paint.  His works commented on important black South African figures and aspects important to his community.  South African resistance artists do not exclusively deal with race nor do they have to be from the townships.  Another artist, Jane Alexander, has dealt with the atrocities of apartheid from a white perspective.  Her resistance art deals with the unhealthy society that continues in post-apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Williamson, Resistance Art in South Africa (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The [[Center for the Study of Political Graphics]] archive currently contains more than 85,000 posters and has the largest collection of post-World War II social justice posters in the United States and the second largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sheff, Harry. "The Center for the Study of Political Graphics". Utne Reader. Retrieved 4 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many university libraries have extensive collections including the Joseph A. Labadie Collection at University of Michigan documents the history of social protest movements and marginalized political communities from the 19th century to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48420">'''Protestant views on [[contraception]]''' are markedly more pluralistic than the views expressed by the [[Magisterium]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], due to historical divergences of theological thought that began during the [[Protestant Reformation]], including the rejection of an infallible doctrinal authority other than Scripture. The doctrine of Protestantism from the Reformation until 1930 strongly condemned contraception. Since the 1930 Seventh Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Communion, major Protestant denominations shifted their doctrine to accepting contraception. 
In general, most liberal Protestants and Anglicans hold relatively settled views that accept use of contraception, while debate is ongoing among conservative Evangelicals, especially as to which types are and are not acceptable. Others, such as [[Laestadian Lutheran|Laestadian Lutheran Church]]es do not permit the use of birth control.&lt;ref name="Kivisto2014"/&gt;

==Denominational positions==

===Anglicanism===
[[The Church of England]] has stated in the 1958 Lambeth Conference that the responsibility for deciding upon the number and frequency of children was laid by God upon the consciences of parents 'in such ways as are acceptable to husband and wife'.&lt;ref name="anglican"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/socialpublic/smte.html#contraception|title=Statements on Science, Medicine, Technology &amp; Environment|accessdate=2006-10-01|publisher=The Church of England|year=2005|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810021928/http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/socialpublic/smte.html#contraception &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheranism===
The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] allows for contraception in the event the potential parents do not intend to care for a child.&lt;ref&gt;''When a woman and man join their bodies sexually, both should be prepared to provide for a child, should conception occur. When that is not their intention, the responsible use of safe, effective contraceptives is expected of the male and the female.''{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/faithfuljourney/pdf/study01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Journey Together Faithfully: ELCA Studies on Sexuality, Part One |accessdate=2006-10-01 |publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929001942/http://www.elca.org/faithfuljourney/pdf/study01.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Lutheran churches or synods take other positions, or do not take any position at all. For example, in 1990 the [[Lutheran Churches of the Reformation]] passed a resolution titled "Procreation" stating that birth control, in all forms, is sin, although they "allow for exegetical differences and exceptional cases (casuistry)", for example, when the woman's life is at risk.&lt;ref&gt;See http://lutheransandcontraception.blogspot.com/2006/01/gods-word-and-procreation.html .

The LCR also notes, &lt;blockquote&gt;Such was the united teaching of [[Martin Luther|Dr. Martin Luther]] and the "Old [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|Missouri]]" fathers ([[C. F. W. Walther|C.F.W. Walther]], [[Franz Pieper|F. Pieper]], A.L. Graebner, C.M. Zorn, W.H.T. Dau, J.T. Mueller, W. Dallman, F. Bente, E.W.A. Koehler, L. Fuerbringer, T. Engelder, Th. Laetsch, G. Luecke, [[Walter A. Maier|W.A. Maier]], M.J. Naumann, et al.) and LCR leaders such as P.E. Kretzmann and W.H. McLaughlin.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Likewise, the Hausvater Project (not an LCR organization) states,&lt;blockquote&gt;We therefore find ourselves sympathetic to the long-standing consensus of Lutheran church fathers from the Reformation through the mid twentieth century that neither abortion, abortifacient birth control, nor barrier contraception should be practiced.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodism===
The [[United Methodist Church]], holds that "each couple has the right and the duty prayerfully and responsibly to control conception according to their circumstances."  Its Resolution on Responsible Parenthood states that in order to "support the sacred dimensions of personhood, all possible efforts should be made by parents and the community to ensure that each child enters the world with a healthy body, and is born into an environment conducive to realization of his or her potential." To this end, the United Methodist Church supports "adequate public funding and increased participation in family planning services by public and private agencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc-gbcs.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=fsJNK0PKJrH&amp;b=848309&amp;content_id=%7BD78C069C-1151-4E3C-8840-B707FC4B96EF%7D&amp;notoc=1|title=Responsible Parenthood |publisher=The United Methodist General Board of Church and Society|accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcrc.org/calltojustice/perspectives_pharmacy.php |title=Perspectives: Pharmacy Refusals - A New Threat to Women's Health |publisher=Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice |accessdate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007160017/http://www.rcrc.org/calltojustice/perspectives_pharmacy.php |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Methodist Church of Great Britain]] also supports responsible use of birth control, welcoming its use as a means "towards fulfilment in marriage, the spacing of children, and the need to avoid pregnancy altogether, for example for medical reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Views of the Church: Abortion and Contraception|url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/who-we-are/views-of-the-church/abortion-and-contraception|publisher=The Methodist Church in Britain|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presbyterianism===
[[Presbyterian Church (USA)|The Presbyterian Church (USA)]] supports “full and equal access to contraceptive methods.” In a recent resolution endorsing insurance coverage for contraceptives, the church affirmed that “contraceptive services are part of basic health care” and cautioned that “unintended pregnancies lead to higher rates of infant mortality, low birth weight, and maternal morbidity, and threaten the economic viability of families.”&lt;ref name="Perspectives: Pharmacy Refusals - A New Threat to Women's Health."&gt;Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. 2006. ''Religious Support For Family Planning'' (retrieved 16 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mennonites===
The [[Mennonite Church USA]], the [[General Conference Mennonite Church]], and the [[Conservative Mennonite Conference]] have adopted statements indicating approval of modern methods of contraception. For example, while also teaching and encouraging love and acceptance of children, the Conservative Mennonite Conference maintains, "The prevention of pregnancy when feasible by birth control with pre-fertilization methods is acceptable."&lt;ref name="mennobeliefs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmcrosedale.org/about/beliefs.shtml |title=What We Believe |accessdate=2006-10-01 |publisher=Conservative Mennonite Conference |year=1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927033751/http://www.cmcrosedale.org/about/beliefs.shtml |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 1975 found that only 11% of Mennonites believed use of birth control was "always wrong".&lt;ref name="mennonite" /&gt;  Old Colony Mennonites, like the [[Amish]], do not officially allow birth control practices.

===Amish===
All types of birth control, including forms of [[natural family planning]] such as [[calendar-based methods]], are forbidden in Old Order [[Amish]] communities.&lt;!--

==History==
Before the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] viewed [[procreation]] as the primary purpose of [[sexual intercourse]] and unity of spouses.  As part of the Reformation, Reformers began to more strongly emphasize the unitive pleasures of marriage.&lt;ref name="rich_vincent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theocentric.com/relationships/parenting/responsible_family_planning.html |title=Responsible Family Planning: The Legitimacy of Contraceptive Use for Christian Couples |accessdate=2006-10-01 |year=2005 |author=Rich Vincent |work=TheoCenTric |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130200513/http://www.theocentric.com/relationships/parenting/responsible_family_planning.html |archivedate=2006-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, all major early [[Protestant Reformers]], and indeed Protestants in general until the twentieth century, condemned birth control as a contravention of God's procreative purpose for marriage.&lt;ref name="flann"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Campbell, Flann| title=Birth Control and the Christian Churches| journal=Population Studies| date=Nov 1960| volume= 14| issue= 2| pages=131–147| doi=10.2307/2172010 | publisher=Population Investigation Committee | jstor=2172010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Carlson, Allan| title=Children of the Reformation| journal=Touchstone|date=May 2007| volume= 20| issue= 4| url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=20-04-020-f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As scientists advanced birth control methods during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some Protestants continued to reject them, while other [[Nonconformists]] welcomed these advances. ([[Moncure Conway]] preached on the subject at [[South Place Chapel]] in London.)&lt;ref name="flann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="malthusian"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Untitled| journal=The Malthusian|date=June 1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conway"&gt;{{cite book|title=Liberty and Morality: A Discourse given at the [[South Place Chapel]], Finsbury| last=Conway| first=Moncure D.| year=1878| publisher=Freethought Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the dissent, the editor of a Nonconformist weekly journal in the United States wrote in 1893,&lt;blockquote&gt;''There was a time when any idea of voluntary limitation was regarded by pious people as interfering with Providence. We are beyond that now and have become capable of recognizing that Providence works through the commonsense of individual brains. We limit population just as much by deferring marriage for prudential reasons as by any action that may be taken after it.''&lt;ref name="flann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nonconform"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Editorial entitled 'A Marriage Problem'| journal=The Christian World Weekly| year=1893| volume=June 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Christian denomination|Non-Catholic denominations]] were slow to officially go along with such a view, although followers were not as reluctant.

===1930 Seventh Lambeth Conference shift===

Then in 1930, at the [[Lambeth Conference#Seventh Conference (1930)|Seventh Lambeth Conference]], the [[Anglican Communion]], after years of considerable internal debate, issued the first statement permitting birth control "when there is a clearly felt moral obligation to limit or avoid parenthood and where there is a morally sound reason for avoiding complete abstinence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noroomforcontraception.com/Resources/Contraception-Lambeth.htm No Room For Contraception] ''Lambeth Conferences of the Anglican Church''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Allan Carlson recounts how this affected the other Protestants:

:There was an immediate American Protestant echo. In 1931, the Committee on Home and Marriage of the Federal Council of Churches (an ecumenical body that embraced Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregational, and Church of the Brethren denominations) issued a statement defending family limitation and urging the repeal of laws prohibiting contraceptive education and sales...In the late 1940′s, a leading LCMS [Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod ] professor of theology, Alfred Rehwinckel, said that Luther had simply been wrong: the Genesis phrase, “Be fruitful and multiply,” was merely a blessing, not a command. Such views spread at a still more rapid pace among the Protestant “mainline” churches. Held near the end of the post World War II “baby boom,” when American family life for a brief period again seemed somewhat healthy, the 1961 North American Conference on Church and Family of the National Council of Churches (successor to the FCC) can only be called extraordinary....Not a single speaker spoke in the spirit of the old Protestant pronatalist ethic. Indeed, this ethic now stood as the chief enemy. The conference endorsed development of a new evangelical sexual ethic, one “relevant to our culture,” sensitive to the overpopulation crisis, and grounded in modern science. Member denominations soon complied. In a 1970 Report, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) rejected the old “taboos and prohibitions” and gave its blessing to “mass contraceptive techniques,” homosexuality, and low-cost abortion on demand. The same year, the Lutheran Church in America fully embraced contraception and abortion as responsible choices. And in 1977, the United Church of Christ celebrated the terms “freedom,” “sensuousness,” and “androgyny,” and declared free access to contraception and abortion as matters of justice.&lt;ref&gt;http://bound4life.com/history-of-contraception-in-the-protestant-church/&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005 acceptance had increased such that a [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] poll conducted online among 2,242 U.S. adults found that 88% of non-Catholic Christians who identified as either "very religious" or [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] supported the use of birth control/contraceptives.&lt;ref&gt;Harris_poll&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestants Reformers’ views vs. modern Protestant views===
Highly conservative Protestants such as [[Mary Pride]], [[Charles D. Provan]], Hess and Hess, and Rachel Scott, argue that Protestants should not have moved away from traditional Protestant views of contraception such as given by [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]]. Such modern authors contrast the views of early Reformers who rejected contraception with modern Christians who accept it, and point to primarily [[feminist]], [[secular]], or [[Satan]]ic influences as causative to the change.&lt;ref name="mary_pride"/&gt;&lt;ref name="provan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Charles D. Provan.jpg|thumb|100px|left| '''[[Charles D. Provan]]''''s ''The Bible and Birth Control'' is frequently cited by [[Quiverfull]] adherents, who eschew all forms of birth control.]] --&gt;
Provan in his ''The Bible and Birth Control'' extensively quotes early Protestant views of birth control, which Provan uses to conclude,&lt;blockquote&gt;''If Martin Luther were alive today, would he not disapprove of many Christians who view children as a bad thing, and so practice birth control to prevent God from sending more blessings to them? ... Truly Scriptural principles do not change at all: therefore Christians should willingly receive the blessings which God has for us, and not try to prevent them.''&lt;ref name="provan"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reformed scholars such as [[James B. Jordan]], however, maintain that Provan's view has the effect of adding a law to the Bible it does not contain. Jordan states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Jesus repeatedly denounced the Pharisees for their additions to the Law of God. Thus, we must be extremely careful about what laws we lay down for people. Does the Bible clearly state that contraception is sinful, or that people are obligated to have as many children as possible? If the Bible does not say these things, we need to fear God and be frightened of adding to His Word.&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jordan argues also that the views of early Protestant Reformers on contraception are unreliable because they were heavily influenced by not just the Bible but [[Neo-Platonic]] [[mysticism]] ([[Asceticism|otherworldliness]]) and [[Aristotle|Aristolean]] [[teleologism]] (measuring all things only by their result), philosophies they inherited from their Catholic predecessors such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]]. Bart Garrett describes it, "They operated in a time and context that unhealthily looked at sex as a base, physical pleasure that carried with it spiritual detriments."&lt;ref name="IIIM"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bart Garrett| title=Christians and Contraception: Convenience or Kingdom Thinking?| journal=IIIM Magazine| year=2001| volume=3| issue=25| url=http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/bar_garrett/PT.Garrett.Contraception.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan further points to the Reformers' unreliability based upon their rejection of [[Song of Solomon]] as a description of passionate sexual expression within marriage. He also cites [[technophobia]] among Protestants, as evident by their rejection of things ranging from buttons to airplanes ("if God meant for man to fly he would have given him wings"). As well, Jordan points to what he describes as the Reformers' own mantra, "reformed and always reforming" (''ecclesia reformata est semper reformanda''), as evidence that Protestants should not crystallize their position on the matter at some point in the past, and says that rejecting contraceptives based upon their correlative rise alongside feminism exhibits the [[genetic fallacy]].&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt;

==Ongoing debates==
There are numerous ongoing debates at core of Protestant differences concerning contraceptives. These include whether contraceptive use or non-use is a matter of individual conscience or binding Biblical commands, what types of birth control are permissible if any, and the amount of weight modern Protestants should give early Protestant Reformers' views on contraception.

===Individual conscience or commandment?===
The [[majority]] of Protestants, irrespective of [[Christian denomination|denomination]], maintain that use or non-use of birth control in its various methods is a matter of [[conscience]] for individual Christians before God, and that individual couples should be convinced in their own minds of what is and is not permissible for them particularly (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2014;&amp;version=49; Romans 14]). In this view, God has a [[Priesthood of all believers|personal relationship]] with individual Christians and, because he has given no [[Argument from silence|explicit Biblical commandment]] against birth control and uses [[Common grace|and has even caused and overseen]] modern [[Technology|technological advancements]] (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2012:4;&amp;version=49; Daniel 12:4]), he guides particular couples' birth control practices in accordance with his particular will for their lives. Conservative evangelical leader [[John F. MacArthur]] states the view,

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Nothing in Scripture prohibits married couples from practicing birth control, either for a limited time to delay childbearing, or permanently when they have borne children and determine that their family is complete ... In our viewpoint, birth control is biblically permissible. At the same time, couples should not practice birth control if it violates their consciences (Romans 14:23)—not because birth control is inherently sinful, but because it is always wrong to violate the conscience. The answer to a wrongly informed conscience is not to violate it, but rather to correct and rightly inform one's conscience with biblical truth.''&lt;ref name="macarthur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/resources.php?section=issues&amp;aid=176403|title=What does the Bible teach about birth control?|accessdate=2006-10-12|publisher=Grace to You|year=2005|author=John F.

[[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]], the ninth president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] states,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Evangelical couples may, at times, choose to use contraceptives in order to plan their families and enjoy the pleasures of the marital bed. The couple must consider all these issues with care, and must be truly open to the gift of children. The moral justification for using contraceptives must be clear in the couple's mind, and fully consistent with the couple's Christian commitments.''&lt;ref name="mohler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertmohler.com/commentary_read.php?cdate=2004-03-30|title=Can Christians Use Birth Control?|accessdate=2006-10-01|year=2004|author=Mohler, R. Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additional adherents of this view include Rainey, [[James Dobson]],&lt;ref name="fofposstament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.org/corrpdfs/Miscellaneous/Position_Statement-Birth_Control_Pills_and_Other_Hormonal_Contraception.pdf|title=Position Statement: Birth Control Pills and Other Hormonal Contraception|accessdate=2006-10-21|publisher=Focus on the Family|year=2005|author=Focus on the Family|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan, Mohler, and evangelical [[ethicists]] Franklin E. Payne&lt;ref name="payne1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biblical/Medical Ethics: The Christian and the Practice of Medicine| last=Payne| first=Franklin E.| year=1985| publisher=Mott Media| location=Milford, MI| isbn=0-8010-7099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="payne2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Making Biblical Decisions: Birth Control, Artificial Reproduction and Genetic Engineering| last=Payne| first=Franklin E.| year=1989| publisher=Hosanna House| location=Escondido, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Feinberg|John]] and [[Paul Feinberg]].&lt;ref name="feinberg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics for a Brave New World| last=Feinberg| first=John and Paul| publisher=Crossway| location=Wheaton, IL| isbn=0-89107-736-7|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most Protestants adhere to this view, some such as Rainey may nonetheless advocate for one of the categories he describes, depending upon which [[Christian values]] they deem most important.

Some Protestants, however, reject the position that contraceptive use is a matter of conscience. Although some [[Quiverfull]] adherents accept that birth control use is a matter of individual conscience, other such adherents may argue that the Bible commands their position for all Christians. For example, David Crank, publisher of ''Unless The Lord Magazine'', states, "The 'Quiverfull' approach is universal in the sense that it is not something unusual that only a few are called to. Rather it is God's basic design and plan for mankind, and it was the way most of mankind lived most of the time, until the 20th century."&lt;ref name="QF-Digest-#3380"&gt;{{cite journal | author=David Crank | title=Quiverfull: universal or specific? | journal=Quiverfull Digest | year=2006| issue= #3380|url=http://www.quiverfull.com|pages=#20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles D. Provan]] additionally argues:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves disobedience to the Word of God. Nowhere is this command done away with in the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid for us today.''&lt;ref name="provan"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Bible and Birth Control| last=Provan| first=Charles D.| year=1989| publisher=Zimmer Printing| location=Monongahela, PA| isbn=99917-998-3-4}}. Quote and its chapter available at http://www.jesus-passion.com/contraception.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quiverfull authors such as Hess and Hess disagree and say the matter is simply one of clear obedience or disobedience to God's words in the Bible.&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Behold, children are a gift of the Lord" (Psa. 127:3). Do we really believe that? If children are a gift from God, let’s for the sake of argument ask ourselves what other gift or blessing from God we would reject. Money? Would we reject great wealth if God gave it? Not likely! How about good health? Many would say that a man’s health is his most treasured possession. But children? Even children given by God? "That’s different!" some will plead! All right, is it different? God states right here in no-nonsense language that children are gifts. Do we believe His Word to be true?''&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To such statements, Protestants such as Jordan point out that Christians will, in fact, choose against the blessing of money and great wealth. Jordan also maintains that, while children are indeed blessings, they are only one among a wide range of blessings God offers, and prayerfully choosing foci among them is part of prudent Christian [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]].&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt; [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s ''Desiring God'' ministry further explains,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Scriptures also say that a wife is a gift from the Lord (Proverbs 18:22), but that doesn't mean that it is wrong to stay single (1 Corinthians 7:8). Just because something is a gift from the Lord does not mean that it is wrong to be a steward of when or whether you will come into possession of it. It is wrong to reason that since A is good and a gift from the Lord, then we must pursue as much of A as possible. God has made this a world in which tradeoffs have to be made and we cannot do everything to the fullest extent. For kingdom purposes, it might be wise not to get married. And for kingdom purposes, it might be wise to regulate the size of one's family and to regulate when the new additions to the family will likely arrive. As Wayne Grudem has said, "it is okay to place less emphasis on some good activities in order to focus on other good activities."''&lt;ref name="piper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/QuestionsAndAnswers/ByTopic/45/1440_Does_the_Bible_permit_birth_control/|title=Does the Bible permit birth control?|accessdate=2006-10-27|publisher=Desiring God|year=2006|author=Desiring God Staff|work=Questions and Answers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====“Be fruitful and multiply”—command or blessing?====
Protestants, including Quiverfull adherents, also disagree over whether the Biblical statement "be fruitful and multiply" in Genesis 1:28 and 9:7 is a [[Cultural mandate|command]] or simply a [[blessing]] God spoke over its recipients. [[Mary Pride]] and [[Charles D. Provan]] see it as a binding command upon married Christians, while Dobson, MacArthur, Jordan, and Raymond C. Van Leeuwen do not see the statement as prohibiting family planning by contraceptive use.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/november12/4.58.html|title="Be Fruitful and Multiply": Is this a Command, or a Blessing?|accessdate=2006-10-21|publisher=Christianity Today|year=2005|author=Raymond C. Van Leeuwen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Sin of Onan—condemnation of contraceptive use?====
{{Main article|Onan}}
As part of this debate, Protestants (as well as some Catholics) disagree over [[Onan|the Sin of Onan]] as found in the Bible verses of Genesis 38:1-10. Protestants within the "children in abundance" group (see discussion of below)  often see Onan's act of ''[[coitus interruptus]]'' as condemning contraceptive use, while most see Onan's real sin as ongoing rebellion against God, with his failure to fulfill the terms of his [[Yibbum|Levirate marriage (Yibbum)]] being his final rebellious act.&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt;

===Which methods are permissible?===
:''Also see: [[Natural Family Planning]], [[Barrier contraception]] and [[Hormonal contraception]]''

Protestants who accept that birth control is permissible may disagree over which methods are impermissible.

====Natural Family Planning only or "artificial" methods too?====
In Sam and Bethany Torode's 2002 book, ''Open Embrace: A Protestant Couple Rethinks Contraception'', the young couple argued that only [[Natural Family Planning]] was permissible, citing their views borrowed from Catholicism including the [[Theology of the Body]].&lt;ref name="open_embrace"&gt;{{cite book | title=Open Embrace: A Protestant Couple Rethinks Contraception| last=Torode| first=Sam and Bethany| year=2002| publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-3973-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple later accepted barrier methods and stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Strict NFP reaches a point where it is more harmful for a marriage than good. We think that Jesus' words in Luke 11:46 apply: "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry." How is it that spouses are saying "yes" to the gift of each other when they end up abstaining for much of their married lives? ... We also see honest congruity with the language of the body by saying "no" to conception with our bodies (via barrier methods or sensual massage) when our minds and hearts are also saying "no" to conception. We don’t believe this angers God, nor that it leads to the slippery slope of relativism or divorce. We strongly disagree with the idea that this is a mortal sin.''&lt;ref name="Torode_redact"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s ''Desiring God'' ministry states of [[Natural family planning|NFP]],''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Some conclude that "natural family planning" is acceptable but "artificial" means are not. But this seems to overlook something significant: in both cases, you are still seeking to regulate when you have children. And so if one concludes that it is wrong to seek to regulate the timing and size of a family, then it would have to be concluded that natural family planning is just as wrong as "artificial" means. But if one concludes that it is appropriate to steward the timing and size of one's family, then what makes "artificial" means wrong but natural family planning right? Surely it is not because God is "more free" to overrule our plans with natural family planning! Perhaps some have concluded that artificial forms are wrong because they allow one more fully to separate intercourse from the possibility of procreation. But if it is wrong to have intercourse without a significant possibility of procreation, then it would also be wrong to have intercourse during pregnancy or after a woman is past her childbearing years. There is no reason to conclude that natural family planning is appropriate but that "artificial" means are not.''&lt;ref name="piper"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In her book, ''Birth Control for Christians: Making Wise Choices'', Jenell Williams Paris, who is associate professor of anthropology at Bethel College in St. Paul, reviews the benefits and uncertainties of various birth control methods, and decidedly favors the Fertility Awareness Method (FAM), which is similar to NFP but is different. (Paris is a FAM instructor.) The main difference is that FAM is not tied to Roman Catholic teaching.  Regarding hormonal methods and abortion, Paris explains that both assertions that the hormonal methods are necessarily acting as abortifacients and the counter claim that they never do are impossible to substantiate from data, and that the probability of the hypothesized scenarios are so small such that the collection of data seems infeasible.&lt;ref name="JWP"&gt;{{cite book | title=Birth Control for Christians: Making Wise Choices| last=Paris| first=Jenell Williams| year=2003| publisher=Baker Books| location=Grand Rapids| isbn=978-0-8010-6437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hormonal contraceptives====
Based upon a view that [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy|life begins at conception]], Protestant author [[Randy Alcorn]] rejects all forms of [[hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptives]], while [[James Dobson]] and [[obstetrician]] and minister William R. Cutrer reject only certain forms of them. Dobson and Cutrer view [[Progestogen only pill|progesterone-only birth control pills]] as potentially problematic, since they may be [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy|potentially abortive contraceptive]]s because of the theoretical possibility that they may have a slight secondary action of preventing a fertilized [[embryo]] from implanting within the [[uterus|uterine wall]], while Alcorn implicates all hormonal contraceptives as problematic in these regards.&lt;ref name="fofposstament"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cutrer"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contraception Guidebook: Options, Risks, and Answers for Christian Couples| url=http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/Authors/Author.htm?ContributorId=CutrerW&amp;QueryStringSite=Zondervan| last=Cutrer| first=William R.|author2=Glahn, Sandra L. | year=2005| publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, MI| isbn=0-310-25407-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alcorn"&gt;{{cite book|title=Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions?| url=http://www.epm.org/media-files/pdf/bcpill.pdf| last=Alcorn| first=Randy| year=2007| publisher=Eternal Perspective Ministries| location=Sandy, OR| isbn=0-9700016-0-6|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson's [[Focus on the Family]] states,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Dr. Dobson would emphasize as foundational his strict concurrence with the biblical teaching that every child is a blessing from God ... While affirming that human life begins with fertilization (the union of sperm and egg), his interpretation of Scripture leads him to believe that the prevention of fertilization is not morally wrong. However, he would oppose any method of birth control that acts after fertilization and terminates a conceived human life by preventing its implantation in the womb ... After two years of extended deliberation and prayer, the PRC has not been able to reach a consensus as to the likelihood, or even the possibility, that these medications might contribute to the loss of human life after fertilization. The majority of the experts to which Dr. Dobson has spoken feel that the pill does not have an abortifacient effect. A minority of the experts feel that when conception occurs on the pill, there is enough of a possibility for an abortifacient effect [with the progesterine-only pill], however remote, to warrant informing women about it.''&lt;ref name="fofposstament"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists]], however, argues that it is inappropriate to implicate certain hormonal contraceptives as abortifacient based upon theory only, and points out that no empirical evidence exists to prove any abortifacient action. The organization states,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Is it appropriate to implicate a medication as an abortive agent without the data to support such a claim? To do so creates needless hostility and division among physicians and patients who genuinely respect life from the moment of conception. Where do we draw the line in informed consent for responsible disclosure of known medical risks vs. a theoretical risk which is not substantiated by current scientific knowledge? Is it accurate to implicate all hormonal contraceptive methods as one regarding their method of action, rather than evaluating each one individually?''&lt;ref name="aaplog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaplog.org/decook.htm|title=Hormone Contraceptives Controversies and Clarifications|accessdate=2006-10-23|publisher=[[American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists]]|year=1999|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061012022215/http://www.aaplog.org/decook.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Current views==
Author and [[Campus Crusade for Christ#Campus Crusade for Christ, Major Ministry Divisions in the U.S.|FamilyLife Today]] radio host Dennis Rainey suggests four categories as useful in understanding current Protestant views concerning birth control.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familylife.com/fltoday/default.asp?id=5868&amp;page=72&amp;search=&amp;strMonth=&amp;strDay=&amp;strYear=&amp;guests=&amp;keywords=&amp;showType= |title=The Value of Children (11 July 2002 FamilyLife Today Radio Broadcast) |accessdate=2006-09-30 |publisher=FamilyLife Today |year=2002 |author=Dennis Rainey |format=Transcript of radio broadcast |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001144025/http://www.familylife.com/fltoday/default.asp?id=5868&amp;page=72&amp;search=&amp;strMonth=&amp;strDay=&amp;strYear=&amp;guests=&amp;keywords=&amp;showType= |archivedate=1 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher G. Ellison and Patricia Goodson use very similar categories in their 1997 study of Protestant seminarians' attitudes on the matter.&lt;ref name="consvprots"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Christopher G. Ellison and Patricia Goodson| title=Conservative Protestantism and Attitudes toward Family Planning in a Sample of Seminarians| journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion| year=1997| volume=36| issue=4| pages=512–529| doi=10.2307/1387687 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | jstor=1387687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Children in abundance" group===
{{Main article|Quiverfull}}
The first is the "children in abundance" group. Protestants within this group believe that birth control is a contravention of God’s purpose for marriage and that all children conceived during routine [[sexual intercourse]] (without regard to time of the month during the [[ovulation]] cycle or other matters) should be welcomed as blessings.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; The [[Quiverfull|Quiverfull movement]] and its authors such as [[Mary Pride]], Rick and Jan Hess, [[Charles D. Provan]], [[Nancy Leigh DeMoss]], Rachel Giove Scott, and others, predominate this group. Based upon [[Bible verses]] that describe God acting to "open and close the womb" (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2020:18;&amp;version=49; Genesis 20:18], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2029:31;&amp;version=49; 29:31], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2030:22;&amp;version=49; 30:22]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%201:5-6;&amp;version=49; 1 Samuel 1:5-6]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2066:9;&amp;version=49; Isaiah 66:9]), Quiverfull adherents believe that [[Divine Providence]] alone should control how many and how often children are conceived and born.&lt;ref name="thenation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061127/joyce|title='Arrows for the War'|accessdate=2006-11-09|publisher=The Nation|date=9 November 2006|author=Kathryn Joyce|work=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestants in this group often connect birth control use with modern [[feminism]], an "anti-child mentality", "worldliness",&lt;ref name="mary_pride"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality| last=Pride| first=Mary| year=1985| publisher=Good News Publishers| location=Wheaton, IL|isbn=0-89107-345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="provan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hess"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ| last=Hess| first=Rick and Jan| year=1990| publisher=Hyatt Publishers| location=Brentwood, TN|isbn=0-943497-83-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite book | title=Birthing God's Mighty Warriors| last=Scott| first=Rachel| year=2004| publisher=Xulon Press| location=Longwood, FL|isbn=1-59467-465-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abortion because birth control is used for "the same reasons why a woman aborts her child".&lt;ref name="nikki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quiverfull.com/birth_control/my_contraceptive_convictions.html|title=My contraceptive convictions|accessdate=2006-10-20|publisher=Quiverfull.com|author=Nikki Keith|work=Quiverfull Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Children in managed abundance" group===
The second is the "children in managed abundance" group. According to Rainey, Protestants within this group are open to however many children they may conceive during their fertile years yet believe that only [[Natural Family Planning]] is acceptable and may use it.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; A young couple Sam and Bethany Torode advocated for this view in their 2002 book,&lt;ref name="open_embrace" /&gt; although they later accepted [[barrier contraception]] such as [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]] and [[condoms]].&lt;ref name="Torode_redact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openembrace.com/ |title=Udates |accessdate=2006-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026170034/http://www.openembrace.com/ |archivedate=2006-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denny Kenaston]] of Charity Christian Fellowship also advocates for this position,&lt;ref name="Kenaston_menno"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pursuit of Godly Seed| last=Kenaston| first=Denny| year=2003| publisher=Home Fires Publishers|isbn=0-9742751-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[Presbyterian]] seminary professor Daniel Doriani.&lt;ref name="doriani"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Doriani, Daniel| title=Birth Dearth or Bring on the Babies?: Biblical Perspectives on Family Planning| journal=Journal of Biblical Counseling| year=1993| volume=12| issue=1| pages=24–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Children in moderation" group===
The third is the "children in moderation" group. In Rainey’s view, these Protestants are very pro-child but feel free to use artificial birth control to prudently plan their families. Those within this group see Divine Providence and [[Free will in theology|Biblically required responsibility]] acting via man's free will as working complementarily. They thus may feel freedom to use non-"natural" birth control in making personal choices in [[prayer|consultation with God]] about the number and spacing of children.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt;

==="No children" group===
{{See also|Childfree}}
The fourth group is the [[Childfree|"no children"]] group. Rainey sees couples in this group as believing they are within their Biblical rights to define their lives around [[natalism|non-natal]] concerns.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; While not their main emphasis on the subject, Protestant authors such as Samuel Owen and [[James B. Jordan]] support this as an acceptable option, but only when a [[Hierarchy#Ethics, behavioral psychology, philosophies of identity|higher ethical principle]] intervenes to make child bearing imprudent, such as health concerns or a calling to serve [[orphan]]s or as [[missionary|missionaries]] in a dangerous location, etc. A small activist group, the Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree, argues their position, "Jesus loved children but chose to never have any, so that he could devote his life to telling the Good News."&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eilertech.com/cyberchurch/cyberchurch.htm|title=The Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree|accessdate=2006-12-08|publisher=The Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan also maintains that modern birth control methods, as well as Natural Family Planning, are acceptable tools of prudent family planning. Jordan also strongly supports the option for couples to have very large families, while Owen believes that non-use of birth control in any form should be normative.&lt;ref name="JBJ"&gt;{{cite journal|author=James B. Jordan |title=The Bible and Family Planning: An Answer to Charles Provan's "The Bible and Birth Control" |journal=Contra Mundum |year=1993 |issue=Fall 1993, no. 9 |url=http://www.contra-mundum.org/cm/cm09.pdf |format=PDF |issn=1070-9495 |pages=2–14 (Article begins on PDF page 4 of source) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204052122/http://www.contra-mundum.org/cm/cm09.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mohler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Letting God Plan Your Family| last=Owen, Jr.| first=Samuel A.| year=1990| publisher=Crossway Books| location=Wheaton, IL|isbn=0-89107-585-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainey sees infertile couples as falling into this group apart from their choice in the matter.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|Sterilized]] couples may as well. According to [[Southern Baptist]] [[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]], "Couples are not given the option of chosen childlessness in the biblical revelation".&lt;ref name="mohler-child"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/167/story_16748.html|title=Deliberate Childlessness: Moral Rebellion With a New Face|accessdate=2006-10-23|publisher=www.albertmohler.com|year=2006|author=Albert Mohler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sterilization reversals===
{{Main article|Sterilization reversal}}

Stemming from ideas from the [[Quiverfull]] movement, some Protestants such as [[Bill Gothard]] advocate for couples to undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] reversal surgery, while Brad and Dawn Irons of ''Blessed Arrows Sterilization Reversal Ministry'' advocate for Quiverfull ideas while providing funding, physician referrals, and support to Protestants wishing to undergo reversal surgery.&lt;ref name="reverse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blessedarrows.org/|title=Blessed Arrows: A Sterilization Reversal Ministry|accessdate=2006-10-14|publisher=Brad and Dawn Irons|author=Brad and Dawn Irons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pusharo.jpg|thumb|Detail of Pusharo petroglyphs]]
The '''Petroglyphs of Pusharo''' constitute a unique and extensive ancient rock art site in southeast [[Peru]]'s [[Manú National Park]], a [[jungle]]d expanse that still contains unexplored and little known areas, and for which an official government permit is required for entry.

==Discovery==
It appears that a rubber tapper on an Indian raid in 1909 may have been the first non-native to encounter the petroglyphs, with the next visit having been made by a Dominican missionary, Vicente Cenitagoya, in 1921.  A smattering of adventurers began to arrive at the site in the 1950s, and in 1969 the site was visited by the Peruvian physician/explorer Dr. [[Carlos Neuenschwander Landa]] (who would return in later years accompanied by Peruvian explorer, Sr. Santiago Yábar). In 1970 another peripatetic Dominican, Padre Adolfo Torrealba, reached the site, followed by Japanese explorer Yoshiharo Sekino, and the French-Peruvian explorers Herbert and Nicole Cartagena in 1978.  Two years later came the Peruvian archaeologist [[Federico Kauffmann Doig]]. In 1991 the party of North American explorer [[Gregory Deyermenjian]], including Peruvian explorer Paulino Mamani and the previously mentioned Santiago Yábar, arrived at Pusharo.  The site has since been visited and studied by rock art scholar Rainer Hostnig.

In 2008, it was the subject of a documentary-trek filmed for the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Extreme Dreams With Ben Fogle|Extreme Dreams]]'' presented by [[Ben Fogle]].

==Description==
The site is made up of an array of deeply incised rock carvings that cover up to a height of 9 feet, a perpendicular rock face that is over 100 feet long and 75 feet high.  Its location is on the south shore of the [[Río Palatoa]] (designated on some maps at this location as the Porotoa, and known by others as the [[Palatoa Chico]]).  The [[petroglyphs]] are thought by some researchers to be purely pan-Amazonian in origin, and of mistico-religious or shamanic significance to those Amerindians of past centuries who must have been their creators.  Others believe that there is an Incan component that is now coming to light, and that the glyphs constitute parts of a map.  Definitive word on the meaning of Pusharo's glyphs must wait until further research is conducted and completed.  The glyphs contain elements such as heart-shaped faces, some with double borders, spirals, zigzags, suns, "curlicue X's" and others that defy verbal description.

{{Wiktionary pipe|轆轤首|rokurokubi}}
[[File:Hokusai rokurokubi.jpg|thumb|"Rokurokubi" from the [[Hokusai Manga]] by [[Katsushika Hokusai]]]]
The '''rokurokubi''' (ろくろ首, 轆轤首) is a type of Japanese ''[[yōkai]]'' (apparition). They look almost completely like humans, with one major difference. There are two types of Rokurokubi: one whose neck stretches, and one whose head comes off and flies around freely (''nukekubi''). The Rokurokubi appear in classical ''[[kaidan]]'' (spirit tales) and in [[yōkai]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=村上健司 編著|title=日本妖怪大事典|year=2005|publisher=角川書店|series=Kwai books|isbn=978-4-04-883926-6|pages=356頁}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested, however, that the idea of rokurokubi may have been created purely for entertainment purposes rather than originating from any folk beliefs or legends.&lt;ref name="今野1981"&gt;{{Harvnb|今野|1981|pp=86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''rokurokubi'' may have derived from the word ''rokuro'' which refers to a [[potter's wheel]]&lt;ref name="井之口他1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|井之口他|1988|p=520}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a [[water well]]'s [[pulley]] (since it elongates).&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E3%82%8D%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8D&amp;dtype=0&amp;dname=0na&amp;stye=0&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=21930619691100 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124182016/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8 |archivedate=2007-01-24 |df= }} Yahoo Japan, ヤフー株式会社 Accessed 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="多田2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|多田|2000|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[umbrella]] handle (which also elongates).&lt;ref name="井之口他1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=阿部主計|title=妖怪学入門|year=2004|publisher=雄山閣|isbn=978-4-639-01866-7|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ShokokuHyaku Rokurokubi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Wechizen no Kofuchuu Rokurokubi no Koto'' (ゑちぜんの国府中ろくろ首の事) from the ''[[Shokoku Hyaku Monogatari]]'' (諸国百物語)&lt;ref name="篠塚訳著2006" /&gt;]]
The nukekubi are rokurokubi whose heads come off and float about. These were the first rokurokubi, whereas the other kind came afterwards.&lt;ref name="篠塚訳著2006"&gt;{{Harvnb|篠塚訳著|2006|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nukekubi sometimes perform bad deeds such as attacking at night and drinking their victims' blood. It's theorized that the nukekubi has a weakness when it is sleeping and the head is floating around: if the body moves, then the head cannot be re-united to the body.&lt;ref name="柴田2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|柴田|2005|pp=30–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical literature about rokurokubi describe tales of people witnessing and encountering floating heads at night time.&lt;ref name="柴田2005" /&gt;

Sometimes, the action of the head separating from the body is seen as the soul wandering away from the body i. e. somnambulism. For example, in the ''Sorori Monogatari'' (曾呂利物語, 1663 CE), in the chapter, ''A Woman's Wild Thoughts Wandering Around'' (女の妄念迷ひ歩く事, ''Onna no Mōnen Mayoiaruku Koto'') the head separating from the body interpreted to be the woman's soul wandering while asleep. In the same book, a man saw a nukekubi that changed into a chick and a woman's head, so he took his sword and chased the head. The head fled into a home, and people said that they heard a voice from inside say, "I had a scary dream. I was chased by a man with a sword. I ran away all the way back home, and then I woke up."&lt;ref name="高田編1989" /&gt; (refer to picture).

A similar story appears in Shokoku Hyaku Monogatari (諸国百物語, 1677 CE), which drew a lot of inspiration from the Sorori Monogatari. In ''About Rokurokubi in the Province of Echizen'' (ゑちぜんの国府中ろくろ首の事, ''Echizen no Kuni Fuchū Rokurokubi no Koto''), there's the story of a man who chases a nukekubi (who was a woman's soul detached from her body) all the way home. It's said that the woman had been shamed by a crime she has committed, so as a result, she left her husband, shaved her hair, and committed suicide.&lt;ref name="篠塚訳著2006" /&gt;

''Hokusō Sadan'' (北窻瑣談, 1910 CE) is an [[Edo period]] essay by Tachibana Nankei (橘春暉). Here too, it was interpreted to be an illness resulting in a detaching soul. The story goes: in the first year of [[Kansei]], in [[Echigo Province]] (now [[Fukui Prefecture]]), there was a house maidservant whose head rolled off the pillow while she was asleep, detached from the body. Later in the story, it was explained that it was not really the head, but rather the soul making the appearance of a head.{{Sfn|柴田|2008|pp=704-705}}

In ''Kokon Hyaku Monogatari Hyōban'' (古今百物語評判, 1686 CE), a book of ghost stories that explains yōkai tales by [[Yamaoka Genrin]], there is a chapter called ''How Priest Zetsugan saw Rokurokubi in Higo'' (絶岸和尚肥後にて轆轤首を見給ふ事, ''Zetsugan Oshō Higo nite Rokurokubi wo Mitamou Koto''). In [[Higo Province]] (now [[Kumamoto Prefecture]]), the head of an innkeeper's wife leaves her body and floats in the air. It returned to normal the next day, but there was a line around her neck. The author made references to examples from Chinese books, and then commented, "as these kinds of things were often seen in South-East Asia, not just limited to the creation of the heaven and earth, it is difficult to fathom them with ordinary common sense such as the idea that octopi do not have eyes, and as these things are unheard of in the capital, everything strange is in faraway lands."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=山岡元隣|editor=山岡元恕編 太刀川清校訂|title=続百物語怪談集成|year=1993|publisher=国書刊行会|series=叢書江戸文庫|isbn=978-4-336-03527-1|pages=12–13|chapter=古今百物語評判}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, there is a story which tells of a woman in the village of Tawa, [[Nagao, Kagawa|Nagao]], [[Ōkawa District, Kagawa|Ōkawa District]], [[Kagawa Prefecture]] (now [[Sanuki, Kagawa|Sanuki]]) who is a rokurokubi and has a ring-like bruise around her neck.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt;

In the ''Churyō Manroku'' (中陵漫録) is a tale which describes a "Rokurokubi Village" in the recesses of [[Mount Yoshino]] where all the residents, even children, wore scarves to cover a line around their necks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=佐藤成裕|editor=早川純三郎編輯代表|title=日本随筆大成|year=1976|publisher=吉川弘文館|volume=第3期 3|isbn=978-4-642-08580-9|page=354|chapter=中陵漫録}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Kasshi Yawa'' (甲子夜話, ca. 1821 CE) by [[Matsura Seizan]] is a story which tells of a woman in [[Hitachi Province]] who has a terminal illness. A peddler has told her husband that the liver of a white dog will cure her. The husband kills the pet dog and gives his wife the dog's liver as a medicant. The woman is cured but her next born daughter is a rokurokobi. When the  roukorkobi's head detached and flew in the air, the white dog appeared, bit the head and killed the rokurokobi.&lt;ref name="笹間1994"&gt;{{Harvnb|笹間|1994|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although rokurokubi and nukekubi are usually female, in ''Shousai Hikki'' (蕉斎筆記), an [[Edo period]] tale, there is a nukekubi that is male. A priest is sleeping in his temple when a head appeared and approached his chest. He grabs it and throws it away and it left. In the morning, the manservant asks to take leave, and when asked why, the manservant asks, "did a head come visit last night?" The priest answered yes, the manservant then explained that "I have the nukekubi illness, and I fear it will interfere with my work too much from now on." The manservant went away to his home in [[Shimōsa Province]] where this "illness" was thought to be common.{{Sfn|柴田|2008|p=702}}

In the essay ''Mimibukuro'' by [[Negishi Shizumori]], a woman who was rumored to be a rokurokubi is married but manages to lives well since the rumor was nothing more than a rumor. She was not actually a rokurokubi so she achieved a happy ending, which is unusual for tales about rokurokubi because bad fortune almost always results when the true identity of a rokurokubi is discovered.&lt;ref name="柴田2005" /&gt;

In the [[Edo period]] encyclopedia, ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]'' Rokuokubi like creatures from Chinese lore are described. They are written as 飛頭蛮 meaning ''flying head barbarians''. They use their ears like wings and they eat insects. The ones from China and Japan were believed to be foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=稲田篤信・田中直日編|editor=高田衛監修|title=鳥山石燕 画図百鬼夜行|year=1992|publisher=国書刊行会|isbn=978-4-336-03386-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreigner nukekubi also appears in ''[[Rokurokubi (folktale)|Rokurokubi]]'' by [[Lafcadio Hearn]]. In his story, the spirits masquerade as a family of woodcutters from the city who kill and eat travellers.

== Rokurokubi whose necks extend ==
[[File:SekienRokurokubi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rokurokubi (飛頭蛮) from the ''[[Gazu Hyakki Yagyō]]'' by [[Sekiyama Torien]]. What is depicted here is not a neck, but actually a string that connects the head to the body.&lt;ref name=kotowari386/&gt;]]
[[File:Ikku Rokurokubi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rokuroubi from ''Rekkoku Kaidan Kikigaki Zōshi'' (列国怪談聞書帖) by [[Jippensha Ikku]]&lt;ref name="ikku"&gt;{{Cite book|author=十返舎一九|editor=棚橋正博校訂|title=十返舎一九集|year=1997|publisher=国書刊行会|series=叢書江戸文庫|isbn=978-4-336-03543-1|pages=246–248|chapter=列国怪談聞書帖}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Starting in the [[Edo period]], tales were written about people's necks stretching when they were asleep. Examples of these tales are ''Buya Zokuda'' (武野俗談), ''Kanden Kōhitsu'' (閑田耕筆) and ''Yasō Kidan'' (夜窓鬼談).

It's thought that the idea of an extending neck originated from people misinterpreting visual depictions of nukekubi, the earlier kind of rokurokubi. There was the idea that nukekubi had a string attaching the head to the body, and when this string was depicted in visual depictions, people misinterpted this string as an elongated neck.&lt;ref name=kotowari386&gt;{{cite book &lt;!--| 和書--&gt; | author=京極夏彦 | title=妖怪の理 妖怪の檻 | publisher=角川書店 | series=怪 BOOKS | year=2007 | chapter=妖怪の形について | pages=386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Kasshi Yawa'' (甲子夜話), there is a tale which tells of a female servant with a pale face who is suspected to be a rokurokubi. One night, her master checks on her while she is sleeping and sees something like steam gradually rise from her chest. The steam becomes thick and obscures her head and then suddenly it appears as though her neck has risen up and stretched. Perhaps due to being surprised from seeing her master, the girl stirs, turns over and her neck returned to normal. This servant had a pale face, but otherwise looked completely normal, but despite this, she was fired and in fact has had trouble staying in any job, always being fired shortly after being employed.{{Sfn|柴田|2008|pp=700-701}} For the soul to leave the body and create the shape of a neck, as seen in this story and the before mentioned Hokusō Sadan, is sometimes interpreted to be "[[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]" in [[parapsychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=多田克己|title=幻想世界の住人たち|year=1990|publisher=新紀元社|series=[[Truth In Fantasy]]|volume=IV|isbn=978-4-915146-44-2|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late [[Edo period]] ''[[yomihon]]'' (illustrated novel), ''Rekkoku Kaidan Kikigaki Zōshi'' (列国怪談聞書帖) by [[Jippensha Ikku]] the author suggests the elongated necks of rokurokubi originate in the spiritual principle, ''[[karma]]''. In Ikku's work, ''Kaishin'', a monk from [[Enshū]] and a woman called Oyotsu elope together. However, when Oyatsu collapsed from an illness, they ran out of money, so he killed her. When Kaishin eventually returned to secular life, he slept with a girl he met at an inn. When they sleep together, the girl's neck stretched and her face becomes that of Oyotsu, who then told him about her resentment. Kaishin felt regretful his actions and proceeded to tell Oyatsu's father everything. The girl's father then told Kaishin that he has also killed a woman before. He stole her money and with it, he opened his inn. He had a daughter was born soon after who, due to karma, became a rokurokubi. Kaishin then reentered the priesthood. He built a grave for Oyotsu, said to be the Rokurokubi no Tsuka (Rokurokubi Mound), which told the story to future generations.&lt;ref name="ikku" /&gt;

In some stories, rokurokubi are not a yōkai, but rather people who have an affliction that affects the body. For example, the [[Edo period]] author [[Ban Kōkei]] in his work "Kanden Kōhitsu" told a tale of a [[geisha]] at the [[Yoshiwara]] brothel whose neck would elongate in her sleep. It stated that her neck stretched to due her "heart becoming loose"{{Sfn|柴田|2008|pp=701-702}}

== Oral tradition ==
Rokurokobi are also appear in the [[oral tradition]] of Japanese myths. For example, there is a myth about an old highway between the villages of Iwa and [[Akechi, Gifu|Akechi]] in [[Gifu Prefecture]] where it is said that a snake shapeshifted into a rokurokubi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=鈴木孝司他編|title=旧静波村の民俗 岐阜県恵那郡明智町旧静波村|year=1971|publisher=東洋大学 民俗研究会|id=ncid: BA5494848X|page=191|chapter=口承文芸}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is a myth from the oral tradition of Koikubo area of [[Iida, Nagano|Iida]], [[Nagano Prefecture]] where it is said a rokurokubi appeared in someone's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=巻山圭一|editor=所三男他編纂|title=長野県史|year=1989|publisher=長野県|volume=民俗編 2巻3号|id=ncid: BN00168252|page=100|chapter=家・屋敷に出る妖怪}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bunka]] period, a [[kaidan]] story became popular, where there was a prostitute whose neck would smoothly stretch and would lick the oil of paper lanterns when she slept with guests, showing how rokurokubi were spoken of as things that women would transform into or an illness that they would be afflicted with. In this period, rokurokubi were also popular in [[freak show]]s.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt; The ''Shohō Kenbunroku'' (諸方見聞録) records a freak show in 1810 (Bunka 7) in Edo, now [[Tokyo]] where a male rokurokubi with an elongated neck appeared.&lt;ref name="笹間1994" /&gt;

Tales of rokurokubi appeared even in the early [[Meiji period|Meiji]] period. There was a tale of how a merchant and his wife from Shibaya town, [[Ibaraki, Osaka|Ibaraki]], [[Osaka Prefecture]] who witnessed their daughter's neck stretch every night. Despite their supplications in [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]], their daughter did not get better, and eventually the whole town came to know about it. The couple couldn't bear it anymore, so they left, leaving no clues as to where they went.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=岡市二洲|date=September 1933|title=怪談茨木附近|journal=郷土研究上方|volume=3巻|issue=33号|page=34|id=NCID: AN00045163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magic shows ==
The rokurokubi is also a kind of Japanese [[magic (illusion)|magic show tricks]] using curtains and life sized dolls without heads. It's reported that a doll without a head wearing a [[kimono]] in [[seiza]] is put in front of the curtain. There's a rope behind the curtain and a female performer connected to it who shows only her face. As she stands and squats, the fake neck would stretches and contracts, as if it were a rokurokubi.

Explanations and pictures about what's behind this trick were written in magazines of the [[Meiji period]] (1800s), giving a date for how early these shows first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;富田昭次 『絵はがきで見る日本近代』 青弓社 2005年 {{ISBN|4-7872-2016-0}} p.131 滑稽新聞 社発行の雑誌「絵葉書世界」（雑誌とは言っているが、絵葉書 の画集）の中に「見せ物の内幕」と題し、ろくろ首の仕掛けを暴く絵がある。絵師は、なべぞとあり、切手 を貼る所には、驚いている少年が描かれている&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time period when mystery phenomena were vigorously exposed by the scientifically minded, so for magic tricks to be revealed is fitting with the zeitgeist.

In the [[Taishō period|Taishō]] period, there were businesses arranging rokurokubi to appear in show tents in festivals and fairs at temples and shrines, and they were quite popular.&lt;ref name="笹間1994" /&gt;

== Similar tales from other nations ==
The type of rokurokubi whose necks separate from the rest of the body is said to have derived from stories of the Chinese yōkai, the ''[[hitōban]]'' (飛頭蛮) a yōkai whose head separates from the body and floats about.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt; Like the rokurokobi, the hitoban has a line around its neck.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt; Chinese stories also tell of a yōkai called a ''rakutō'' (落頭) whose head comes off and floats about while the torso remains at rest on the futon. There is a tale that in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, an [[Eastern Wu]] general, [[Zhu Huan]] employed a female servant who was a rakutō. It's said that she used its ears like wings. Another tale relates that in the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] era, there was a clan from the south called ''rakutōmin'' (落頭民) who could fly around in only their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=水木しげる|title=カラー版 続妖怪画談|year=1993|publisher=岩波書店|series=岩波新書|isbn=978-4-004-30288-9|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are legends of creatures including [[Palasik]], [[Kuyang]], and [[Leyak|Leak]] from Indonesia,  [[Penanggalan]] in Malaysia, and [[Krasue]] in Thailand. The heads of these creatures would separate from the body and float about with the [[entrails]] attached.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt;

The [[Chonchon]] is a mythical creature of South America which takes the form of a human head flying around in the air, sucking the life out of people.

The [[Manananggal]] is a creature of Philippines mythology. This female monster is slightly different since its whole body from the waist up detaches and grows giant bat-like wings.

The yōkai researcher, Tada Katsumi states that these stories arrived in Japan in the [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] to [[Azuchi–Momoyama period|Azuchi-Momoyama]] periods, when there was still trade with southern China and Southeast Asia. In the [[Edo period]], when Japan adopted an [[Sakoku|isolationist policy]] an original Japanese yōkai, the ''rokurokubi'' evolved.&lt;ref name="多田2000" /&gt;

'''''A Scene from the Great Flood''''' or ''''''The Great Flood''''' is an 1826 painting of [[Noah's flood]] by [[Joseph-Désiré Court]]. It was first exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] on 4 November 1827 although - as a laureate of the Prix de Rome - he could not compete for the awards of that Salon. The French state purchased the work for 3000 francs and it is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]].

'''Shop fitting''' ('''shopfitting''') is the trade of fitting out [[retail]] and service [[Retailing|shops]] and [[Retailing|stores]] with equipment, fixtures and fittings. The trade applies to all kinds of outlets from small corner shops to [[hypermarket]]s. A '''shop fitter''' executes planning, [[design]]s shop layout and installs equipment and services. A shop fitting [[business entity|firm]] typically incorporates professional expertise in [[interior design]], manufacturing of [[bespoke]] furniture, signage and fittings (with own or [[outsourcing|outsourced]] facilities) and purchasing of retail equipment.

A shop fitting cycle begins with a survey and measurement of available space and preparing design drawings for submission to the client. Alternatively, the client may have their own drawings prepared by an independent interior designer. The shop fitter arranges for purchase of standard equipment and merchandise or production of bespoke furniture, delivers and physically installs them—until the shop is ready for daily operation.

There are different requirements to the different branches and types of shop. [[Fashion]] shop design requires up-to-the-minute awareness of current trends in colour and style to create stores that will draw customers in.

==Systems==
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Shopfitting system''' refers to a product range made to satisfy the needs of shopfitters and ultimately retailers for display and [[merchandising]] goods. A shopfitting system can be adapted from combinations of standardized components for a particular retail application. A manufacturer would normally launch new shopfitting systems on a 2-year basis. Leading manufacturers would offer design oriented systems, followers would reinterpret them making the display solution achievable with as many as existing items as possible, hoping that retailers will choose their product because of the cheap price.

Shopfitting systems are usually connected to a "modular" concept, meaning that each item has more than one use. This economically goes into the rules of "network", where one element has the value of three, if added to another element, because 1x1=1 but 2x2=4: an extra item designed and compatible with others, has very high value.

== Shop Fitting Profession ==
'''Shop Fitting''' is a profession that involves the fitting of retail outlets like corner shops, department stores, convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets with equipment, fixtures and fittings. It’s carried out by a shop fitter who executes all planning, design, layout and installation of equipment and services. A '''shop fitter''' brings interior design expertise and assists in the design of bespoke furniture, fittings and signage and also with the buying of retail equipment.

The process begins with a survey of the retail premises and measurement of available space. The next stage is the preparation of design, which is then submitted to the client for review and approval. Some clients provide their own design drawings that are prepared by another interior designer.  Finally, the shop fitter arranges for the purchase of standard equipment and the production of the bespoke furniture, which is delivered and installed – ready for the shop operation. 

Shop fitting is a precision orientated profession that requires intricacy and exceptional attention to detail in order to meet client requirements. Visual elements heavily impact customer behaviour hence why shop fitting is now at the forefront of attracting new customers to stores across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lake|first1=Dean|title=Shop Fitting|url=https://lakecontracts.co.uk/service/shop-fitting/|website=Lake Contracts|publisher=Lake Contracts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:QuietClubbing Gatsby Party 4.08.16.jpg|thumb|QuietClubbing Gatsby Party in New York on April 8, 2016]]
A '''silent disco''' or '''silent rave''' is an event where people dance to music listened to on wireless [[headphone]]s.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/silent+disco|title=silent disco - Definition of silent disco in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than using a [[speaker system]], music is broadcast via a radio transmitter with the signal being picked up by wireless headphone receivers worn by the participants. Those without the headphones hear no music, giving the effect of a room full of people dancing to nothing.

In the earliest days of silent discos, before 2005, there would be only one channel available to listen to music through. Over time, the technology moved along to where there were two, and later technology allowed for a third channel that three separate DJs could broadcast over at the same time.

Silent discos are popular at music festivals as they allow dancing to continue past noise curfews. Similar events are "mobile clubbing" gatherings, where a group of people dance to the music on their personal music players.

==History==
[[Image:Silent house party san francisco.jpg|thumb|left|A silent house party in [[San Francisco, California]]]]
An early reference in fiction is the 1969 Finnish science-fiction film ''Ruusujen Aika'' (''A Time of Roses''), where characters wear headsets during a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138764/|title= IMDb "A Time of Roses"|publisher=|accessdate=|last=|first= | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was used by eco-activists in the early 1990s, utilizing headphones at outdoor parties to minimize noise pollution and disturbance to the local wildlife.

In 1994, the [[Glastonbury Festival]] linked its on-site radio station to the video screen sited next to the Main Stage, allowing festival goers to watch late night [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] football and music videos on the giant screen after the sound curfew by using their own portable radios. The idea was the brainchild of the project manager from Proquip, who supplied the giant screen, and engineers from Moles Recording Studio in [[Bath, Somerset]], who were working with Radio Avalon.

In May 2000, [[BBC]] Live Music held a "silent gig" at [[Chapter Arts Centre]] in [[Cardiff]], where the audience listened to a band, Rocketgoldstar, and various DJs through headphones.&lt;ref name="BBC Music Live events unfold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/764290.stm|title=BBC News - ENTERTAINMENT - BBC Music Live events unfold|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002 artist Meg Duguid hosted ''Dance with me...''  a silent dance party at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago]] where she created an outdoor club installation complete with velvet ropes and glow rope in which a DJ spun a transmission to wireless headsets that audience members put on and danced to.&lt;ref&gt;http:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molzahn|first1=Laura|title=Summer Solstice Celebration|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/summer-solstice-celebration/Content?oid=908938|website=Chicago Reader|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://megduguid.com/section/149646-Dance-with-me.html|title=Dance with me...|website=megduguid.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duguid threw a second dance party at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]] the following year, entitled Dueling DJs where two DJS simultaneously spun two separate musical transmissions various wireless headsets that audience members put on and danced to.  This performance was repeated the following year (2004) at the [[Chicago Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dueling DJs @ Cultural Center|url=http://www.gapersblock.com/slowdown/archives/2004/12/|website=Gapers Block: Slow Down Archive|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "silent disco" has been in existence since at least 2005 with [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] advertising such an event that year with DJ’s [[Motion Potion]], Quickie Mart and DJ medi4 and headphones provided by KOSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, the traveling arts and culture festival De Parade already featured a "stille disco" [silent disco] earlier, for example in 2003. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmitz|first1=Jowi|title=Amsterdams Parade-publiek bekijkt zichzelf|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2003/08/05/amsterdams-parade-publiek-bekijkt-zichzelf-7649080-a812311|website=NRC.nl|publisher=NRC|accessdate=21 May 2018|language=Dutch|date=5 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch DJs Nico Okkerse and Michael Minton have been described as "the pioneers ... in the legend of silent disco" because they started "stille disco" events in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|title=A quiet night out|url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/a-quiet-night-out-1.499140|website=The National|publisher=The National|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okkerse claims his company 433fm.com "created Silent Disco in 2002"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nico Okkerse|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nico-okkerse-0b0191b/|website=LinkedIn|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its site does have photos from such events going back to at least 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Festival de Parade Museumpark|url=http://www.radio433.com/foto/detail.php?book=20030620&amp;taal=|website=Radio433.com|publisher=433fm.com|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HUSHconcerts]] (previously, Silent Frisco) was the first company to produce a multi-city Silent Disco tour in 2008 with Silent Soundclash &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/jun/14/meltdownmassiveattack|title=Meltdown: Silent disco, big noise|last=Ojumu|first=Akin|date=2008-06-14|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; kicking off at [[Winter Music Conference]] in Miami, followed by Atlanta, Athens, Savannah, Wilmington NC, Charlottesville Va, Baltimore, New York City, Syracuse, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. During this tour, the company became the first to produce American silent discos on a beach (Miami Beach) and a boat (the Rocksoff Cruise in New York Harbor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2010/04/02/silent-soundclash-rana-eric-krasno-chapter-2-among-cruises-on-rocks-off-calendar|title=Silent Soundclash, RANA, Eric Krasno &amp; Chapter 2 Among Cruises on Rocks Off Calendar|website=www.jambands.com|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford Dictionary Online]] added the term "silent disco" to their website in February 2011.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary" /&gt; As interest has increased, there has been a rise in the number of companies organizing parties and providing events with wireless headphones. Some companies have offered home kits.&lt;ref name="craze"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/6142360/Silent-disco-craze-spreads.html|title=Silent disco craze spreads|last=Johnston|first=Ian|date=6 September 2009|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile clubbing==
Another type of silent party, known as mobile clubbing, involves the gathering of a group of people in an unconventional location to dance to music which they provide themselves via a [[Portable audio player|portable music device]], such as an [[MP3 player]], listened to on headphones.  These [[flash mob]] gatherings may involve hundreds of people, transforming public spaces into temporary clubbing areas, in which dancers listen to their personal playlists.  To an observer it would appear that the participants are dancing for no apparent reason. Mobile clubbing events are organized using mass-emails, word-of-mouth or [[social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], or a combination of these methods.

The first event, organised by London-based artists Ben Cummins (also founder of Pillow Fight Club) and Emma Davis, was at London's [[Liverpool Street Station]] in September 2003.&lt;ref name="Mobile Clubbing website"&gt;[http://www.mobile-clubbing.com/Seedsprouts/MobileClubbing/Display/EventList.aspx?period=past Mobile Clubbing website] retrieved on 2009-02-28&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next five months there were a further five events at other London train stations including [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo]], [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] and [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]].&lt;ref name="Mobile Clubbing Instructions"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070501081916/http://www.mobile-clubbing.com/eventsWeb/public/mobileclubbing/mcInstructions.aspx Mobile Clubbing Instructions] retrieved on 2007-05-01&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2008 there had been more than twenty of these events at similar venues throughout London, mostly train station concourses or other public spaces that lend themselves to expressive dancing and rapid dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=409998&amp;in_page_id=1770|title=i-Pod flashmobbers dance in their hundreds at station|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event in 2007 at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]], [[London]] involved 4,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 4,000 flash mob dancers startle commuters at Victoria | first = Tim | last = Stewart | work = [[Evening Standard]] | date = 2007-04-05 | accessdate = 2007-05-03 | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/4000-flash-mob-dancers-startle-commuters-at-victoria-7203786.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was broken up by police two hours later.

==Headphone concert==
[[File:Flaming Lips - headphone concert poster.png|thumb|left|A Flaming Lips poster promoting "The World's First Headphone Concerts"]]
A headphone concert is a [[live music]] performance where the audience, in the same venue as the performing artist, listens to the music through headphones.&lt;ref name="plug2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=[:]plug[:] (2005)|url=http://deletist.info/|work=deletist.info |accessdate=2016-08-23| date=2005-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050924230826/http://deletist.info/|archivedate=2005-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea originated in 1997 when [[Erik Minkkinen]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Sister Iodine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="placard2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=the placard headphone festival|url=http://www.leplacard.org/|work=leplacard.org |accessdate=2005-10-26| date=2005-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026233655/http://www.leplacard.org/|archivedate=2005-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; an electronic artist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v2.nl/archive/people/erik-minkkinen|title=Erik Minkkinen|website=V2_Institute for the Unstable Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/76850-Erik-Minkkinen|title=Erik Minkkinen|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Paris]], streamed a live concert from his closet over the internet to three listeners in Japan.&lt;ref name="wiredbyo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Axline|first=Keith|title=Fest Rocks With BYO Headphones|url=http://archive.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2005/08/68682|work=Wired.com entertainment music news|publisher=wired magazine|accessdate=2016-08-23|date=2005-08-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823160820/http://archive.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2005/08/68682|archivedate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept led to a decentralized organization known as ''le placard'' ("the Cupboard"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/Placard|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed anybody to establish a streaming or listening room.&lt;ref name="wiredbyo"/&gt;

The first headphone concert taking place in front of a live audience took place March 20, 1999, at the [[South by Southwest]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. The American psychedelic band [[The Flaming Lips]] used an FM signal generator at the venue and handed out mini [[FM radio]] receivers and headphones to each member of the audience. A normal speaker system was also used so the sound could also be felt. This continued on their "International Music Against Brain Degeneration Revue" tour with mixed results, with technical problems including dead batteries and intoxicated audience members having trouble tuning to the correct frequency.&lt;ref name="warner press archive"&gt;{{cite web|last=Booker|first=Scott|title=Partly Accurate Flaming Lips News|url=http://www.wbr.com/flaminglips/cmp/marnov99.htm|work=Archived News Relating To The Flaming Lips|accessdate=2013-02-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329221215/http://www.wbr.com/flaminglips/cmp/marnov99.htm|archivedate=2007-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another headphone concert was performed in the [[Chapter Arts Centre]], [[Cardiff]] in April 2000 by [[Rocketgoldstar]].&lt;ref name="BBC Music Live events unfold" /&gt;

Later headphone concerts used specially designed wireless 3-channel headphones, better in-house custom made transmitters and no speakers or any live PA in the venue.  Major events hosting headphone concerts included the 2005 [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[2010 Shift Festival]] in Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spirgi|first=Dominique|title=2010 Shift Festival english program|url=http://www.shiftfestival.ch/en/shift-2010/program/headphone-concerts/|work=2010 Shift Festival website|publisher=Shift  Electronic Arts Festival   Postfach CH-4023 Basel Switzerland|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2011-12 [[Van's Warp Tours]] across North America, [[Sensoria Music &amp; Film Festival|Sensoria 2012]] in [[Sheffield, UK]], the 2012 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] in Tennessee and the [[Hoxeyville Music Fest]] in Michigan.&lt;ref name="knoxnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brimer|first=Adam|title=Bonnaroo Silent Disco Day 1|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/photos/galleries/2012/jun/07/day-1-thursday-at-bonnaroo-2012/46908/|work=knox news|publisher=Knoxnews.com|accessdate=Dec 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Kid Koala]] performed a "Space Cadet Headphone Concert tour" around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/04/kid_koala_space_cadet_headphone_experience_april_4_review.php | title = Live: Kid Koala's Space Cadet Headphone Experience Crashes In Brooklyn - New York - Music - Sound of the City | accessdate = 2013-02-21 | last = Mlynar | first = Phillip | date = 2012-04-05 | publisher = [[Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of the headphone concert involves live bands competing for the audience, who are able to choose which band's frequency to receive. In August 2008, the first silent [[Battle of the Bands]] was held at [[Barfly (club)|The Barfly]] music venue in [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejoycollective.co.uk/blog/uncategorized/preview-silent-gig-featuring-kutosismuscle-club-and-others-barfly-wed-13th-august|title= Silent Gig featuring Kutosis/Muscle Club and others @ Barfly : Wed 13th August |publisher=Joy Collective|accessdate=2008-08-08|last=|first= | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event featured bands going directly head-to-head, with a stage at each end of the venue, allowing gig-goers to choose which group they wished to listen to.

==Silent theatre==
Theatre and performance companies are now beginning to exploit silent disco technology as well. In 2009, with the help of SilentArena Ltd, Feral Productions began using an experimental approach – a mixture of narrative-led performance, [[sound art]] and guided exhibit. Their first performance, ''The Gingerbread House'', took the audience from The [[Courtyard, Hereford]] on a journey through a [[multi-storey car park]] in the centre of Hereford. In 2010, their second show, ''Locked (Rapunzel’s Lament)'', took place in a children’s playground, also in Hereford. Silent theatre techniques are now being used by companies in Liverpool, Birmingham and Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/leisure/reviews/4715331.Thinking_out_of_the_dramatic_box/ |title=The Gingerbread House breaks dramatic boundaries in Hereford |accessdate= |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/leisure/theatre/8383794.New_theatre_group___s_hoping_for_another_fairytale_ending_at_The_Courtyard_in_Hereford/ |title=Feral Productions' hoping for another fairytale ending at The Courtyard in Hereford |accessdate= |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[Lincoln Center]] staged a production of the [[Rocky Horror Picture Show]] utilizing Quiet Events Headphones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quiet Theater|url=https://quietevents.com/quiet-theater/|website=Quiet Events|publisher=Quiet Events|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where an audience wearing headphones could switch between the audio for the live performance and the soundtrack of the film version being projected behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = ‘Rocky Horror’ at Lincoln Center, With Headphones|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/10/movies/rocky-horror-in-central-park-with-headphones.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-08-09|access-date = 2015-09-25|issn = 0362-4331|first = Dave|last = Itzkoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silent street shows ==
Street performers have used the concept as a solution to overcome bans on amplification and loudspeakers on the street. In 2016, Irish band [[Until April]] began using this for their shows on the street while touring in Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/86139/galway-duo-find-novel-way-to-overcome-amplifier-bans-on-continental-europe|title=Galway duo find novel way to overcome amplifier bans on continental Europe|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Songzhuang art colony''' (simplified Chinese: 宋庄艺术区; traditional Chinese: 宋莊藝術區`; pinyin: Sòng zhuāng), located in Songzhuang Town of [[Tongzhou District, Beijing|Tongzhou]] (in the eastern suburbs of [[Beijing]]), is the most famous and biggest artist community in Beijing. More than 2,000 artists live there.

Originally representing the [[avant-garde]], the area now accommodates artists who paint in varying styles, ranging from the avant-garde to the academic. Sculptors and photographers also call the area home.

==The character of Songzhuang art colony==

The previously institutionalized and socially motivated art system produced many of the initial artists of the Chinese avant-garde. Were it not for the breakaway radicals of the last two decades, there simply would be no artistic community in Songzhuang, even if its present concerns are perhaps more of a monetary rather than a sociological nature. With a shift catering more towards the foreign market occurring in the 1980s, and the rise of the [[nouveau-riche]] at the beginning of the new century, today it is both the growing upper middle class in the cosmopolitan cities as well as foreign collectors and galleries that have become the prominent collectors of contemporary art in China, though one would have to be über-cynical to suppose that the creative process has become wholly money-orientated to the modern artist living here. Far from it, in fact, a spirit of [[idealism]], a “Songzhuang spirit” well and truly exists, and can even be examined from a historical perspective, where the roots of the artistic community can be traced back to Yuanmingyuan, the grounds of the [[Old Summer Palace]] in the north-east of Beijing. It was there that in the 1980s, like-minded free spirits congregated, living relatively poorly, though freely, escaping from the [[rat race]] and pressures of modern society. Artists arrived from all over China, celebrating a creative community and period of intense artistic exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beijingtoday.com.cn/2013/10/songzhuang-remembers-20-years-cutting-edge-creation/ |title=Songzhuang remembers 20 years of cutting-edge creation |publisher=[[Beijing Today]] |date=27 Oct 2013 |accessdate=5 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searching for tranquility==
A trend was established for artists to migrate away from the cities and to form their own communities such as the famous [[Beijing East Village]]. It brought far-reaching consequences for the Chinese avant-garde scene, as focus shifted away from the emerging capitalistic distractions and political pressures and opportunity was given in a tranquil environment for inner reflection and deep contemplation. However, problems arose once the community began attracting attention/notoriety from the media, gallery owners and other quarters, making artistic life more difficult as the once relaxed and free atmosphere came under closer scrutiny. The 1993 [[documentary]] ‘Seeking Dreams on the Verge’, by the director [[Zhang Jiarui]], explores these issues.

In an effort to preserve the spirit of the avant-garde, Fang Lijun, Zhang Huiping and Yue Minjun took the bold initiative in the spring of 1994 to relocate from Yuanmingyuan to the farming area of Songzhuang Township, located between the [[Chaobai]] and Wenyue rivers in [[Tongzhou District, Beijing|Tong County]], 20&amp;nbsp;km away from central Beijing. [[Liu Wei (artist)|Liu Wei]], Zhang Huiping, Wang Qiang and [[Gao Huijun]] were also in this first wave of artists to move. By the end of the year Yang Shaobin, Ma Ziheng, Zhang Jianqiang, Shao Zhenpeng, [[Liu Fenghua]], Zhang Mingqiang, [[Wang Qiuren]] and [[Yao Junzhong]] joined them. With the accompaniment of renowned art critic [[Li Xianting]], who later became known as “ the Godfather of Songzhuang ”, a quite formidable group of talent had succeeded in keeping the flame burning for Chinese avant-garde art.

Here, the old style farmhouses, many with a small front courtyards or gardens, proved an ideal living and working space for the artists, more of whom would subsequently arrive following the official closure of the Yuanmingyuan community in 1995, this being in some part due to the latter’s proximity to Beijing’s university district. The communal artistic lifestyle and essence of the avant-garde was preserved and remained intact amongst the tribulations, albeit by transplantation to Songzhuang.

==Today==
About present day Songzhuang, native artist Cheng Da Qing said, “ The future of [[Chinese fine art]] is in Songzhuang ”. The artistic community now has over one thousand artists, centered mainly in the village of Xiaopu and spreading throughout Tuanli, Liuhe, [[Daxing]], Xindian, Lamazhuang, Renzhuang, Beisi, Baimiao and Xiaoyang. Painters, sculptors, photographers, writers, [[Conceptual art|conceptual]]/[[new media art]]ists and dreamers live side-by-side, the largest gathering of contemporary artists certainly in China if not in the world.

October 2005 saw the successful inauguration of an annual Songzhuang Art Festival, under the sponsorship of the Ministry of Culture, the Songzhuang Township Government, and the Songzhuang Art Promotion Society, when over six hundred works were shown along the 2&amp;nbsp;km main road in Xiaopu. The subsequent year’s festival used the newly constructed Songzhuang Art Museum and the East District Artistic Centre, strengthening Songzhuang's reputation as an arts community.

Travel to and from Beijing is convenient with local transport or taxi capable of making the journey in under an hour.

'''Stipple engraving''' is a technique used to create tone in an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] print by distributing a pattern of dots of various sizes and densities across the image. The pattern is created on the printing plate either in [[engraving]] by gouging out the dots with a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], or through an [[etching]] process.&lt;ref name=pankow/&gt; [[Stippling]] was used as an adjunct to conventional [[line engraving]] and etching for over two centuries, before being developed as a distinct technique in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt;

The technique allows for subtle tonal variations and is especially suitable for reproducing chalk drawings.&lt;ref name=verhoogt&gt;{{cite book|title=Art in Reproduction: Nineteenth-Century Prints after Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Jozef Israels and Ary Scheffer|first= Robert|last= Verhoogt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSDnRo7YrWwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Verhoogt,+Art+in+Reproduction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Xi0NT57ZJOquiQKfntSGBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=crayon%20manner&amp;f=false|page=77|isbn=978-90-5356-913-9|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Stipple effects were used in conjunction with other engraving techniques by artists as early as [[Giulio Campagnola]] (c.1482 – c. 1515) and [[Ottavio Leoni]] (1578 – 1630), although some of Campagnola's small prints were almost entirely in stipple.&lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Zucker in Kristin L. Spangenberg (ed), ''Six Centuries of Master Prints: Treasures from the Herbert Greer French collection'', Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993, nos 39 &amp; 40, {{ISBN|0-931537-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Holland in the seventeenth century, the printmaker and goldsmith [[Jan Lutma]] developed an engraving technique, known as ''opus mallei'', in which the dots are punched into the plate by an awl struck with a hammer, while in England the faces of portraits were engraved with stippled dots by [[William Rogers (engraver)|William Rogers]] in the sixteenth century and [[Lucas Vorsterman]] in the seventeenth.&lt;ref name=salaman&gt;{{cite book|title=The Old Engravers of England in Their Relation to Contemporary Life and Art|first= Malcolm C.|last= Salaman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZh5Bl3_zb8C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq|pages=204–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eighteenth century==
[[File:Duchess of Richmond, 1775 stipple engraving.jpg|thumb|''The Duchess of Richmond'', a stipple engraving portrait by [[William Wynne Ryland]] after [[Angelica Kauffman]] (1775)]]

An etched stipple technique known as the '''crayon manner''', suitable for producing imitations of chalk drawings, was pioneered in France.  Gilles Demarteau used in 1756 goldsmith's chasing tools and marking-wheels to shade the lines in a series of ''Trophies'' designed by [[Antoine Watteau]]. [[Jean-Charles François]] who was a partner of Demarteau further developed the technique and used it to engrave the whole plate. François engraved in 1757 three etchings directly on copper in crayon manner.  He then used the technique to etch three plates using different-size needles bound together.  Other people who contributed to this new  engraving technique included Alexis Magny and Jean-Baptiste Delafosse.&lt;ref name=verhoogt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ward&gt;Gerald W. R. Ward, 'The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art', Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Wynne Ryland]], who had worked with Jean-Charles François,&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt; took the crayon manner to Britain, using it in his contributions to Charles Roger’s publication ''A Collection of Prints in imitation of Drawings'',&lt;ref name=verhoogt/&gt; and developing it further under the name of  "stipple engraving".&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt;

The process of stipple engraving is described in [[Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding|T.H. Fielding]]'s ''Art of Engraving'' (1841). To begin with an etching ground is laid on the plate. The outline is drawn out in small dots with an etching needle, and the darker areas of the image shaded with a pattern of close dots. As in [[mezzotint]] use was made of ''roulettes'', and a ''mattoir'' to produce large numbers of dots relatively quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 78&lt;/ref&gt;  Then the plate is bitten with acid, and the etching ground removed. The lighter areas of shade are then laid in with a [[drypoint]] or a stipple graver; Fielding describes the latter as "resembling the common kind, except that the blade bends down instead of up, thereby allowing the engraver greater facility in forming the small holes or dots in the copper". The etched middle and dark tones would also be deepened where appropriate with the graver.&lt;ref name=fielding&gt;{{cite book|last=Fielding|first=T.H.|title=The Art of Engraving|pages=63–64|publisher=Ackerman &amp; Co.|location=London|year=1841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the technique fed a fashion for reproductions of red chalk drawings by artists such as [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  [[Gilles Demarteau]] etched 266 drawings of Boucher in stipple, for printing in an appropriate [[sanguine]]-coloured ink and framing.&lt;ref name=grif&gt;[[Antony Griffiths|Griffiths, Antony]], ''Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques'', pp 81, British Museum Press (in UK), 2nd ed., 1996 {{ISBN|0-7141-2608-X}}; [[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 587-588, {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These prints so resembled red chalk drawings that they could be framed as little pictures. They could then be hung in the small blank spaces of the elaborately decorated paneling of residences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/94303/rec/1 Alpheus Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints &amp; People: A Social History of Printed Pictures]'', Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), 1 January 1971, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt;

In England the technique was used for "furniture prints" with a similar purpose, and became very popular, though regarded with disdain by producers of the portrait mezzotints that dominated the English portrait print market.  Stipple competed with mezzotint as a tonal method of [[printmaking]], and while it lacked the rich depth of tone of mezzotint, it had the great advantage that far more impressions could be taken from a plate.&lt;ref name=grif/&gt;

During the late eighteenth century, some printmakers, including [[Francesco Bartolozzi]], began to use colour in stipple engraving. Rather than using separate plates for each colour, as in most colour printing processes of the time, such as [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]]'s three-colour mezzotint method, the different colours were carefully applied with a brush to a single plate for each impression,&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt; a highly skilled operation which soon proved economically unviable.&lt;ref name=pankow&gt;{{cite book|title=Tempting the Palette: a survey of color printing processes|first=David|last= Pankow|publisher=RIT Cary Graphic Arts Press|year=2005 |page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zDi3b3nf3oC&amp;q=yielding+a+single+print#v=snippet&amp;q=yielding%20a%20single%20print&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-1-933360-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method is also known as ''à la poupée'' after the French term for the small cotton pads used for the inking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/clrflimpr-tech.shtm NGA Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4631">'''Symphony No. 1''' is a four-movement [[orchestra]]l composition by American composer [[Bernard Herrmann]].  The work was jointly commissioned in 1940 by [[CBS]] and the [[New York Philharmonic]] and was completed March 29, 1941, though Herrmann revised the work in 1973.  It premiered July 27, 1941 at the [[CBS Radio]] Theater, with Herrmann conducting the [[Columbia Symphony Orchestra|CBS Symphony Orchestra]].  Though he would continue to compose [[Classical music|concert music]] and [[film score]]s throughout his later life, the symphony would be Herrmann's last foray into [[Absolute music|nonprogrammatic]] music.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, p. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and composition==
The symphony has a duration of roughly 35 minutes and is composed in four movements:&lt;ref name="FSM"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Mark |title=Herrmann Centennial Concert Work Series: Symphony No. 1 |work=[[Film Score Monthly]] |date=March 8, 2011 |url=http://filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm/articleID/6634/Herrmann-Centennial-Concert-Work-Series--Symphony-No.-1/ |accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Maestoso: Allegro pesante
#Scherzo
#Andante sostenuto
#Rondo: Epilogue à la processional
On the experience of composing [[absolute music]], Herrmann said, "For the first time I was not confined to the outline of a story. It was not necessary to depict waves, portray the anguish of a lost soul, or look for a love theme... Consequently, working on the Symphony I had a Roman holiday."&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;  Albert Imperato of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' compared the music favorably with that of other [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] composers [[Samuel Barber]], [[William Walton]], and [[William Schuman]].&lt;ref name="Gramophone"&gt;{{cite web |last=Imperato |first=Albert |title=My Weekend With Bernie: Getting beyond Herrmann's famed film scores |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=July 7, 2011 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/blog/new-york-insider/my-weekend-with-bernie |accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Initial critical response to the symphony was favorable, though the work has fallen into relative obscurity since its premiere.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;  In 2011, Brian Gittis of ''[[The Paris Review]]'' called the work "an underappreciated symphony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gittis |first=Brian |title=Who is Bernard Herrmann? |work=[[The Paris Review]] |date= June 23, 2011|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/06/23/who-is-bernard-herrmann/ |accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'''s Albert Imperato also argued for a reassessment of the piece, calling it "more than a curiosity."&lt;ref name="Gramophone" /&gt;  Herrmann biographer Steven C. Smith further commented: {{quote|After the innovations of ''[[Citizen Kane|Kane]]'' and ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (film)|All That Money Can Buy]]'' and the orchestral originality of ''Moby Dick'', Herrmann's Symphony seems in some ways a step back, a retreat to concert [[Neoromanticism (music)|Neo-Romanticism]]. [...] Although Herrmann apparently enjoyed the process of its composition, the Symphony illustrates Herrmann's uneasiness working in a rigidly formal structure. It also suffers from the fragmentation that characterizes most of Herrmann's output, a quality ideal for radio and film but not for the concert hall. Yet the Symphony was an impressive achievement for the thirty-year-old Herrmann: a mature, brilliantly orchestrated work whose power increases on subsequent listenings. Its traditional idiom makes it the most accessible of Herrmann's concert works and the most likely candidate for rediscovery (especially in its 1973 revised form).&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;}}

{{nihongo|'''''Sōgetsu-ryū'''''|草月流|}} is a school of ''[[Ikebana]]'', or [[Japan]]ese floral art.

== History ==
[[File:Teshigahara Sofu.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The founder Sōfu Teshigahara in 1948]]
Sogetsu was founded by [[Sōfu Teshigahara]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikebanahq.org/sogetsu.php|title=Ikebana International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sofu's father was an Ikebana master, who taught his son from childhood.  Sofu wanted to become a painter, but he found that the possibilities for creative expression in using green materials are endless, just as in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kadensho, the book of flowers|last=Teshigahara|first=Sofu|publisher=Sogetsu Shuppan Inc.|year=1979|isbn=4-88145-001-8|location=|pages=9–12|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He found that the strict rules of traditional ikebana did not allow individual expression. He broke away from traditional ikebana and formed his school in 1926.&lt;ref name="sogetsu.or.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sogetsu.or.jp/e/know/about/timeline/|title=IKEBANA SOGETSU Time-line - Know Sogetsu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the beginning, he promoted the school through radio.

As of 2016, there have been four headmasters.  Sofu's daughter Kazumi was a gifted artist. She became the second headmaster until she died at age 47.  Her elder brother, film director [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]], took over.  The current headmaster is Akane, Sofu's granddaughter.&lt;ref name="sogetsu.or.jp"/&gt;

The Sogetsu school is an open-minded and avant-gardist school. The school was one of the first to have English textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Ikebana|last=Beunen|first=Ilse|publisher=Stichting Kunstboek|year=2015|isbn=978-90-5856-504-4|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ikebana DSC 9552 (13032184793).jpg|thumb|Free-style arrangement]]
A famous saying by Sofu Teshigahara and credo of the Sogetsu school is that Sogetsu can be done by anyone, anywhere, anytime with any kind of material. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ikebana Sogetsu|last=Teshigahara|first=Hiroshi|publisher=Shufunotomo co., Ltd.|year=1986|isbn=4-07-974618-0|location=|pages=1|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is led by Akane Teshigahara, the founder's granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sogetsu.or.jp/e/akane/profile/|title=IKEBANA SOGETSU Profile - Sogetsu and Akane Teshigahara|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted practitioners include Master Instructor Koka Fukushima, whose masterclasses worldwide have received acclaim in floral art circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2005/08/13/people/koka-fukushima/|title=Koka Fukushima|first=Vivienne|last=Kenrick|date=13 August 2005|publisher=|via=Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Sogetsu-Kaikan-Akasaka-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Sōgetsu Hall headquarters in Tokyo]] 

The headquarters was constructed by the architect [[Kenzo Tange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sogetsu.or.jp/e/know/hall/|title=IKEBANA SOGETSU Sogetsu HQ Building - Know Sogetsu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Styles ==
''Sōgetsu'' typically uses either a tall, narrow vase such as one made from a bamboo stem, or a flat, open dish in which the flowers and branches are fixed in a hidden [[kenzan]] spiked support. However, other forms are possible, including highly elaborate creations that fill an entire hall.  The arrangements in a tall vase are called Nageire, the once in a shallow container are called Moribana.

One of ''Sōgetsu'''s central ideas is that an arrangement should have three strong elements, each with certain proportions and arranged at a certain angle. But there is considerable latitude to work with whatever materials are available and to express the spirit of the moment.

'''''The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno, and the Network Battle for the Night''''' is a 1994 [[non-fiction]] book written by ''[[The New York Times]]'' media reporter Bill Carter.&lt;!--different [[Bill Carter]] than WP article and writer of Miss Sarajevo--&gt; It chronicles the early 1990s conflict surrounding the American [[late-night talk show]] ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. The book was later made into a [[The Late Shift (film)|film of the same name]] by [[HBO]].

==Contents==
The book chronicles the behind-the-scenes corporate battle surrounding American [[late-night talk show]]s, leading up to, and after, [[Johnny Carson]]'s 1992 retirement as host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. The book primarily details the power struggle between [[David Letterman]] and [[Jay Leno]] to succeed Carson as the "King of Late Night", NBC choosing Leno over Letterman as the next ''Tonight Show'' host, and Letterman later moving to rival network [[CBS]].

==Cast of characters==
The following is a partial list of people featured in the book:

;Major principals
* [[Johnny Carson]]: Host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' from 1962 to 1992.
* [[Jay Leno]]: Permanent guest host of ''The Tonight Show'' since 1987. Chosen by [[NBC]] to succeed Carson as host.
* [[David Letterman]]: Host of NBC's 12:30am show ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' since 1982. After being bypassed as Carson's successor in favor of Leno, moves to rival network [[CBS]] in 1993.

;Others
* [[Helen Kushnick]]: Leno's tough manager who helps him secure his spot as Carson's successor. Becomes executive producer of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', but her fierce tactics eventually force both NBC and Leno to fire her.
* [[Peter Lassally]]: Executive producer of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and later ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. Becomes an unofficial counselor to Letterman after Leno is selected to succeed Carson.
* [[Michael Ovitz]]: Head of the [[Creative Artists Agency]] from 1975 to 1995. Hired by Letterman to negotiate his move from NBC to another network, studio, or syndicator (eventually CBS).
* [[Howard Stringer]]: President of CBS from 1988 to 1995. After several unsuccessful attempts to break NBC's ratings stranglehold on the late night hours, negotiates to bring Letterman to his network.
* [[Brandon Tartikoff]]: President of NBC's entertainment division from 1981 to 1991. Instrumental in helping to build NBC's 1980s late night lineup of Carson and Letterman, as well as signing Leno to be Carson's permanent guest host in 1987.
* [[Bob Wright]]: President of NBC from 1986 to 2007. Tries to negotiate to keep Letterman on NBC.
* [[John Agoglia]]: NBC executive from 1980 to 1998 and supporter of Leno.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Lowry |title=John Agoglia, Top NBC Exec in 'Must-See TV' Era, Dies at 76|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/people-news/john-agoglia-top-nbc-exec-in-must-see-tv-era-dead-at-76-1201138124/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher= |date=2014-03-25 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In a review of ''The Late Shift'' for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', Jon Katz wrote, "[This] is a reporter's book, unfailingly balanced, thoroughly researched, filled with scoops and fresh details. Even though CBS's wooing and winning of Mr. Letterman was the subject of enormous publicity, Mr. Carter's book makes clear that we knew less than we thought about what was really going on."&lt;ref name="katz" /&gt; Katz criticized the book for not going into more depth about Letterman's switch to CBS, writing, "As readable as it is, 'The Late Shift' needed to take a more critical, detached look at the long-term significance of Mr. Letterman's move. A number of questions are not addressed."&lt;ref name="katz" /&gt;  He concluded, "'The Late Shift' is nonetheless a powerful story, and ultimately a sad one, filled with casualties as well as winners. Mr. Leno, who has been made to seem a second choice by the very people who elevated him, has been betrayed by his employers in the most basic of ways, and he has not yet recovered."&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Katz| first=Jon|title=The Late Shift|journal=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|volume=99|page=11|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]| date =February 20, 1994 |issn=0028-7806 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim Campbell reviewed the book for ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', and commented, "More than just a play-by-play account of the actions that followed Johnny Carson's 1991 retirement announcement, Carter's well-written book is a look at the history of the late-night franchise, and of the men who host the shows that we would rather watch instead of going to bed."&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; Campbell described the book as revealing in its assessment of NBC's decision to pass over Letterman for ''The Tonight Show'', concluding, "Carter's eye-opening book leaves the impression that NBC will be remembered more for its loss of Letterman, than for its role as creator of late-night television."&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Campbell| first=Kim|title=The Late Shift|journal=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] (Eastern edition)|page=17| date = March 11, 1994|issn=0882-7729 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
[[Helen Kushnick]], Jay Leno's manager at the time of Carson's retirement who was pushed out following her heavy-handed tactics, filed a $30 million lawsuit against Bill Carter, claiming [[libel]]. Specifically, her case related to a claim that she planted a story about Carson's retirement in a New York City [[Tabloid journalism#As a sensational.2C gossip-filled newspaper|tabloid]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Michael. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR120352.html?categoryid=3&amp;cs=1 "Dish: Fox backing off the gay buss"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 21 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The then-pending lawsuit was noted in the closing credits of the film, as the Broadway tune "[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]" plays.  The lawsuit settled out of court for an undisclosed sum; Kushnick died of cancer in August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Shales | first = Tom | coauthors =  | title = Tom Shales on the villains in the Leno-O'Brien fiasco at NBC | work = [[The Washington Post]] | language =  | publisher = [[The Washington Post Company]] | date =  January 19, 2010| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/18/AR2010011803528.html | accessdate =  2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Discuss before changing this to an infobox. This is a painting with a lot of intricate detail and looks like an incomprehensible smear at infobox default size --&gt;[[File:Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael - Two Watermills and an Open Sluice - WGA20479.jpg|right|upright=1.8|thumb|''Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice''|alt=Painting of two working water mills]]

'''''Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice''''', also known as '''''Two Watermills and an Open Sluice''''', '''''Two Undershot Water Mills with an Open Sluice''''' is a 1653 painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]. It is in the collection of the [[Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Slive|2011|p=56}}

The painting shows two working undershot water mills, with the major one being half-timbered with a cob-facade construction, tie beams, and vertical plank gable. This is characteristic of the water mills in the [[County of Bentheim (district)|Bentheim]] area in Germany, to where Ruisdael had travelled in the early 1650s.{{sfn|Slive|2011|p=56}} This painting is one of six known variations on this theme and the only one that is dated.&lt;ref name="Getty"/&gt;

Although other Western artists had depicted water mills before, Ruisdael was the first to make it the focal subject in a painting.{{sfn|Slive|2011|p=54}} [[Meindert Hobbema]], Ruisdael's pupil, started working on the water mills subject in the 1660s. Today Hobbema is more strongly associated with water mills than his teacher.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=130}}

The painting is known by various names. The painting is called ''Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice'' in [[Seymour Slive]]'s 2001 catalogue raisonné of Ruisdael, catalogue number 119.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=130}}  In his 2011 book on Ruisdael's mills and water mills Slive calls it ''Two Undershot Water Mills with an Open Sluice''.{{sfn|Slive|2011|p=56}} The Getty Museum calls it ''Two Watermills and an Open Sluice''  on their website, object number 82.PA.18.&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Watermills and an Open Sluice|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/699/jacob-van-ruisdael-two-watermills-and-an-open-sluice-dutch-1653/|publisher=[[Getty Museum]]|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
