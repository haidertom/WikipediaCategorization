{{nihongo|'''''Aerobiz'''''|エアーマネジメント 大空に賭ける||"Air Management: Ōzora ni Kakeru"}} is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] [[game console]]s, released in 1992 by [[Koei]].&lt;ref name=MobyGames&gt;{{cite web|title=Aerobiz Game Information|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/aerobiz|publisher=MobyGames|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also released for the [[FM Towns]], [[PC-9800 Series|PC-9801]] and [[X68000]] computer platforms in Japan.

As [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of a budding international [[airline]], the player has a limited amount of time to expand their business to become the industry leader against three other airlines (either [[artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled or human opponents). The player has an amount of control over how their airline develops, such as the name, investments, what routes to fly, plane purchases, and other various aspects, while at the mercy of world events such as politics (for instance, if the player runs his or her airline out of Moscow, he or she can initially only buy Soviet planes and will have a harder time negotiating with Western nations&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.29&lt;/ref&gt;) and natural disasters. The player can also get the company involved in peripheral businesses such as [[hotel]]s and shuttle services.&lt;ref name=MobyGames/&gt; Once [[Perestroika]] is initiated, then the Cold War restrictions no longer apply in the game.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.59&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequel ''[[Aerobiz Supersonic]]'' was released in August 1994 for the SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis. The player is presented with a wider variety of options in nearly everything, but the game play is much the same. Another sequel known as ''Air Management '96'' was released only in Japan for the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Management '96 Game Information|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/air-management-96|publisher=MobyGames|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Aerobiz features two timeframes to play the game through: 1963 to 1995, and 1983 to 2015. After selecting the timeframe, the players then choose a city for their airline's headquarters. This allows a certain amount of handicapping: some cities, such as [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], and [[Tokyo]], start the player with many airplanes and a large amount of money; others, such as [[Lima]], [[Nairobi]], and [[Honolulu]], start the player with only a couple of airplanes and a small amount of money. The players then select a difficulty level, which affects the number of passengers, world events (and the reactions of the passengers to those world events), and the win conditions. A charter system of independent airlines can have their shares bought or sold on the stock market; owning at least 51% of the company makes it eligible to be assimilated into the main airline.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

The gameplay is superficially straightforward: players negotiate for access slots at each airport, buy airplanes, then open routes and start business. After each player has made their desired moves, the game shows any world events that affect the players (for instance, a labor strike will delay shipments of aircraft from that company, while the Olympic Games will boost traffic worldwide, particularly to the host city). The game then shows the results of direct competition between airlines flying the same routes, then the quarterly results of sales, expenses, profits, and passengers flown. After the January–March quarter of every year, it also shows annual results. There are elements of enhancing airline service, such as improving the convenience of arrivals/departures, along with reductions in fare, improving the quality of service along with advertising campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.36-37, 40-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is won by the first player to achieve the win conditions: link all 22 cities and carry a certain number of passengers (between 2.5 million and 4.5 million, based on difficulty level), all while remaining profitable. If a player goes for four quarters with a negative balance, the company is declared bankrupt and offered reorganization. If the game goes for 32 years (128 turns) without any player meeting the win conditions, the game is called a loss.

|award1Pub = ''MegaTech''

}}
''[[MegaTech]]'' magazine said the game had massive potential, and that "strategy buffs will cream over it".

===Scenarios===
; Scenario 1
: This scenario starts in 1963 with the intense competition for the airlines heating up with aircraft that can fly for longer distances without re-fueling. All airlines are desperately trying to cross the long [[Pacific Ocean]] in the quest for intercontinental superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.12-13&lt;/ref&gt;
; Scenario 2
: This scenario starts in 1983 with the [[supersonic aircraft|supersonic airplane]] become the hottest topic in the airline industry.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook pp.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Cowan''' (born 13 December 1936) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] former [[rally driver]], and the founder and senior director of [[Ralliart|Mitsubishi Ralliart]] until his retirement on 30 November 2005.

==Early years==
Cowan was raised in [[Duns]], a small town in the [[Scottish Borders]], where he established a longstanding close friendship with future [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One world champion]] [[Jim Clark]], also a young farmer and the same age as himself. According to Cowan their lifestyles were a great help in their subsequent careers: ''"We each had to have a car. We were able to drive in fields, off road, and of course through all the twisty roads around here where there was practically no traffic in those days. That definitely refined our driving skills. We had advantages that other drivers didn't."''&lt;ref name="scot"&gt;[http://motors.scotsman.com/features.cfm?id=2450592005 "Borders farmer who cultivated speed, honour and Mitsubishi"], Rick Wilson, ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 23 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men were active in the [[Berwick and District Motor Club]] during the 1950s, but while Clark gravitated to open-wheeled racing, Cowan ventured off-road, and took part in the 1960 [[RAC Rally]], eventually finishing 43rd of over 200 starters in a [[Sunbeam Rapier]]. Impressed by his success, his father bought him a newer, more powerful Rapier as a replacement, and behind the wheel of his new vehicle, he won the 1962 [[Scottish Rally]], an achievement he later declared to be his "Most Important Moment". He returned the following year to successfully defend his title,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottishrally.co.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=Previous_Winners&amp;menu=SpectatorMenu RSAC Scottish Rally – Previous winners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501071452/http://www.scottishrally.co.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=Previous_Winners&amp;menu=SpectatorMenu |date=May 1, 2006 }}, ScottishRally.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result the [[Rootes Group]] invited him to become their 'works' driver.&lt;ref name="scot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imps4ever.info/racing/rallies/cowan.html "Andrew Cowan"], ''The Imp Site''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behind the wheel==
Once established as a professional driver, Cowan had many notable successes with both Rootes and subsequently [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], for whom he signed in 1972. Aside from his two Scottish Rally titles, he won the first two [[London-Sydney Marathon]]s in 1968 and 1977,&lt;ref name="scot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marathon68.homestead.com/billkneipp.html Pictorial account of the 1968 London – Sydney Marathon], Bill Kneipp&lt;/ref&gt; five consecutive [[Southern Cross Rally|Southern Cross Rallies]] (1972–76), the 1977 [[Rallye Bandama Côte d'Ivoire]], and the world's longest rally, the 20,000-mile South American Marathon in 1978. He was also competitive in the [[Safari Rally]] where he recorded a top four finish four times in five years, and latterly the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]] where his best result was second overall in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=profile&amp;driverid=5856 Profile and international competitive record of Andrew Cowan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104164347/http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=profile&amp;driverid=5856 |date=January 4, 2007 }}, RallyBase.nl&lt;/ref&gt; He retired as a driver in 1990.&lt;ref name="scot"/&gt;

For his achievements in 1977, he was awarded the British Guild of Motoring Writers' ''Driver of the Year'' Award, the ''Jim Clark Memorial Trophy'' for "outstanding achievement by a Scottish driver", and the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]]'s ''[[John Cobb (racing driver)|John Cobb]] Trophy'' for a British driver of outstanding success.

==Behind a desk==
In 1983, [[Mitsubishi Motors]] asked him to establish a [[Europe]]an base for their motorsport activities, and so he founded [[Andrew Cowan Motorsports (ACMS)]]. Based in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]], it would evolve into [[Ralliart|Mitsubishi Ralliart Europe]], and his cars took [[Tommi Makinen]] to four consecutive [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|WRC Drivers']] titles ([[1996 World Rally Championship season|1996]] to [[1999 World Rally Championship season|1999]]), as well as winning Mitsubishi their only [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|manufacturers' crown]] in [[1998 World Rally Championship season|1998]].

In 2003, Mitsubishi Motors officially took over the business and renamed it Mitsubishi Motorsport, although Cowan remained as "Sporting Advisor" for the next two years until his retirement aged 69.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carpages.co.uk/mitsubishi/mitsubishi_takes_over_andrew_cowan_motorsports_06_04_03.asp "Mitsubishi Motors Takes Over Andrew Cowan Motorsports"], Carpages.co.uk, 6 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Cowan took part in the ''[[Colin McRae]] Forest Stages Rally'', a round of the [[Scottish Rally Championship]]. He was one of a number of former rally drivers to take part in the event in memory of McRae, who died in 2007.

'''Beijing Benz''' (officially '''Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd''') is an [[Automotive industry|automotive]] manufacturing company headquartered in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and a [[joint venture]] between [[BAIC Motor]] and [[Daimler AG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mercedes-benz.com.cn/content/china/mpc/mpc_china_website/enng/home_mpc/passengercars/home/passengercars_world/about_company/daimler.html|title=Daimler Northeast Asia |publisher=Mercedes-Benz China |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dameofficial&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ar2009.daimler.com/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes/2-significant-acquisitions-and-dispositions-of-interests-in-companies-and-of-other-disposals-of-assets-and-liabilities.html |title=2009 Annual Report, 2.

Originally established in 1984 as Beijing Jeep Corporation ({{zh|s=北京吉普汽车有限公司}}) by BAIC Motor with [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC), it was the first Chinese auto-making joint venture with a Western partner. It continued after AMC was acquired by Chrysler in 1987 and after Chrysler merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz AG in 1998.

As of 2016, Beijing Benz assembles and manufactures the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]] (long wheelbase), and [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|C-Class]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;For assembly of vehicles, see {{cite web |url=http://ar2009.daimler.com/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes/34-related-party-relationships.html |title=2009 Annual Report, 34.

==History==
The history of this company goes back to Beijing Jeep Corporation (BJC), which was the first Sino-foreign automobile joint venture in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher |first=Kevin |title=Handbook on Trade and the Environment |year=2010 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=9781848446045 |page=152 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=LpHiobgEuMgC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=Beijing+Jeep+Corporation+(BJC)+was+the+first+Sino-foreign+automobile+joint+venture+in+China |accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a prototype for future cooperative projects and BJC became a test case revealing problems, both political and economic, that would appear for other investors the Chinese hoped to attract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harwit |first=Eric |title=China's Automobile Industry: Policies, Problems and Prospects: Policies, Problems and Prospects |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781315286792 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=aooYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68&amp;lpg=PT68&amp;dq=The+company+would+be+a+test+case,+one+that+would+reveal+the+kinds+of+problems,+both+political+and+economic,+that+would+appear+for+other+investors+the+Chinese+hoped+to+attract |accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current name, Beijing Benz, was established in 2005 and the enterprise now owned by [[Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd|Beiqi]] and [[Daimler AG]].&lt;ref&gt;For pedigree, see {{cite news|url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/07/content_397951.htm |first= Yu |last=Qiao |title=JV renamed Beijing Benz-DaimlerChrysler |newspaper=China Daily |date=7 December 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}

===American Motors===

Beijing Benz grew out of what was originally the Beijing Jeep Corporation ({{zh|s=北京吉普汽车有限公司}}), China's first Sino-western automotive [[joint venture]] having been established in 1984 with [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]].&lt;ref name="cd"/&gt;

American Motors began negotiations in 1979 to sell its vehicles in China and gain access to then low-cost Chinese labor.&lt;ref name=manngeneric&gt;{{cite book| last=Mann |first=Jim |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=zss6RUl6UDYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=beijing%20jeep%20a%20case%20study%20of%20western%20business%20in%20china |title=Beijing Jeep: A Case Study of Western Business in China |publisher=Westview Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8133-3327-4 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese wanted more-modern automotive technology; Beijing Jeep suited the needs of both parties and produced the American Motors [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]] in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name=manngeneric/&gt; While talks began in the late 1970s, operation started in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Doing business in China: the last great market - Page 192 Geoffrey Murray - 1994 "BEIJING JEEP Finally in this chapter, I want to return to the ongoing story of Beijing Jeep.

Beijing Jeep has since become well known as an example of early [[foreign direct investment|FDI]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Needle| first = David| title = Business in Context: An Introduction to Business and Its Environment| publisher = Cengage Learning EMEA| year = 2010| edition=5| pages=42–44| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kJsDgcqM6tcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq='Business%20in%20Context&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn=978-1-84480-613-3 }}

===Chrysler===
[[File:Chinajeep.jpg|thumb|Beijing BJ2500 in 2004, a Jeep XJ with a facelifted front end]]

When Chrysler purchased American Motors in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DALX2AsrZTcC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=chrysler%20american%20motors&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=chrysler%20american%20motors&amp;f=false | title=Chrysler | publisher=MotorBooks International | author=Adler, Dennis | year=2000 | pages=15 | isbn=9781610608718}}&lt;/ref&gt; its Jeep brand came with an unexpected boon, Beijing Jeep. A few Chrysler models were subsequently added to the Chinese company's product line including the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]], [[Mitsubishi Pajero Sport]], and the [[Mitsubishi Outlander]], as well as some Beijing Jeep-branded, locally developed vehicles.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Chrysler no longer had any ownership in Beijing Jeep as of early 2009 due to the failure of its [[Daimler AG#Merger with Chrysler|attempt to acquire the maker of Mercedes-Benz models]]. That German company, [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], kept the profitable China manufacturing operation for itself once it was clear the merger was a failed prospect.&lt;ref name="pullout"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://autonews.gasgoo.com/auto-news/1015204/Guangzhou-Fiat-JV-to-make-Chrysler-Jeep-in-Changsha.html|first=George |last=Gao |title=Guangzhou-Fiat JV to make Chrysler Jeep in Changsha|publisher=gasgoo.com |newspaper=Automotive News |date=17 May 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic manufacture of Jeep-branded vehicles ceased in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324266904578461320642086556 | title=Chrysler's Jeep Faces Uphill Climb in China | publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company | work=WSJ.com | date=May 9, 2013 | accessdate=19 September 2013 | first1=Mike | last1=Ramsey | first2=Christina | last2=Rogers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer Jeep models are now being produced at a joint venture between [[Guangzhou Automobile Group]] and [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]], current owner of the Chrysler and Jeep brands, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-23/marchionne-arrives-late-to-china-party-with-fiat-viaggio.html | title=Marchionne Arrives Late To China Party with Fiat Viaggio | publisher=Bloomberg LP | work=bloomberg.com | date=Apr 23, 2012 | accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daimler AG===
During Chrysler's short-lived partnership with Daimler AG, maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, production at Beijing Jeep was expanded to include Mercedes-Benz-branded products. Its legal name was changed to Beijing Benz-DaimlerChrysler Automotive Co Ltd,&lt;ref name=cd/&gt; with then [[German Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schroeder]] in attendance at the 2004 naming ceremony.&lt;ref name=cd&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/07/content_397951.htm |first= Yu |last=Qiao |title=JV renamed Beijing Benz-DaimlerChrysler |newspaper=China Daily |date=7 December 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Chrysler was removed from the company in 2009, it remained in its legal name&lt;ref name="pullout"/&gt; for several more years.

The company started producing the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]] locally in 2006 and the [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|C-Class]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=fut/&gt; Manufacture of Chrysler-branded models continued until at least 2008.&lt;ref name=orac/&gt; This included the 300C and Sebring, which were both locally produced and imported.&lt;ref name=important&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-06/07/content_889631.htm |title=Beijing Benz-DaimlerChrysler recalls defective sedans |agency=Xinhua |newspaper=China Daily |date=7 June 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2010, the E-Class was assembled from [[knock-down kit]]s with a low localization rate of about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;For knock-down assembly of E-Class, see "China's domestically-made Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedans to get off the line in Beijing". ''China Business News''. Shanghai: May 31, 2010.

Incidentally, Daimler had previously cooperated with [[FAW Group]] to produce the then-recently discontinued [[Mercedes-Benz W123]] (200 and 230E) sedans although these did not prove popular. Between January 1988 and sometimes in 1990, a mere 828 units were assembled in Changchun most of which were 230s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/cd30th/2011-06/01/content_12632372.htm | title=The Cherokees that sparked revolution | publisher=China Daily | work=chinadaily.com.cn | date=2011-06-01 | accessdate=9 December 2014 | last = Sutcliffe | first = Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnfol1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://auto.cnfol.com/110707/169,1684,10214074,00.shtml | title = 比奥迪国产早1年 奔驰E级9代车型历史解析 |trans-title=A year before the Audi: A history of nine generations of the Mercedes E-class | language = Chinese | publisher = www.cnfol.com | date = 2011-07-07 | accessdate = 2014-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few dozen of the long wheelbase 230E (V123) were among the cars assembled.&lt;ref name=cnfol1/&gt;

'''Business Bay''' ({{lang-ar|الخليج التجاري}}: ''Al-Khaleej Al-Tijari'') is a [[central business district]] under construction in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. The project features numerous skyscrapers located in an area where [[Dubai Creek]] has been dredged and extended. Business Bay will have upwards of 240 buildings, comprising commercial and residential developments. The infrastructure of Business Bay has been completed in 2008, and the entire development is expected to be completed between 2012-2015.&lt;ref name="dubai-properties2"&gt;http://dubai-properties.ae/en/Flexible_Images/FactSheets/BBE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Business Bay is part of the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashed Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Ruler of Dubai. Business Bay will be a new 'city' within the city of Dubai and is being built as a commercial, residential and [[business cluster]] along a new extension of Dubai Creek extending from Ras Al Khor to Sheikh Zayed Road. Covering an area of {{convert|64000000|sqft|m2}}, once completed it will be composed of office and residential towers set in landscaped gardens with a network of roads, pathways and canals. It will become the region's business capital as well as a freehold city.&lt;ref name="dubai-properties2"/&gt;

==Development==

[[File:Business Bay Advertisement on 30 January 2007.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Business Bay, Dubai]]

==Bay Square==

Bay Square is a mixed-use community within Business Bay. The entire development will be a pedestrian-only zone, and will include walkways over canals. It will cover over {{convert|2400000|sqft|m2}} and will be located 1&amp;nbsp;km away from Sheikh Zayed Road within Business Bay. When completed it will comprise canals, sidewalks, restaurants, cafes and retail stores.
It will have {{convert|1600000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of office space; Bay Square will host numerous small and medium-sized enterprises. When Bay Square completes there will be approximately 575 offices with an average size of {{convert|2000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Bay Square is expected to be completed in 2010.

==The Executive Towers==

The [[Executive Towers]] at Business Bay consist of 12 towers, which includes residential, commercial and office towers. These are the first buildings to be completed in Business Bay and are located near its entrance. A three-storey podium connects all the towers in addition to the nearby [[Vision Tower]], which is going to be connected by a special passage.&lt;ref&gt;Vision Tower brochure, can be downloaded here [http://www.dubai-properties.ae/media.php?id=379] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bay Avenue==

Bay Avenue is an arena of two levels of indoor and outdoor retail space. It will have cafes, restaurants, boutiques, showrooms, plazas, children’s play areas,and sporting facilities. However, nearly two years after completion, the first couple of shops are only nearing completion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Dubai Creek Extension==

Dubai Creek Extension is a part of the Business Bay development. The plan involves the expansion of the current 14&amp;nbsp;km long Dubai Creek to 26.2&amp;nbsp;km. Dubai Creek will be extended from its original place to Business Bay to the Persian Gulf through Safa Park and Jumeirah. The project will be carried out in three phases. Completion was scheduled for 2007, but is now expected by the end of 2010. Some 10 kilometres of the total 12.2 kilometres of the Dubai Creek extension work has already been completed in Business Bay.

The '''California Society of Municipal Finance Officers''' (or CSMFO) is a [[professional association]] of state, [[County (United States)|county]], and [[local government]] finance officers in [[California]].  The California Society of Municipal Finance Officers is the statewide organization serving all California municipal finance professionals, an affiliate of the nationwide Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA).  Membership is open to anyone in the State of California actively engaged in government finance in any [[city]], county, or [[Special-purpose district|special district]].  Its stated mission is to  promote excellence in financial management through innovation, continuing education and professional development.  CSMFO members are actively involved in the key issues facing cities, counties, and special districts in the State of California.

Recognizing that public servants have an obligation to serve the public’s interests, CSMFO serves to actively improve fiscal integrity, adherence to the highest standards of ethical conduct, and to create better accountability by disseminating best practices.

==The Challenge to Excellence in Government Finance ==

The [[Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990]](CFO Act) was signed into law by President [[George H.W. Bush]]. For each of 23 federal agencies, the position of chief financial officer was created. Since that time, federal efforts have been intended to improve the government's financial management and develop standards of financial performance and disclosure. Similar financial expectations exist at State and Local government levels.

The [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) of a public agency is the corporate officer primarily responsible for managing the financial risks of the business or agency. This officer is also responsible for budgeting, financial planning, record-keeping, cash flow management, higher management. communicating financial performance and forecasts to the community. The title may vary, such as finance director or treasurer, from agency to agency. The CFO typically reports to the city manager or other chief executive officer.

Financial reporting has multiple audiences, with a responsibility to citizens, taxpayers and voters to provide transparent accountability for use of public funds (taxes).  Additionally, financial reporting must provide internal guidance to program managers to maintain budgetary control and to governing city councils and boards of directors to provide adequate financial policy guidelines.

The United States government in general has sought to improve the quality of financial reporting.  The Government Accounting Standards Board ([[Governmental Accounting Standards Board|GASB]]) has a stated mission to "establish and improve standards of state and local governmental accounting and financial reporting that will result in useful information for users of financial reports and guide and educate the public, including issuers, auditors, and users of those financial reports." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasb.org/ Government Accounting Standards Board]&lt;/ref&gt; Pronouncements in particular have trended to incorporate more comparable elements of business-sector.

The need for and value of financial managers has increased. Over the past decades, a number of factors have created a rapidly changing environment for today's government financial managers.  Beginning with the [[New York City]] financial crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, state and local governments began overhauling their financial management systems. In 1990, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) act called for reforms that brought the goal of accountability to the forefront.  The 1994 Bankruptcy of [[Orange County, California]] further underscored the need for ongoing excellence and expertise in the field of municipal finance.

==Role of CSMFO Membership==
Members are finance directors and treasurers of municipalities and other local government agencies, whether elected or appointed, having responsibility for collection, receipt, reporting, custody, investment or disbursement of municipal funds.  Municipal funding sources are commonly [[property tax]], [[sales tax]], [[income tax]], utility users tax (UUT), transient occupancy tax (hotel occupancy), and user fees such as licensing and permit fees.

Michael Genest is the [[Finance Director]] and [[Bill Lockyer]] is the [[Treasurer]] of the [[State of California]].  There are 480 California cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/cities.html State of California, Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428195928/http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/cities.html |date=2012-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 58 [[California counties]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/counties.html State of California, Counties ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527094654/http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/counties.html |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 3,400 [[Special Districts]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterplan.water.ca.gov/docs/cwpu2005/vol4/vol4-background-whatssospecialaboutspecialdistricts.pdf A Citizen's Guide to Special Districts in California] Retrieved 2009-04-04&lt;/ref&gt; and School Districts, each with independent fiscal stewardship.  Many City Treasurers are elected, and are therefore directly accountable to their constituents; the remainder are appointed either by City Council or City Manager.  Finance Directors typically are appointed by the City Manager.

==Professional Standards Setting==
Certification is a guide for municipal finance directors and treasurers to become valued administrators in local government.  CSMFO encourages [[professional certification]] for public finance directors and treasurers who meet standards of education, experience and commitment to a [[code of ethics]].  CSMFO does not offer its own [[post-nominal]] professional certificate since GFOA already administers the Certified Professional Finance Officer (CPFO), CMTA offers the [[Certified California Municipal Treasurer]] (CCMT) certification program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cacities.org/index.jsp?displaytype=11&amp;story=23047&amp;zone=ilsg&amp;section=conf&amp;sub_sec=conf_codes Institute for Local Government, Ethics Codes]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Association of Government Accountants offers the [[Certified Government Financial Manager]] (CGFM) certification, requiring six hours of testing on Federal, State and Local Government Financial material.

==CSMFO Code of Ethics==

Members are enjoined to adhere to legal, moral and professional standards of conduct. The following ethical principles govern the conduct of the Municipal members of the California Society of Municipal Finance Officers who shall:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmfo.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Detail&amp;CID=4&amp;NavID=154 CSMFO Code of Ethics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926062024/http://www.csmfo.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Detail&amp;CID=4&amp;NavID=154# |date=2006-09-26 }} Retrieved 2009-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and Education in California Finance and Treasury==
CSMFO has technical and professional committees that deal with financial issues facing government and the public.  CSMFO also provides web-based technical support resources, educational material, conferences and technical publications for its members.  CSMFO's annual statewide conferences provide an array of education across many topics and alternate annually between various northern and southern cities.  By assembling leadership from a broad representation of government agencies and also bringing in subject matter experts in various disciplines, the collective expertise and professionalism of financial managers and policymakers is enhanced and improved.

==Statewide Financial Leadership==
CSMFO is recognized as a leading source of expert knowledge in public financial management by exercising leadership in research, recommended practice and policy development, and information dissemination.  Nationwide recognition is furthered through a continued association with the nationwide Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA).  Statewide recognition is furthered through a thorough participation of members drawn from many cities, counties and special districts.

Standing Committees
Financial Leadership is furthered by engaging in efforts to assist statewide finance officers to develop the skills and capabilities necessary to enable them to become organizational leaders as well as technical experts.  &lt;br&gt;

==Resources==
The CSMFO website is a well-known statewide resource for a variety of documents relevant to local government, the most obvious benefit of which is to avoid inefficient duplication of effort and to make more knowledge available statewide to everyone.  CSMFO's library of resources includes sample RFPs, job descriptions, and a variety of documents and information relevant to local government.  Categories of posted information include Accounting/Financial Reporting, Budgeting, Consultants, Investments/Cash Management, Job Descriptions, Payroll, Human Resources, Policies &amp; Procedures, Revenue Management, RFPs/RFQs, and Technology.

CSMFO facilitates interagency communication for the purposes of sharing information and best practices.  Cooperate with and complement the services provided by other organizations to increase the effectiveness of all.

Like GFOA nationwide, CSMFO sponsors award programs designed to encourage good financial reporting in California, for financial documents including the [[Comprehensive annual financial report]], or CAFR, and the annual [[budget]].

CSMFO provides technology information and analytical tools to help governments identify and apply appropriate, economical technologies to support efficient resource allocation, quality services, and effective decision making and to promote citizen involvement.

The '''Cessna 190''' and '''195 Businessliner''' are a family of light single [[radial engine]] powered, [[conventional landing gear]] equipped, [[general aviation]] aircraft which were manufactured by [[Cessna]] between 1947 and 1954.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;Montgomery, MR &amp; Gerald Foster: ''A Field Guide to Airplanes, Second Edition'', page 54. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1992. {{ISBN|0-395-62888-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 195 model was also used by the [[United States Air Force]], [[United States Army]], and [[Army National Guard]] as a light transport and utility aircraft under the designations '''LC-126'''/'''U-20'''.&lt;ref name="Christy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A-790"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/b176b378bb2db1388625724300680fe9/$FILE/A-790.pdf|title=Type Certificate Data Sheet No. A-790|work=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]||date=March 31, 2003|accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harding 1997"&gt;Harding 1997, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The Cessna 190 and 195 were Cessna's only postwar radial-engined aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1945, after the end of World War II and both the 190 and 195 entered production in 1947.&lt;ref name="Plane and Pilot"&gt;Plane and Pilot: ''1978 Aircraft Directory'', page 92. Werner &amp; Werner Corp, Santa Monica CA, 1977. {{ISBN|0-918312-00-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanaberger"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.shanaberger.com/cessna_195.htm|title = Cessna 190/195 Businessliner|accessdate = 2008-08-11|last = Shanaberger|first = Kenneth W.|authorlink = |year = 2008|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081201135808/http://www.shanaberger.com/cessna_195.htm|archivedate = 2008-12-01|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 195 was the first Cessna airplane to be completely constructed of aluminum and features a [[Cantilever#Aircraft|cantilever]] wing, similar to the pre-war [[Cessna 165]] from which it is derived. The wing differs from later Cessna light aircraft in that it has a straight taper from root chord to tip chord and no [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]]. The airfoil employed is a NACA 2412, the same as used on the later [[Cessna 150]], [[Cessna 172|172]] and [[Cessna 182|182]].&lt;ref name="Christy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lednicer"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ae.uiuc.edu/m-selig/ads/aircraft.html|title = The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage|accessdate = 2008-08-10|last = Lednicer|first = David|authorlink = |date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 190/195 fuselage is large in comparison to other Cessna models because the 42" diameter radial engine had to be accommodated in the nose. There are two rows of seats: two individual seats in the first row, with a comfortable space between them and up to three passengers can be accommodated on a bench seat in the second row.&lt;ref name="Plane and Pilot"/&gt;

The 190/195 has flat sprung-steel landing gear legs derived from Cessna's purchase of the rights to [[Steve Wittman|Steve Wittman's]] [[Wittman Big X|Big X]]. Many have been equipped with swiveling crosswind landing gear which allows landing with up to 15 degrees of crab. While the crosswind gear simplifies the actual landing, it makes the aircraft difficult to handle on the ground. The 195 is equipped with a retractable step that extends when the cabin door is opened, although some have been modified to make the step a fixed unit.&lt;ref name="Christy"/&gt;

The aircraft was expensive to purchase and operate for private use and Cessna therefore marketed them as mainly as a business aircraft under the name "Businessliner".&lt;ref name="Foster"/&gt;

The engines fitted to the 190 and 195 became well known for their oil consumption. The aircraft has a {{convert|5|USgal|L|adj=on}} oil tank, with {{convert|2|USgal|L}} the minimum for flight. Typical oil consumption with steel cylinder barrels is {{convert|2|USqt|L}} per hour.&lt;ref name="Plane and Pilot"/&gt;

A factory-produced [[floatplane]] version was equipped with a triple tail for improved yaw stability. The tail resembles that of the [[Lockheed Constellation]].&lt;ref name="Foster"/&gt;

The Cessna 195 produces a cruise true airspeed of {{convert|148|kn|km/h}} (170 MPH) on a fuel consumption of {{convert|16|USgal|L}} per hour.&lt;ref name="Christy"/&gt; It can accommodate five people.

Including the LC-126s, a total of 1180 190s and 195s were built.&lt;ref name="Classic"/&gt;

The 190 was originally introduced at a price of [[United States Dollar|USD]]$12,750 in 1947 ({{inflation|US|12750|1947|fmt=eq}}). When production ended in 1954 the price had risen to [[United States Dollar|USD]]$24,700 ({{inflation|US|24700|1954|fmt=eq}}) for the 195B. This compared to [[United States Dollar|USD]]$3,495 for the [[Cessna 140]] two seater of the same period.&lt;ref name="Christy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christypg12"&gt;Christy. Joe: ''The Complete Guide to Single Engine Cessna, 3rd Edition'', page 12. Tab Books, 1979. {{ISBN|0-8306-2268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LC-126/U-20===
The '''LC-126''' was the military version of the {{convert|300|hp|abbr=on}} Cessna 195 and could be fitted with [[ski]]s or floats. 83 LC-126s were delivered, including:&lt;ref name="Classic"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.classicaircraft.com/AircraftComparisons/Cessna195/tabid/111/Default.aspx|title = Cessna 190 Series Information|accessdate = 2008-08-10|last = Classic Aircraft|authorlink = |year = 2007|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009001934/http://www.classicaircraft.com/AircraftComparisons/Cessna195/tabid/111/Default.aspx|archivedate = 2007-10-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christy"/&gt;

*[[United States Army|US Army]] - Cessna LC-126C - 63&lt;ref name="Christy"/&gt;

Once made surplus the majority of LC-126s were sold as civil aircraft, once modified by a Cessna civil kit.&lt;ref name="Christy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A-790"/&gt;

==Operational history==

The Cessna 190 and 195 are considered "one of the finest classics ever built" by pilots and collectors and are much sought after on the used aircraft market.&lt;ref name="Classic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plane and Pilot"/&gt;

'''Cherry Mobile''' is a Philippine [[mobile phone]] and [[electronics]] brand by Cosmic Technologies, established by Maynard Ngu in 2009. In 2010, barely two years after it started, Cherry Mobile was voted IT Company of the Year in the 3rd CyberPress Awards, upstaging some of the country’s technology giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cherrymobile.com/about-us/ |website=cherrymobile |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company imports [[mobile phones]] manufactured by [[original design manufacturer]]s in [[China]] and [[white label product|markets them]] under the Cherry Mobile brand.&lt;ref name="Pinoy-owned phonemaker named IT firm for 2010 "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/breaking-news/639803/pinoy-owned-phonemaker-named-it-firm-2010 |title=Pinoy-owned phonemaker named IT firm for 2010 |newspaper=[[Philippine Star]] |date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Cherry Mobile's current lineup come with [[Wi-Fi]], [[capacitive touch screen]]s and run on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[Windows Phone]] [[operating system]]s;&lt;ref name="upscale"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=621219&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=73 |title=Cherry Mobile goes upscale with new Android devices |last=Delos Reyes |first=Manny |newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]] |date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a line of smart feature phones running [[Firefox OS]] named Cherry Mobile Ace was also sold by the company for a time before it was later discontinued.

'''Corporate law in [[Vietnam]]''' was originally based on the [[French company law|French commercial law]] system. However, since Vietnam's independence in 1945, it has largely been influenced by the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]]. Currently, the main sources of Corporate Law are the Law on Enterprises,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamlaws.com/freelaws/Lw13na12Jun99Enterprises%5BXIV1033%5D.pdf Law on Enterprises]&lt;/ref&gt; the Law on Securities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telchar.com/capmkts/VietnamSecuritiesLaw2006English.pdf Law on Securities]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Law on Investment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamlaws.com/freelaws/Lw59na29Nov05CIL%5B10Apr06%5D.pdf Law on Investment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of corporate law and sources of law in Vietnam==

===The post-independence period (1945–1986)===
Corporate law in Vietnam is largely influenced by French laws due to its colonial past. After the [[1954 Geneva Conference]], Vietnam separated into two zones: the North and the South. In 1980, after the North took control of the South, the country adopted a [[Central planning|centrally-planned]] economy, with officials discouraging private commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, F. R. (1987). Vietnam Country Study. Retrieved August, 2011, from http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:History of Vietnam Corporate Law.tiff|thumb|600px|History of Vietnam Corporate Law]]

===Doi Moi (post-1986)===
In 1986, the government initiated economic reforms ([[Doi Moi]]) to the corporate sector to reinvigorate the ailing economy. These policies aimed to reverse most of policies that led to economic crises in the 1970s and 1980s following the [[Vietnam War]]. Development of the [[private sector]] was encouraged and the economy was liberalized in hopes of increasing the potential for economic development. In 1987, the Law on Foreign Investment was passed, allowing foreign investors into the country.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Development Bank. (2011). Economy of Vietnam - An Overview. Retrieved August, 2011, from 44th Annual Meeting, Board of Governors, Asian Development Bank: {{cite web |url=http://adb2011.vn/adb2011/categorynews/Economy/567/52 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110326053556/http://adb2011.vn/adb2011/categorynews/Economy/567/52 |archivedate=2011-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Law on Private Enterprises and Companies Law were introduced to boost economic development. They were subsequently superseded by the Law on Enterprises (LOE) in 1999, which introduced Partnerships in addition to [[Limited Liability Company|Limited Liability Companies]] and [[Public company|Shareholding Companies]]. Within three years of implementing the LOE, over 70,000 enterprises were registered as compared to just over 40,000 for the previous nine years.&lt;ref&gt;Bai, X. H. (2006). Vietnamese Company Law: The Development and Corporate Governance Issues. Bond Law Review , 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Law on Investment (replacing Law on Foreign Investment) and a new LOE were enacted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Bai, X. H., &amp; Walker, G. (2005). Transitional Adjustment Problems in Contemporary Vietnamese Company Law. Journal of International Banking Law and Regulation , 567-576.&lt;/ref&gt; These statutes are expected to further strengthen Vietnam's economy and its potential for international economic integration.

==Forms of business enterprise==

The LOE governs business enterprises in Vietnam. Enterprises in all economic sectors have to satisfy the stipulated conditions accounted for in Article 7(2).
There are 4 forms of business enterprises.

===Limited liability company (LLC)===
[[File:LLC.tiff|thumb|left|380px|Structure of Limited Liability Companies]]
An LLC is established by members' capital contribution to the company. As a LLC is a legal entity separate from the owners, the owner(s)'s liability for the firm's debts and obligations is limited to his capital contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 38 and 63, [http://www.vietnamlaws.com/freelaws/Lw13na12Jun99Enterprises%5BXIV1033%5D.pdf Law of Enterprises] 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

LLCs exist in two forms - one-member LLC, or multi-member LLC. The former is owned by an organisation/individual,&lt;ref&gt;Article 63, Law of Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter allows for two to fifty members.&lt;ref&gt;Article 38, Law of Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The management structure consists of a Members' Council (MC), Chairperson of the MC and Director. Where there are more than 11 members in LLC, an Inspection Committee (IC) must also be established.&lt;ref&gt;Article 46, Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shareholding Company (SC)===
[[File:Shareholding Company.tiff|thumb|390px|Structure of a Shareholding Company]]
An SC is an entity with at least three [[shareholder]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Article 77(1)(b), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; where ownership of the firm depends on the number of shares they hold. It is the only form of enterprise that can issue securities to raise capital.

Shareholders' liability is limited to their capital contribution;&lt;ref&gt;Article 77(1)(c), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; however, shareholders can be personally liable where the company is substantially [[undercapitalised]] on formation.

The management structure consists of a shareholders' meeting (SM), a board of management (BOM), a director and an IC.&lt;ref&gt;Article 95, Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnership===
A [[partnership]] comprises at least two co-owners jointly conducting business under one common name,&lt;ref&gt;Article 130(1)(a), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; with at least one co-owner being an individual. In a partnership, there can be both limited&lt;ref&gt;Article 130(1)(c), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and unlimited liability&lt;ref&gt;Article 130(1)(b), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; partners.

The Partners' Council, consisting of all partners, is the highest body in the partnership with the right to resolve all business affairs, such as the admission of new partners.&lt;ref&gt;Article 135, Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private enterprises===
A [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] is a firm owned by an individual, who is its legal representative&lt;ref&gt;Article 143(4), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The owner has total discretion in making business decisions,&lt;ref&gt;Article 143(1), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and is liable for its operations to the extent of all his [[assets]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 141(1), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual can only establish one private enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Article 141(3), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules concerning ownership of businesses==
The government has rules to restrict certain lines of businesses,&lt;ref&gt;Article 7, Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and will periodically review business conditions and proceed with any changes accordingly.

The rights and obligations of business enterprises are provided for in Articles 8–10; but might differ slightly should the enterprise offer public services or products.
[[File:Ownership Differences.tiff|thumb|500px|Ownership Differences]]

===Limited liability company (LLC)===
Owners in LLCs have to contribute capital in full and on time. In one-member LLCs, the owner will be responsible for [[debt]]s and other property obligations if he fails to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Article 65, Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in multi-member LLCs, members are to contribute capital in the type of asset, and any change is subject to the consent of other members.&lt;ref&gt;Article 39(1) Law of Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Owners in LLCs can assign a share of their capital contribution except where prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Such prohibitions are laid down in Article 45(6).&lt;/ref&gt; In one-member LLCs, this is the only way for the owner to withdraw capital.

===Shareholding Company (SC)===
The government provides specific provisions on the forms of offering [[Security (finance)|securities]] to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Article 11, Securities Law 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In offering securities, SCs are subject to conditions laid out in the Securities Law, such as the requirement for a paid-up [[charter capital]] at the time of offering of at least [[VND]] 10 billion in book value.&lt;ref&gt;Article 12, Securities Law 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Founding shareholders can assign their registered ordinary shares to each other if they hold 20% of ordinary shares for 3 years from the date of the Business Registration Certificate. Approval at the SM will allow a non-founding shareholder to purchase registered ordinary shares from a founding shareholder.

===Partnerships===
If an unlimited-liability partner fails to contribute capital accordingly, other partners may be held liable to compensate the partnership for the damage. However, where the limited liability partner fails to contribute capital accordingly, the unpaid amount will become a debt owed by that partner to the partnership.

An unlimited liability partner can transfer his share of capital in the partnership to another person only with the consent of the other unlimited liability partners.

===Private enterprises===
The owner must register his investment capital in the firm, and record changes in the [[investment capital]] in the accounts.

==Rules concerning corporate governance==

===Regulation of governing bodies===

====Ownership====
The ownership powers of the enterprises are vested in the MC/Chairman for LLCs&lt;ref&gt;Article 47(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 68(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and in the SM and BOM for SCs.&lt;ref&gt;Article 96(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 108(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; They are the highest decision making bodies for each enterprise and are tasked with the passing of resolutions, amending the Company Charter and setting out the general direction of the Company, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Article 47(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 96(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 104(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A resolution can only be passed with a minimum percentage approval.&lt;ref&gt;Article 52(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 68(6), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Such a rule is put in place to ensure the interests of all shareholders are protected.

====Executive====
The Director, appointed by the ownership institutions of the enterprise, has Executive powers and oversees the day-to-day running of the Company for SCs&lt;ref&gt;Article 116 (2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and LLCs.&lt;ref&gt;Article 55(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 70(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He is legally responsible for the implementation of delegated rights and obligations. Directors of LLCs cannot be affiliated to any member of the MC,&lt;ref&gt;Article 70(3), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ensuring the separation of powers between the company's ownership and management.

However, for SCs, the LOE permits persons to take up dual roles as Director and chairman of the BOM.&lt;ref&gt;Article 111 (1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; One survey found that 75% of chairmen of a BOM were also the Directors of their company. Furthermore, other members of the BOM are often majority shareholders and managers of the company. This highlights an indefinite differentiation between ownership and management.

====Inspection====
The LOE prescribes the formation of a mandatory IC to monitor and check the ownership and executive powers.&lt;ref name="article_71"&gt;Article 71, Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 121, Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the IC must minimally possess professional qualifications or [[accounting]]/[[auditing]] work experience,&lt;ref name="article_71_4"&gt;Article 71(4), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be related to members of the ownership or executive bodies.&lt;ref name="article_71_4"/&gt; This ensures impartiality and prevents conflict of interests. However, in SCs, while members of the IC cannot hold any managerial positions in the company, they are allowed to own company shares or be a general employee of the Company.&lt;ref&gt;Article 122(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual liability for corporate actions===

====Ownership Representatives====
Where the MC/Chairman of the LLC fails to convene a requested meeting within 15 days of the request, he must bear personal liability for any damage that may result to the company.&lt;ref&gt;Article 50(5), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Executive====
The LOE prescribes that the Director of a LLC may be sued by shareholders should he fail to perform his obligations and duties.&lt;ref&gt;Article 41(1g), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in a SC, there are no such provisions to grant the shareholders power to bring an action against Directors who do not perform their duties. While the law lays out the [[fiduciary]] duties of the Directors, it does not provide a way to enforce these duties. This has led to the criticism that the interests of shareholders of SCs are not adequately protected.&lt;ref&gt;Le Minh, Toan and Walker, Gordon (2008) "Corporate Governance of Listed Companies in Vietnam," Bond Law Review: Vol. 20: Iss.2, Article 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inspectors====
The IC is legally responsible for the implementation of its rights and duties.&lt;ref name="article_71"/&gt; The LOE however does not specify the circumstances under which the IC will be deemed to have neglected its rights and duties and hence be legally liable.

===Restrictions on transactions with owners/shareholders===
The LOE prescribes certain regulations to control and approve large related-party transactions. For SCs, if a [[loan agreement]]/contract is valued at at least 50% of the company's total assets, it is subject to approval by the BOM.&lt;ref name="article_120_2"&gt;Article 120(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

All related-party transactions must be approved by the shareholders.&lt;ref name="article_120_2"/&gt; 'Related-party' include managers of the enterprise or family members of shareholders,&lt;ref name="article_4_17"&gt;Article 4(17), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and related-party transactions are business arrangements between two parties with prior relationships.

Management personnel have to disclose details of their and their related parties' ownership interests in other enterprises; the latter applies where the related-party holds more than 35% of charter capital.&lt;ref name="article_4_17"/&gt; These measures ensure that personal interests do not override the company's interests. In addition, shareholders or directors related to the transaction cannot vote on the deal.&lt;ref&gt;Article 120 Section 3, Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The LOE, however, does not provide for an external checking mechanism for related-party transactions. The BOM has the sole and unfettered right to give approval to related-party transactions, and this lack of an extra checking mechanism has resulted in a lack of investor protection in Vietnam.{{#tag:ref|In a 2006 World Bank research, Vietnam tallied a score of 0 in the extent of director liability index, a stark contrast to the average score of 4.4 attained for East Asia and Pacific economies.&lt;ref&gt;Le Minh, Toan and Walker, Gordon (2008) "Corporate Governance of Listed Companies in Vietnam," Bond Law Review: Vol. 20: Iss.2, Article 6.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

==Foreign investment==
Both foreign and domestic investments are similarly treated under the LOI. Foreign investors and expatriates working for foreign-invested businesses or business co-operation contract can remit investment capital, profits and other assets, and their income abroad respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam - A Guide for Business and Investment, 2008, PriceWaterHouseCoopers&lt;/ref&gt;
There are four types of foreign investment in Vietnam:&lt;ref&gt;Article 21, [http://www.vietnamlaws.com/freelaws/Lw59na29Nov05CIL%5B10Apr06%5D.pdf Law on Investment] 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*100% Foreign Owned Enterprise (FOE);
*Joint-Venture Enterprise (JV);
*Business Co-operation Contract (BCC); and
*Building–Operation–Transfer/Building– Transfer–Operation/Building–Transfer. (BOT/BTO/BT)

===Foreign owned enterprise===
Foreign investors may establish economic organizations or LLCs in the form of 100% capital of foreign investors.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 (1), Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint venture===
Foreign investors may enter a [[joint venture]] where there is at least one foreign and one domestic investor.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 (2), Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The operational duration of a Foreign Invested Project cannot exceed 50 years; where the Government thinks it necessary to continue, it cannot exceed 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;Article 52, Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt; FOEs are recommended over joint ventures and they can be formed quickly through application of investment licenses. Joint ventures face problems such as corruption and the lack of control over the business.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam –Open for Business?, http://www.business-in-asia.com/vn_industrial.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business cooperation contract===
Foreign investors may invest in contractual agreements with Vietnamese partners to cooperate on specific business activities. This form of investment does not constitute a new legal entity and the investors have unlimited liability for BCC's debts.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 (3), Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===BOT/ BTO/ BT===
A foreign investor can sign such a contract with a State body to implement projects for expansion and modernization of [[infrastructure]] projects in the sectors stipulated by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 (4), Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 23 (2), Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis and assessment of current rules==

===Comparison with other jurisdictions===

====Flexibility in choosing corporate governance structures====
Although Vietnam's corporate law adopted Anglo-American legal principles, [[common law]] jurisdictions like the US grant businesses greater flexibility in choosing corporate governance structures. The LOE, however, imposes mandatory internal governance structures.&lt;ref&gt;Katharina Pistor et al, 'The Evolution of Corporate Law: A Cross‐Country Comparison' (2003) 23(4) University of Pennsylvania, Journal of International Economic Law 791, 19,&lt;/ref&gt; This has been criticised for failing to give companies the latitude to adapt their corporate governance structures to suit their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Xuan Hai, Bui, and Nunoi, Chihiro, Corporate Governance in Vietnam: A System in Transition, Hitotsubashi Journal of Commerce and Management 42 (2008), pp.45-65.&lt;/ref&gt;
Anglo-American law allows directors to delegate their powers to a sub-committee or another person.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ss 198C(1), 198(1) of the Corporation Act 2001 (C th) of Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in Vietnam, subcommittees can be established to assist the BOM, but the latter cannot delegate its powers to the former. The imposition of mandatory corporate governance structures without delegation of powers leads to less flexibility and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. American Law Institute, Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis and Recommendations (Vol. 1, 1994) s.305, Part III‐A (ss 3A.01‐3A.05).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jursidictions.tiff|thumb|500px|Comparisons between jurisdictions]]

====Separation of supervisory and management bodies====
Internal governance structures are important in supervising the company managers. In US, the supervisory body is often subsumed within the single-tiered [[board of directors]], whereas in Vietnam, the IC is an independent body. Through separation of supervisory and management functions, the Vietnamese corporate law model, at least theoretically, ensures that the BOM is held to a greater degree of accountability by an independent checking mechanism.
However, there is no hierarchy for the Vietnamese IC and BOM. This contrasts with the German two-tiered board model for SCs, with an [[Aufsichtsrat]] (supervisory board) which is hierarchically superior to the [[Vorstand]] (management board). Because the IC is not recognised as a superior institution, it has limited authority over the BOM. In practice, many supervisors are low level employees within the company. Although institutionally independent, the members of the IC are, in reality, dependent on their employers for their livelihoods, and therefore serve as a weak check against mismanagement by the BOM or Director.

====Vesting of executive powers====
In Vietnam, executive powers are vested solely in the Director while in Germany, executive powers are shared equally amongst members of the Vorstand. This encourages consensus decision-making in German companies as responsibility is shared amongst all members of the Vorstand.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan P. Charkham (1994). Keeping Good Company: A Study of Corporate Governance in Five Countries. Oxford University Press. pp. 14–21&lt;/ref&gt; This can be further contrasted with Japan, where the corporate law does not designate any positions for corporate officers (the Vietnamese equivalent of Director) and executive powers are largely retained within the Board of Directors (the Vietnamese equivalent of BOM).&lt;ref&gt;http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~allenf/download/Vita/Japan-Corporate-Governance.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems===

====Understanding corporate governance and role of management structures====
Corporate governance in Vietnam is seen more as a management framework rather than a system for accountability and protecting minority shareholders. In particular, the LOE does not clearly mandate the separation of ownership and management. Separation of ownership and management promotes [[accountability]] by allowing managers to be objectively appraised. On the other hand, owners who serve as managers will be more likely to pursue their own interests, possibly at the expense of the interests of minority shareholders.

====State-owned enterprises====
Following the introduction of LOE, SOEs were converted to single-organisation-owned LLCs.&lt;ref&gt;Decree No. 95/2006/ND-CP of Government dated Sept. 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, the state retains many powers and is directly involved in management decision-making. Government officials are thus selected to run companies for political reasons. Their lack of business expertise and [[profit motive]] has led to inefficiency and mismanagement of large [[state-owned enterprise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://swopec.hhs.se/eijswp/papers/eijswp0228.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011551/http://swopec.hhs.se/eijswp/papers/eijswp0228.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, since only up to three supervisors can be appointed, there is limited monitoring on the company managers. In 2010, the state-owned shipbuilding firm [[Vinashin]] ended in [[bankruptcy]], following mismanagement and false reporting of [[financial statement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dztimes.net/post/politics/poor-governance-led-to-vinashin-s-financial-wrongdoings.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the inadequate monitoring and auditing mechanisms for SOEs.

====Investor protection====
The LOE is increasingly recognizing the interests of minority shareholders by introducing new avenues for them to hold the management accountable.{{#tag:ref|These new measures includes basic rights of shareholders such as attending the General Shareholders' Meeting, voting on the basis of one share one vote, selecting senior managers and supervisors and having priority in making additional capital contributions, among others.|group=Note}} Nonetheless, with stringent prerequisites including higher shareholding requirements and the need to show evidence before minority shareholders can call for a shareholders' meeting, investor protection in Vietnam is still limited compared to other jurisdictions.{{#tag:ref|These other jurisdictions include China, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Australia, Germany and New Zealand.|group=Note}}
Other shortcomings of the LOE include limited opportunities for shareholders to request a meeting, no imposition of legal responsibilities on board members who approve unfair transactions, no shareholders' rights to sue those in the corporate governance structure (for SCs), and a shortage of provisions to require disclosure obligations and directors to avoid [[insolvent trading]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4419">In [[finance]], the '''cost of equity''' is the return (often expressed as a [[rate of return]]) a firm theoretically pays to its equity investors, i.e., [[shareholder]]s, to compensate for the risk they undertake by investing their capital. Firms need to acquire capital from others to operate and grow. Individuals and organizations who are willing to provide their funds to others naturally desire to be rewarded. Just as landlords seek rents on their property, capital providers seek returns on their funds, which must be commensurate with the risk undertaken.

Firms obtain capital from two kinds of sources: lenders and equity investors. From the perspective of capital providers, lenders seek to be rewarded with [[interest]] and equity investors seek [[dividend]]s and/or appreciation in the value of their investment ([[capital gain]]).  From a firm's perspective, they must pay for the capital it obtains from others, which is called its [[cost of capital]]. Such costs are separated into a firm's '''cost of debt''' and '''cost of equity''' and attributed to these two kinds of capital sources.

While a firm's present cost of debt is relatively easy to determine from observation of interest rates in the capital markets, its current cost of equity is unobservable and must be estimated. Finance theory and practice offers various models for estimating a particular firm's cost of equity such as the [[capital asset pricing model]], or CAPM. Another method is derived from the [[Gordon Model]], which is a [[discounted cash flow]] model based on dividend returns and eventual capital return from the sale of the investment. Another simple method is the Bond Yield Plus Risk Premium (BYPRP), where a subjective risk premium is added to the firm's long-term debt interest rate. In addition, the cost of equity can be calculated by (proposed by Gebhardt et.al. (2001) - see Further Reading Section) using the discounted residual income model to estimate the market implied cost-of-capital. The paper shows that a firm’s implied cost-of-capital is a function of its industry membership, B/M ratio, forecasted long-term growth rate, and the dispersion in analyst earnings forecasts. Moreover, a firm's overall cost of capital, which consists of the two types of capital costs, can be estimated using the [[weighted average cost of capital]] model. 

According to finance theory, as a firm's [[risk]] increases/decreases, its cost of capital increases/decreases. This theory is linked to observation of human behavior and logic: capital providers expect reward for offering their funds to others. Such providers are usually rational and prudent preferring safety over risk. They naturally require an extra reward as an incentive to place their capital in a riskier investment instead of a safer one. If an investment's risk increases, capital providers demand higher returns or they will place their capital elsewhere.

Knowing a firm's cost of capital is needed in order to make better decisions. Managers make [[capital budgeting]] decisions while capital providers make decisions about [[lending]] and [[investment]]. Such decisions can be made after quantitative analysis that typically uses a firm's cost of capital as a model input.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6756">The '''Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program''' ('''ERSP''') is a self-regulatory program created in 2004 by American business organizations to promote consumer confidence. ERSP is a program of the Electronic Retailing Association http://www.retailing.org in conjunction with the [[National Advertising Review Council]] (NARC) and administered by the Council of [[Better Business Bureaus]]. The mission of the program is to enhance consumer confidence in electronic retailing, by providing a forum to self-regulate [[direct response advertising]].

ERSP was created for several reasons, to: improve consumer confidence in electronic retailing; demonstrate the strong commitment of this industry to effective self-regulation; provide a quick and efficient mechanism for review of high-profile [[advertising]] (such as weight-loss advertising) and affecting the discontinuance of advertising containing egregious claims. ERSP investigates the truth and accuracy of claims in direct response advertising from inquiries brought to ERSP’s attention through competitor’s challenges, consumer’s concerns, or through ERSP’s ongoing monitoring program. Working as a voluntary program, ERSP is an efficient and useful tool to assist direct response marketers with timely and cost effective measures to minimize government interference and increase consumer confidence. 

The direct response industry includes long-form ([[infomercial]]) productions, short-form [[commercials]], live home [[shopping channels]], print advertising, Internet marketing, cell phone advertising, [[broadband]] channels, and radio advertising. Anything that has a direct link to the marketer: either a 1-[[800 number]], [[email]], or [[website]] is within ERSP’s purview.

ERSP inquires about the evidentiary support that a marketer possesses for product claims communicated through any form of direct-response advertising. Advertising claims come to ERSP’s attention through competitive challenges and ERSP’s ongoing monitoring program. 

Among the most significant benefits afforded by this program are:&lt;br&gt;
• '''speed''' – the ERSP mandate is to resolve all inquiries within 60 calendar days&lt;br&gt;
• '''cost''' –low cost alternative to litigation &lt;br&gt;
• '''burden of proof''' – ERSP does not require that injury to a consumer be proven as may be required by law and&lt;br&gt; 
• '''confidentiality''' – a company may bring cases anonymously to ERSP and, conversely, any proprietary information submitted confidentially will remain so in an ERSP challenge.&lt;br&gt;
 
The 60-day structure of this program is vital in limiting marketer inconvenience, but comprehensive enough to provide a thorough review. The success of the program lies in the voluntary participation by direct response marketers and the nature of the self-regulatory format. With the beneficial nature of this format for the electronic retailing industry, ERSP looks forward to not only continuing its monitoring program but to addressing the challenges brought by both consumers and competitors of electronic marketing.

Core claims at issue in an ERSP inquiry might include:

• Establishment Claims (“Clinically proven”)&lt;br&gt;
• Performance Claims (how well a product performs)&lt;br&gt;
• Testimonials (Anecdotal tales from consumers about their results with the product)&lt;br&gt;
• Weight Loss Claims&lt;br&gt;
• Health and Safety&lt;br&gt;
• Disclosures&lt;br&gt;
• Before and After Photographs&lt;br&gt;
• Puffery&lt;br&gt;
• Comparative Claims

ERSP opened its first case in August 2004.

== How the ERSP Process Works ==

ERSP details its concerns in an initial letter of inquiry and the marketer is given 15 calendar days to respond to ERSP with substantiation for the issues raised. ERSP then has 15 calendar days to ask the marketer for more information regarding its submission. Upon receipt of that request the marketer has 10 days to answer ERSP’s questions, and upon receipt of that, ERSP has 15 calendar days to reach a decision. 

If a marketer does not respond to the initial inquiry letter by ERSP, a press release summarizing the claims at issue and announcing a 10-calendar-day response for the marketer is released.

== ERSP Determinations – What to Expect ==

Participants in an ERSP review can anticipate one of three results:

• ERSP determines that the core claims at issue are supported by reasonable evidence. &lt;br&gt;
• ERSP recommends the marketer modify core claims.&lt;br&gt;
• ERSP determines there is no support for the claims at issue and recommends that the advertiser pull the advertisement.

ERSP also refers marketers to the appropriate [[regulatory agency]] if they fail to respond or refuse to comply with ERSP’s findings. Compliance inquiries are also conducted to confirm compliance with ERSP recommendations.&lt;br&gt;

== ERSP Review Program ==
In January 2012, the Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program (ERSP) expanded its purview to monitor and review advertising of the coaching and mentoring and live seminar industry. The program is called the “ERSP Review Program.”  The ERSP Review Program has two fundamental components: 1) review of telemarketing practices and free live seminar events which include telesales phone calls,  scripts and recordings of free, live seminar events ; 2) monitoring of lead generation advertising applicable to the coaching and mentoring industry including print, broadcast and online advertising.

== ERSP Copy Review ==
In 2014 ERSP introduced its Copy Reviewservice which is offered to members of the direct response industry and provides a review of advertising and the reasonable messages being communicated in the advertisement (usually conducted before the advertising is nationally disseminated). The review is focused on the legal, regulatory, self-regulatory and/or statutory provisions that should be considered and/or adhered to with respect to representations (express or implied) disseminated in an advertisement. Unlike a preclearance service which entails a comprehensive review of a marketer’s substantiation, a copy review evaluation is a “''non evidentiary''” review and is limited to “''primary''” and “''core''” claims communicated in an advertisement. Consumer complaints can be sent into ERSP via this [http://savvyshopper.org/savvyshopper/complaintlog/complaint_frame.htm complaint form].&lt;br&gt;

'''Export restrictions''',  or a '''restriction on exportation''', are limitations on the quantity of [[good (economics)|goods]] [[export]]ed to a specific country or countries by a Government.

An export restriction may be imposed:
* To prevent a shortage of goods in the domestic market because it is  more profitable to export
* To manage the effect on the domestic market of the importing country, which may otherwise impose [[Dumping (pricing policy)|antidumping duties]] on the imported goods
*As part of [[foreign policy]], for example as a component of [[trade sanction]]s
*To limit or restrict arms or dual-use items that may be used in proliferation, terrorism, or nuclear, chemical, or biological warfare.
*To limit or restrict trade to embargoed nations.

In the United States, the [[Export Administration Regulations]] are issued by the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] (in the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]) for all items except munitions.  The [[Department of State]] has the responsibility of overseeing export of defense and military-related articles as per the [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] or ITAR.

In [[information technology consulting]] and [[management consulting]], '''a grade''' aims to explicitly recognize a certain professional level, both within the organization and to customer organizations. A grade is separated from a place in the line hierarchy of a company, it underlines the very possibility of recognizing a person (top) level without being necessarily in a management functions.

The most commonly used system of grading [[consultant]]s is the following:

*''Associate consultant'': In some fields, an associate consultant is at the beginning of their consulting career and will typically do work to support the consultants and senior consultants - data collection and analysis, workshop support, etc. An associate consultant can also refer to a day rate contractor at any level, differentiating them from an employee of the firm (e.g. associate managing consultant). However, in [[engineering]], [[urban planning]] and some environmental consulting fields the term ''Associate consultant'' is used differently and is typically a higher grade than ''Principal consultant''.
*''Consultant'': A consultant is ‘learning the trade' within a specific domain of expertise. A consultant is developing in most competency dimensions and work in different roles on different projects in a specific domain.
*''Senior consultant'': A senior consultant has developed a specialisation within a specific domain of expertise. A senior consultant is capable of working independently as well as in teams. A senior consultant is often responsible for the completion of a part of a project or activities for which he/she leads a small team. A senior consultant is more client oriented and explores sales activities.
*''Managing consultant'': A managing consultant has started to excel in some of the competency dimensions. A managing consultant is known for domain expertise and is capable of generating his or her own work and that of others. As such the managing consultant is often responsible for business volume, through (add-on) sales and delivering a project. A managing consultant can act as a team lead or counsellor for other team members.
*''Principal consultant'': A principal consultant has a strong business impact and is often part of the company's leadership. A principal consultant is capable of shaping a piece of business being the leader in a specific domain and in any other domains. A principal consultant develops high-level business relations and high-impact projects. A principal is capable of leading large teams and also generates new business ideas.

'''Harris Whitbeck Pinol''' is an upper-class [[Guatemala]]n businessman. Whitbeck was a presidential candidate for Guatemala's Partido Patriota or [[Patriotic Party (Guatemala)|Patriotic Party]] (PP) during national elections held in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Whitbeck had previously been in the Frente Republicano Guatemalteco or [[Guatemalan Republican Front]] (FRG), the political party founded in 1989 by the former Guatemalan strongman and president, former Brigadier General [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], a  [[Christian evangelist]] who seized power in a coup toppling then dictator General [[Romeo Lucas García]] in 1982. Montt's regime was favored by Ronald Reagan's administration as a staunch U.S. ally and anti-communist bulwark during the turbulent 1980's when civil wars plagued [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Nicaragua]]. Prior to breaking away from the FRG, Harris Whitbeck had been one of Rios Montt's closest advisers.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
ICS consists of a standard management hierarchy and procedures for 
managing temporary incident(s) of any size.  ICS procedures should be pre-established and sanctioned by participating authorities, and personnel should be well-trained prior to an incident.

ICS includes procedures to select and form temporary management hierarchies
to control funds, personnel, facilities, equipment, and communications.
Personnel are assigned according to established standards and procedures previously sanctioned by participating authorities.
ICS is a system designed to be used or applied from the time an incident occurs until the requirement for management and operations no longer exist.

ICS is interdisciplinary and organizationally flexible to meet the following management challenges:
* Meets the needs of a jurisdiction to cope with incidents of any kind or complexity (i.e. it expands or contracts as needed).
* Allows personnel from a wide variety of agencies to meld rapidly into a common management structure with common terminology.
* Provide logistical and administrative support to operational staff.
* Be cost effective by avoiding duplication of efforts, and continuing overhead.
* Provide a unified, centrally authorized emergency organization.

==History==
The ICS concept was formed in 1968 at a meeting of Fire Chiefs in Phoenix, Arizona. The program was built primarily to take after the management hierarchy of the US Navy and it was mainly for fire fighting of wildfires in California and Arizona. During the 1970s, ICS was fully developed during massive [[wildfire suppression]] efforts in California ([[FIRESCOPE]]) that followed a series of catastrophic wildfires, starting with the massive [[Laguna fire]] in 1970. Property damage ran into the millions, and many people died or were injured. Studies determined that response problems often related to communication and management deficiencies rather than lack of resources or failure of tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 | title = Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) Guidelines

 | accessdate = 2009-07-16 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaknesses in incident management were often due to:
* Lack of accountability, including unclear [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] and supervision.
* Poor communication due to both inefficient uses of available communications systems and conflicting codes and terminology.
* Lack of an orderly, systematic planning process.
* No predefined methods to integrate inter-agency requirements into the management structure and planning process effectively.
* Freelancing by individuals within the first responding team without the direction from team leader (IC) and those with specialized skills during an incident without coordination with other first responders
* Lack of knowledge with common terminology during an incident.

Emergency Managers determined that the existing [[management]] structures — frequently unique to each agency — did not scale to dealing with massive [[mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] responses involving dozens of distinct agencies and when these various agencies worked together their specific training and procedures clashed. As a result, a new [[command and control]] [[paradigm]] was collaboratively developed to provide a consistent, integrated framework for the management of all incidents from small incidents to large, [[multi-agency]] emergencies.

It should be noted that at the beginning of this work, despite the recognition that there were incident or field level shortfalls in organization and terminology, there was no mention of the need to develop an on the ground incident management system like ICS.  Most of the efforts were focused on the multiagency coordination challenges above the incident or field level.  It wasn’t until 1972 when Firefighting Resources of Southern California Organized for Potential Emergencies (FIRESCOPE) was formed that this need was recognized and the concept of ICS was first discussed.  Also, ICS was originally called Field Command Operations System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher   = Emergency Management Services International (EMSI)
| access-date = 2016-01-13
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

ICS became a national model for command structures at a fire, crime scene or major incident. ICS was used in New York at the first [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|attack]] on the World Trade Center in 1993. On 1 March 2004, the [[Department of Homeland Security]], in accordance with the passage of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5) calling for a standardized approach to incident management amongst all federal, state, and local agencies, developed the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS) which integrates ICS. Additionally, it was mandated that NIMS (and thus ICS) must be utilized to manage emergencies in order to receive federal funding.

The [[Superfund]] Amendment and Re-authorization Act title III mandated that all first responders to a hazardous materials emergency must be properly trained and equipped in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q). This standard represents OSHA's recognition of ICS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher   = Occupational Safety and Health
| access-date = 2015-09-25
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

HSPD-5 and thus the National Incident Management System came about as a direct result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, which created numerous All-Hazard, Mass Casualty, multi-agency incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Jurisdiction and legitimacy==
In the United States, ICS has been tested by more than 30 years of emergency and non-emergency applications. All levels of government are required to maintain differing levels of ICS training and private sector organizations regularly use ICS for management of events. ICS is widespread in use from law enforcement to every-day [[business]], as the basic goals of clear [[communication]], [[accountability]], and the efficient use of resources are common to incident and emergency management as well as daily operations. ICS is mandated by law for all [[Hazardous Material]]s responses nationally and for many other emergency operations in most states. In practice, virtually all [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] and disaster response agencies utilize ICS, in part after the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] mandated the use of ICS for [[emergency services]] throughout the [[United States]] as a condition for federal preparedness funding. As part of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]'s [[National Response Plan]] (NRP), the system was expanded and integrated into the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS).

ICS is widely used in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United Nations]] recommended the use of ICS as an international standard. ICS is also used by agencies in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalhealth.ca/EspeciallyFor/EmergencyPreparedness/IncidentCommandSystem/default.htm Alberta Health Services website on ICS]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Zealand]] has implemented a similar system, known as the [[Coordinated Incident Management System]], [[Australia]] has the [[Australasian Inter-Service Incident Management System]] and [[British Columbia]], Canada, has [[BCERMS]] developed by the [[Emergency Management BC].

In [[Brazil]], ICS is also used by [[The Fire Department of the State of Rio de Janeiro]] (CBMERJ) and by the Civil Defense of the State of Rio de Janeiro in every emergency or large-scale events.

==Basis==
=== Incidents ===&lt;!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER --&gt;
Incidents are defined within '''ICS''' as unplanned situations necessitating a response. Examples of incidents may include:
* [[Emergency medical services|Emergency medical situations]] ([[ambulance]] service)
* [[Hazardous material]] spills, releases to the air (toxic chemicals), releases to a drinking water supply
* [[Hostage crisis|Hostage crises]]
* [[Anthropogenic hazard|Man-made disasters]] such as [[Traffic collision|vehicle crashes]], [[industrial accident]]s, train [[derailment]]s, or [[structure fire]]s
* [[Natural disaster]]s such as [[wildfire]]s, [[flood]]ing, [[earthquake]] or [[tornado]]
* [[Public Health]] incidents, such as disease [[outbreak]]s
* [[Search and Rescue]] operations
* [[Technological crisis]]
* [[Terrorism|Terrorist]] attacks
* [[Traffic collision|Traffic incidents]]

===Events===
Events are defined within ICS as planned situations. Incident command is increasingly applied to events both in emergency management and non-emergency management settings. Examples of events may include:
* Concerts
* Parades and other ceremonies
* Fairs and other gatherings
* Training exercises

==Key concepts==

=== Unity of command ===
Each individual participating in the operation reports to only one supervisor. This eliminates the potential for individuals to receive conflicting orders from a variety of supervisors, thus increasing accountability, preventing freelancing, improving the flow of information, helping with the coordination of operational efforts, and enhancing operational safety. This concept is fundamental to the ICS chain of command structure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Emergency management Institute. [http://training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/IS200%20Lesson%20Summary.pdf "IS-200: ICS for Single Resources and Initial Action Incidents"]. 29 November 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714010117/http://training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/IS200%20Lesson%20Summary.pdf |date=14 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common terminology===
Individual response agencies previously developed their protocols separately, and subsequently developed their terminology separately. This can lead to confusion as a word may have a different meaning for each organization.

When different organizations are required to work together, the use of common [[terminology]] is an essential element in team cohesion and communications, both internally and with other organizations responding to the incident.

An incident command system promotes the use of a common terminology and has an associated glossary of terms that help bring consistency to position titles, the description of resources and how they can be organized, the type and names of incident facilities, and a host of other subjects. The use of common terminology is most evident in the titles of command roles, such as ''Incident Commander'', ''Safety Officer'' or ''Operations Section Chief''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

===Management by objective===
Incidents are managed by aiming towards specific objectives. Objectives are ranked by priority; should be as specific as possible; must be attainable; and if possible given a working time-frame. Objectives are accomplished by first outlining strategies (general plans of action), then determining appropriate tactics (how the strategy will be executed) for the chosen strategy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

===Flexible and modular organization===
Incident Command structure is organized in such a way as to expand and contract as needed by the incident scope, resources and hazards. Command is established in a top-down fashion, with the most important and authoritative positions established first. For example, Incident Command is established by the first arriving unit.

Only positions that are required at the time should be established. In most cases, very few positions within the command structure will need to be activated. For example, a single fire truck at a [[dumpster]] fire will have the officer filling the role of IC, with no other roles required. As more trucks get added to a larger incident, more roles will be delegated to other officers and the Incident Commander (IC) role will probably be handed to a more-senior officer.

Only in the largest and most complex operations would the full ICS organization be staffed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; Conversely, as an incident scales down, roles will be merged back up the tree until there is just the IC role remaining.

===Span of control===
To limit the number of responsibilities and resources being managed by any individual, the ICS requires that any single person's [[span of control]] should be between three and seven individuals, with five being ideal. In other words, one manager should have no more than seven people working under them at any given time.  If more than seven resources are being managed by an individual, then they are being overloaded and the command structure needs to be expanded by delegating responsibilities (e.g. by defining new sections, divisions, or task forces). If fewer than three, then the position's authority can probably be absorbed by the next highest rung in the chain of command.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==Coordination==
One of the benefits of the ICS is that it allows a way to coordinate a set of organizations who may otherwise work together sporadically. While much training material emphasizes the hierarchical aspects of the ICS, it can also be seen as an inter-organizational network of responders. These network qualities allow the ICS flexibility and expertise of a range of organizations. But the network aspects of the ICS also create management challenges. One study of ICS after-action reports found that ICS tended to enjoy higher coordination when there was strong pre-existing trust and working relationships between  members, but struggled when authority of the ICS was contested and when the networks of responders was highly diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moynihan |first= Donald |title=The Network Governance of Crisis Response: Case Studies of Incident Command Systems (2009)|work= Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 19: 895-915 |url=http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/facultystaff/moynihan/JPART194.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coordination on any incident or event is facilitated with the implementation of the following concepts:

===Incident Action Plans===
''Incident Action Plans'' (IAPs) ensure that everyone is working in concert toward the same goals set for that operational period by providing all incident supervisory personnel with direction for actions to be taken during the operational period identified in the plan. Incident Action Plans provide a coherent means of communicating the overall incident objectives for both operational and support activities. They include measurable strategic objectives to be achieved in a time frame called an Operational Period, which may be any interval of time but is commonly 12 hours. They may be verbal or written except for hazardous material incidents where it must be written,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=40 CFR 1910.120(q)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are prepared by the Planning Section.

The consolidated IAP is a very important component of the ICS that reduces freelancing and ensures a coordinated response. At the simplest level, all Incident Action Plans must have four elements:
*What do we want to do?
*Who is responsible for doing it?
*How do we communicate with each other?
*What is the procedure if someone is injured?

The content of the IAP is organized by a number of standardized ICS forms that allow for accurate and precise documentation of an incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Comprehensive resource management===
''Comprehensive resource management'' is a key management principle that implies that all assets and personnel during an event need to be tracked and accounted for. It can also include processes for reimbursement for resources, as appropriate.
Resource management includes processes for:
* Categorizing resources.
* Ordering resources.
* Dispatching resources.
* Tracking resources.
* Recovering resources.

Comprehensive resource management ensures that visibility is maintained over all resources so they can be moved quickly to support the preparation and response to an incident, and ensuring a graceful demobilization. It also applies to the classification of resources by type and kind, and the categorization of resources by their status.
* '''Assigned''' resources are those that are working on a field assignment under the direction of a supervisor.
* '''Available''' resources are those that are ready for deployment(staged), but have not been assigned to a field assignment.
* '''Out-of-service''' resources are those that are not in either the "available" or "assigned" categories. Resources can be "out-of-service" for a variety of reasons including: resupplying after a sortie (most common), shortfall in staffing, personnel taking a rest, damaged or inoperable.

T-Cards ([[ICS 219]], Resource Status Card) are most commonly used to track these resources. The cards are placed in T-Card racks located at an Incident Command Post for easy updating and visual tracking of resource status.

===Integrated communications===
Developing an integrated voice and data communications system, including equipment, systems, and protocols, must occur prior to an incident.

Effective ICS communications include three elements:
* Modes: The "hardware" systems that transfer information.
* Planning: Planning for the use of all available communications resources.
* Networks: The procedures and processes for transferring information internally and externally.

==Composition==

=== Incident commander ===
* Single incident commander - Most incidents involve a single [[incident commander]]. In these incidents, a single person commands the incident response and is the decision-making final authority.
* Unified Command - A [[Unified Command (ICS)|Unified Command]] involves two or more individuals sharing the authority normally held by a single incident commander.  Unified Command is used on larger incidents usually when multiple agencies or multiple jurisdictions are involved. A Unified command typically includes a command representative from major involved agencies and/or jurisdictions with one from that group to act as the spokesman, though not designated as an Incident Commander. A Unified Command acts as a single entity. It is important to note, that in Unified Command the command representatives will appoint a single Operations Section Chief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nims/NIMS_core.pdf National Incident Management System] - December 2008 Page 51&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Anchor|Area Command}}
* Area command - During multiple-incident situations, an Area Command may be established to provide for Incident Commanders at separate locations. Generally, an Area Commander will be assigned - a single person - and the Area Command will operate as a logistical and administrative support. Area Commands usually do not include an Operations function.

===Command staff===
* Safety officer - The Safety Officer monitors safety conditions and develops measures for assuring the safety of all assigned personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency [http://training.fema.gov/position%20specific%20taskbooks/#safety "FEMA Taskbooks"], ''FEMA'', 28 October 2010, accessed 11 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Public information officer - The Public Information Officer (PIO or IO) serves as the conduit for information to and from internal and external stakeholders, including the media or other organizations seeking information directly from the incident or event. While less often discussed, the Public Information Officer is also responsible for ensuring that an incident's command staff are kept apprised as to what is being said or reported about an incident. This allows public questions to be addressed, rumors to be managed, and ensures that other such public relations issues are not overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency [http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/ICSResource/Glossary.htm#P "FEMA Glossary"], ''FEMA'', 28 October 2010, accessed 11 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Liaison Officer - A Liaison serves as the primary contact for supporting agencies assisting at an incident.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency [http://training.fema.gov/EMIWEB/IS/ICSResource/ICSResCntr_Glossary.htm#L "FEMA Glossary"], ''FEMA'', 28 October 2010, accessed 11 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Staff===
* Operations Section Chief: Tasked with directing all actions to meet the incident objectives.
* Planning Section Chief: Tasked with the collection and display of incident information, primarily consisting of the status of all resources and overall status of the incident.
* Finance/Administration Section Chief: Tasked with tracking incident related costs, personnel records, requisitions, and administrating procurement contracts required by Logistics.
* Logistics Section Chief: Tasked with providing all resources, services, and support required by the incident.

===200-Level ICS===
At the ICS 200 level, the function of Information and Intelligence is added to the standard ICS staff as an option. This role is unique in ICS as it can be arranged in multiple ways based on the judgement of the Incident Commander and needs of the incident. The three possible arrangements are:
* Information &amp; Intelligence Officer, a position on the command staff.
* Information &amp; Intelligence Section, a section headed by an Information &amp; Intelligence Section Chief, a General Staff position.
* Information &amp; Intelligence Branch, headed by an Information &amp; Intelligence Branch Director, this branch is a part of the Planning Section.

===300-Level ICS===
At the ICS 300 level, the focus is on entry-level management of small-scale, All-Hazards incidents with emphasis on the scalability of ICS. It acts as an introduction to the utilization of more than one agency and the possibility of numerous operational periods. It also involves an introduction to the Emergency Operations Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===400-Level ICS===
At the ICS 400 level, the focus is on large, complex incidents. Topics covered include the characteristics of incident complexity, the approaches to dividing an incident into manageable components, the establishment of an "Area Command", and the MultiAgency Coordination System (MACS).

==Design==

=== Personnel ===
ICS is organized by levels, with the supervisor of each level holding a unique title (e.g. only a person in charge of a Section is labeled "Chief"; a "Director" is exclusively the person in charge of a Branch). Levels (supervising person's title) are:
:* Incident Commander
::* Command Staff Member (Officer)- Command Staff
::* Section (Chief)- General Staff
:::* Branch (Director)
::::* Division (Supervisor) - A Division is a unit arranged by geography, along jurisdictional lines if necessary, and not based on the makeup of the resources within the Division.
::::* Group (Supervisor) - A Group is a unit arranged for a purpose, along agency lines if necessary, or based on the makeup of the resources within the Group.
:::::* Unit, Team, or Force (Leader) - Such as "Communications Unit," "Medical Strike Team," or a "Reconnaissance Task Force." A Strike Team is composed of same resources (four ambulances, for instance) while a Task Force is composed of different types of resources (one ambulance, two fire trucks, and a police car, for instance).
::::::* Individual Resource. This is the smallest level within ICS and usually refers to a single person or piece of equipment. It can refer to a piece of equipment ''and'' operator, and less often to multiple people working together.

===Facilities===
ICS uses a standard set of facility nomenclature. ICS facilities include:
'''Pre-Designated Incident Facilities:''' Response operations can form a complex structure that must be held together by response personnel working at different and often widely separate incident facilities. These facilities can include:

* '''Incident Command Post''' (ICP): The ICP is the location where the Incident Commander operates during response operations. There is only one ICP for each incident or event, but it may change locations during the event. Every incident or event must have some form of an Incident Command Post. The ICP may be located in a vehicle, trailer, tent, or within a building. The ICP will be positioned outside of the present and potential hazard zone but close enough to the incident to maintain command. The ICP will be designated by the name of the incident, e.g., Trail Creek ICP.
* '''Staging Area''': Can be a location at or near an incident scene where tactical response resources are stored while they await assignment. Resources in staging area are under the control status. Staging Areas should be located close enough to the incident for a timely response, but far enough away to be out of the immediate impact zone. There may be more than one Staging Area at an incident. Staging Areas can be collocated with the ICP, Bases, Camps, Helibases, or Helispots.
* A '''Base''' is the location from which primary logistics and administrative functions are coordinated and administered. The Base may be collocated with the Incident Command Post. There is only one Base per incident, and it is designated by the incident name. The Base is established and managed by the Logistics Section. The resources in the Base are always out-of-service.
* '''Camps''': Locations, often temporary, within the general incident area that are equipped and staffed to provide sleeping, food, water, sanitation, and other services to response personnel that are too far away to use base facilities. Other resources may also be kept at a camp to support incident operations if a Base is not accessible to all resources. Camps are designated by geographic location or number. Multiple Camps may be used, but not all incidents will have Camps.
* A '''Helibase''' is the location from which helicopter-centered air operations are conducted. Helibases are generally used on a more long-term basis and include such services as fueling and maintenance. The [[Helibase]] is usually designated by the name of the incident, e.g. Trail Creek Helibase.
* '''Helispots''' are more temporary locations at the incident, where helicopters can safely land and take off. Multiple Helispots may be used.

Each facility has unique location, space, equipment, materials, and supplies requirements that are often difficult to address, particularly at the outset of response operations. For this reason, responders should identify, pre-designate and pre-plan the layout of these facilities, whenever possible.

On large or multi-level incidents, higher-level support facilities may be activated. These could include:

* '''Emergency Operations Center''' (EOC): An emergency operations center is a central command and control facility responsible for carrying out the principles of emergency preparedness and emergency management, or disaster management functions at a strategic level during an emergency, and ensuring the continuity of operation of a company, political subdivision or other organization. An EOC is responsible for the strategic overview, or "big picture", of the disaster, and does not normally directly control field assets, instead making operational decisions and leaving tactical decisions to lower commands. The common functions of all EOC's is to collect, gather and analyze data; make decisions that protect life and property, maintain continuity of the organization, within the scope of applicable laws; and disseminate those decisions to all concerned agencies and individuals. In most EOC's there is one individual in charge, and that is the Emergency Manager.
* '''Joint Information Center''' (JIC): A JIC is the facility whereby an incident, agency, or jurisdiction can support media representatives. Often co-located - even permanently designated - in a community or state EOC the JIC provides the location for interface between the media and the PIO. Most often the JIC also provides both space and technical assets (Internet, telephone, power) necessary for the media to perform their duties. A JIC very often becomes the "face" of an incident as it is where press releases are made available as well as where many broadcast media outlets interview incident staff. It is not uncommon for a permanently established JIC to have a window overlooking an EOC and/or a dedicated background showing agency logos or other symbols for televised interviews. The National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) at FEMA has both, for example, allowing televised interviews to show action in the NRCC behind the interviewer/interviewee while an illuminated "Department of Homeland Security" sign, prominently placed on the far wall of the NRCC, is thus visible during such interviews.
* '''Joint Operations Center''' (JOC): A JOC is usually pre-established, often operated 24/7/365, and allows multiple agencies to have a dedicated facility for assigning staff to interface and interact with their counterparts from other agencies. Although frequently called something other than a JOC, many locations and jurisdictions have such centers, often where Federal, state, and/or local agencies (often law enforcement) meet to exchange strategic information and develop and implement tactical plans. Large mass gathering events, such as a presidential inauguration, will also utilize JOC-type facilities although they are often not identified as such or their existence even publicized.
* '''Multiple Agency Coordination Center''' (MACC): The MACC is a central command and control facility responsible for the strategic, or "big picture" of a disaster. A MACC is often used when multiple incidents are occurring in one area or are particularly complex for various reasons such as when scarce resources must be allocated across multiple requests. Personnel within the MACC use [[Multi-agency Coordination]] to guide their operations. The MACC coordinates activities between multiple agencies and incidents and does not normally directly control field assets, but makes strategic decisions and leaves tactical decisions to individual agencies. The common functions of all MACC's is to collect, gather and analyze data; make decisions that protect life and property, maintain continuity of the government or corporation, within the scope of applicable laws; and disseminate those decisions to all concerned agencies and individuals. While often similar to an EOC, the MACC is a separate entity with a defined area or mission and lifespan whereas an EOC is a permanently established facility and operation for a political jurisdiction or agency. EOCs often, but not always, follow the general ICS principles but may utilize other structures or management (such as an Emergency Support Function [ESF] or hybrid ESF/ICS model)schemas. For many jurisdictions the EOC is where elected officials will be located during an emergency and, like a MACC, supports but does not command an incident.

===Equipment===
ICS uses a standard set of equipment nomenclature. ICS equipment include:
* Tanker - This is an aircraft that carries fuel (Fuel Tanker) or water (Water Tanker).
* Tender - Like a tanker, but a ground vehicle, also carrying fuel (Fuel Tender), water (Water Tender), or even [[fire fighting foam]] (Foam Tender).

===Type and kind===
The "type" of resource describes the size or capability of a resource. For instance, a 50&amp;nbsp;kW (for a generator) or a 3-ton (for a truck). Types are designed to be categorized as "Type 1" through "Type 5" formally, but in live incidents more specific information may be used.

The "kind" of resource describes what the resource is. For instance, generator or a truck. The "type" of resource describes a performance capability for a kind of resource for instance,

In both type and kind, the objective must be included in the resource request. This is done to widen the potential resource response. As an example, a resource request for a ''small aircraft for aerial reconnaissance of a search and rescue scene'' may be satisfied by a [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] [[OH-58 Kiowa]] helicopter (Type &amp; Kind: Rotary-wing aircraft, Type II/III) or by a [[Civil Air Patrol]] [[Cessna 182]] (Type &amp; Kind: Fixed-wing aircraft, Type I). In this example, requesting only a fixed-wing or a rotary-wing, or requesting by type may prevent the other resource's availability from being known.

===Command transfer===
A role of responsibility can be transferred during an incident for several reasons: As the incident grows a more qualified person is required to take over as Incident Commander to handle the ever-growing needs of the incident, or in reverse where as an incident reduces in size command can be passed down to a less qualified person (but still qualified to run the now-smaller incident) to free up highly qualified resources for other tasks or incidents. Other reasons to transfer command include jurisdictional change if the incident moves locations or area of responsibility, or normal turnover of personnel due to extended incidents. The transfer of command process always includes a transfer of command briefing, which may be oral, written, or a combination of both.

{{Contract law}}
In [[contract]] [[law]], an '''integration clause''', '''merger clause''',  (sometimes, particularly in the [[United Kingdom]], referred to as an '''entire agreement clause''') &lt;ref&gt;Bates, M., [https://united-kingdom.taylorwessing.com/synapse/commercial_agreementclause.html Entire Agreement Clauses], accessed 16 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; is a clause in a written contract which declares that contract to be the complete and final agreement between the parties. It is often placed at or towards the end of the contract. Any pre-contractual material which the parties wish to be incorporated into the contract need to be assembled with it or explicitly referred to in the contractual documentation. 

==Effect== 
A contract that has such a clause may be deemed an '''integrated contract''', and any previous negotiations in which the parties to the contract had considered different terms will be deemed superseded by the final writing. However, many modern cases have found merger clauses to be only a [[rebuttable presumption]].

In the [[United States]], the existence of such a term is normally not conclusive proof that no varied or additional conditions exist with respect to the performance of the contract beyond those that are in the writing but instead is simply evidence of that fact.

==Sample clause==
"This Agreement, along with any exhibits, appendices, addenda, schedules, and amendments hereto, encompasses the entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes all previous understandings and agreements between the parties, whether oral or written. The parties hereby acknowledge and represent, by affixing their hands and [[Seal (contract law)|seal]]s hereto, that said parties have not relied on any representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty, collateral contract or other assurance, except those set out in this Agreement, made by or on behalf of any other party or any other person or entity whatsoever, prior to the execution of this Agreement. The parties hereby waive all rights and remedies, at law or in equity, arising or which may arise as the result of a party’s reliance on such representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty, collateral contract or other assurance, provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as a restriction or limitation of said party’s right to remedies associated with the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of any person or party taking place prior to, or contemporaneously with, the execution of this Agreement."{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Haarlem-Hofje van Noblet-5 ovale portretten.jpg|thumb|Johannes Enschedé was regent of the [[Hofje]]s Staats and Noblet. His portrait (upper right) was painted by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] for the [[Hofje van Noblet]]]]
'''Johannes Enschedé Jr.''' (16 November 1750 in [[Haarlem]] &amp;ndash; 29 July 1799 in Haarlem)&lt;ref name="NNBW"&gt;P.C. Molhuysen en P.J. Blok (red.), [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu04_01/molh003nieu04_01_0892.php Nieuw Nederlandsch biografisch woordenboek. Deel 1] (Dutch) Johannes Enschedé (2)&lt;/ref&gt; was a Haarlem [[regent]] and collector.

==Biography==
He was the grandson of the founder of the [[Joh. Enschedé]] company, and one of the first members of the ''[[Dutch Society of Science]]'' and the ''[[Teylers Second Society]]''. He was a regent of the [[St. Elisabeth Gasthuis, Haarlem|St. Elizabeth's-Gasthuis]] and the [[Hofje van Staats]] en Noblet. Johannes was the son of [[Johannes Enschedé (1708-1780)]] and the brother of Jacobus and Abraham. He married [[Johanna Elisabeth Swaving]] and was the father of [[Johannes Enschedé III]] and Christiaan Justus (the father of [[Adriaan Justus Enschedé]]).

His father was a collector of [[Costeriana]] and had statues of Coster and [[Hadrianus Junius]], Coster's biographer, placed in the garden of his home, adjacent to the typesetter's workshop in 1768. An engraving by [[Cornelis van Noorde]] shows the workshop and the statues. Enschedé Jr. continued his father's collection of Costeriana and also added his love of Greek and Latin books.  He died relatively young, and his wife succeeded him in his role leading the company. Under her influence the day-to-day operations were split into three divisions; the newspaper, the type foundry, and the bible publishing. This "triumvirate" lasted three generations.

'''José Jorge Alperovich''' (born April 13, 1955) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] politician and is currently the governor of [[Tucumán Province]]. He was elected in 2003, and reelected in 2007 and 2011. He is married to [[Beatriz Rojkés de Alperovich]], who has served as National Senator and president of the [[Justicialist Party]] in his province.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Alperovich was born in [[Banda del Río Salí]] to Marta León, an [[Argentine Jew]], and León Alperovich, a [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jew]] from [[Lithuania]] whose parents had settled in one of the numerous Jewish [[agricultural colonies in Argentina]]. His father relocated to Tucumán Province and later established ''León Alperovich S.A.'', one of the most important [[auto dealership]]s in Tucumán.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsigloweb.com/nota.php?id=69655|title=Murió León Alperovich, el padre del Gobernador de Tucumán|work=El Siglo|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122082158/http://www.elsigloweb.com/nota.php?id=69655|archivedate=2013-01-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He enrolled at the [[University of Tucumán]], graduated as an [[accountant]], and married [[Beatriz Rojkés de Alperovich|Beatriz Rojkés]], with whom he had four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contexto.com.ar/vernota.php?id=36186 |title=La tucumana Beatriz de Alperovich está entre los 10 senadores más ricos |publisher=''Contexto'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430075117/http://www.contexto.com.ar/vernota.php?id=36186 |archivedate=2012-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
He worked as an accountant for several years, then began his political career in the provincial legislature in 1995. He served as chairman of the provincial Committee of Finance and Budget under Governor [[Antonio Bussi]].

Alperovich was a member of the centrist [[Radical Civic Union]] until 1999, when Bussi failed to achieve re-election and the new [[Justicialist Party]] governor, [[Julio Miranda]] , appointed Alperovich to be Minister of Economy. Alperovich thereupon switched to the Justicialist Party. His appointment to the ministerial position was part of an agreement that was designed to maintain a channel of communications between the Justicialist Party and the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education|Alliance]] government of [[Fernando de la Rúa]]. Alperovich was elected to the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]] amid the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina|political crisis of 2001]], and ran for governor of Tucumán Province in 2003.&lt;ref name=p12&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/subnotas/1-55415-2011-08-29.html|title=El juramento sobre la Torá|work=Página/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators had speculated that Alperovich would not be able to become governor if elected because of the provincial law that required him to give an oath on the [[Christian]] [[Bible]]. A constitutional crisis ensued; ultimately, Alperovich's challenge to the provincia law met with success in the Supreme Court, which amended Tucumán's Constitution to allow Alperovich to take the oath on the Hebrew [[Torah]].&lt;ref name=p12/&gt;

Alperovich owns several houses and apartments, concessionaires, and many acres of soybeans and cattle. He has auto dealerships, sells truck and agricultural machinery, and is also active in hotel and commercial development and in construction and real estate. He owns several apartment buildings in [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] and over 120,000 hectares of land in Tucumán, Salta, and Santiago del Estero provinces.&lt;ref name=lanac1&gt;{{cite web| last =Lopez| first =Fabian| title =Los Alperovich no tienen 10 mansiones, pero sí una incalculable fortuna| work =La Nacion | date =Mar 30, 2015|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1780221-los-alperovich-no-tienen-10-mansiones-pero-si-una-incalculable-fortuna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of Tucumán Province===
During his early years as governor, Alperovich formed strong political ties with President Nestor Kirchner, who provided funds for various projects in the province that included a comprehensive public-works program.

He was re-elected governor in 2007 with more than 78% of the vote. In that year a law was passed limiting the number of gubernatorial terms to two, starting in 2007. In that year, he was reelected by a 73% margin over Ricardo Bussi, who ran on the right-wing [[Republican Force]] ticket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://towsa.com/andy/totalpais/tucuman/2007g.html|title=Tucumán: Gobernador (2007)|publisher=Atlas Electoral de Andy Tow}}&lt;/ref&gt; He secured a constitutional amendment that would allow him to run for a third term, and in 2008 unsuccessfully proposed another amendment that would remove all gubernatorial term limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xsupuesto.com.ar/nota/nacionales/5786/tucuman-alperovich-obtuvo-la-re-reeleccion.php|title=Tucumán: Alperovich obtuvo la re-reelección|work=Xpuesto|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119214844/http://www.xsupuesto.com.ar/nota/nacionales/5786/tucuman-alperovich-obtuvo-la-re-reeleccion.php|archivedate=2012-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alperovich was able to run for a third term because his 2003-07 term did not count under the 2007 term-limits law, which limited governors of Tucumán to two terms, starting in 2007. He was the first governor in the modern history of Tucumán to be elected for a third time.&lt;ref name=bah1&gt;{{cite web| last =Soltys| first =Michael| title =Tucumán man| work =Buenos Aires Herald| date =Aug 30, 2011|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/77347/tucum%C3%A1n-man}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://towsa.com/andy/totalpais/tucuman/2011g.html|title=Tucumán: Gobernador (2011)|publisher=Atlas Electoral de Andy Tow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife was elected [[List of Provisional Presidents of the Argentine Senate|Provisional President of the Argentine Senate]] in November 2011, and served in the post until February 2014.

Alperovich announced on January 15, 2014, that he would not seek a fourth term as governor, but “did not dismiss the possibility that his wife, Senator Beatriz Rojkés, would run to succeed him in 2015.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Alperovich to leave in 2015| work =Buenos Aires Herald| date =Jan 16, 2014|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/149785/alperovich-to-leave-in-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tulsa Oklahoma Sister Cities Sign crop.jpg|thumb|right|sign for South Main Street, [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]]]
'''Main Street''' is a generic phrase used to denote a primary retail street of a [[village]], [[town]] or small city in many parts of the world. It is usually a focal point for [[Retailing#Shops and Stores|shop]]s and retailers in the [[central business district]], and is most often used in reference to retailing and socializing.

The term is commonly used in Ireland, Scotland, the United States, Canada, and less often in Australia and New Zealand.  In most of the United Kingdom the common description is [[High Street]] though "[[Fore Street]]" or "Front Street" is commonplace in some regions.  In [[Jamaica]] the term is Front Street.

In many places, the [[street name]] for such a street is actually "Main Street", though even where it isn't the term "Main street" is still used to describe the main thoroughfare of the central business district.  The [[U.S. Highway 66 Association|"Main Street of America"]] branding was used to promote [[U.S. Route 66]] in its heyday.

==American cultural usage==
[[File:Bastrop Texas1.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Main Street; [[Bastrop, Texas]], featuring the small shops and old-fashioned architecture typical of rural towns]]
In the general sense, the term "Main Street" refers to a place of traditional values.  Social realists from 1870 to 1930 used the name as a symbol of stifling conformity.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Ann Alexander, "Midwest Main Street in Literature: Symbol of Conformity," ''Rocky Mountain Social Science Journal'' (1968) 5#2 pp 1-12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sherwood Anderson]], for example, wrote ''[[Winesburg, Ohio]]: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small Town Life'' in 1919.  The best-selling 1920 novel ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' was a critique of small town life, by the American writer [[Sinclair Lewis]]. The locale was "Gopher Prairie," presented as an 'ideal type' of the Midwestern town, and the heroine, Carol Kennicott, was a more urbane, 'ideal-typical' Progressive.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jürgen Grabbe, "The Ideal Type of the Small Town: 'Main Street' in a Social Science Context," ''Amerikastudien'' (1987) 32#2 pp 181-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In North American media of later decades, "Main Street" represents the interests of everyday people and [[small business]] owners, in contrast with "[[Wall Street]]" (in the United States) or "[[Bay Street]]" (in Canada), symbolizing the interests of large national corporations.  Thus, in the 1949 movie adaptation of [[On the Town (film)|''On The Town'']], the song "When You Walk Down Main Street With Me" refers to small-town values and social life. [[Main Street Republicans]], for example, see themselves as supporting those values as against urbane or "Wall Street" tendencies.

"Main Street" is part of the [[iconography]] of American life. For example,  the [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]], the outfit that operates the PX and BX stores on military bases, chose the name "Main Street USA" for its food courts.

''Main Street'' was a popular term during the economic crises in 2008 and 2009: [[Proposed bailout of U.S. financial system (2008)|the proposed bailout of U.S. financial system]], the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential campaign]], and [[United States presidential election debates, 2008|debates]]. One widely reviewed book was ''Bailout: An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street'' (2012) by [[Neil Barofsky]].

In small towns across the United States, Main Street is not only the major road running through town but the site of all street life, a place where townspeople hang out and watch the annual parades go by. A slang term popularized in the early 20th century, "main drag", is also used to refer to a town's main street.

===Walt Disney===

Two [[Walt Disney Company]] [[theme park]]s, [[Disneyland]] in Anaheim, California, and the [[Magic Kingdom]] in the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] near Orlando, Florida, both have "[[Main Street, U.S.A.]]" sections immediately at their front. These areas, which are designed to look like the main street of a small town, house gift shops, restaurants and various services, along with park offices on the second floors. While the architecture of these "streets" appears to be turn-of-the-20th-century, in fact these are decorative false-fronts on [[Industrial Style|industrial-style]] buildings. Main Street, U.S.A. is also present at [[Disneyland Paris]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]. At [[Tokyo Disneyland]] the area is named "World Bazaar," but has the same look as Main Street, albeit housed under a decorative glass roof for protection from Japan's unpredictable weather.

Disney's design copied visual elements of small-town America seen in films by [[Frank Capra]] and others, in a deliberate attempt to capture the iconic symbolism of small-town America. Disney wanted to embed the values and memories associated with life in small towns into an entertainment experience for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Neuman, "Disneyland's Main Street, USA, and its Sources in Hollywood, USA," ''Journal of American Culture'' (2008) 31#1 pp 83-97, online&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preservation and Main Street===
[[National Trust for Historic Preservation#National Trust Main Street Center|Main Street Inc.]] is the name of a community revitalization program begun by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in the late 1970s. The core of the Main Street philosophy is the preservation of the historic built environment by engaging in [[historic preservation]]. Main Street focuses on a holistic approach to revitalization based on the 4-point approach of design, promotion, economic restructuring, and organization. Originally targeted at small, traditional downtowns, the program has expanded to include towns of various sizes, including neighborhood districts in several large urban centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainstreet.org/|title=Home Page|date=2009-04-09|work=Main Street|publisher=National Main Street Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many communities, a merchants' association or [[business improvement district]] serves a promotional role on behalf of the merchants of a downtown Main Street. Individual city governments also may engage in revitalisation or historic preservation efforts to support a downtown core, either to make a community appear more attractive for [[tourism]] or to stem a flow of commerce out of the city into [[suburb]]s with [[shopping mall]]s and cookie-cutter [[big box store]]s.

In the [[United States of America|United States]] federal funds are allocated specifically for restoration of historic properties on the former [[U.S. Route 66]], the main street of many roadside towns; this funding is administered by the US [[National Park Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/listofsites66.html|title=Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary: Route 66|publisher=US [[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International use and equivalents ==

* Many small Canadian cities and towns have a thoroughfare named Main Street (or, in French, ''Rue principale''); in other cases, the main street of the community has a name particular to that community. The phrase "a town where the main street is still called Main Street" is occasionally used as being synonymous with small-town values.
** In [[Ottawa]], main streets of various individual [[village]]s which had been annexed to the larger urban municipality bear names like "Manotick Main" or "Osgoode Main" to distinguish them from Smyth Road (which becomes "Main Street" in one small area southeast of downtown Ottawa) and from each other. The actual main street of centretown Ottawa is [[Bank Street (Ottawa)|Bank Street]].
** In [[Toronto]], Main Street is a mostly residential avenue in the [[East York]] district.&lt;ref name=ShapingToronto/&gt;&lt;ref name=RailsAcross/&gt;&lt;ref name=MikeFileyTheWayWeWere2008/&gt; At one time it was the main street of the hamlet of [[East Toronto]], which was annexed by the city of Toronto in 1908. It has kept its historic name, and evidence of its commercial origins can be seen in the stores at the corner of Main and Gerrard Streets. Toronto's main street is considered to be [[Yonge Street]], which divides the city's latitudinal streets into east-west.
** [[Saint Laurent Boulevard]], which divides [[Montreal]] between east and west, is unofficially known as "the Main." 
** Main Street in [[Vancouver]] is a neighbourhood shopping street, near the dividing line between east and west side of town. However, the city's main city centre shopping street is Robson Street.
* In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], smaller urban centres often have a main street. In some towns this street is officially designated Main Street or High Street; rarer variants include Main Road, Commercial Road, and Commerce Street. Often, though, the street is given a name peculiar to the town. For many small towns, the main street forms part of the principal road into, or through, the town. Large centres often have a [[central business district]] in which no one street is a clear focus for commercial activity, though for historical or cultural reasons there is often one street regarded as the city's "main street". Examples include [[Melbourne]]'s [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], [[Sydney]]'s [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]], [[Adelaide]]'s King William Street, [[Auckland]]'s Queen Street, and [[Christchurch]]'s [[Colombo Street]].
* In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] most towns have a "main street", and this is usually the term given colloquially (for example, in offering road directions), though the primary thoroughfare of cities are often named after an historical figure, e.g. [[O'Connell Street]]. A more recent phenomenon in the media and with younger people is the misapplication of the term "high street" to describe typical or average street level fashion&amp;mdash;likely due to advertising by various British retail multiples which began operating in Ireland during the "Celtic Tiger" years.
* In [[England]], the terms "Market Street" or "Market Place" are often used to designate the heart of a town or city,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} as is the more common High Street (particularly in newer urban developments, or towns or cities which were not original market towns). [[High Street]] is often the name of a fairly busy street with small shops on either side, often in towns and villages.
* In [[Germany]], the [[Hauptstraße (allgemein)|Hauptstraße]] (literally "Main Street") is a highly trafficked street. Hauptstraßen even have formal recognition in road construction guidelines, which specify the width of lanes, for example. The term chiefly refers to motorized traffic, whereas "Einkaufsstraße" (shopping street) or "Fußgängerzone" (pedestrian district) refer to retail in the sense of Engl. "Main Street".
* In [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], almost all towns and cities have their own main street, a street called ''Storgatan''/''Storgaten'' (literally, "The big street"). They are typically surrounded by stores and restaurants, and increasingly since the late-20th century open for [[pedestrian]]s only. Likewise, in both [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] this type of street is called ''gågata''/''gågate'' (literally, "walkingstreet").
* In most [[Comune|Italian municipalities]], the highway or another major route is called ''Via [[Rome|Roma]]''. This was done at the behest of [[Benito Mussolini]], who gave the order in 1939 to commemorate the [[March on Rome]].
* ''[[Jalan Besar]]'' (roughly translated from [[Malay language|Malay]] as "Main Road") is a common street name used in [[Malaysia]] (and to a more limited extent, [[Singapore]]) when referring to main streets of older urban centres in the country. Such main streets were originally constructed during British colonisation of territories in present-day Malaysia and Singapore, and were named in English as "Main Street" or "Main Road", depending on the size and nature of the urban centre, and often are laid out as parts of major thoroughfares between larger towns and cities.
** The independence of states that would form Malaysia and the introduction of the [[Malay language]] as the country's national language in 1967 led to extensive renaming of certain Main Streets or Main Roads to "''Jalan Besar''" in Malaysia the following decades. Large cities (such as [[List of capitals in Malaysia|state capitals]]) tend to forgo the use of "Main Street" or "Main Road" altogether as commercial or transport activity may be concentrated along more than one street.
* In [[South Africa]], Main Road is the term used for the same concept as Main Street in the U.S. and High Street in the UK.
* In [[Rural Khmer house|Cambodia]], the Main Road is between the Rice fields and settlements.
* In [[Industrial engineering|Industrial Engineering]], "Main Street" is often used to describe a conveyor which transports the fundamental materials for producing objects to the automated construction site where the intended object will be assembled.

'''Marousi''' or '''Maroussi''' ({{lang-el|Μαρούσι}}, also Αμαρούσιο ''Amarousio'') is a suburb in the northeastern part of the [[Athens]] agglomeration, [[Greece]]. Marousi dates back to the era of the [[History of Athens|ancient Athenian Republic]]; its ancient name was Athmonon (Ἄθμονον) and it represented one of the 10 Athenian sub-cities. The area held a main ancient [[temple]], where Amarysia [[Artemis]], the goddess of hunting, was adored, and the city's modern name derives from that of the goddess, ''Amarysia'', which denotes the origin of the worship back in [[Amarynthos]], [[Euboea]].

==Geography==

Marousi is situated {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of Athens city centre. The municipality has an area of 12.938 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=stat01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |publisher=National Statistical Service of Greece |title=Population &amp; housing census 2001 (incl. area and average elevation) |language=el |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921212047/http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The built-up area of Marousi is continuous with those of the neighbouring suburbs [[Pefki]], [[Kifisia]], [[Vrilissia]] and [[Halandri]]. Within Marousi lies the biggest forest in urban Athens, "Dasos Syngrou" (also "Alsos Syggrou"). The [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex]], the largest sports complex in Greece, built for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], is located in the southwestern part of the municipality.

The main thoroughfare is [[Kifisias Avenue]], which connects Marousi with central Athens and the northern beltway [[Motorway 6 (Greece)|Motorway 6]]. Marousi has 3 stations on [[Line 1 (Athens Metro)|Athens Metro Line 1]], and two suburban ([[Proastiakos]]) commuter railway stations: [[Nerantziotissa station]] and [[Kifisias railway station]].

Marousi is also home to a number of prestigious public ([[Peiramatiko Lyceum Anavryton]]) and private educational institutions.

==Economy==

Marousi's favourable infrastructure ([[Motorway 6 (Greece)|Motorway 6]], [[Athens Metro]], [[Proastiakos]] suburban railroad) has led to strong economic growth. The main offices of the Greek subsidiaries of several [[multinational corporation]]s, including [[Kodak]], [[Bayer]], [[Kimberly-Clark]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Nestlé]], and the [[ANT1]] television studios are located in Marousi. The managing office of [[Consolidated Contractors Company]], a large Middle Eastern and International EPC Contractor, is located in Marousi. [[The Mall Athens]], one of the largest shopping centres in southeastern Europe, is situated in the southwestern part of Marousi.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''Media strategy''', as used in the [[advertising]] or [[content delivery]] (online broadcasting) industries, is concerned with how messages will be delivered to [[consumer]]s or [[niche markets]]. It involves: identifying the characteristics of the target audience or market, who should receive messages and defining the characteristics of the [[Mass media|media]] that will be used for the delivery of the messages, with the intent being to influence the behaviour of the [[target audience]] or market pertinent to the initial brief. Examples of such strategies today have revolved around an [[Integrated Marketing Communications]] approach whereby multiple channels of media are used i.e. [[advertising]], [[public relations]], events, [[direct response media]], etc.

This concept has been used among proponents of [[entertainment]]-education programming where pro-social messages are embedded into dramatic episodic programs to change the audiences attitudes and behaviors in such areas as [[family planning]], [[literacy]], [[nutrition]], [[Tobacco advertising#Anti-smoking advertising|smoking]], etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8544">A '''memorandum of understanding''' ('''MoU''') is a type of agreement between two ([[bilateralism|bilateral]]) or more ([[multilateralism|multilateral]]) parties. It expresses a convergence of will between the parties, indicating an intended common line of action. It is often used either in cases where parties do not imply a legal commitment or in situations where the parties cannot create a legally enforceable agreement. It is a more formal alternative to a [[gentlemen's agreement]].

Whether a document constitutes a binding contract depends only on the presence or absence of well-defined legal elements in the text proper of the document (the so-called "[[Four corners (law)|four corners]]"). The required elements are: [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]], and the [[intention to be legally bound]] (''animus contrahendi''). In the U.S., the specifics can differ slightly depending on whether the contract is for goods (falls under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] [UCC]) or services (falls under the common law of the state).

==Inside a company or government agency==
Many companies and government agencies use MoUs to define a relationship between departments, agencies or closely held companies.
In the [[United Kingdom]], the term MOU is commonly used to refer to an agreement between parts of [[The Crown]]. The term is often used in the context of [[devolution#United Kingdom|devolution]], for example the 1999 concordat between the central [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] and the Scottish [[Environment Directorate]]. 

MoUs can also be used between a government agency and a non-commercial, non-governmental organization. Examples from international development contexts include: 

* MoUs developed by grassroots organizations working with municipalities in South Africa to improve land and housing for the urban poor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradlow|first=Benjamin Hofman|date=2013|others=Department of Urban Studies and Planning, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.|title=Quiet conflict : social movements, institutional change, and upgrading informal settlements in South Africa|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/80905|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The MoU used by NGOs and the Bangladeshi government to determine tasks under the National Tuberculosis Control Programme&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Batley|first=Richard|last2=Mcloughlin|first2=Claire|date=2010-02-01|title=Engagement with Non-State Service Providers in Fragile States: Reconciling State-Building and Service Delivery|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7679.2010.00478.x|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=131–154|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2010.00478.x|issn=0950-6764}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The MoU used by city authorities and NGOs in [[Harare]], Zimbabwe to collaboratively document and upgrade [[Slum|slums]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shand|first=Wayne|date=2018-08-06|title=Making spaces for co-production: collaborative action for settlement upgrading in Harare, Zimbabwe|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956247818783962|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|pages=095624781878396|doi=10.1177/0956247818783962|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In public international law==
In international relations, MoUs fall under the broad category of [[treaty|treaties]] and should be registered in the [[United Nations]] treaty collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/ |title=United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher=treaties.un.org |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice and in spite of the [[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs]]' insistence that registration be done to avoid 'secret diplomacy', MoUs are sometimes kept confidential. As a matter of law, the title of MoU does not necessarily mean the document is binding or not binding under international law. To determine whether a particular MoU is meant to be a legally binding document (i.e., a treaty), one needs to examine the parties’ intent as well as the signatories' position (e.g., Minister of Foreign Affairs vs. Minister of Environment). A careful analysis of the wording will also clarify the exact nature of the document. The [[International Court of Justice]] has provided some insight into the determination of the legal status of a document in the landmark case of ''Qatar v. Bahrain'', 1 July 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=1&amp;PHPSESSID=66a15edfa6bb89698b26627e76c1d56b&amp;case=87&amp;code=qb&amp;p3=4/ |publisher=International Court of Justice |title=Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain (Qatar v. Bahrain)|date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
One advantage of MoUs over more formal instruments is that, because obligations under international law may be avoided, they can often be put into effect without requiring legislative approval. Hence, MoUs are often used to modify and adapt existing treaties, in which case these MoUs have factual treaty status. The decision concerning ratification, however, is determined by the parties' internal law and depends to a large degree on the subject agreed upon. MoUs that are kept confidential (i.e., not registered with the UN) cannot be enforced before any UN organ, and it may be concluded that no obligations under international law have been created. As was obvious{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} in ''Qatar v. Bahrain'', disputes may arise concerning the status of the document once one of the parties seeks to enforce its provisions.

Although MoUs in the [[multilateralism|multilateral]] field are seldom seen, the transnational [[aviation]] agreements are actually MoUs.

===Examples===
Examples include:
* The ''Memorandum of Understanding Relating to the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems on May 26, 1972'' signed by US President [[Richard Nixon]] and the [[Soviet Union]] updating the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ABM Treaty: Memorandum of Understanding |work=Treaty Compliance |publisher=[[Office of the Secretary of Defense |Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics]] |url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/tc/treaties/abm/72sccreg.htm |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Memorandum of Understanding on Hijacking of Aircraft and Vessels and Other Offenses'' between the US and [[Cuba]], meant to criminalize hijacking in both countries (February 3, 1973)
* The agreement between the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Cuba]], under which Cayman immigration officers must give Cuban refugees two choices: disembark and be repatriated back to Cuba, or continue on their way with no help{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
* The [[Agreed Framework]] between the U.S. and North Korea over nuclear weaponry on October 21, 1994
* The [[Oil for Food program]], for which [[Iraq]] signed an MoU in 1996
* The agreement between the government of [[Indonesia]] and the [[Free Aceh Movement|GAM]] in the [[Aceh]] peace process, 15 August 2005.
* The agreement between the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Jordan (country)|Jordan]], [[Libya]] and [[Lebanon]] regarding potential extradition of suspects (commonly [[terrorist]] suspects), who, if they are to be tried, must be tried fairly and in a manner similar to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]; for example, withholding from using evidence obtained through the use of [[torture]] (Article 3). Such an understanding has been criticised for its inability to be legally enforced. This has been highlighted in the current deportation process of the suspected terrorist [[Abu Qatada]], who is wanted by Jordan in connection with a terrorist attack. However, at present, the Court of Appeal has rejected the UK Government's appeal based on the Court's concern of Jordan obtaining evidence potentially incriminating Qatada through the use of torture.
* The ''Memorandums of Understanding on Labour Cooperation'' between the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Singapore]] and [[New Zealand]] on 2008, in parallel with their respective free trade agreements
*The [[Under2 MOU]] is a 2015 memorandum of understanding which sets [[climate change mitigation]] goals for jurisdictions with over 1 billion residents.

'''Nominative determinism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that people tend to gravitate towards [[vocation|areas of work]] that fit their names. The term was first used in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1994, after the magazine's humorous Feedback column noted several studies carried out by researchers with remarkably fitting [[surname]]s. These included a book on polar explorations by [[Daniel Snowman]] and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon. These and other examples led to light-hearted speculation that some sort of psychological effect was at work. Since the term appeared, nominative determinism has been an irregularly recurring topic in ''New Scientist'', as readers continue to submit examples. Nominative determinism differs from the related concept [[aptronym]], and its synonyms aptonym, namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name, in that it focusses on causality. "Aptronym" merely means the name is fitting, without saying anything about why it has come to fit.

The idea that people are drawn to professions that fit their name was suggested by psychologist [[Carl Jung]], citing as an example [[Sigmund Freud]] who studied pleasure and whose surname means "joy". A few recent empirical studies have indicated that certain professions are disproportionately represented by people with appropriate surnames (and sometimes given names), though the methods of these studies have been challenged. One explanation for nominative determinism is ''[[implicit egotism]]'', which states that humans have an unconscious preference for things they associate with themselves. An alternative explanation is [[genetic determinism|genetic]]: a person might be named Smith or Taylor because that was originally their occupation, and they would pass on their genes to their descendants, including an aptitude for activities involving strength in the case of Smith, or dexterity in the case of Taylor.

==Background==
Before people could gravitate towards areas of work that matched their names, many people were given names that matched their area of work.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=2}} The way people are named has changed over time.{{sfn|Fowler|2012| p=11}} In pre-urban times people were only known by a single name &amp;ndash; for example, the Anglo-Saxon name Beornheard.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{efn-ua|Even the Romans, whose [[Roman naming conventions|naming system]] is generally assumed to have used three names, started out with a single name, e.g., Romulus. Over the course of fourteen centuries this then first evolved to two names, to three names (e.g., [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], where Marcus is the [[praenomen]], Tullius the [[nomen gentilicium]], and Cicero the [[cognomen]]), back to two names, and finally one name again.{{sfn|Salway|1994|p=124–126}}}} Single names were chosen for their meaning or given as [[nickname]]s.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=71}} In England it was only after the [[Norman conquest]] that surnames were added, although there were a few earlier [[Epithet|bynames]] that were not hereditary,{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{sfn|McKinley|1990|pp=25–34}}  such as [[Edmund Ironside]].{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}} Surnames were created to fit the person, mostly from [[patronymic|patronyms]] (e.g., John son of William becomes John Williamson), [[occupational name|occupational descriptions]] (e.g., John Carpenter), character or traits (e.g., John Long), or location (e.g., John from Acton became John Acton).{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=2}} Names were not initially hereditary; only by the mid-14th century did they gradually become so.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=viii}} Surnames relating to trades or craft were the first to become hereditary, as the craft often persisted within the family for generations.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=143}}{{efn-ua|Ancient Roman fathers passed on their cognomen to their children as well.{{sfn|Salway|1994|p=127}} According to Gaius Plinius Secundus, better known as [[Pliny the Elder]], cognomina derived from occupations were initially taken from agriculture &amp;ndash; for example, Cicero means chickpea. Ergo, Marcus Tullius Cicero, the orator, was a descendent of a grower of chickpeas,{{sfn|Wilson|2003|p=10}} although it is also said the cognomen was given for the shape of the nose being similar to that of a chickpea.{{sfn|McKeown|2010|p=22}}}} The appropriateness of occupational names has decreased over time, because tradesmen did not always follow their fathers:{{sfn|Fowler| 2012|p=11}} an early example from the 14th century is "Roger Carpenter the pepperer".{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=143}}

Another aspect of naming was the importance attached to the wider meaning contained in a name. In 17th-century England it was believed that choosing a name for a child should be done carefully. Children should live according to the message contained in, or the meaning of their names.{{sfn|Smith-Bannister|1997|p=11}} In 1652 [[William Jenkyn]], an English clergyman, argued that first names should be "as a thread tyed about the finger to make us mindful of the errand we came into the world to do for our Master".{{sfn|Jenkyn|1652|p=7}} In 1623, at a time when [[Puritans|Puritan]] names such as Faith, Fortitude and Grace were appearing for the first time, English historian [[William Camden]] wrote that names should be chosen with "good and gracious significations", as they might inspire the bearer to good actions.{{sfn|Camden|1984|p=43}}{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=14}} With the rise of the [[British Empire]] the English naming system and English surnames spread across large portions of the globe.{{ sfn|American Council of Learned Societies|1998|p=180}}

By the beginning of the 20th century, Smith and Taylor were two of the three most frequently occurring English surnames; both were occupational, though few smiths and tailors remained.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=43–44}}{{efn-ua|Over time many surnames in patrilineal systems go extinct, sometimes leaving a few to dominate, depending on factors such as number of male children, immigration and merging women's surnames with their spouses upon marriage. A [[Korean surnames|Korean surname]] has a 43% chance of being either Kim, Lee or Park. The [[Galton–Watson process]] models mathematically how much chance a surname has to survive. Under constant assumptions of 1 in 3 chance of 0, 1 or 2 sons, there is a 67% chance that by the fourth generation the surname has died out.{{sfn|Ratzan|2004|p=120–122}}}} When a correspondence between a name and an occupation did occur, it became worthy of note. In an 1888 issue of the ''[[Kentish Note Book]]'' magazine a list appeared with "several carriers by the name of Carter; a hosier named Hosegood; an auctioneer named Sales; and a draper named Cuff".{{sfn|Feedback|2000}}  Since then, a variety of terms for the concept of a close relationship between name and occupation have emerged. The term ''[[aptronym]]'' is thought to have been coined in the early 20th century by the American newspaper columnist [[Franklin Pierce Adams|Franklin P. Adams]].{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=18}} Linguist Frank Nuessel coined ''aptonym'', without an "r", in 1992.{{sfn|Nuessel|1992}} Other synonyms include ''euonym'',{{sfn|Room|1996|p=40}} ''Perfect Fit Last Name'' (PFLN),{{sfn|Levey|1985}} and ''namephreak''.{{sfn|Conrad|1999|p=16}} In [[literary science]] a name that particularly suits a character is called a ''charactonym''.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|1995|p=229}} Notable authors who frequently used charactonyms as a stylistic technique include [[Charles Dickens]] (e.g., [[Gradgrind|Mr. Gradgrind]], the tyrannical schoolmaster){{sfn|Lederer|2010|p=67}} and [[William Shakespeare]] (e.g., the lost baby [[Perdita (The Winter's Tale)|Perdita]] in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'').{{sfn|Cavill|2016|p=365}} Unlike nominative determinism, the concept of aptronym and its synonyms do not say anything about causality, i.e. why the name has come to fit.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=16}}

Because of the potentially humorous nature of aptronyms a number of newspapers have collected them. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Herb Caen]] reported irregularly on reader-submitted gems, including substitute teacher Mr. Fillin, piano teacher Patience Scales, and the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s spokesman on the evils of rock 'n roll, Cardinal Rapsong.{{sfn|Conrad|1999|p=16–17}} Similarly, the journalist Bob Levey on occasion listed examples sent in by readers of his column in ''[[The Washington Post]]'': a food industry consultant named Faith Popcorn, a lieutenant called Sergeant, and a tax accountant called Shelby Goldgrab.{{sfn|Levey|1985}}{{sfn|Levey|2000}} Dutch newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]'' had an irregularly featured column called "Nomen est omen" with Dutch examples.{{sfn|Hoekstra|2011|p=45}} Individual name collectors have also published books of aptronyms.{{sfn|Dickson|1996}}{{sfn|Hoekstra|2001}} [[Onomastics|Onomastic]] scholar R.M. Rennick called for more verification of aptronyms appearing in newspaper columns and books.{{sfn|Rennick|1982|p=193}} Lists of aptronyms in science, medicine, and law are more reliable as they tend to be drawn from easily verifiable sources.{{sfn| Keaney|Groarke|Galvin|McGorrian|2013}}{{sfn|Bennett|1992}}

==Definition==
Nominative determinism, literally "name-driven outcome",{{sfn|Alter|2013|p=7}} is the [[hypothesis]] that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work which reflect their names. The name fits because people, possibly subconsciously, made themselves fit. Nominative determinism differs from the concept of aptronyms in that it focuses on causality.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=16}}

The term has its origin in the "Feedback" column of the British magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1994. A series of events raised the suspicion of its editor, John Hoyland, who wrote in the 5 November issue:

{{quote|We recently came across a new book, ''Pole Positions—The Polar Regions and the Future of the Planet'', by [[Daniel Snowman]].{{sfn|Snowman|1993}} Then, a couple of weeks later, we received a copy of ''London Under London—A Subterranean Guide'', one of the authors of which is Richard Trench.{{sfn|Trench|1993}} So it was interesting to see Jen Hunt of the [[University of Manchester]] stating in the October issue of ''[[The Psychologist (publication)|The Psychologist]]'': "Authors gravitate to the area of research which fits their surname."{{sfn|Hunt|1994|p=480}} Hunt's example is an article on incontinence in the ''[[British Journal of Urology]]'' by A. J. Splatt and D. Weedon.{{sfn|Splatt|Weedon|1977}}

We feel it's time to open up this whole issue to rigorous scrutiny. You are invited to send in examples of the phenomenon in the fields of science and technology (with references that check out, please) together with any hypotheses you may have on how it comes about.{{sfn|Feedback|1994a}}}}

Feedback editors John Hoyland and Mike Holderness subsequently adopted the term ''nominative determinism'' as suggested by reader C. R. Cavonius. The term first appeared in the 17 December issue.{{sfn|Alter|2013|p=230}} Even though the magazine tried to ban the topic numerous times over the decades since,{{sfn|Feedback|2015}} readers kept sending in curious examples. These included the U.S. Navy spokesman put up to answer journalists' questions about the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], one Lieutenant Mike Kafka;{{sfn|Feedback|2004}} authors of the book ''The Imperial Animal'' Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox;{{sfn|Feedback|2005}} and the UK Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on knife crime, Alfred Hitchcock.{{sfn|Feedback|2007}}

As used in ''New Scientist'' the term nominative determinism only applies to work.{{sfn|Feedback|1994a}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994b}}{{sfn|Feedback|2000}}{{sfn|Feedback|2015}} In contributions to other newspapers ''New Scientist'' writers have stuck to this definition, with the exception of editor Roger Highfield in a column in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', in which he included "key attributes of life".{{sfn|Highfield|2011}}{{sfn|Colls|2011}}{{sfn|Telegraph staff|2011}}{{efn-ua|Others have extended the area of influence; for example researchers Keaney ''et al.'' entitled their study into the relationship between people called Brady and those who had pacemakers inserted for [[bradycardia]] "The Brady Bunch? New evidence for nominative determinism in patients' health".{{sfn| Keaney|Groarke|Galvin|McGorrian|2013}}}}

Prior to 1994 other terms for the suspected psychological effect were used sporadically. ''Onomastic determinism'' was used as early as 1970 by [[Roberta Frank]].{{sfn|Frank|1970|p=25}} German psychologist [[Wilhelm Stekel]] spoke of "Die Verpflichtung des Namens" (the obligation of the name) in 1911.{{sfn|Stekel|1911|p=110}} Outside of science, ''cognomen syndrome'' was used by playwright [[Tom Stoppard]] in his 1972 play ''[[Jumpers (play)|Jumpers]]''.{{sfn|Stoppard|1972|p=52}} In [[Ancient Rome]] the predictive power of a person's name was captured by the Latin proverb "nomen est omen", meaning the name is a sign.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}} This saying is still in use today in English{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}} and other languages such as French,{{sfn|Fibbi|Kaya|Piguet|2003|p=0}} German,{{sfn|Schaffer-Suchomel|2009|p=1}} Italian,{{sfn|Gerber|2006|p=0}} Dutch,{{sfn|Hoekstra|2001|p=1}} and Slovenian.{{sfn|Duša|Kenda|2011|p=0}}

''New Scientist'' coined the term ''nominative contradeterminism'' for people who move away from their name, creating a contradiction between name and occupation. Examples include Andrew Waterhouse, a professor of wine,{{sfn|Feedback|2014b}} would-be doctor Thomas Edward Kill, who subsequently changed his name to Jirgensohn,{{sfn|Slovenko|1983|p=227}} and the Archbishop of Manila, [[Jaime Sin|Cardinal Sin]].{{sfn|Feedback|1996}}{{efn-ua|Over the years ''New Scientist'' has reported on other variations on the theme, including ''onomatopoeic nominative determinism'' (e.g., [[European Space Agency]] chief mission scientist Bernard Foing),{{sfn|Feedback|2006}} ''nominative indeterminism'' (to explain the existence of hundreds of scientific articles whose authors include a Wong and a Wright),{{sfn|Feedback|2014a}} and ''occupational preferentialism'' (the hypothesis that one's work influences one's taste, for example policemen liking [[John Constable|Constable]]'s paintings).{{sfn|Feedback|1999}}}} The synonym ''inaptronym'' is also sometimes used.{{sfn|Nunn|2014}}

==Research==
===Theoretical framework===
The first scientists to discuss the concept that names had a determining effect were early 20th-century German psychologists.{{sfn|Flugel|1930|p=208}} Wilhelm Stekel spoke of the "obligation of the name" in the context of compulsive behaviour and choice of occupation;{{sfn|Stekel|1911|p=110}} [[Karl Abraham]] wrote that the determining power of names might be partially caused by inheriting a trait from an ancestor who was given a fitting name. He made the further inference that families with fitting names might then try to live up to their names in some way.{{sfn|Abraham|1979|p=31}} In 1952 [[Carl Jung]] referred to Stekel's work in his theory of [[synchronicity]] (events without causal relationship that yet seem to be meaningfully related):{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=27}}

{{Quote|We find ourselves in something of a quandary when it comes to making up our minds about the phenomenon which Stekel calls the "compulsion of the name". What he means by this is the sometimes quite gross coincidence between a man's name and his peculiarities or profession. For instance&amp;nbsp;... Herr Feist (Mr Stout) is the food minister, Herr Rosstäuscher (Mr Horsetrader) is a lawyer, Herr Kalberer (Mr Calver) is an obstetrician&amp;nbsp;... Are these the whimsicalities of chance, or the suggestive effects of the name, as Stekel seems to suggest, or are they "meaningful coincidences"?{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=15}}}}

Jung listed striking instances among psychologists—including himself: "Herr [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] (Joy) champions the [[Beyond the Pleasure Principle|pleasure principle]], Herr [[Gerhard Adler|Adler]] (Eagle) the will to power, Herr Jung (Young) the idea of rebirth&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=15}}

In 1975 psychologist Lawrence Casler called for empirical research into the relative frequencies of career-appropriate names to establish if there is an effect at work or whether we are being "seduced by [[Fortuna|Lady Luck]]". He proposed three possible explanations for nominative determinism: one's self-image and self-expectation being internally influenced by one's name; the name acting as a social stimulus, creating expectations in others that are then communicated to the individual; and genetics – attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname.{{sfn|Casler|1975|p=472}}

In 2002 the researchers Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing that people have a basic desire to feel good about themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the [[self]]. Given the ''[[endowment effect|mere ownership effect]]'', which states that people like things more if they own them, the researchers theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name.{{efn-ua|Studies have shown that most people like the name given to them.{{sfn|Joubert|1985|p=983}} Extensive research also has found a strong effect called the [[name-letter effect]]: when given the choice between letters, people significantly prefer the ones from their own name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=353}}}} They called this unconscious power ''[[implicit egotism]]''.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}} Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011|p=46}} Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.{{sfn|Smeets|2009|p=11}}

===Empirical evidence===
[[File:Igor Judge 2007 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of a man|[[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Igor Judge]], a former judge]]
Those with fitting names give differing accounts of the effect of their name on their career choices. [[Igor Judge]], former [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=18}} Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision.{{sfn|Silverman|Light|2011}} Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force.{{sfn|Nelson}} Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms,{{sfn|Cole|2001}} was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said "That had never occurred to me."{{sfn|Nevid|Rathus|2009|p=202}} [[Church of England]] vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers had anything to do with him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".{{sfn|Colls|2011}}

How much is down to the subconscious is difficult to say, but the fact that your name is similar may be a reason for showing more interest in a profession than you might otherwise.

While reports by owners of fitting names are of interest, some scientists have questioned their value in deciding whether nominative determinism is a real effect.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=18}}{{sfn|Smeets|2009|p=14}} Instead, they argue that the claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}} To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed.{{sfn|Bateson|Martin|2001|p=124}} In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479–480}} However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham ''et al.'' for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham ''et al.'' to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011|p=23}}{{efn-ua|Confounding variables have also played a role in research into ''monogrammic determinism'': in 1999 Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive monograms (e.g., ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g., PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999}} Morrison &amp; Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artifact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. Indeed when grouping the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005}}}}

Aware of Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Mauricio published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds.{{efn-ua|Initially Pelham and colleagues defended their methods in a rebuttal Simonsohn assessed as also lacking in diligence.{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2011|p=25}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=31}}}} In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations whose titles matched their surnames, for example, baker, carpenter, and farmer.{{sfn|Pelham|Mauricio|2015|p=692}}

In 2009 Michalos reported the results of an analysis of the occurrences of people with the surname Counsell registered as independent barristers in England and Wales versus those with the name in England and Wales as whole. Given the low frequency of the name in England and Wales as a whole he expected to find no one registered, but three barristers named Counsell were found.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}}

In 2015 researchers Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb published a paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the [[General Medical Council]], and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an [[orthopedic surgery|orthopaedic surgeon]], and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided a wide range of alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were [[genitourinary medicine]] (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and [[urology]] (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). [[Neurology|Neurologists]] had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables.{{sfn|Limb|Limb|Limb|Limb|2015|p=24–26}} In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, "doc", "law", and likewise found a significant relationship between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds were more likely to be [[radiology|radiologists]] than [[dermatology|dermatologists]].{{sfn|Abel|2010|p=65}} Two separate studies by Krajick and Neimi in 2005, both analysing large samples of names of scientists, showed 1.35% of geologists having names referring to their field, and in political science, 1.26%.{{sfn|Krajick|2005|p=15}}{{sfn|Neimi|2005|p=13}}

As for Casler's third possible explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, but it was not statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}

'''Procurement software''' is [[business software]] that helps to automate the purchasing function of organizations. Activities including raising and approving [[purchase order]]s, selecting and ordering the product or service, receiving and matching the invoice and order, and paying the bill is handled electronically, enabling the procurement department to see everything that is ordered, ensure that nothing can be ordered without correct approvals, and lets them get the best value by combining several orders for the same type of good or even getting suppliers to bid for the business.  Buying organisation's choice can be driven by the particular strengths offered by each individual system and the number of vendors available through them. A multinational or otherwise large organization will use a shared procurement system to take advantage of [[economies of scale]] to drive down the cost of purchases. While traditionally most e-procurement software systems have been designed for larger organizations, there are now also systems available for the SMB market, such as [https://free-procurement.com/about/ the Free-Procurement Project] and an open source alternative by ProcuMan. Whilst some services are available to purchase through automated systems, the key strength of these systems lies in the procurement of commodities that are much easier to standardise.

The key benefit for organisations using procurement software include ease of administration and potential long-term cost savings. Having a single interface for procurement related management information cuts down the time and effort required to monitor organisational spending. The use of such software also allows procurement managers to control the vendors used by the wider organisation so all employees take advantage of negotiated rates and other terms of service.

A '''root cause''' is an initiating [[cause]] of either a condition or a [[causal chain]] that leads to an outcome or effect of interest. The term denotes the earliest, most basic, 'deepest', cause for a given behavior; most often a fault. The idea is that you can only see an error by its manifest signs. Those signs can be widespread, multitudinous, and convoluted, whereas the '''root cause''' leading to them often is a lot simpler.

A "root cause" is a "cause" (harmful factor) that is "root" (deep, basic, fundamental, underlying, initial or the like).

The term "root cause" appeared in professional journals as early as 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date = 18 November 1905 | volume = 166 | title=The Present State of Medical Practice in the Rhondda Valley| journal=The Lancet | pages = 1507 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)68499-4 | issue = 4290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantin (2014) describes the root cause as the result of the drill-down [[root cause analysis]] required to discover which is the process that is failing, defining it as "MIN Process" (meaning a process that is Missing, Incomplete or Not followed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ivan |last=Fantin |year=2014 |title=Applied Problem Solving: Method, Applications, Root Causes, Countermeasures, Poka-Yoke and A3 |location=Milan, Italy |publisher=Createspace, an Amazon company |isbn=9781499122282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, projects may fail due to unrealistic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pitagorsky|first1=George|title=The Zen Approach to Project Management: Working from Your Center to Balance Expectations and Performance|publisher=IIL Publishing|isbn=9780970827692|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbtDSBxeqC0C&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=Unrealistic%20expectations%20root%20cause&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism, the [[three poisons]] are the root causes of suffering.

'''Scrubber''' systems (e.g. chemical scrubbers, gas scrubbers) are a diverse group of [[air pollution]] control devices that can be used to remove some [[particulate]]s and/or gases from industrial exhaust streams. The first air scrubber was designed to remove carbon dioxide from the air of an early submarine, the [[Ictineo I]], a role for which they continue to be used today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2008/08/submarines-1.html# Snorkel A steam-powered submarine: the Ictíneo]. Low-tech Magazine, 24 de ghanta de 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the term "scrubber" has referred to pollution control devices that use liquid to wash unwanted pollutants from a gas stream. Recently, the term has also been used to describe systems that inject a dry [[reagent]] or [[slurry]] into a dirty exhaust stream to "wash out" [[acid gas]]es. Scrubbers are one of the primary devices that control gaseous emissions, especially acid gases. Scrubbers can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by [[flue-gas condensation]].&lt;ref name=gmab_condensation&gt;[http://www.gmab.se/eng_rokgaskondensering.htm On Flue gas Condensation] by Götaverken Miljö AB&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also used for the high flows in solar, PV, or LED processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticalsystemsinc.com/ask-expert/recommended-point-of-use-gas-scrubber-for-solar-processes Recommended point of use gas scrubber for solar processes].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several methods to remove toxic or [[corrosive]] compounds from [[exhaust gas]] and neutralize it.

== Combustion ==
[[Combustion]] is sometimes the cause of harmful exhausts, but, in many cases, combustion may also be used for exhaust gas cleaning if the temperature is high enough and enough oxygen is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystec.com/ksiburne.htm |title=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH, Burn and wet scrubber for process exhaust gas cleaning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wet scrubbing ==
The exhaust gases of combustion may contain substances considered harmful to the environment, and the scrubber may remove or neutralize those. 
A [[wet scrubber]] is used for cleaning [[air]], [[fuel gas]] or other [[gas]]es of various [[pollutant]]s and [[dust]] particles. Wet scrubbing works via the contact of target compounds or [[particulates|particulate matter]] with the scrubbing solution. Solutions  may simply be [[water]] (for dust) or solutions of reagents that specifically target certain compounds.

Process exhaust gas can also contain water-soluble toxic and/or corrosive gases like [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) or [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). These can be removed very well by a wet scrubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystec.com/ksiwete.htm |title=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH, Wet scrubber for process exhaust gas cleaning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removal efficiency of pollutants is improved by increasing residence time in the scrubber or by the increase of surface area of the scrubber solution by the use of a [[spray nozzle]], [[Packed bed|packed towers]] or an [[aspirator (pump)|aspirator]]. [[Wet scrubber]]s may increase the proportion of water in the gas, resulting in a visible stack plume, if the gas is sent to a stack.

Wet scrubbers can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by [[flue-gas condensation]].&lt;ref name="gmab_condensation"/&gt; In this mode, termed a condensing scrubber, water from the scrubber drain is circulated through a cooler to the nozzles at the top of the scrubber. The hot gas enters the scrubber at the bottom. If the gas temperature is above the water [[dew point]], it is initially cooled by [[evaporation]] of water drops. Further cooling cause [[water vapor]]s to [[condensation|condense]], adding to the amount of circulating water.

The condensation of water releases significant amounts of low temperature heat (more than {{convert|2|GJ}} per ton of water{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}), that can be recovered by the cooler for e.g. [[district heating]] purposes.

Excess condensed water must continuously be removed from the circulating water.

The gas leaves the scrubber at its [[dew point]], so even though significant amounts of water may have been removed from the cooled gas, it is likely to leave a visible stack plume of water vapor.

== Dry scrubbing ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Air pollution]] --&gt;
A dry or semi-dry scrubbing system, unlike the [[wet scrubber]], does not saturate the flue gas stream that is being treated with moisture. In some cases no moisture is added, while in others only the amount of moisture that can be evaporated in the flue gas without condensing is added. Therefore, dry scrubbers generally do not have a stack steam plume or [[wastewater]] handling/disposal requirements. Dry scrubbing systems are used to remove [[acid gas]]es (such as [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Hydrogen chloride|HCl]]) primarily from [[combustion]] sources.

There are a number of dry type scrubbing system designs. However, all consist of two main sections or devices:  a device to introduce the [[acid gas]] [[sorbent]] material into the gas stream and a particulate matter control device to remove reaction products, excess sorbent material as well as any particulate matter already in the [[flue gas]].

Dry scrubbing systems can be categorized as dry sorbent injectors (DSIs) or as [[spray dryer|spray dryer absorbers (SDAs)]]. Spray dryer absorbers are also called semi-dry scrubbers or spray dryers.

Dry scrubbing systems are often used for the removal of odorous and corrosive gases from [[industrial wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plant]] operations.  The medium used is typically an [[activated alumina]] compound impregnated with materials to handle specific gases such as [[hydrogen sulfide]].  Media used can be mixed together to offer a wide range of removal for other odorous compounds such as [[methyl mercaptan]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[dimethyl sulfide]], and [[dimethyl disulfide]].

'''Dry sorbent injection''' involves the addition of an [[alkaline]] material (usually [[hydrated lime]], [[soda ash]], or [[sodium bicarbonate]]) into the gas stream to react with the [[acid gas]]es. The sorbent can be injected directly into several different locations:  the combustion process, the [[flue gas]] duct (ahead of the particulate control device), or an open reaction chamber (if one exists). The acid gases react with the alkaline [[sorbent]]s to form solid [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s which are removed in the particulate control device. These simple systems can achieve only limited acid gas (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HCl) removal efficiencies. Higher collection efficiencies can be achieved by increasing the flue gas [[humidity]] (i.e., cooling using water spray). These devices have been used on [[medical waste]] incinerators and a few [[municipal waste]] combustors.

In '''spray dryer absorbers''', the [[flue gas]]es are introduced into an absorbing tower (dryer) where the gases are contacted with a finely atomized alkaline [[slurry]]. Acid gases are absorbed by the slurry mixture and react to form solid [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s which are removed by the particulate control device. The heat of the flue gas is used to evaporate all the water droplets, leaving a non-saturated flue gas to exit the [[absorption (chemistry)|absorber]] tower. Spray dryers are capable of achieving high (80+%) acid gas removal efficiencies. These devices have been used on industrial and utility [[boiler]]s and [[municipal waste]] [[incinerator]]s.

== Adsorber ==
Many chemicals can be removed from exhaust gas also by using adsorber material. The flue gas is passed through a cartridge which is filled with one or several adsorber materials and has been adapted to the chemical properties of the components to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystec.com/ksicate.htm |title=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH, Adsorption scrubber for exhaust gas cleaning}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of scrubber is sometimes also called dry scrubber. The adsorber material has to be replaced after its surface is saturated. Note: adsorption is a surface phenomena, absorption involves the entire material. Ex: Activated carbon an adsorbent, used for the adsorption of odorous compounds.

== Mercury removal ==
[[mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a highly toxic element commonly found in [[coal]] and municipal waste. [[Wet scrubber]]s are only effective for removal of soluble mercury species, such as oxidized mercury, Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.  Mercury vapor in its elemental form, Hg&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, is insoluble in the scrubber slurry and not removed. Therefore, an additional process of Hg&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; conversion is required to complete mercury capture. Usually halogens are added to the flue gas for this purpose. The type of coal burned as well as the presence of a [[selective catalytic reduction]] unit both affect the ratio of elemental to oxidized mercury in the flue gas and thus the degree to which the mercury is removed.

In July 2015, one study found that some mercury scrubbers installed on coal power plants inadvertently capture [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]] (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) emissions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Mercury Scrubbers On Power Plants Clean Up Other Pollutants, Too|url = http://www.popsci.com/mercury-scrubbers-power-plants-clean-additional-pollutants|accessdate = 30 July 2015|date = 20 July 2015|website = [[Popular Science]]|last = Griggs|first = Mary Beth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Relative Influence of Trans-Pacific and Regional Atmospheric Transport of PAHs in the Pacific Northwest, U.S.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b00800|journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date = 2015-07-07|issn = 0013-936X|doi = 10.1021/acs.est.5b00800|first = Scott|last = Lafontaine|first2 = Jill|last2 = Schrlau|first3 = Jack|last3 = Butler|first4 = Yuling|last4 = Jia|first5 = Barbara|last5 = Harper|first6 = Stuart|last6 = Harris|first7 = Lisa M.|last7 = Bramer|first8 = Katrina M.|last8 = Waters|first9 = Anna|last9 = Harding}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The information is this sentence as of 30 July 2015 comes from the Popular Science article. The actual study is also cited, which is the study that the PS article cited. --&gt;

== Scrubber waste products ==
One side effect of scrubbing is that the process only moves the unwanted substance from the exhaust gases into a liquid solution, solid paste or powder form. This must be disposed of safely, if it can not be reused.

For example, mercury removal results in a waste product that either needs further processing to extract the raw mercury, or must be buried in a special hazardous wastes [[landfill]] that prevents the mercury from seeping out into the environment.

As an example of reuse, limestone-based scrubbers in coal-fired [[power plants]] can produce a synthetic [[gypsum]] of sufficient quality that can be used to manufacture [[drywall]] and other industrial products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/inorganic/faq/waste-so2-to-wallboard.shtml How Sulfuric (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) waste is chemically removed from emissions] at General Chemistry Online&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bacteria spread ==
Poorly maintained scrubbers have the potential to spread disease-causing bacteria.  The problem is a result of inadequate cleaning.  For example, the cause of a 2005 outbreak of [[Legionnaires' disease]] in [[Norway]] was just a few infected scrubbers.  The outbreak caused 10 deaths and more than 50 cases of infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?PublicationType=W&amp;Volume=10&amp;Issue=23&amp;OrderNumber=1 Update: Outbreak of legionnaires’ disease in Norway traced to air scrubber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135103/http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?PublicationType=W&amp;Volume=10&amp;Issue=23&amp;OrderNumber=1 |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work''''' is a 2006 non-fiction book by [[Industrial and organizational psychology|industrial psychologist]] Paul Babiak and [[Criminal psychology|criminal psychologist]] [[Robert D. Hare]]. 

==Contents summary==
The text covers the nature of psychopaths in the context of employment and purports to explain: how psychopaths [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] their way into work and get promoted, the effects of their presence on colleagues and [[corporation]]s, and the superficial similarities (and fundamental differences) between [[leadership]] skills and psychopathic traits. The work is interlaced with fictional [[narratives]] illustrating how the factual content applies to real-life situations. Characteristics of manipulators are described as shifting to meet stereotypical gender expectations: a female psychopath might make full use of the passive, warm, nurturing, and dependent [[sex-role]] stereotype in order to get what she wants out of others and a male psychopath might use a [[Machismo|macho]] image, intimidation, and aggression to achieve satisfaction of his desires. The authors posit that around 1% of senior positions in business are psychopaths.

The authors describe a "five phase model" of how a typical [[workplace psychopath]] climbs to and maintains power: entry, assessment, manipulation, confrontation, and ascension. In the entry stage, the psychopath will use highly developed [[social skills]] and [[Superficial charm|charm]] to obtain employment into an organisation. At this stage it will be difficult to spot anything which is indicative of psychopathic behaviour, and as a new employee you might perceive the psychopath to be helpful and even benevolent. Once on to the assessment stage, the psychopath will weigh you up according to your usefulness, and you could be recognised as either a pawn (who has some informal [[Social influence|influence]] and will be easily manipulated) or a [[Patronage|patron]] (who has formal power and will be used by the psychopath to protect against attacks).

[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] involves the psychopath creating a scenario of “[[Cognitive distortion|psychopathic fiction]]” where positive information about themselves and negative [[disinformation]] about others will be created, where your role as a part of a network of [[Flying monkeys (psychology)|pawns or patrons]] will be utilised and you will be [[Operant conditioning|groomed]] into accepting the psychopath's agenda. Once on to the confrontation stage, the psychopath will use techniques of [[character assassination]] to maintain their agenda, and you will be either discarded as a pawn or used as a patron. Finally, in the ascension stage, the role of the subject as a patron in the psychopath’s quest for power will be discarded, and the psychopath will take for himself/herself a position of power and prestige from anyone who once supported them.

==Reception==
A review of ''Snakes in Suits'' by ''[[The Australian]]'' called it "a lay guide to corporate psychopaths." and concluded "However wooden in parts, Snakes in Suits is a valuable addition to any business library."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gamboto-Burke |first=Antonella |date=23 September 2006 |title=News: Snakes In Suits: When Psychopaths Go To Work |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/snakes-in-suits-when-psychopaths-go-to-work/news-story/0c583c95ba81ca66223e1da4aae4415c |newspaper=The Australian |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22679">The '''Sustainable Forestry Initiative''' (SFI) is a North American 'forest certification standard' and program of SFI Inc., a [[non-profit]] organization. The Sustainable Forestry Initiative is the world’s largest single forest certification standard by area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/files/pdf/news-releases/nr-standard-2010-01-12.pdf |title=SFI Inc.

USA.

In 2005, the [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC), which itself is the world's largest forest certifications system, recognized the SFI standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pefc.org/about-pefc/membership/national-members/8-United%20States |title=National Members |publisher=Pefc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SFI Standards are revised and updated every five years to incorporate the latest scientific information and to respond to emerging issues. As part of this process, comments were received during two 60-day public comment periods in 2013 and 2014, and input was received from 12 public workshops across the United States and Canada. About 10,000 stakeholders were invited to submit comments. Participants included public and private landowners, forest sector representatives, Indigenous communities, conservation groups, industry, academia and government officials. 

Independent oversight was provided at each stage of the revision process by the SFI External Review Panel, a group of independent experts representing conservation, professional, academic and public organizations, operating at arm’s length from SFI. The SFI External Review Panel reviewed every public comment submitted to ensure that all comments were considered, and to guarantee the Standard revision process was transparent, objective and credible. The responses to comments are posted on the SFI website.

The SFI Program only certifies lands in the United States and Canada, and program participants must comply with all applicable laws. For sources outside of North America without effective laws, participants must avoid illegal or other controversial sources.&lt;ref name="C20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/files/pdf/Section7_sfi_requirements_2010-2014.pdf |title=SFI Requirements 2010-2014 Section 7 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826175220/http://www.sfiprogram.org/files/pdf/Section7_sfi_requirements_2010-2014.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFI Program supports activities by international experts to find ways to address the problem of illegal logging&lt;ref name="C21"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/forest-conservation/prevent-illegal-logging.php |title=Prevent Illegal Logging |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014001529/http://www.sfiprogram.org/forest-conservation/prevent-illegal-logging.php |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of the international, multi-stakeholder Forest Legality Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/fla/ |title=Forest Legality Alliance |publisher=Wri.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SFI 2015-2019 Fiber Sourcing Standard promotes responsible forestry practices based on 14 Principles, 13 Objectives, 21 Performance Measures and 55 Indicators that address the 90 percent of the world’s forests that are not certified. The SFI 2015-2019 Fiber Sourcing Standard distinguishes SFI from all other forest certification programs in that it sets mandatory practice requirements for the responsible procurement of all fiber, even if it is sourced from non-certified land. These fiber sourcing requirements include measures to broaden the practice of biodiversity, use best management practices to protect water quality, and utilize the services of forest management and harvesting professionals. Because it governs how SFI Program Participants procure fiber from non-certified land, supporters argue that the Standard encourages the spread of responsible forestry practices.

SFI has certified more than 285 million acres (115 million hectares)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/about-us/basics-of-sfi/|title=Basics of SFI - SFI|author=|date=|website=www.sfiprogram.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to its standard in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. At the end of October 2010, SFI had 959 [[chain of custody]] certifications at 2,339 locations.  According to the [[United Nations]], SFI was the fastest growing organization for chain of custody certifications in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |title=2008-2009 Forest Products- Annual Market Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717023154/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews and comparisons ==

===Third-party reviews ===

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]]/[[Food and Agriculture Organization]], in its ''2009-2010 Forest products Annual Review'', says: "Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |title=2009-2010 Forest Products- Annual Market Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dovetail Partners Inc., in its ''2010 Forest Certification: A Status Report'', states: "the previous differences between forest certification programs are much less distinct ... each program generally has the same structural programmatic requirements, although the required content and level of detail provided by each may vary considerably."&lt;ref name=Dove&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dovetailinc.org/files/DovetailCertReport0310b.pdf |title=2010 Forest Certification: A Status Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531220823/http://www.dovetailinc.org/files/DovetailCertReport0310b.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SFI is generally considered less stringent than that of the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC).&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/science/earth/12timber.html Mireya Navarro, “Environmental Groups Spar Over Certifications of Wood and Paper Products”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AW"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/0812/environment_1-1.html |article=FSC Versus SFI|author=Christine MacDonald|date=August 12, 2009|publisher=Architecture Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, SFI allows more tree farming and does not require conservation plans or consultation with local and indigenous stakeholders (except for public lands).&lt;ref name="AW"/&gt;

SFI is less highly rated than FSC for example by Consumer Reports “Greener Choices”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenerchoices.org/eco-labels/labelCategory.cfm?labelCategoryName=Sustainable%20Wood 
“Sustainable Wood”&lt;/ref&gt; and Green America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenamerica.org/programs/woodwise/publishers/simplesteps/FSCvsSFI.cfm
"FSC: The Premier Forest Certification Program"
by Jennifer Gerholdt, Magazine PAPER Project Coordinator&lt;/ref&gt; Others rate SFI/PEFC and FSC equally: TerraChoice (part of [[Underwriters Laboratories]] Global Network) in its 2010 Sins of Greenwashing report, like its 2009 one, counts the SFI/PEFC and FSC in its second-tier list of "legitimate" environmental standards and certifications.;&lt;ref name="C17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/findings/greenwashing-report-2010/ |title=Sins of Greenwashing |publisher=Sins of Greenwashing |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does Environment Canada's EcoLogo.&lt;ref name="C14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/education/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=743D106D-1 |title=Environment Canada's EcoLogo |publisher=Ec.gc.ca |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611114921/http://www.ec.gc.ca/education/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=743D106D-1 |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A National Association of State Foresters forest certification policy statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateforesters.org/node/1032 |title=NASF Resolution No. 2008-7: Forest Certification Policy Statement |publisher=Stateforesters.org |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by resolution in 2008 states: "While in different manners, the ATFS (American Tree Farm System), FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability. . . . No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility."

=== Green Building Council ===
On April 5, 2016, the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] issued a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) pilot alternative compliance path (ACP) designed to screen out illegal forest products from LEED buildings. While the ACP is being tested as a credit, it will ultimately become a prerequisite that applies to all LEED projects. As a pilot, the ACP does not become a permanent part of the LEED standard without an affirmative vote of the USGBC membership.  The ACP pilot recognizes all certified sources - FSC, PEFC, SFI and ATFS and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USGBC Announces New LEED Pilot ACP Designed to Help Eliminate Irresponsibly Sourced Materials—Like Illegal Wood—From the Building Material Supply Chain|url=http://www.usgbc.org/articles/usgbc-announces-new-leed-pilot-acp-designed-help-eliminate-irresponsibly-sourced-materials%E2%80%94|website=U.S. Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACP will apply to all LEED v4 rating systems including Homes v4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEED Reference Guide for Homes Design and Construction|url=http://www.usgbc.org/resources/leed-reference-guide-homes-design-and-construction|website=U.S. Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to all LEED 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEED 2009 Rating System Selection Guidance.” U.S. Green Building Council|url=http://www.usgbc.org/resources/leed-2009-rating-system-selection-guidance|website=U.S. Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; rating systems. 

The ACP categorizes the various forest certification standards based on the ASTM D7612-10 (2015) standard, which is titled “Categorizing Wood and Wood-Based Products According to Their Fiber Sources.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Practice for Categorizing Wood and Wood-Based Products According to Their Fiber Sources|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D7612.htm|website=American Society for Testing and Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASTM ([[ASTM_International|American Society for Testing and Materials]]) International is a globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of voluntary consensus standards.

Other [[green building]] tools, including two [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI)-approved rating systems in the United States –  ANSI-ICC 700-2008: National Green Building Standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahbgreen.org/Guidelines/ansistandard.aspx |title=National Green Building Standard |publisher=Nahbgreen.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ANSI/GBI 01-2010: Green Building Assessment Protocol for Commercial Buildings (formerly Green Globes U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegbi.org/green-globes/ansi-gbi-standard.asp |title=ANSI / GBI Standard |publisher=Thegbi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) –  [[Green Building Initiative|Green Globes]] and [[Built Green Canada]] recognize wood products certified by credible third-party certification programs like SFI.

=== Conservation organizations ===
The SFI Program is supported by conservation groups such as [[Conservation International]], [[American Bird Conservancy]], [[Ducks Unlimited]], and the [[Conservation Fund]] (which serves on its Board).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/board.php |title=Board Members |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104014327/http://www.sfiprogram.org/board.php |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike SFI, the FSC included environmental groups such as [[Greenpeace]] among its founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsc.org/history.html|title=History of FSC|publisher=Fsc.org|date=|accessdate=2013-02-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422113655/http://www.fsc.org/history.html|archivedate=2012-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/forests/solutions-to-deforestation/ |title=Solutions to Deforestation |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Wildlife Federation]] and [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) currently serve on the FSC Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsc.org/bod.html |title=Board of Directors |publisher=Fsc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503212719/http://www.fsc.org/bod.html |archivedate=2012-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sierra Club]] endorses only FSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/forestcertification/ |title=Forest Certification Committee |publisher=Sierraclub.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301171528/http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/forestcertification/ |archivedate=2013-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of SFI==

===Marketing practices===
On September 9, 2009 the Washington State Forest Law Center, on behalf of the environmental protection group ForestEthics, filed complaints against SFI Inc. with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;ref name="C23"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wflc.org/cases/credibleforestcert/SFIcomplaints |title=Complaints filed against SFI |publisher=Wflc.org |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref name="C23"/&gt;

The FTC complaint accuses SFI Inc. of misleading consumers with deceptive marketing practices. The complaint cites various aspects of SFI’s marketing, including its claim that it is an “independent” not-for-profit organization, its dependence on the timber industry for funding, and the vagueness of SFI’s environmental standards, which allow SFI-certified landowners to be certified merely because the landowner is complying with state environmental regulations. The complaint cites SFI’s certification as an example of [[greenwash]].

Both the FTC and IRS investigated the complaints made against SFI and found them without merit. No action was taken by either investigative body.{{Citation needed|reason=A link to the IRS and FTC investigation needed to verify this claim|date=September 2015}}


===Conflict of interest===
The complaint filed with the IRS requests an examination of SFI Inc.’s non-profit status, based on the fact that SFI benefits the private interests of its corporate landowners and not the public interest, as well as the fact that SFI draws more than 80% of its funding from the wood and paper industry.&lt;ref name="C24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gisf.research.yale.edu/assets/pdf/ypfc_perspectives/fsc_sfi_comparison.pdf|title=THE FOREST STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AND THE SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY INITIATIVE: POINTS OF COMPARISON|author=|date=|website=yale.edu|accessdate=16 April 2018}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint asserts that in serving the private interests of wood and paper companies that want a ‘green’ image, SFI is inappropriately granted a nonprofit status reserved for public charities.&lt;ref name="C25"&gt;[http://forestethics.org/downloads/SFI_IRS_complaint.pdf Washington State Forest Law Center complaint against SFI filed with IRS]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706181943/http://forestethics.org/downloads/SFI_IRS_complaint.pdf |date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRS investigated the complaint as well as conducted a thorough examination of SFI’s non-profit status and concluded that it was appropriate and that no further action was required.{{Citation needed|reason=A link to the IRS investigation needed to verify this claim|date=September 2015}}


=== Sierra Club complaint ===

The [[Sierra Club]] has lodged a formal complaint with the SFI,&lt;ref name="C26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wflc.org/cases/credibleforestcert/SFI%20Complaint |title=Sierra Club complaint filed with SFI |publisher=Wflc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that [[Weyerhaeuser]] engaged in risky and irresponsible logging on steep slopes that led to 1,259 landslides in 2007 on SFI-certified Weyerhaeuser lands in Washington state.&lt;ref name="C27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/1021/news_2-1.html |title=High Tension Over Big Timber |publisher=Architectureweek.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/ger_ofr2008-5_dec2007_landslides.pdf |title=Landslide Reconnaissance Following the Storm Event of December 1–3, 2007, in Western Washington |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenging SFI to back up its claims of 'independence' and 'rigorous audits,' the Sierra Club requested that Weyerhaeuser's SFI certification be revoked.&lt;ref name="C26" /&gt;

A peer reviewed landslide study concluded that the Washington State landslides that the Sierra Club attributed to Weyerhaeuser’s logging practices were the result of extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall and not the result of steep slope logging by the company.{{Citation needed|reason=A link to the study needed to verify this claim|date=September 2015}} Landslides occur on both logged and unlogged sites, but science shows that logging (and logging roads) dramatically increase the risk of landslides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oregonwild.org/sites/default/files/pdf-files/Heiken,%20D.%20Landslides%20and%20clearcuts%20-%20science.pdf|title=LANDSLIDES AND CLEARCUTS: What Does The Science Really Say?|last=Heiken|first=Doug|date=|website=www.oregonwild.org|publisher=Oregon Wild|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''test pilot''' is an [[aircraft pilot]] with additional training to fly and evaluate experimental, newly produced and modified [[aircraft]] with specific manoeuvres known as flight test techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Stinton, Darrol. ''Flying Qualities and Flight Testing of the Airplane.'' American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 1996, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, test pilots were being killed at the rate of about one a week,{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} but the risks have shrunk to a fraction of that due to the maturation of aircraft technology, better ground-testing and simulation of aircraft performance, [[fly-by-wire]] technology and lately, the use of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s to test experimental aircraft features. Still, piloting experimental aircraft remains more dangerous than most other types of flying.

==Test Pilot Qualifications==
A test pilot must be able to:
*Understand a test plan;
*Stick to a test plan, flying a plane in a highly specific way;
*Carefully document the results of each test;
*Have an excellent feel for the aircraft, and sense exactly how it is behaving oddly if it is doing so;
*Solve problems quickly if anything goes wrong with the aircraft during a test;
*Cope with many different things going wrong at once.
*Effectively communicate flight test observations to engineers and relate engineering results to the pilot community, thus bridging the gap between those who design and build aircraft with those who employ the aircraft to accomplish a mission.

Test pilots must have an excellent knowledge of [[aeronautical engineering]], in order to understand how and why planes are tested. They must be above-average pilots with excellent [[analytical skills]] and the ability to fly accurately whilst following a flight plan.

Test pilots can be '''experimental''' and '''engineering''' test pilots (investigating the characteristics of new types of aircraft during development) or '''production''' test pilots (the more mundane role of confirming the characteristics of new aircraft as they come off the production line); many test pilots would perform both roles during their careers.  Modern test pilots often receive formal training from highly-selective military test pilot schools, although other test pilots receive training and experience from civilian institutions and/or manufacturers' test pilot development programs.

==History==
Test flying as a systematic activity started during the [[World War I|First World War]], at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) in the [[United Kingdom]]. 
An "Experimental Flight" was formed at the [[Central Flying School]].
During the 1920s, test flying was further developed by the RAE in the UK, and by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) in the [[United States]]. In the 1950s, NACA was transformed into the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], or NASA. During these years, as work was done into aircraft stability and handling qualities, test flying evolved towards a more qualitative scientific profession. At the insistence of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the first American [[astronauts]], the [[Mercury Seven]], were all military test pilots, as were some of the later astronauts.

The world's oldest test pilot  school is what is now called the [[Empire Test Pilots' School]] (motto "Learn to Test - Test to Learn"), at [[RAF Boscombe Down]] in the UK. There are a number of [[List of test pilot schools|similar establishments over the world]]. In America, the [[United States Air Force Test Pilot School]] is located at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], the [[United States Naval Test Pilot School]] is located at [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River]], Maryland and [[EPNER]] (''Ecole du Personnel Navigant d'Essai et de Reception'' - "School for flight test and acceptance personnel"), the French test pilot school, is located in [[Istres]], France. The only civilian  school in the United States is the [[National Test Pilot School]], a not-for-profit educational institute located in [[Mojave, California|Mojave]], California. In [[Russia]], there is a [[Ministry of Industry and Trade (Russia)|Russian aviation industry]] [[Fedotov Test Pilot School]] (founded 1947)&lt;ref name="ShLI2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |date=2002 |editor-last=Знаменская |editor-first=Наталья |title=ШЛИ со временем |trans-title=ShLI in Time |url=https://search.rsl.ru/ru/search#yf=2002&amp;yt=2002&amp;q=%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%B8%20%D1%81%D0%BE%20%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BC |language=RU |edition=2 |location=Жуковский |publisher=ООО "Редакция газеты "Жуковские вести" |pages=400 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in [[Zhukovsky (city)|Zhukovsky]] within the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]].

'''Theo H. Davies &amp; Co.''' is a company that was one of the [[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]] trading and agricultural companies in the [[Territory of Hawaii]].

==History==
Starkey, Janion, &amp; Co. was a trading company founded in [[Liverpool]] in April 1845 by Englishmen James and John Starkey and Robert Cheshire Janion. Janion arrived in [[Honolulu]] in August, selling the first boat-load of merchandise. Janion acquired a building in a prime location on the [[Honolulu Harbor]] after the firm of [[Ladd &amp; Co.]] went out of business, and some of the last undeveloped land that was part of the claim of former British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] [[Richard Charlton (Hawaii)|Richard Charlton]].&lt;ref name="hjh98"&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/430 |title= Along the Old Honolulu Waterfront |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 32 |author= Richard A. Greer |date= 1998 |pages= 53–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Starkey brothers bought more goods in England, where they were traded with Hawaiian exports and gold. After the [[California Gold Rush]] their business soon expanded to include their own fleet of ships, and selling insurance as the local agent for [[Lloyd's of London]].&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

In 1849 another Briton [[William Lowthian Green]] was hired, and when the Starkey brothers pulled out in 1851, the name was changed to Janion &amp; Co. In 1857, Welshman [[Theophilus Harris Davies]] arrived in Hawaii and joined the company as a clerk for Green. In 1859 Green became a partner. Davies worked his way up in the company, but left when his contract expired in 1862. In 1863 Davies returned to work as an agent for a [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]], but left again when his contract expired in 1866. In 1867 Janion &amp; Green were in financial trouble, and Davies was brought in to reorganize. Davies and Janion formed a new partnership in 1871.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Davies raised capital in London and invested in plantations on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. In 1875, he refinanced the Honolulu Iron Works and hired [[Alexander Young (Hawaii)|Alexander Young]]. He would partner with Young in a number of future businesses.
Davies took full control of the company after Janion died in 1881, and incorporated his growing interests in the sugar industry. The business expanded to add departments for steamship agents, grocery stores, dry goods, and hardware. Under the laws of the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]], it became Theo. H. Davies &amp; Co., Ltd. in January, 1894.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite news |title= Hawaii's big six: A cyclical Saga |author= Edward Greaney |year= 1976 |work= The Encyclopedia of Hawaii, a 1976 Bicentennial Project |publisher= The University of Hawaii Press |url= http://www.judyvorfeld.com/Greaney.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Davies died in 1898, Francis Mills Swanzy became managing director and T. Clive Davies (son of Theo) as board member. In 1917 T. Clive Davies and Ernest Hay Wodehouse were named co-managing directors, but Davies died the same day. A new headquarters building built in 1921 served through the 1960s when a 32-story Davies Pacific Center was built at 841 Bishop Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Davies Pacific Center |year= 2008 |publisher= Pacific Office Properties Trust, Inc. |work= web site |url= http://www.pacificofficeproperties.com/p_honolulu_2.htm |accessdate= 2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1928 the company opened a [[Manila]] branch and expanded with sugarcane plantations in the [[Philippines]].
John E. Russell led the company until the 1950s. Geoffrey C. Davies (T. Clive's son) became chairman, followed by Gerald M. Wilkinson. James H. Tabor, Harold E. Weidig, and Milton Pickup then served as presidents. In 1967 Dillingham Corp. made a failed takeover attempt.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

The company remained in family hands until 1973, when the family sold the company to Hong Kong-based conglomerate [[Jardine Matheson]].  Davies became the first big five company to get out of sugar, selling the [[Hamakua, Hawaii|Hamakua]] Sugar Company in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Hollie| first = Pamela G.| title = A Gamble on Sugar in Hawaii| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-04-22| date = 1984-03-01| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/01/business/a-gamble-on-sugar-in-hawaii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company diversified its holdings, owning the [[Pizza Hut]] and [[Taco Bell]] franchises in [[Hawaii]], as well as the franchises for [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]].

Starting in 2003, Jardine gradually sold its various holdings in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://starbulletin.com/2003/10/19/news/story2.html |title=Rumored sales of Theo Davies' businesses may signal its end |author= Erika Engle |date=October 19, 2003 |publisher=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = eengle@starbulletin.com| first = Erika Engle;| title = TheoDavies restaurants sold to company in California - A notice says that the buyers will retain all 2,289 employees with pay and benefits| work = Honolulu Star-Bulletin (HI)| accessdate = 2018-04-22| date = 2004-08-11| url = http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/129731B99776DDD0?p=NewsBank|via = NewsBank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theo H. Davies (Manila) founded in 1928 currently exists as a separate holding company JTH Davies under the control of Philippine businessman [[Eusebio Tanco]] who is involved in education, insurance, shipping and overseas job placement businesses in Manila and other locations in the Philippines.

Born to [[Lithuanian-Americans|Lithuanian immigrants]], he studied at the [[University of Chicago]]. During [[World War I]] served in [[France]]. After coming back in 1919, he became interested in management and continued his studies at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Draugas"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.draugas.org/news/vytautas-andrius-graiciunas/ |title=Vytautas Andrius Graičiūnas |date=January 15, 2015 |publisher=draugas.org |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927 he came to Lithuania and worked at [[Kaunas]] factories. Soon he started traveling and working across Europe. Until 1935 he worked as a consultant and helped to establish large companies in [[Barcelona]], [[Brussels]], [[Copenhagen]], [[London]], and [[Milan]]. During this period he published his classical study printed in [[Geneva]] ''Relationship in Organization'' in 1933. Soon other editions appeared in the [[United States]]. He mathematically proved that a manager should not have more than 4-5 subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://emeritus.ktu.lt/content/vytautas-andrius-grai%C4%8Di%C5%ABnas |title=GRAIČIŪNAS Vytautas Andrius |publisher=ktu.lt |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came up with the following formula to express the total number of relationships between a boss and his or her subordinates:&lt;ref name="Draugas"/&gt;

: N [(2&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;/2) + N - 1], where N is a number of subordinates.

When number of subordinates increases, the number of relationships increases exponentially; at 5 subordinates the number of relationships is 100, at 10 - 5,210. Many scientists expanded or criticized the theory, among them was [[Herbert A. Simon]].

In 1935 Graičiūnas returned to Lithuania, where he worked as an engineer, management consultant at various state and private institutions, including Ministry of Defense,  Lithuanian [[aviation]], Lithuanian State Theatre, Lithuanian Film Company. He also lectured at the [[Vytautas Magnus University]] and was awarded Commander's Cross of [[Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas]]. During [[World War II]] Graičiūnas decided to remain in Lithuania despite clear threats of the occupation by the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Draugas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vz.lt/laisvalaikis/akiraciai/2013/05/10/vytautas-andrius-graiciunas |title=Vytautas Andrius Graičiūnas |date=May 10, 2013 |publisher=vz.lt |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 while visiting [[Moscow]] with a group of students he visited the embassy of the United States where he was told that only he could leave the [[Soviet Union]] because his wife, actor [[Unė Babickaitė]], did not have [[U.S. citizenship]]. After this incident Graičiūnas and his wife were arrested for espionage and anti-soviet activities, tried and sentenced to several years in [[gulag]]. He died the following year under unclear circumstances. His wife, after [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death in 1953, got her sentence reduced and returned to Kaunas.&lt;ref name="Draugas"/&gt;

Between 1905 and 1910, Alexander was the city representative in the Zagreb City Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Imenik dostojanstvenika, činovnika i javnih službenika Kraljevina Hrvatske i Slavonije, 1908: 40, 143; Dundović J.

He was the councillor, vicepresident and honorary president of the "Commercial Chamber".&lt;ref name="nqy"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ivo Banac|1988|pp=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as treasurer and later as a vicepresident of the "Commercial Home" in Zagreb, and as an honorary vicepresident of the "Association of traders for Croatia and Slavonija".&lt;ref name="nqy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}}  Dundović J.

He also encouraged the development of tourism in Croatia, and as so he was the major shareholder of "Schlesinger Palace" (now ''"Hotel Palace, Zagreb"'') in Zagreb. Alexander was member of the society "Narodni rad - društvo židovskih asimilanata i anticionista u Hrvatskoj" (''Peoples work - Society of Jewish assimilates and anti Zionists in Croatia'').&lt;ref name="žuz"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Alexander was great philanthropist, just like his brother, who donated the most of his wealth to charity.&lt;ref name="nqy"/&gt; Around 1908, Alexander founded the society for feeding poor school children in Zagreb, where he was also the treasurer.&lt;ref name="hswc"&gt;{{hr icon}} Sandra Prlenda; The History of Social Work in Croatia, 1900- 1960; stranica 14,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Dundović J. Adresar 1908: 67.&lt;/ref&gt; He also managed the Croatian academic society, which supported and funded the poor academic citizens. Every society which had the fortune to have Alexander as a treasurer, never had problems with finances. During [[World War I]], Alexander organized and largely financed the "Council for helping the unemployed and disabled employees of trading, industrial and financial institutions", which he also chaired as the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}}  Imenik dostojanstvenika, činovnika i javnih službenika Kraljevina Hrvatske i Slavonije, 1918: 169.&lt;/ref&gt; His greatest merit was when he, fall of 1914, established a public kitchen for the poor citizens and families of those who fought on the battlefield during the war.&lt;ref name="nqy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hswc"/&gt; Alexander founded the charity "Prehrana".&lt;ref name="nqy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hswc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Zaklada predsjednika i osnivača "Prehrane" Šandora A.

"Prehrana" distributed millions of meals, according to some estimates over 15 millions. At the beginning of the World War I, Alexander donated 1 million golden [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|guldens]] as an irreversible war loan to the state. For that,  on August 13, 1918, Alexander was knighted by [[Charles I of Austria]] and awarded with the title ''pl.'' (plemeniti {{hr icon}} = noble ) ''Sesvetski''.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}}  Viktor Anton Duišin; Heraldički zbornik, Zbornik plemstva u Hrvatskoj; Slavoniji, Dalmaciji, Bosni-Hercegovini, Dubrovniku, Kotoru i Vojvodini; 1938 Zagreb; 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On December 17, 1929, while attending the Royal Guard ball in [[Belgrade]], Alexander suddenly fell ill. He died from a heart attack in the night from the 17th. to the 18th. of December, 1929. All major newspapers reported in detail and with great sadness about Alexanders death and funeral.
