Public protesting and demonstrations began one week ahead of the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit]], which took place in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada on 26−27 June. The protests were for various causes, including poverty and anti-capitalism.

Protests mainly consisted of peaceful [[demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s and [[Political rally|rallies]] but also took form of a [[riot]] as a group of protesters using [[black bloc]] tactics caused [[vandalism]] to several businesses in [[Downtown Toronto]]. More than 20,000 police, military, and security personnel were involved in policing the protests, which at its largest numbered 10,000 protesters.&lt;ref&gt;CTV News.

Over 1000 arrests were made, making it the largest [[mass arrest]] in Canadian history.&lt;ref name=globemailjuly2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Toronto police were overwhelmed at G20, review reveals|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/toronto-police-were-overwhelmed-at-g20-review-reveals/article2073215/|accessdate=24 June 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=23 June 2011|first=Adrian|last=Morrow| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110624112511/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/toronto-police-were-overwhelmed-at-g20-review-reveals/article2073215/| archivedate= 24 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the protests, the [[Toronto Police Service]] and the [[Integrated Security Unit]] (ISU) of the G20 Toronto summit were heavily criticized for brutality during the arrests and eventually went under public scrutiny by media and human rights activists. There has been legal action in the form of a  class action lawsuit towards the Toronto police on behalf of all whom were arrested despite the Toronto Police's several attempts to stop court proceedings by appealing the case. As of November 10, 2016 The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that it will not hear the Toronto Police Services Board's appeal and court proceedings may go on.

==Preliminary events==

===Early opposition===
A [[Royal Bank of Canada]] branch in [[Ottawa]] was [[Firebombing|firebombed]] just before dawn on May 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2010/05/18/ott-glebe-bank-fire.html |title=CBC News – Ottawa – RBC firebombed as protest, group claims |publisher=CBC.ca |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2010-06-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100522013917/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2010/05/18/ott-glebe-bank-fire.html| archivedate= 22 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attackers posted video on [[YouTube]] showing a large fireball igniting inside the bank.  The video then listed the [[manifesto]] of a previously unknown group calling itself the FFFC.  The message stated that the attack against the bank was because of the growing suffering of Vancouver's poor in the shadow of RBC's major sponsorship of the [[2010 Vancouver Olympics]] and [[2010 Winter Paralympics|Paralympics]] in [[Vancouver]] and [[Whistler, British Columbia]] and claimed these events were held "on stolen [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] land."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiImoI0JdPQ YouTube Video] of bank firebombing of Royal Bank Branch, Ottawa, Ontario&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to social issues and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] land claims, the video claimed the actions were sparked by environmental and [[deforestation]] related concerns surrounding the [[Athabasca oil sands|Alberta tar sands]] projects in ''"Canada's"'' prairies, in which the video claims RBC is substantially involved and which G8/G20 decisions furthered.&lt;ref name="CTVCharged"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20100519/anarchists-firebomb-bank-100519/20100519?hub= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524131549/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20100519/anarchists-firebomb-bank-100519/20100519?hub= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-05-24 |title=Terrorism charges possible in bank firebombing: police – CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2010-05-19 |accessdate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attackers also stated their intention to be present during the [[36th G8 summit|G8]] and the G20 Toronto summits the following month.&lt;ref name="TSun1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/05/19/14005326.html |title=Anarchy among anarchists after firebomb &amp;#124; Canada &amp;#124; News |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2010-05-19 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projected recurrence of such acts of violence and the escalating [[rhetoric]] of anti-summit protest plans caused the G8/G20 [[Integrated Security Unit]] (ISU) to increase its security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/812976--ottawa-firebombing-proves-security-need-clement-says |title=Ottawa firebombing proves security need, Clement says |publisher=thestar.com |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2010-06-04 | location=Toronto | first=Gail | last=Swainson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/05/22/wanted-500-extra-police-for-g20-summit/ |title=Wanted: 500 extra police for G20 summit &amp;#124; Posted Toronto &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The attacks were quickly and widely criticized by the media, politicians, and other protest groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=QMI Agency |url=http://www.torontosun.com/comment/editorial/2010/05/19/14012571.html |title=Brainless thugs all about mayhem &amp;#124; Editorial &amp;#124; Comment |publisher=Toronto Sun |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistproject.ca/bullet/358.php |title=Socialist Project &amp;#124; The Bullet |publisher=Socialistproject.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527064005/http://www.socialistproject.ca/bullet/358.php| archivedate= 27 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three suspects were arrested on June 19, 2010; with one, Roger Clement, being convicted in December 2010 while charges against the other two were stayed for lack of evidence.  Clement, a 58-year-old retired federal government employee, formerly working for the Canadian International Development Agency, eventually received a 3½ year prison sentence, that included 6 months for vandalism of another RBC branch in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/national/article/103466--man-who-firebombed-bank-gets-three-year-sentence |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723071425/http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/national/article/103466--man-who-firebombed-bank-gets-three-year-sentence |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-23 |title=Man Who Firebombed Bank Gets Three-Year Sentence |publisher=CityTV |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial estimates of the damage, immediately following the attack, set the price-tag at around $300,000 and projected that the bank would be closed for several weeks.  At the time of Clement's trial, reports stated that the branch was closed for months with total costs of $1,600,000.&lt;ref name="CTVCharged" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TSun1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20101207/bank-fire-bomber-sentence-101207/ |title=Man who firebombed bank sentenced to 3 years |publisher=CTV News |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual was arrested for vandalism on May 28, after being caught spray-painting anti–G20 slogans on windows and [[automated teller machine]]s in Downtown Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=QMI Agency |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/05/28/14168296.html |title=Anti-G20 slogans spray-painted on T.O. banks &amp;#124; Canada &amp;#124; News |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two individuals were arrested in [[London, Ontario]] after attaching posters to public property encouraging disruption of the G20 summit and canvassing protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2010/06/17/14420391.html |title=G20 activists jailed for poster – Canada – Canoe.ca |publisher=Cnews.canoe.ca |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key groups which organized early in opposition to the summit included [[Canadian Labour Congress]], [[Council of Canadians]], [[Greenpeace]], [[Ontario Coalition Against Poverty]], [[Ontario Federation of Labour]], [[Oxfam]] and the Toronto Community Mobilization Network.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Whyte.

===Week prior to summit===
[[File:G-20 Toronto June 2010 (2).jpg|left|thumb|An early demonstration on [[Yonge Street]] on June 24 demanding respect of First Nations treaty rights]]
A small rally was conducted on June 17 in the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] by [[Oxfam Canada]], urging Canada to end [[fossil fuel]] subsidization and take action on world [[poverty]]. The rally also spoofed the summit's high security cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE65E4RB20100617?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Toronto G20 protest hints at more to come &amp;#124; Top News &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Ca.reuters.com |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2010-06-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100622091653/http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE65E4RB20100617?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0| archivedate= 22 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An anti-poverty protest occurred on June 21, causing traffic congestion.&lt;ref name=toronto1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100621/lcbo_shut_down_100621/20100621/?hub=TorontoNewHome |title=CTV Toronto – Police ride herd as G20 protesters march the streets – CTV News |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-06-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100624024104/http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100621/lcbo_shut_down_100621/20100621/?hub=TorontoNewHome| archivedate= 24 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 100 protesters marched from [[Allan Gardens]] on [[Sherbourne Street, Toronto|Sherbourne Street]] and continued on [[Yonge Street]], [[Dundas Street (Ontario)|Dundas Street]], and Isabella Street.

The following day, about 200 people from Toronto's [[gay community]] marched through downtown attempting to raise awareness on [[LGBT rights in Canada|homosexual rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/827058--gays-lesbians-hold-g20-kiss-in?bn=1 |title=G20 turning downtown Toronto into a ghost town |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2010-06-22|accessdate=2010-06-24 | first1=Jennifer | last1=Yang | first2=Liam | last2=Casey| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100626093646/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/827058--gays-lesbians-hold-g20-kiss-in?bn=1| archivedate= 26 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters chanted, "We're queer, we're fabulous, we're against the G20."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2216509620100622 |title=Gay rights protest hits Toronto ahead of G20 |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-06-22|accessdate=2010-06-24 | first=Pav | last=Jordan| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100626103252/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2216509620100622| archivedate= 26 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) labelled the protests as "peaceful" overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/22/g20-tuesdayprotestors.html |title=CBC News – Toronto – Protests continue in Toronto as G20 nears |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= 2010-06-22|accessdate=2010-06-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100625060457/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/22/g20-tuesdayprotestors.html| archivedate= 25 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sizable G20 protest, of about 1000 people, took place on June 24 with [[First Nations]] groups and supporters from across Canada demanding respect for [[treaty rights]] from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/827924--first-nations-demonstrators-take-over-downtown-streets?bn=1 |title=First nations demonstrators take over downtown streets |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2010-06-24|accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=Toronto | first=Peter | last=Edwards| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100627143516/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/827924--first-nations-demonstrators-take-over-downtown-streets?bn=1| archivedate= 27 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations moved from [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] to the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] along [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]] and [[Queen Street West]]. Concerns of protesters were Canada's failure to sign the [[United Nations]]' [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] and the fact that no aboriginal chiefs were invited to the summits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/827924--canada-flunks-on-indigenous-rights-protesters-say?bn=1 |title=Canada flunks on indigenous rights, protesters say |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2010-06-24|accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=Toronto | first=Peter | last=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on June 24, activist [[Jaggi Singh (activist)|Jaggi Singh]], spokesperson for the group No One Is Illegal, suggested in a news conference that some protesters intended to attempt to breach the security fence in the coming days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/24/g20-aboriginal.html--first-nations-demonstrators-take-over-downtown-streets?bn=1 |title=First Nations' G20 protest peaceful |publisher=thestar.com |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-07-10 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the G20 leaders arrived in Toronto after the G8 summit in [[Huntsville, Ontario]] wrapped up, a large group comprising as many as 10,000 people protested downtown during the afternoon of June 26.&lt;ref name="CBCprotests"&gt;{{cite news|title=G20 protest turns violent|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/06/26/g20-saturday-protests.html|accessdate=26 June 2010|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=June 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100628031322/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/06/26/g20-saturday-protests.html| archivedate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the protest, Jeff Atkinson, spokesperson for the [[Canadian Labour Congress]], said, "We don't want G20 countries to cut stimulus spending until jobs recover." [[Greenpeace International]] director [[Kumi Naidoo]] reasoned that "if G20 governments could spend billions of dollars to rescue banks in trouble, why not find money to help unemployed workers for the environment and for social causes." Sid Ryan of the [[Ontario Federation of Labour]] said in a speech, "It wasn't the workers of the world that caused the financial crisis. We don't want to see a transfer of wealth from the public sector to the private sector."&lt;ref&gt;France 24, "Massive Rally Calls on G20 to Put People Ahead of Banks," http://www.france24.com/en/20100626-massive-rally-calls-g20-put-people-ahead-banks{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to eyewitness accounts, about 200 marchers broke away from the protest route on Queen Street and headed south on Bay Street towards the convention centre, through [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]]. The media would describe the break-off as led by the [[black bloc]], with demonstrators covering their bodies and faces in black clothes. Individuals using the same black bloc tactics have been suspected of being responsible for confrontations in other international summit protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The Canadian Press |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/829168--violent-black-bloc-tactics-on-display-at-g20-protest?bn=1 |title=Violent Black Bloc tactics on display at G20 protest |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2010-06-26|accessdate=2010-06-27 | location=Toronto| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630071652/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/829168--violent-black-bloc-tactics-on-display-at-g20-protest?bn=1| archivedate= 30 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters dispersed to damage buildings and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100626/g8-g20-black-bloc-100626/20100626?hub=Toronto |title=CTV Toronto - 'Black Bloc' vandal take over Toronto streets - CTV News |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-06-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100629065237/http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100626/g8-g20-black-bloc-100626/20100626?hub=Toronto| archivedate= 29 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent as interpreted by some media was to distract police forces from the security zone so that other protesters could break in, but police maintained their blockades, protecting the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=the CNN Wire Staff |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/06/27/canada.g20.protests/index.html?hpt=T1&amp;fbid=mZjulc3NxV6 |title=G-20 protests plagued by violence, vandalism - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= 2010-06-28|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vandals smashed the windows of various office buildings and stores along [[Yonge Street]], [[Queen Street West]] and [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]] using hammers, flag poles, umbrellas, chunks of pavement and mailboxes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|author=CBC.ca |url=http://news.ca.msn.com/canada/cbc-article.aspx?cp-documentid=24700313 |title=G20 protest brings violence, arrests - News - MSN CA |publisher=News.ca.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100629073427/http://news.ca.msn.com/canada/cbc-article.aspx?cp-documentid=24700313| archivedate= 29 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts also erupted between purported anarchists and journalists who were recording property destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20100626/summit-protests-100626/ |title=Police attempt to clear crowds amid G20 unrest - CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-06-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630162453/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20100626/summit-protests-100626/| archivedate= 30 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few hours, many black bloc demonstrators changed into civilian clothes and dissolved into the larger crowd as security forces began to increase in presence.

===Criticism of policing===
On December 7, 2010, Andre Marin, Ontario Ombudsman, issued a report called ''Caught in the Act'', an investigation into the legality of the ''Ontario Public Works Protection Act'', and, more specifically ''Regulation 233/10'', in Marin's words, "...known as the secret security regulation, a little known and widely misunderstood legal measure that was supposed to help the police keep the peace, but in my view wound up contributing to massive violations of civil rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=6125 | title=Toronto G20: Will Police be Held Accountable After Scathing Ombudsman's Report |date=January 22, 2010 |publisher=The Real News| accessdate= 24 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:G-20 Toronto June 2010 (6).jpg|thumb|Police were allowed to arrest anyone within five metres of the fence who would neither leave nor identify himself.]]
A group of lawyers requested court injunctions against the [[Toronto Police Service]] from using newly purchased [[Long Range Acoustic Device]]s (LRAD), also known as sound cannons, during protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/25/g20-sound-cannon.html |title=CBC News – Toronto – Limited G20 sound cannon use approved |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= 2010-06-25|accessdate=2010-06-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100627174237/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/25/g20-sound-cannon.html| archivedate= 27 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound cannons have been used in previous summit protests and have the ability to produce sound at ear-piercing volumes, potentially causing [[hearing impairment]].

The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that the [[Executive Council of Ontario]] had implemented a regulation under the provincial Public Works Protection Act on June 2 granting the ISU sweeping powers of arrest within a specific boundary during the summit;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/828367--g20-law-gives-police-sweeping-powers-to-arrest-people |title=G20 law gives police sweeping powers to arrest people |publisher=thestar.com |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=Toronto | first=Jennifer | last=Yang| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100628022808/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/828367--g20-law-gives-police-sweeping-powers-to-arrest-people| archivedate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rule was said to designate the security fence as a [[public works]] and, as such, allow any police officer or guard to arrest any individual failing or refusing to provide identification within five metres of the security zone. The regulation was requested by [[Toronto Police Service]] chief [[Bill Blair (police chief)|Bill Blair]] and debate in the legislature was not required. [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] such as this one are announced in the ''Ontario Gazette'', but the next issue of that publication was to be published after the order expired on June 28, a week after the summit ended.

Toronto Police Service held press conferences to speak out against inappropriate actions of protesters, including displaying items alleged to have been seized from protesters.

===Adam Nobody===
Protestor Adam Nobody, 27, was arrested in Queen's Park on 26 June. An amateur video uploaded to [[YouTube]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hym0afc03pE&lt;/ref&gt; showed at least a dozen officers surrounding and beating Nobody, who was not armed and did not appear to resist. He suffered a broken nose and cheekbone, and was charged with assaulting police. These charges were eventually dropped, and a [[Special Investigations Unit]] investigation was opened into the incident.  This investigation was closed without any charges laid, because the SIU was unable to identify the officers. They had covered their identification badges, police witnesses all claimed to be unable to identify them, and the arresting officer had written an invalid ID number on Nobody's arrest record.

Police chief Bill Blair insisted that a "forensic examination" had proven the video was "tampered with," removing proof that Nobody was an armed, violent criminal,  but soon retracted this statement admitting he had no evidence to support it. Blair's claims led to increased attention to the case, new witnesses coming forward, and a second video corroborating the first. On 30 November the SIU re-opened its investigation, obtained the co-operation of a police officer who witnessed the incident, and laid charges against Const. Babak Andalib-Goortani. The SIU has the names of other officers involved but has not yet laid charges against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/torontog20summit/article/898432--blair-says-g20-youtube-video-was-tampered-with | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Jayme | last=Poisson | title=Blair blasts SIU over findings of 'probable' excessive force | date=2010-11-29| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/torontog20summit/article/901332--chief-blair-apologizes-to-g20-protester-at-centre-of-youtube-video | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Jayme | last=Poisson | title=Chief Blair apologizes to G20 protester at centre of YouTube video | date=2010-12-03| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/torontog20summit/article/902664 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Rosie | last=DiManno | title=A second look at G20 police assault | date=2010-12-07| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/ontario-police-watchdog-reopens-g20-nobody-arrest-investigation/article1819175/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Adrian | last=Morrow | title=Ontario police watchdog reopens G20 'Nobody' arrest investigation - The Globe and Mail | date=2010-11-30| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101201044629/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/ontario-police-watchdog-reopens-g20-nobody-arrest-investigation/article1819175/| archivedate= 1 December 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/910856--g20-officer-tight-lipped-at-siu-appearance | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Jayme | last=Poisson | title=G20 officer tight-lipped at SIU appearance | date=2010-12-22| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/12/22/charges-siu-g20.html | work=CBC News | title=SIU knows all 3 officers in alleged G20 assault | date=2010-12-22| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/how-a-man-named-nobody-became-the-battered-face-of-g20-protests/article1818432/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Joe | last=Friesen | title=How a man named Nobody became the battered face of G20 protests | date=2010-11-30| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110122173321/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/how-a-man-named-nobody-became-the-battered-face-of-g20-protests/article1818432/| archivedate= 22 January 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and charges against police==

=== Babak Andalib-Goortani ===
In 2013, Andalib-Goortani was convicted of assault with a weapon for his role in Nobody's beating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alyshah |last=Hasham |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/09/12/g20_assault_trial_guilty_verdict_for_officer_who_hit_adam_nobody.html |title=G20 assault trial: Guilty verdict for officer who hit Adam Nobody|newspaper=Toronto Star| date= September 12, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial judge, Ontario Court Justice Louise Botham, commented that "a police officer is not entitled to use unlimited force to affect an arrest."&lt;ref name="NtlPost2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=Toronto police officer Babak Andalib-Goortani found guilty of assault with weapon against G20 protester Adam Nobody |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/posted-toronto/toronto-police-officer-babak-andalib-goortani-found-guilty-of-assault-with-weapon-against-g20-protester-adam-nobody |date=September 12, 2013 |publisher=[[National Post]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botham, who was brought in to Toronto from [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]] to hear the case, subsequently sentenced Andalib-Goortani to 45 days in jail.&lt;ref name="CBC2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=G20 assault: Babak Andalib-Goortani gets 45-day sentence |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/g20-assault-babak-andalib-goortani-gets-45-day-sentence-1.2456893 |date=December 9, 2013 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her ruling, Botham indicated that the sentence was heavy influenced by video of Andalib-Goortani, along with a number of other officers whose disciplinary charges were dismissed, punching, kneeing, kicking, and striking the victim with a baton; stating that the period of incarceration was necessary to uphold the public's faith in the justice system.&lt;ref name="CBC2013"/&gt;

Less than 10 minutes after Botham announced the sentence in her Brampton courtroom, a Toronto court granted bail to Andalib-Goortani pending appeal.&lt;ref name="Sun2013"&gt;{{cite web |author=Shawn Jeffords |title=Toronto cop sentenced to 45 days in jail for Adam Nobody assault  |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/12/09/toronto-cop-gets-45-days-in-jail-for-adam-nobody-assault |date=December 9, 2013 |publisher=[[Toronto Sun]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Andalib-Goortani awaited appeal of that assault conviction, another assault with a weapon charge, for a G20 attack on journalist/blogger Wyndham {{nowrap|Bettencourt-McCarthy}}, was thrown out when the photograph taken a she was about to be hit with the baton, showing a riot-geared officer which another officer was ready to testify was Andalib-Goortani, was ruled inadmissible because the photo had been obtained through an anonymous website posting and the photographer could not be called to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Colin Perkel, The Canadian Press |title=Babak Andalib-Goortani, G20 Cop, Acquitted On 2nd Assault Charge |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/09/24/babak-andalib-goortani_n_5875964.html |date=September 24, 2014 |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sarah Sweet |title=Cop Acquitted on Charge of Assaulting Former ''Torontoist'' Contributor at G20 Protests — {{resize|Photographic evidence ruled inadmissible.}} |url=http://torontoist.com/2014/09/cop-acquitted-on-charge-of-assaulting-former-torontist-contributor-at-g20-protests/ |date=September 24, 2014 |publisher=[[Torontoist]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Babak Andalib-Goortani acquitted in 2nd G20 incident |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/babak-andalib-goortani-acquitted-in-2nd-g20-incident-1.2776735 |date=September 24, 2014 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 16 months after being sentenced to jail time and released on bail, Toronto Superior Court Justice Brian O'Marra overturned the sentence and, without providing reasons for his decision, instead ordered that Andalib-Goortani do 75 hours of community service with one year's probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Alyshah Hasham |title=No jail for Toronto police officer convicted of G20 assault |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2015/01/29/no-jail-for-toronto-police-officer-convicted-of-g20-assault.html |date=January 29, 2015 |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Judge lightens sentence of officer convicted of assaulting G20 protester |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/g20-officers-conviction-stands-but-he-need-not-serve-jail-time-judge-rules/article22697292/ |date=January 29, 2015 |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2015, retired Toronto judge Lee Ferrier, presiding over the Toronto Police Service's disciplinary hearing of Andalib-Goortani, docked Andalib-Goortani five days pay for the incident, thus returning the officer to patrol the streets of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rosie DiManno |title=Retired judge all but weeps for guilty G20 cop: DiManno |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2015/11/11/retired-judge-all-but-weeps-for-guilty-g20-cop-dimanno.html |date=November 11, 2015 |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David 'Mark' Fenton ===
In 2014, Toronto Police Superintendent Mark Fenton, was charged with unlawful arrest and discreditable conduct in relation to the [[kettling]] incidents and faced a disciplinary hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wendy Gillis |title='Toronto deteriorated into a sense of lawlessness,' says G20 police commander |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2014/12/17/the_city_of_toronto_deteriorated_says_g20_police_commander_charged_with_misconduct.html |date=December 17, 2014 |publisher=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenton was one of two major incident commanders, in charge of the Major Incident Command Centre during the summit, and was the one on duty when he ordered the kettling of protestors both at the Novotel on the Esplanade and at Queen and Spadina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Colin Perkel |title=Misconduct case for Toronto police officer in G20 'kettling' put over |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/misconduct-case-for-toronto-police-officer-in-g20-kettling-put-over/article7035463/ |date=January 8, 2013 |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2015, more than five years after the Toronto G20 incidents leading to the charges, Fenton was found guilty of two counts of unlawful arrest and one count of discreditable conduct, disciplinary charges under the [[Police Services Act of Ontario|''Police Act'']], in relation to the "kettling" of protestors and passers-by at the intersection of Queen Street and Spadina Avenue and at the Novotel hotel on the Esplanade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wendy Gillis |title=G20 commander apologizes after being convicted of misconduct |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2015/08/25/toronto-police-g20-supervisor-found-guilty-of-misconduct.html |date=August 25, 2015 |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rendering judgment, retired Ontario judge John Hamilton explained that "Legitimate protesters … had the right not to be subject to arrest for making noise, chanting and sitting in the public street.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cara McKenna, The Canadian Press |title=More than five years later, senior officer found guilty over mass arrests, ‘kettling’ at 2010 G20 protests |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/toronto-g20-officer-david-fenton-charged |date=August 25, 2015 |publisher=[[National Post]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamilton indicated that he believed Fenton was committed to serving the public, but that he did not properly understand the constitutional right of the public to protest.&lt;ref name="CP24"/&gt;  In addition to the unlawful arrest convictions, Hamilton deemed Fenton guilty of discreditable conduct resultant from keeping people corralled in the streets during a severe thunderstorm while his duty was to protect them from such harsh weather; however he found him not guilty of the same charge in relation to the Novotel because those unlawfully arrested did not suffer similar hardships.&lt;ref name="CP24"&gt;{{cite web |author=Cara McKenna, The Canadian Press |title=T.O. cop found guilty on 3 charges stemming from G20 protests |url=http://www.cp24.com/news/t-o-cop-found-guilty-on-3-charges-stemming-from-g20-protests-1.2531835 |date=August 25, 2015 |publisher=[[CP24]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fenton was found not guilty on charges of unnecessary exercise of authority relating to the treatment of protestors after they were arrested and taken away because another officer of equal rank was in charge of the Prisoner Processing Centre; that officer was never charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senior police officer found guilty of 3 charges in G20 disciplinary hearing |url=http://www.reddeeradvocate.com/news/Senior_police_officer_found_guilty_of_3_charges_in_G20_disciplinary_hearing_322858231.html |date=August 25, 2015 |publisher=[[Red Deer Advocate]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentencing hearing is expected to begin December 21, 2015 with penalty possibilities ranging from reprimand to dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michele Mandel, [[Toronto Sun]] |title=Senior G20 cop guilty on three charges

Regarding count one (the Novotel Misconduct) Fenton was given a formal reprimand.  Regarding count two (the Queen and Spadina Misconduct) Fenton was sentenced to the forfeiture of 10 vacation days.  Regarding count three (the Queen and Spadina Discreditable Conduct) Fenton was sentenced to the forfeiture of 20 vacation days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ccla.org/cclanewsite/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fenton-Penalty-Decision_June-15-2016-C1631822xA0E3A.pdf|title=Fenton Penalty Decision|last=Hamilton|first=John|date=June 15, 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement has an intense [[chromaticism]] with a great representation of [[ayahuasca]] experience psychedelic —a delirious artistic style that is seen strongly in the non-Amazonian pop art works of [[Pablo Amaringo]]. Originally, it is an [[mural]] art that blends prominently the colorful amazonian culture, European motifs and commercial characters, which could be influenced by American [[pop art]] when the era of [[cable television]] came to the city, like [[MTV]].&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt;

Amazonian pop art grew [[self-taught]]. Mainly started in the suburbs of Iquitos, where there was no [[art market]], or some kind of [[art school]], because that too is considered a [[naive art|naive]] style.&lt;ref name=SobrePeru /&gt;

Essentially, the Amazonian pop art originated from various mixes of popular culture Iquitos received through the media, including [[movie poster]]s, typography of [[Cinema of Mexico|film in Mexico]] and [[Bollywood|India]]. Another important feature is the visual style that originated from [[music video]]s.&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt; Typically, in most of the Amazonian pop art works is denoted [[nightclub]]s, [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s and pubs video scene. In several other compositions, it also becomes large presence of the feminine and the [[erotic]].&lt;ref name=SobrePeru /&gt;

In the visual, Amazonian pop art is divided into two categories: the ''diurnal'' works have consistent and complete colors, and the ''nocturn'' works, the most attractive, are painted with [[phosphorescent]] material —often taking infinite forms as a collection of [[neon light]]s—, that glow under [[black light]] or simple night.&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt;

Currently, several artists engaged in decorating the rustic architecture of the city —such as [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s and [[stilt house|palafittes]]— in areas such as the [[Belén District, Maynas|Belen District]] as a method of [[artistic expression]] and cultural influence. The cultural impact of art was so attractive that comes up in cemeteries.&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt;

The '''Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device''' or '''MUSTARD''', usually written as '''Mustard''', was a concept explored by the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC) during the mid-1960s for launching payloads weighing as much as {{convert|5000|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}} into orbit. Operating as a multi-stage rocket for launch, the individual stages were near-identical modules, each flying back to land as a spaceplane.

==History==
British interest in re-usable space vehicles started life under [[English Electric]] at [[Warton Aerodrome|Warton]], Lancashire, UK, as part of a government-sponsored series of wider studies into high-speed vehicles and sub-orbital [[spaceplane]]s. Their aerospace activities were later merged with other firms to form [[British Aircraft Corporation|BAC]]. American influence had already been seen, but now BAC studied the various transatlantic projects with greater interest. The [[Douglas Astro]] in particular impressed them and around the beginning of 1964 they took it as the starting point for their own clustered design, which they called the Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device or MUSTARD, but it was usually written simply as Mustard.

The last major design study was drawn up early in 1967 and the project continued at a lower level until it was finally terminated in 1970 by the British government's decision to participate in the new American post-Apollo project. Key Mustard project staff spent the first two years of the 1970s at [[North American Rockwell]] contributing to the initial study which would eventually lead to the [[Space Shuttle]]. By then the prospect of collaboration had faded and, with UK government interest also gone, the Mustard project was terminated.

BAC was itself later merged into [[British Aerospace]] (B.Ae) and when the [[HOTOL]] project arose in 1984 it was moved to Warton to take advantage of the expertise built up during the Mustard project.&lt;ref name="sharp2016"&gt;Sharp (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
===Modules===
Mustard was a modular re-usable space launch system, comprising multiple copies of a single vehicle design, each of which was configured for a different role as a booster stage or an orbital spaceplane. The core vehicle design followed the [[Douglas Astro]] delta-winged reusable vehicle, as would the later US [[Space Shuttle]], in being a vertically-launched rocket with integral wings so that it landed horizontally as an aeroplane.&lt;ref name="sharp2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"BAC MUSTARD Project Artwork Archive", ''Britain in Space'', {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926000930/http://www.britain-in-space.co.uk/info/pix-archive/mustard.html|date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1966/1966%20-%200663.pdf "Space Transporters for Europe?"], ''Flight International'', 10 March 1966, p.402.&lt;/ref&gt; The design team was led by [[Tom Smith (engineer)|Tom Smith]], Chief of the Aerospace Department at BAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%200816.html "Economical Space Transport"], ''Flight International'', 24 March 1966, p.473.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design evolved through a total of fifteen proposed variants or schemes, each typically comprising a deep-keeled lifting-body airframe with delta wings in a smooth [[blended wing body]] layout, with twin tail fins rising from the wing tips and canted outwards. Some early variants had a compound-delta wing with inboard tail fins. Power was provided by anything from one to four rocket engines in the rear fuselage.

There were two primary vehicle configurations, respectively for the orbiter and booster stages. The orbiter could be manned and had ducting to receive fuel from the boosters. The boosters were unmanned and incorporated systems to pump fuel across to the orbiter or to each other. In this way the orbiter could remain fully topped-up for its long orbital injection flight, while all the vehicles could have a standard design of fuel tank.

===Clustering and stacking===
Various clustering and stacking arrangements were explored. Where the Astro had launched as a two-stage step-rocket with the booster much larger than the orbiter, Mustard comprised from three to five similar-sized modules.

Early studies focused around a vehicle with a shallow 120° "vee" underside to both body and wings, so that three could be clustered in a triangle. Some included a fourth, orbital vehicle mounted on top of three boosters. The most efficient regime was to empty one booster at a time, keeping the others topped up for as long as possible, so that the first-stage booster could be dropped as soon as possible. The three boosters would be emptied in turn. But this led to an asymmetric mass loading which BAC believed to be a significant problem, so later designs used a sideways stacking system in which flatter modules were stacked more like sheets of paper.&lt;ref name="sharp2016"/&gt;

At {{convert|150,000|to|200,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, at around 30 nautical miles, the last of the booster units would separate and land like aircraft.

The spacecraft would place its payload into orbit at around 1000 nautical miles, after 10 minutes from launch, and then return in a like manner.

== Background ==
{{Main article|Epigenetics}}
In [[biology]], and specifically [[genetics]], epigenetics is the study of [[heritable]] changes in [[gene]] activity which are ''not'' caused by changes in the [[DNA]] sequence; the term can also be used to describe the study of stable, long-term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell that are not necessarily heritable.&lt;ref name="pmid17522671"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird A | title = Perceptions of epigenetics | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 396–8 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17522671 | doi = 10.1038/nature05913 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..396B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview of the Roadmap Epigenomics Project |url=http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are [[DNA methylation]]&lt;ref name="pmid18940229"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehler MF | title = Epigenetic principles and mechanisms underlying nervous system functions in health and disease | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 305–41 | date = Dec 2008 | pmid = 18940229 | pmc = 2636693 | doi =  10.1016/j.pneurobio.2008.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[histone modification]],&lt;ref name="Maze_2011"/&gt; each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying [[DNA sequence]]. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of repressor proteins that attach to [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]] regions of the DNA. 
[[Image:Epigenetic mechanisms.jpg|thumb|Modifications of the [[epigenome]] do not alter DNA.]]

DNA methylation turns a gene "off" – it results in the inability of genetic information to be read from DNA; removing the methyl tag can turn the gene back "on".&lt;ref name="Reik_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reik W | title = Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 425–32 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17522676 | doi = 10.1038/nature05918 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..425R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottesman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gottesman II, Hanson DR | title = Human development: biological and genetic processes | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 56 | issue =  | pages = 263–86 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15709936 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigenetics has a strong influence on the development of an organism and can alter the expression of individual traits.&lt;ref name="pmid11498570"/&gt;  Epigenetic changes occur not only in the developing fetus, but also in individuals throughout the human life-span.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell IC, Mill J, Uher R, Schmidt U | title = Eating disorders, gene-environment interactions and epigenetics | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 784–93 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 20888360 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.09.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Because some epigenetic modifications can be passed from one generation to the next,&lt;ref name="Goto_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goto T, Monk M | title = Regulation of X-chromosome inactivation in development in mice and humans | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 362–78 | date = Jun 1998 | pmid = 9618446 | pmc = 98919 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequent generations may be affected by the epigenetic changes that took place in the parents.&lt;ref name="Goto_1998"/&gt;

== Discovery ==

The first documented example of epigenetics affecting behavior was provided by [[Michael Meaney]] and [[Moshe Szyf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weaver IC, Cervoni N, Champagne FA, D'Alessio AC, Sharma S, Seckl JR, Dymov S, Szyf M, Meaney MJ | title = Epigenetic programming by maternal behavior | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 847–54 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15220929 | doi = 10.1038/nn1276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at [[McGill University]] in [[Montréal]] in 2004, they discovered that the type and amount of nurturing a mother rat provides in the early weeks of the rat's [[infancy]] determines how that rat responds to [[stress (psychological)|stress]] later in life.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; This stress sensitivity was linked to a [[Regulation of gene expression#Up-regulation and down-regulation|down-regulation]] in the expression of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] in the brain.  In turn, this down-regulation was found to be a consequence of the extent of [[Methylation#Epigenetics|methylation]] in the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region of the glucocorticoid receptor [[gene]].&lt;ref name="Miller_2010"/&gt; Immediately after birth, Meaney and Szyf found that [[methyl group]]s repress the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] gene in all rat pups, making the gene unable to unwind from the histone in order to be transcribed, causing a decreased stress response. Nurturing behaviours from the mother rat were found to stimulate activation of stress signalling pathways that remove methyl groups from DNA. This releases the tightly wound gene, exposing it for transcription. The glucocorticoid gene is activated, resulting in lowered stress response. Rat pups that receive a less nurturing upbringing are more sensitive to stress throughout their life-span.

This pioneering work in rodents has been difficult to replicate in humans because of a general lack of availability human brain tissue for measurement of epigenetic changes.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010"/&gt;

== Research into epigenetics in psychology ==

=== Anxiety and risk-taking ===
[[Image:TwinGirls.jpg|right|thumb|[[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|Monozygotic twins]] are identical twins. [[Twin studies]] help to reveal epigenetic differences related to various aspects of psychology.]]
In a small clinical study in humans published in 2008, epigenetic differences were linked to differences in risk-taking and reactions to stress in [[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|monozygotic twins]].&lt;ref name="Kaminsky_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaminsky Z, Petronis A, Wang SC, Levine B, Ghaffar O, Floden D, Feinstein A | title = Epigenetics of personality traits: an illustrative study of identical twins discordant for risk-taking behavior | journal = Twin Research and Human Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | date = Feb 2008 | pmid = 18251670 | doi = 10.1375/twin.11.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study identified twins with different life paths, wherein one twin displayed risk-taking behaviours, and the other displayed risk-averse behaviours.  Epigenetic differences in [[DNA methylation]] of the [[CpG island]]s proximal to the [[DLX1]] gene correlated with the differing behavior.&lt;ref name="Kaminsky_2008"/&gt;   The authors of the twin study noted that despite the associations between epigenetic markers and differences personality traits, epigenetics cannot predict complex decision-making processes like career selection.&lt;ref name="Kaminsky_2008"/&gt;

=== Stress ===
[[Image:Basic HPA Axis.jpeg|right|thumb|The [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis]] is involved in the [[Stress (biology)|human stress response]].]]
Animal and human studies have found correlations between poor care during infancy and epigenetic changes that correlate with long-term impairments that result from neglect.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Masterpasqua F | title = Psychology and epigenetics | journal = Review of General Psychology | year = 2009 | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 194–201 |pmid = | doi = 10.1037/a0016301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Szyf and McGowan"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szyf M, McGowan P, Meaney MJ | title = The social environment and the epigenome | journal = Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–60 | date = Jan 2008 | pmid = 18095330 | doi = 10.1002/em.20357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gonzalez-Pardo&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = González-Pardo H, Pérez Álvarez M | title = Epigenetics and its implications for Psychology | journal = Psicothema | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = Feb 2013 | pmid = 23336536 | doi = 10.7334/psicothema2012.327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in rats have shown correlations between maternal care in terms of the parental licking of offspring and epigenetic changes.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua/&gt; A high level of licking results in a long-term reduction in stress response as measured behaviorally and biochemically in elements of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA).  Further, decreased DNA methylation of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] gene were found in offspring that experienced a high level of licking; the glucorticoid receptor plays a key role in regulating the HPA.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;  The opposite is found in offspring that experienced low levels of licking, and when pups are switched,  the epigenetic changes are reversed. This research provides evidence for an underlying epigenetic mechanism.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;  Further support comes from experiments with the same setup, using drugs that can increase or decrease methylation.&lt;ref name="Szyf and McGowan"/&gt;  Finally, epigenetic variations in parental care can be passed down from one generation to the next, from mother to female offspring. Female offspring who received increased parental care (i.e., high licking) became mothers who engaged in high licking and offspring who received less licking became mothers who engaged in less licking.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;

In humans, a small clinical research study showed the relationship between prenatal exposure to maternal [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and genetic expression resulting in increased reactivity to stress in offspring.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; Three groups of infants were examined: those born to mothers medicated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] with [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|serotonin reuptake inhibitors]]; those born to depressed mothers not being treated for depression; and those born to non-depressed mothers. Prenatal exposure to depressed/anxious mood was associated with increased DNA methylation at the glucocorticoid receptor gene and to increased HPA axis stress reactivity.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;  The findings were independent of whether the mothers were being pharmaceutically treated for depression.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;

Recent research has also shown the relationship of methylation of the maternal glucocorticoid receptor and maternal neural activity in response to mother-infant interactions on video.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Moser DA, Giacobino A, Stenz L, Gex-Fabry M, Adouan W, Cordero MI, Suardi F, Manini A, Sancho-Rossignol A, Merminod G, Aue T, Ansermet F, Dayer AG, Rusconi-Serpa S. (epub May 29, 2015)  Methylation of NR3C1 is related to maternal PTSD, parenting stress and maternal medial prefrontal cortical activity in response to child separation among mothers with histories of violence exposure. Frontiers in Psychology. http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00690/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;  Longitudinal follow-up of those infants will be important to understand the impact of early caregiving in this high-risk population on child epigenetics and behavior.

=== Drug addiction ===
{{main article|ΔFosB}}
{{Psychostimulant addiction|Colorcode=yes|align=right}}
Environmental and epigenetic influences seem to work together to increase the risk of [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt; For example, environmental stress has been shown to increase the risk of [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name="Andersen and Teicher"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SL, Teicher MH | title = Desperately driven and no brakes: developmental stress exposure and subsequent risk for substance abuse | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 516–24 | date = Apr 2009 | pmid = 18938197 | pmc = 2688959 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.09.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to cope with stress, [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] can be used as an escape.&lt;ref name=Carver&gt;{{cite book | vauthors =  Carver C | chapter = Coping | veditors = Baum A, Contrada RJ | title = The Handbook of Stress Science: Biology, Psychology, and Health | edition = | publisher = Springer Publishing Company | location = New York | year = 2010  | pages = 223 | quote = | isbn = 978-0-8261-1471-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once substance abuse commences, however, epigenetic alterations may further exacerbate the biological and behavioural changes associated with addiction.&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt;

Even short-term substance abuse can produce long-lasting epigenetic changes in the brain of rodents,&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt; via DNA methylation and histone modification.&lt;ref name="Maze_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maze I, Nestler EJ | title = The epigenetic landscape of addiction | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1216 | issue =  | pages = 99–113 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21272014 | pmc = 3071632 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05893.x | bibcode = 2011NYASA1216...99M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic modifications have been observed in studies on rodents involving [[ethanol]], [[nicotine]], [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]] and [[opiate]]s.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; Specifically, these epigenetic changes modify gene expression, which in turn increases the vulnerability of an individual to engage in repeated substance overdose in the future. In turn, increased substance abuse results in even greater epigenetic changes in various components of a rodent's [[reward system]]&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong CC, Mill J, Fernandes C | title = Drugs and addiction: an introduction to epigenetics | journal = Addiction | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 480–9 | date = Mar 2011 | pmid = 21205049 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03321.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., in the [[nucleus accumbens]]&lt;ref name="Renthal and Nestler"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Renthal W, Nestler EJ | title = Epigenetic mechanisms in drug addiction | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 341–50 | date = Aug 2008 | pmid = 18635399 | pmc = 2753378 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2008.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Hence, a cycle emerges whereby changes in the pleasure-reward areas contribute to the long-lasting neural and behavioural changes associated with the increased likelihood of addiction, the maintenance of addiction and [[relapse]].&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt; In humans, alcohol consumption has been shown to produce epigenetic changes that contribute to the increased craving of alcohol. As such, epigenetic modifications may play a part in the progression from the controlled intake to the loss of control of alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name=Naassila&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naassila M | title = Abstracts of ESBRA 2011, European Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism.

These include: repetitive habits that increase the risk of disease, and personal and social problems; need for immediate [[gratification]]; high rates of relapse following treatment; and, the feeling of loss of control.&lt;ref name="Marlatt et al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marlatt GA, Baer JS, Donovan DM, Kivlahan DR | title = Addictive behaviors: etiology and treatment | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 39 | issue =  | pages = 223–52 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3278676 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.39.020188.001255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for epigenetic changes stemming from amphetamine and cocaine abuse derives from animal studies. In animals, drug-related epigenetic changes in fathers have also been shown to negatively affect offspring in terms of poorer spatial [[working memory]], decreased [[attention]] and decreased [[cerebral volume]].&lt;ref name="He et al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = He F, Lidow IA, Lidow MS | title = Consequences of paternal cocaine exposure in mice | journal = Neurotoxicology and Teratology | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 198–209 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16458479 | doi = 10.1016/j.ntt.2005.12.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eating disorders and obesity ===
{{further|ΔFosB}}
Epigenetic changes may help to facilitate the development and maintenance of [[eating disorder]]s via influences in the early environment and throughout the life-span.&lt;ref name="Campbell_2011"/&gt; [[Pre-natal]] epigenetic changes due to maternal stress, behaviour and diet may later predispose offspring to persistent, increased anxiety and [[anxiety disorders]]. These anxiety issues can precipitate the onset of eating disorders and [[obesity]], and persist even after recovery from the eating disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid18213688"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raney TJ, Thornton LM, Berrettini W, Brandt H, Crawford S, Fichter MM, Halmi KA, Johnson C, Kaplan AS, LaVia M, Mitchell J, Rotondo A, Strober M, Woodside DB, Kaye WH, Bulik CM | title = Influence of overanxious disorder of childhood on the expression of anorexia nervosa | journal = The International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–32 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18213688 | doi = 10.1002/eat.20508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigenetic differences accumulating over the life-span may account for the incongruent differences in eating disorders observed in monozygotic twins. At [[puberty]], [[sex hormones]] may exert epigenetic changes (via DNA methylation) on gene expression, thus accounting for higher rates of eating disorders in men as compared to women. Overall, epigenetics contribute to persistent, unregulated [[self-control]] behaviours related to the urge to [[Binge eating|binge]].&lt;ref name="Campbell_2011"/&gt;

=== Schizophrenia ===
{{details|Epigenetics of schizophrenia}}
Epigenetic changes including hypomethylation of glutamatergic genes (i.e., NMDA-receptor-subunit gene [[NMDA receptor|NR3B]] and the promoter of the AMPA-receptor-subunit gene [[GRIA2]]) in the post-mortem human brains of schizophrenics are associated with increased levels of the neurotransmitter [[glutamic acid|glutamate]].&lt;ref name="Mostafavi-Abdolmaleky"&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Bronner F, Helmtrud I |title=Epigenetic Aspects of Chronic Diseases |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84882-643-4 |vauthors=Mostafavi-Abdolmaleky H, Glatt SJ, Tsuang MT |chapter=Epigenetics in Psychiatry |pages=163–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since glutamate is the most prevalent, fast, excitatory neurotransmitter, increased levels may result in the [[psychotic episodes]] related to [[schizophrenia]]. Epigenetic changes affecting a greater number of genes have been detected in men with schizophrenia as compared to women with the illness.&lt;ref name="Abdolmaleky_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abdolmaleky HM, Thiagalingam S, Wilcox M |title=Genetics and epigenetics in major psychiatric disorders: dilemmas, achievements, applications, and future scope |journal=American Journal of Pharmacogenomics |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=149–60 |year=2005 |pmid=15952869 |doi=10.2165/00129785-200505030-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, many other environmental factors (e.g., [[nutritional deficiencies]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use) have been proposed to increase the susceptibility of [[psychotic disorder]]s like schizophrenia via epigenetics.&lt;ref name="Rutten_2009"/&gt;

Several studies have indicated DNA cytosine methylation linked to the social behavior of insects, such as honeybees and ants. In honeybees, when nurse bee switched from her in-hive tasks to out foraging, cytosine methylation marks are changing. When a forager bee was reversed to do nurse duties, the cytosine methylation marks were also reversed.&lt;ref name="Herb_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herb BR, Wolschin F, Hansen KD, Aryee MJ, Langmead B, Irizarry R, Amdam GV, Feinberg AP | title = Reversible switching between epigenetic states in honeybee behavioral subcastes | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 15 | issue = 10 | pages = 1371–3 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22983211 | doi = 10.1038/nn.3218 | pmc=3518384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knocking down the DNMT3 in the larvae changed the worker to queen-like phenotype.&lt;ref name="Kucharski_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kucharski R, Maleszka J, Foret S, Maleszka R | title = Nutritional control of reproductive status in honeybees via DNA methylation | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5871 | pages = 1827–30 | date = Mar 2008 | pmid = 18339900 | doi = 10.1126/science.1153069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen and worker are two distinguish castes with different morphology, behavior, and physiology.

== Limitations and future direction ==
Many researchers contribute information to the [[International Human Epigenome Consortium|Human Epigenome Consortium]].&lt;ref name="Albert_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Albert PR | title = Epigenetics in mental illness: hope or hype? | journal = Journal of Psychiatry &amp; Neuroscience | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 366–8 | date = Nov 2010 | pmid = 20964959 | pmc = 2964366 | doi = 10.1503/jpn.100148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of future research is to reprogram epigenetic changes to help with addiction, mental illness, age related changes,&lt;ref name="Powledge_2011" /&gt;  memory decline, and other issues.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010" /&gt; However, the sheer volume of consortium-based data makes analysis difficult.&lt;ref name="Powledge_2011" /&gt; Most studies also focus on one gene.&lt;ref name=McCaffery&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = McCaffery JM | chapter = Genetic epidemiology of stress and gene by stress interaction |veditors=Baum A, Contrada RJ | title = The Handbook of Stress Science: Biology, Psychology, and Health | edition = | publisher = Springer Publishing Company | location = New York | year = 2010 | pages = 78–85 | isbn = 978-0-8261-1471-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In actuality, many genes and interactions between them likely contribute to individual differences in personality, behaviour and health.&lt;ref name="Kalant_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalant H | title = What neurobiology cannot tell us about addiction | journal = Addiction | volume = 105 | issue = 5 | pages = 780–9 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 19919596 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02739.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; As social scientists often work with many variables, determining the number of affected genes also poses methodological challenges. More collaboration between medical researchers, geneticists and social scientists has been advocated to increase knowledge in this field of study.&lt;ref name = "Guo_2010"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors =  Guo G | chapter = Family influences on children's well being: potential roles of molecular genetics and epigenetics |veditors=Landale N, Booth A, McHale S | title = Biosocial Foundations of Family Processes (National Symposium on Family Issues) | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2010 | pages = 181–204 | quote = | isbn = 978-1-4419-7360-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Limited access to human brain tissue poses a challenge to conducting human research.&lt;ref name="Powledge_2011" /&gt; Not yet knowing if epigenetic changes in the blood and (non-brain) tissues parallel modifications in the brain, places even greater reliance on brain research.&lt;ref name="Albert_2010"/&gt; Although some epigenetic studies have translated findings from animals to humans,&lt;ref name="McGowan_2009"/&gt; some researchers caution about the extrapolation of animal studies to humans.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010" /&gt; One view notes that when animal studies do not consider how the subcellular and  cellular components, organs and the entire individual interact with the influences of the environment, results are too reductive to explain behaviour.&lt;ref name="Kalant_2010" /&gt;

Some researchers note that epigenetic perspectives will likely be incorporated into pharmacological treatments.&lt;ref name="pmid18197504" /&gt; Others caution that more research is necessary as drugs are known to modify the activity of multiple genes and may, therefore, cause serious side effects.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010" /&gt; However, the ultimate goal is to find patterns of epigenetic changes that can be targeted to treat mental illness, and reverse the effects of childhood stressors, for example. If such treatable patterns eventually become well-established, the inability to access brains in living humans to identify them poses an obstacle to pharmacological treatment.&lt;ref name="Albert_2010"/&gt; Future research may also focus on epigenetic changes that mediate the impact of psychotherapy on personality and behaviour.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;

Most epigenetic research is correlational; it merely establishes associations. More experimental research is necessary to help establish causation.&lt;ref name="pmid21908516"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dempster EL, Pidsley R, Schalkwyk LC, Owens S, Georgiades A, Kane F, Kalidindi S, Picchioni M, Kravariti E, Toulopoulou T, Murray RM, Mill J | title = Disease-associated epigenetic changes in monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 20 | issue = 24 | pages = 4786–96 | date = Dec 2011 | pmid = 21908516 | pmc = 3221539 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddr416 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of resources has also limited the number of intergenerational studies.&lt;ref name="Powledge_2011" /&gt; Therefore, advancing longitudinal&lt;ref name="Guo_2010" /&gt; and multigenerational, experience-dependent studies will be critical to further understanding the role of epigenetics in psychology.&lt;ref name="Champagne" /&gt;

In [[quantum statistics]], '''Bose–Einstein statistics''' (or more colloquially '''B–E statistics''') is one of two possible ways in which a collection of non-interacting indistinguishable [[particles]] may occupy a set of available discrete [[Energy level|energy states]], at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. The aggregation of particles in the same state, which is a characteristic of particles obeying Bose–Einstein statistics, accounts for the cohesive streaming of [[Laser#Quantum vs. classical emission processes|laser light]] and the frictionless creeping of [[Superfluid helium-4|superfluid helium]]. The theory of this behaviour was developed (1924–25) by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], who recognized that a collection of identical and indistinguishable particles can be distributed in this way. The idea was later adopted and extended by [[Albert Einstein]] in collaboration with Bose.

The Bose–Einstein statistics apply only to those particles not limited to single occupancy of the same state—that is, particles that do not obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] restrictions. Such particles have integer values of [[spin (physics)|spin]] and are named [[boson]]s, after the statistics that correctly describe their behaviour. There must also be no significant interaction between the particles.

==Concept==
At low temperatures, bosons behave differently from [[fermion]]s (which obey the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]) in a way that an unlimited number of them can "condense" into the same energy state. This apparently unusual property also gives rise to the special state of matter &amp;ndash; the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein statistics apply when [[quantum|quantum effects]] are important and the particles are "[[Identical particles|indistinguishable]]". Quantum effects appear if the concentration of particles satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{V} \ge n_q, &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|N}} is the number of particles, {{mvar|V}} is the volume, and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[quantum concentration]], for which the interparticle distance is equal to the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]], so that the [[wavefunction]]s of the particles are barely overlapping.

Fermi–Dirac statistics apply to fermions (particles that obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]), and Bose–Einstein statistics apply to [[bosons]]. As the quantum concentration depends on temperature, most systems at high temperatures obey the classical (Maxwell–Boltzmann) limit, unless they also have a very high density, as for a [[white dwarf]]. Both Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein become [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] at high temperature or at low concentration.

B–E statistics was introduced for [[photon]]s in 1924 by [[Satyendra Nath Bose|Bose]] and generalized to atoms by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] in 1924–25.

The expected number of particles in an energy state ''i'' for B–E statistics is
:&lt;math&gt;n_i(\varepsilon_i) = \frac{g_i}{e^{(\varepsilon_i - \mu)/k_{\rm B}T} - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
with {{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt; ''μ''}} and where {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the number of particles in state {{math|''i'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of energy level {{math|''i'', ''ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[energy]] of the ''i''-th state, ''μ'' is the [[chemical potential]], {{Math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and ''T'' is [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]].

For comparison, the average number of fermions with energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; given by [[Fermi–Dirac statistics#Distribution of particles over energy|Fermi–Dirac particle-energy distribution]] has a similar form:
:&lt;math&gt; \bar{n}_i(\epsilon_i) = \frac{g_i}{e^{(\epsilon_i - \mu)/k_{\rm B}T} + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

B–E statistics reduces to the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] distribution for &lt;math&gt; k_{\rm B}T \gg \epsilon_i - \mu &lt;/math&gt;, namely 
:&lt;math&gt; n_i = \frac{g_i k_{\rm B}T}{\varepsilon_i - \mu}. &lt;/math&gt;

==History==
While presenting a lecture at the [[University of Dhaka]] (in what was then [[British India]] and now [[Bangladesh]]) on the theory of radiation and the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] intended to show his students that the contemporary theory was inadequate, because it predicted results not in accordance with experimental results. During this lecture, Bose committed an error in applying the theory, which unexpectedly gave a prediction that agreed with the experiment. The error was a simple mistake—similar to arguing that flipping two fair coins will produce two heads one-third of the time—that would appear obviously wrong to anyone with a basic understanding of statistics (remarkably, this error resembled the famous blunder by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] known from his "[http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Dalembert/croix_ou_pile.pdf Croix ou Pile]" article). However, the results it predicted agreed with experiment, and Bose realized it might not be a mistake after all. For the first time, he took the position that the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] would not be true for all microscopic particles at all scales. Thus, he studied the probability of finding particles in various states in phase space, where each state is a little patch having volume h&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and the position and momentum of the particles are not kept particularly separate but are considered as one variable.

Bose adapted this lecture into a short article called "Planck's Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta"&lt;ref&gt;See p. 14, note 3, of the Ph.D. Thesis entitled
''Bose–Einstein condensation: analysis of problems and rigorous results'', presented by Alessandro Michelangeli to the International School for Advanced Studies, Mathematical Physics Sector, October 2007 for the degree of Ph.D. See: {{cite web

However, the referee's report was negative, and the paper was rejected. Undaunted, he sent the manuscript to Albert Einstein requesting publication in the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]''. Einstein immediately agreed, personally translated the article from English into German (Bose had earlier translated Einstein's article on the theory of General Relativity from German to English), and saw to it that it was published. Bose's theory achieved respect when Einstein sent his own paper in support of Bose's to ''Zeitschrift für Physik'', asking that they be published together. The paper came out in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = &lt;!--The paper gives the name of the author as just this single word--&gt; | last = Bose | title = Plancks Gesetz und Lichtquantenhypothese | journal = [[Zeitschrift für Physik]] | volume = 26 | pages = 178–181 | year = 1924 | language = German | bibcode = 1924ZPhy...26..178B | doi = 10.1007/BF01327326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason Bose produced accurate results was that since photons are indistinguishable from each other, one cannot treat any two photons having equal energy as being two distinct identifiable photons. By analogy, if in an alternate universe coins were to behave like photons and other bosons, the probability of producing two heads would indeed be one-third, and so is the probability of getting a head and a tail which equals one-half for the conventional (classical, distinguishable) coins. Bose's "error" leads to what is now called Bose–Einstein statistics.

Bose and Einstein extended the idea to atoms and this led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which became known as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], a dense collection of bosons (which are particles with integer spin, named after Bose), which was demonstrated to exist by experiment in 1995.

==Two derivations of the Bose–Einstein distribution==

=== Derivation from the grand canonical ensemble ===
The Bose–Einstein distribution, which applies only to a quantum system of non-interacting bosons, is easily derived from the [[grand canonical ensemble]].&lt;ref name="sriva7"&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Statistical Mechanics
 |last1=Srivastava |first1=R. K.
 |last2=Ashok |first2=J.

 |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.
 |chapter=Chapter 7  
 |isbn=9788120327825
 |location=[[New Delhi]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this ensemble, the system is able to exchange energy and exchange particles with a reservoir (temperature ''T'' and chemical potential ''µ'' fixed by the reservoir).

Due to the non-interacting quality, each available single-particle level (with energy level ''ϵ'') forms a separate thermodynamic system in contact with the reservoir.
In other words, each single-particle level is a separate, tiny grand canonical ensemble.
With bosons there is no limit on the number of particles ''N'' in the level, but due to [[indistinguishability]] each possible ''N'' corresponds to only one [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] (with energy ''Nϵ'').
The resulting partition function for that single-particle level therefore forms a [[geometric series]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}\mathcal Z &amp; = \sum_{N=0}^{\infty} \exp(N(\mu - \epsilon)/k_{\rm B} T) = \sum_{N=0}^\infty [\exp((\mu - \epsilon)/k_{\rm B}T)]^N \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{1 - \exp((\mu - \epsilon)/k_{\rm B} T)}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and the average particle number for that single-particle substate is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \langle N\rangle = k_{\rm B} T \frac{1}{\mathcal Z} \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal Z}{\partial \mu}\right)_{V,T} = \frac{1}{\exp((\epsilon-\mu)/k_{\rm B} T)-1} &lt;/math&gt;
This result applies for each single-particle level and thus forms the Bose–Einstein distribution for the entire state of the system.&lt;ref name="sriva6"&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Statistical Mechanics
 |chapter=Chapter 6  
 |isbn=9788120327825
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The BE distribution can be derived also from thermal field theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variance in particle number (due to [[thermal fluctuations]]) may also be derived:
:&lt;math&gt; \langle (\Delta N)^2 \rangle = k_{\rm B} T \left(\frac{d\langle N\rangle}{d\mu}\right)_{V,T} = \langle N^2\rangle - \langle N\rangle^2 &lt;/math&gt;
This level of fluctuation is much larger than for [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics|distinguishable particles]], which would instead show [[Poisson statistics]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\langle (\Delta N)^2 \rangle = \langle N\rangle^2\right) &lt;/math&gt;. The reason is that the [[probability distribution]] for the number of bosons in a given energy level is a [[geometric distribution]], not a [[Poisson distribution]].

=== Derivation in the canonical approach ===

It is also possible to derive approximate Bose–Einstein statistics in the [[canonical ensemble]].
These derivations are lengthy and only yield the above results in the asymptotic limit of a large number of particles.
The reason is that the total number of bosons is fixed in the canonical ensemble. The Bose–Einstein distribution in this case can be derived as in most texts by maximization, but the mathematically best derivation is by the [[Darwin–Fowler method]] of mean values as emphasized by Dingle.&lt;ref&gt;R.B.

Suppose we have a number of energy levels, labeled by index
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i&lt;/math&gt;, each level 
having energy &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; and containing a total of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt; particles.  Suppose each level contains 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g_i&lt;/math&gt;
distinct sublevels, all of which have the same energy, and which are distinguishable. For example, two particles may have different momenta, in which case they are distinguishable from each other, yet they can still have the same energy. 
The value of  
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g_i&lt;/math&gt; associated with level &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i&lt;/math&gt; is called the "degeneracy" of that energy level. Any number of bosons can occupy the same sublevel.

Let &lt;span id="w(n,g)"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be the number of ways of distributing
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; particles among the 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g&lt;/math&gt; sublevels of an energy level. There is only one way of distributing
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; particles with one sublevel, therefore 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,1)=1&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to see that
there are &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (n+1)&lt;/math&gt; ways of distributing
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; particles in two sublevels which we will write as:

:&lt;math&gt;
w(n,2)=\frac{(n+1)!}{n!1!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

With a little thought 
(see [[#Notes|Notes]] below) 
it can be seen that the number of ways of distributing
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; particles in three sublevels is

:&lt;math&gt;w(n,3) = w(n,2) + w(n-1,2) + \cdots + w(1,2) + w(0,2)
&lt;/math&gt;
so that

:&lt;math&gt;
w(n,3)=\sum_{k=0}^n w(n-k,2) = \sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(n-k+1)!}{(n-k)!1!}=\frac{(n+2)!}{n!2!}
&lt;/math&gt;

where we have used the following &lt;span id="theorem"&gt;theorem&lt;/span&gt; involving [[binomial coefficient]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(k+a)!}{k!a!}=\frac{(n+a+1)!}{n!(a+1)!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Continuing this process, we can see that 
&lt;span id="w(n,g)"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
is just a binomial coefficient
(See [[#Notes|Notes]] below)

:&lt;math&gt;
w(n,g)=\frac{(n+g-1)!}{n!(g-1)!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the population numbers for two particles in three sublevels are 200, 110, 101, 020, 011, or 002 for a total of six which equals 4!/(2!2!). The number of ways that a set of occupation numbers &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt; can be realized is the product of the ways that each individual energy level can be populated:

:&lt;math&gt;
W = \prod_i w(n_i,g_i) =  \prod_i \frac{(n_i+g_i-1)!}{n_i!(g_i-1)!}
\approx\prod_i \frac{(n_i+g_i)!}{n_i!(g_i)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the approximation assumes that &lt;math&gt;n_i \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Following the same procedure used in deriving the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]], we wish to find the set of  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt; for which  ''W'' is maximised, subject to the constraint that there be a fixed total number of particles, and a fixed total energy. The maxima of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \ln(W)&lt;/math&gt; occur at the same value of  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt; and, since it is easier to accomplish mathematically, we will maximise the latter function instead. We constrain our solution using [[Lagrange multipliers]] forming the function:

:&lt;math&gt;
f(n_i)=\ln(W)+\alpha(N-\sum n_i)+\beta(E-\sum n_i \varepsilon_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the &lt;math&gt;n_i \gg 1&lt;/math&gt; approximation and using [[Stirling's approximation]] for the factorials &lt;math&gt;\left(x!\approx x^x\,e^{-x}\,\sqrt{2\pi x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;f(n_i)=\sum_i (n_i + g_i) \ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \ln(n_i) +\alpha\left(N-\sum n_i\right)+\beta\left(E-\sum n_i \varepsilon_i\right)+K.&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''K'' is the sum of a number of terms which are not functions of the &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt;, and setting the result to zero and solving for  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n_i&lt;/math&gt;, yields the Bose–Einstein population numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;
n_i = \frac{g_i}{e^{\alpha+\beta \varepsilon_i}-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

By a process similar to that outlined in the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] article, it can be seen that:
:&lt;math&gt;d\ln W=\alpha\,dN+\beta\,dE&lt;/math&gt;

which, using Boltzmann's famous relationship &lt;math&gt;S=k_{\rm B}\,\ln W&lt;/math&gt; becomes a statement of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] at constant volume, and it follows that &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{k_{\rm B}T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = - \frac{\mu}{k_{\rm B}T}&lt;/math&gt; where ''S'' is the [[entropy]], &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[chemical potential]], ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the [[temperature]], so that finally:

:&lt;math&gt;
n_i = \frac{g_i}{e^{(\varepsilon_i-\mu)/k_{\rm B}T}-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the above formula is sometimes written:

:&lt;math&gt;
n_i = \frac{g_i}{e^{\varepsilon_i/k_{\rm B}T}/z-1},
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle z=\exp(\mu/k_{\rm B}T)&lt;/math&gt; 
is the absolute [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]], as noted by McQuarrie.&lt;ref&gt;See McQuarrie in citations&lt;/ref&gt;

Also note that when the particle numbers are not conserved, removing the conservation of particle numbers constraint is equivalent to setting &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the chemical potential &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to zero. This will be the case for photons and massive particles in mutual equilibrium and the resulting distribution will be the [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]].

A much simpler way to think of Bose–Einstein distribution function is to consider that '''n''' particles are denoted by identical balls and '''g shells are marked by g-1 line partitions.''' It is clear that the [[permutation#Permutations of multisets|permutation]]s of these '''n balls''' and '''g&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 partitions''' will give different ways of arranging bosons in different energy levels. Say, for 3 (=&amp;nbsp;''n'') particles and 3 (=&amp;nbsp;''g'') shells, therefore (''g''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the arrangement might be '''|●●|●''', or '''||●●●''', or '''|●|●● ''', etc. Hence the number of distinct permutations of n + (g-1) objects which have n identical items and (''g''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) identical items will be:

: &lt;math&gt;
    \frac{(g-1 + n)!}
   {(g-1)! n!}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''OR'''

The purpose of these notes is to clarify some aspects of the derivation of the Bose–Einstein (B–E) 
distribution for beginners.  The enumeration of cases (or ways) in the B–E distribution can be recast as 
follows.  Consider a game of dice throwing in which there are 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; dice, 
with each die taking values in the set 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \{ 1, \dots, g \}&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;g \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;.  
The constraints of the game are that the value of a die 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_i&lt;/math&gt;, has to be 
'''''greater than or equal to''''' the value of die 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (i-1)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;, in the previous throw, i.e., 
&lt;math&gt;m_i \ge m_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus a valid sequence of die throws can be described by an 
''n''-tuple 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle ( m_1 , m_2 , \dots , m_n)&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;m_i \ge m_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of these valid ''n''-tuples:

:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   S(n,g) = 
   \Big\{ 
      \left( m_1 , m_2 , \dots , m_n \right) 
      \Big| \Big.
      m_i \ge m_{i-1} ,
      m_i \in \left\{ 1,  \dots, g \right\} ,
      \forall i = 1, \dots , n 
   \Big\}.
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="width:5%" | (1)
|}

Then the quantity &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt; ([[#w(n,g)|defined above]] as the number of ways to distribute 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; particles among the 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g&lt;/math&gt; sublevels of an energy level) is the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the number of elements (or valid ''n''-tuples) in &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the problem of finding an expression for 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt; 
becomes the problem of counting the elements in &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
   S(4,3) =
   \left\{ 
      \underbrace{(1111), (1112), (1113)}_{(a)},
      \underbrace{(1122), (1123), (1133)}_{(b)},
      \underbrace{(1222), (1223), (1233), (1333)}_{(c)},
   \right.
&lt;/math&gt;
:::::&lt;math&gt;
   \left.
      \underbrace{(2222), (2223), (2233), (2333), (3333)}_{(d)}
   \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(4,3) = 15&lt;/math&gt; (there are &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 15&lt;/math&gt; elements in &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt;)
&lt;!--
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle S(4,3)
&lt;/math&gt;)
--&gt;

Subset 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (a)&lt;/math&gt;
is obtained by fixing all indices 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_i&lt;/math&gt; to 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 1&lt;/math&gt;, except for the last index, 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_n&lt;/math&gt;, which is incremented from 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 1&lt;/math&gt; to
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g=3&lt;/math&gt;.
Subset 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (b)&lt;/math&gt;
is obtained by fixing 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_1 = m_2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and incrementing 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_3&lt;/math&gt; from 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2&lt;/math&gt; to
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g=3&lt;/math&gt;.  Due to the constraint 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   m_i \ge m_{i-1}
&lt;/math&gt;
on the indices in 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;,
the index
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_4&lt;/math&gt; must 
automatically
take values in 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \left\{ 2, 3 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.
The construction of subsets
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (c)&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (d)&lt;/math&gt;
follows in the same manner.

Each element of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as a 
[[multiset]] 
of cardinality 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n=4&lt;/math&gt;; 
the elements of such multiset are taken from the set 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \left\{ 1, 2, 3 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
of cardinality 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g=3&lt;/math&gt;,
and the number of such multisets is the 
[[multiset#Multiset coefficients|multiset coefficient]]
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   \left\langle 
      \begin{matrix} 
	 3 
	 \\ 
	 4 
      \end{matrix}
   \right\rangle 
   = {3 + 4 - 1 \choose 3-1}
   = {3 + 4 - 1 \choose 4}
   =
   \frac
   {6!}
   {4! 2!}
   = 15
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, each element of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;
is a 
[[multiset]] 
of cardinality
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt;
(number of dice)
with elements taken from the set 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \left\{ 1, \dots, g \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
of cardinality 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g&lt;/math&gt;
(number of possible values of each die),
and the number of such multisets, i.e., 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;
is the 
[[multiset#Multiset coefficients|multiset coefficient]]
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(n,g) 
   =
   \left\langle 
      \begin{matrix} 
	 g 
	 \\ 
	 n 
      \end{matrix}
   \right\rangle 
   = {g + n - 1 \choose g-1}
   = {g + n - 1 \choose n}
   = 
   \frac{(g + n - 1)!}
   {n! (g-1)!}
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="width:5%" | (2)
|}
which is exactly the same as the 
[[#w(n,g)|formula]] for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle w(n,g)&lt;/math&gt;, as derived above with the aid
of
a [[#theorem|theorem]] involving binomial coefficients, namely

:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(k+a)!}{k!a!}=\frac{(n+a+1)!}{n!(a+1)!}.
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="width:5%" | (3)
|}

To understand the decomposition
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(n,g) 
   =
   \sum_{k=0}^n
   w(n-k, g-1)
   =
   w(n, g-1)
   +
   w(n-1, g-1)
   +
   \cdots
   +
   w(1, g-1)
   +
   w(0, g-1)
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="width:5%" | (4)
|}
or for example, 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n=4&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g=3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(4,3)
   =
   w(4,2)
   +
   w(3,2)
   +
   w(2,2)
   +
   w(1,2)
   +
   w(0,2),
&lt;/math&gt;

let us rearrange the elements of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt; as follows
:&lt;math&gt;
   S(4,3) =
   \left\{ 
      \underbrace{
	 (1111), 
	 (1112), 
	 (1122), 
	 (1222), 
	 (2222)
      }_{(\alpha)},
      \underbrace{
	 (111{\color{Red}{\underset{=}{3}}}),
	 (112{\color{Red}{\underset{=}{3}}}), 
	 (122{\color{Red}{\underset{=}{3}}}), 
	 (222{\color{Red}{\underset{=}{3}}}) 
      }_{(\beta)},
   \right.
&lt;/math&gt;
:::::&lt;math&gt;
   \left.
      \underbrace{
	 (11{\color{Red}{\underset{==}{33}}}),
	 (12{\color{Red}{\underset{==}{33}}}), 
	 (22{\color{Red}{\underset{==}{33}}}) 
      }_{(\gamma)},
      \underbrace{
	 (1{\color{Red}{\underset{===}{333}}}),
	 (2{\color{Red}{\underset{===}{333}}}) 
      }_{(\delta)}
      \underbrace{
	 ({\color{Red}{\underset{====}{3333}}})
      }_{(\omega)}
   \right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, the subset
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt;
is the same as the set
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   S(4,2)
   =
   \left\{ 
	 (1111), 
	 (1112), 
	 (1122), 
	 (1222), 
	 (2222)
   \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;.

By deleting the index 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_4=3&lt;/math&gt;
(shown in &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red with double underline&lt;/span&gt;)
in
the subset 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt;,
one obtains
the set
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   S(3,2)
   =
   \left\{ 
	 (111),
	 (112), 
	 (122), 
	 (222) 
   \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subset
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
of 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(4,3)&lt;/math&gt;
and the set
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(3,2)&lt;/math&gt;.  We write
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   (\beta)
   \longleftrightarrow
   S(3,2)
&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, it is easy to see that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   (\gamma)
   \longleftrightarrow
   S(2,2)
   =
   \left\{ 
	 (11),
	 (12), 
	 (22) 
   \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   (\delta)
   \longleftrightarrow
   S(1,2)
   =
   \left\{ 
	 (1),
	 (2) 
   \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   (\omega)
   \longleftrightarrow
   S(0,2)
   =
   \varnothing
&lt;/math&gt; (empty set).

Thus we can write 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   S(4,3) 
   =
   \bigcup_{k=0}^{4}
   S(4-k,2)
&lt;/math&gt;

or more generally,
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   S(n,g) 
   =
   \bigcup_{k=0}^{n}
   S(n-k,g-1)
&lt;/math&gt;;
| style="width:5%" | (5)
|}
and since the sets 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   S(i,g-1) \ , \ {\rm for} \ i = 0, \dots , n
&lt;/math&gt;
are non-intersecting, we thus have
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(n,g) 
   =
   \sum_{k=0}^{n}
   w(n-k,g-1)
&lt;/math&gt;,
| style="width:5%" | (6)
|}
with the convention that
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(0,g)
   =
   1 \ , \forall g
   \ ,
   {\rm and}
   \ 
   w(n,0)
   =
   1 \ , \forall n
&lt;/math&gt;.
| style="width:5%" | (7)
|}
Continuing the process, we arrive at the following formula
:&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(n,g) 
   =
   \sum_{k_1=0}^{n}
   \sum_{k_2=0}^{n-k_1}
   w(n - k_1 - k_2, g-2)
   =
   \sum_{k_1=0}^{n}
   \sum_{k_2=0}^{n-k_1}
   \cdots
   \sum_{k_g=0}^{n-\sum_{j=1}^{g-1} k_j}
   w(n - \sum_{i=1}^{g} k_i, 0).
&lt;/math&gt;
Using the convention (7)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; above, we obtain the formula
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" | 
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   w(n,g) 
   =
   \sum_{k_1=0}^{n}
   \sum_{k_2=0}^{n-k_1}
   \cdots
   \sum_{k_g=0}^{n-\sum_{j=1}^{g-1} k_j}
   1,
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="width:5%" | (8)
|}

keeping in mind that for 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q&lt;/math&gt;
and 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle p&lt;/math&gt;
being constants, we have
:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%"  |
&lt;math&gt;
   \displaystyle 
   \sum_{k=0}^{q}
   p
   =
   q p
&lt;/math&gt;.
| style= | (9)
|}

It can then be verified that (8) and (2) give the same result for

==Interdisciplinary applications==

Viewed as a pure [[probability distribution]], the Bose–Einstein distribution has found application in other fields:

* In recent years, Bose Einstein statistics have also been used as a method for term weighting in [[information retrieval]]. The method is one of a collection of DFR ("Divergence From Randomness") models,&lt;ref name=bia1&gt;Amati, G.; C. J. Van Rijsbergen (2002). "[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=582416 Probabilistic models of information retrieval based on measuring the divergence from randomness ]" ''[[ACM Transactions on Information Systems|ACM TOIS]]'' '''20'''(4):357–389.&lt;/ref&gt; the basic notion being that Bose Einstein statistics may be a useful indicator in cases where a particular term and a particular document have a significant relationship that would not have occurred purely by chance. Source code for implementing this model is available from the [http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/terrier/doc/dfr_description.html Terrier project] at the University of Glasgow.
* {{Main article|Bose–Einstein condensation (network theory)}} The evolution of many complex systems, including the [[World Wide Web]], business, and citation networks, is encoded in the dynamic web describing the interactions between the system's constituents. Despite their irreversible and nonequilibrium nature these networks follow Bose statistics and can undergo Bose–Einstein condensation. Addressing the dynamical properties of these nonequilibrium systems within the framework of equilibrium quantum gases predicts that the "first-mover-advantage," "fit-get-rich('''FGR''')," and "winner-takes-all" phenomena observed in competitive systems are thermodynamically distinct phases of the underlying evolving networks.&lt;ref name=bia2&gt;Bianconi, G.;  Barabási, A.-L. (2001). "[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v86/i24/p5632_1 Bose–Einstein Condensation in Complex Networks.]" ''[[Physical Review Letters|Phys. Rev. Lett.]]'' '''86''': 5632–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law and his wife Margaret Pestorius coordinated the Cairns Peace by Peace organisation.&lt;ref name="cairnspeacebypeace.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairnspeacebypeace.org/|title=Peace by Peace – We aren't gunna study war no more!|author=|date=|website=www.cairnspeacebypeace.org|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law also disrupted logging activities on the [[World Heritage site]] [[Fraser Island]].

==Early life==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Law was born in 1954 in the [[Brisbane]] suburb of Moorooka. Both his parents served in the army during World War II, His father in [[New Guinea]] and his mother in [[Townsville]]. Law attended [[Yeronga State School|Yeronga State High School]], excelling in the sciences. He attended the [[University of Queensland]], studying chemistry briefly before dropping out. He then worked briefly for the Education Department as a clerk. He subsequently drove taxis for 15 years in Cairns. In his thirties Law returned to Griffith University to study history and politics with a special interest in Asia and Pacific history and regional militarism. He was a campus activist and became President of the Student Union.

==Activism==
Law was radicalised during the government of [[Joh Bjelke Petersen]] and was first arrested at a large right to march street demonstration in Brisbane. He was arrested more than 30 times. Law blogged widely. He had ambitions to become a lawyer but felt he came from the wrong class at the wrong time. He revelled in the intellectual stimulation offered by the court room process. He was acknowledged by judges, barristers and adversaries as an honourable challenger. [[Ciaron O'Reilly|Ciaron O’Reilly]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the thousands arrested and bashed during that period, some of us remained "beat up but upbeat" turning towards, exploring and sustaining nonviolent resistance against war and war preparations. As some turned towards the U.S. traditions of the Catholic Worker and Berrigans, Law turned to a deep exploration of Gandhi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his later years the [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker tradition]] also influenced Law’s approach to nonviolence.

Between 1982 and the mid-2000s, Law worked on a range of campaigns and was judged by colleagues{{who|date=May 2016}} as the "foremost nonviolence strategist in Australia."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} He applied nonviolence theory and techniques to local, regional and national projects. Campaigns he was involved with included [[Indigenous rights|Aboriginal rights]], which he initially explored in relation to the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982. He lived on Fraser Island during the blockade to interrupt logging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webdiary.com.au/cms/?q=node/858|title=Webdiary - Founded and Inspired by Margo Kingston - Webdiary - Independent, Ethical, Accountable and Transparent|author=|date=|website=webdiary.com.au|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in local issues such as improving bicycle facilities, the  Cairns Yacht Club and most recently the "Save City Place" campaign in Cairns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2008/10/16/10631_print-version.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a keen interest in opposing militarism and this became his primary passion. As an antimilitarist activist he first opposed visits of US and UK warships to Australia during the Bicentennial. It was during this time he started to explore the power of small group nonviolence. He teamed up with fellow nonviolent activist Margaret Pestorius and they followed their shared passion of educating ordinary people about the practice of nonviolence. With the  Cairns Peace by Peace group they began citizens' inspections of visiting US warships at a time when Law considered Australia was in a state of perpetual war.&lt;ref name="cairnspeacebypeace.org"/&gt; In 2005 he entered Pine Gap spy base near Alice Springs with three other people from Christians Against All Terrorism. This action was a turning point in Law's pursuit of more powerful types of activity and ultimately led to his His work culminated fittingly{{how|date=May 2016}} in the regional Queensland town of Rockhampton at a time when most{{who|date=May 2016}} looked toward Canberra and Washington for political change. decision to conduct a  ploughshare type action in Rockhampton during the 2011 Talisman Sabre Exercises.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

== Personal life ==
During the court case in Alice Springs in 2007 he probably{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} had his first heart attack and his health declined consistently from that point. He struggled with diabetes and heart disease and their consequences.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Law and Margaret Pestorius had a son, Joseph.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

'''Cat intelligence''' is the capacity of the [[cat|domesticated cat]] to solve problems and adapt to its environment. Researchers have also shown feline intelligence to include the ability to acquire new behavior that applies previously learned knowledge to new situations, communicating needs and desires within a social group, and responding to training cues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Analyses of cat brains have shown they are divided into many areas with specialized tasks that are extremely interconnected and share sensory information in a kind of [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke network]], with a large number of specialized hubs and many alternative paths between them. This exchange of sensory information allows the brain to construct a complex perception of the real world and to react to and manipulate its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fnins.2011.00083 |title=Exploring Brain Function from Anatomical Connectivity |year=2011 |last1=Kurths |first1=Jürgen |last2=Zhou |first2=Changsong |last3=Zamora-López |first3=Gorka |journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience |volume=5 |pmid=21734863 |pages=83 |pmc=3124130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brain and diet ===
{{Further|Cat food|Cat cognitive support diets}}
A cognitive support diet for felines is a food that is formulated to improve mental processes like attention, short and long-term memory, learning, and problem solving. Claims for cognitive support appear on a number of kitten formulations to help with brain development, as well as diets aimed at seniors to help prevent cognitive disorders. These diets typically focus on supplying [[Omega-3 fatty acid]]s, [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s, [[taurine]], vitamins, and other supporting supplements that have positive effects on cognition.

The omega-3 fatty acids are a key nutrient in cognition for felines. They are essential for felines as they cannot be synthesized naturally and must be obtained from the diet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Covington|first=MB.|date=2004|title=Omega-3 Fatty Acids|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0701/p133.html#|journal=American Family Physician|volume=70|pages=133–140|via=American Family Physician}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids that support brain development and function are [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]], [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fish oils, fish and other marine sources provide a very rich source of DHA and EPA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alpha-linolenic acid can be acquired from oils and seeds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Omega-6 fatty acids are also needed in feline cognition diets. The important omega-6 fatty acid that plays a role in brain support and cognition is [[arachidonic acid]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer EB.|first=|date=2006|title=Metabolic basis for the essential nature of fatty acids and the unique dietary fatty acid requirement of cats.|url=|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=229 | issue = 11 |pages=1729–32|via=|doi=10.2460/javma.229.11.1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arachidonic acid or AA is found in animal sources such as meat and eggs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; AA is required in cat diets, as felines convert insignificant amounts of it from linoleic acid due to the limited delta-6 desaturase.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biagi G., Moedenti A. and Cocchi M.|first=|date=2004|title=The role of dietary omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids in the nutrition of dogs and cat: A review.|url=|journal=Progress in Nutrition|volume=6 | issue = 2 |pages=1–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like DHA, arachidonic acid is often found in the brain tissues of cats and seems to have a supporting role in brain function.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In a 2000 study completed by Contreras ''et al.'', it was found that DHA and AA made up 20% of the fatty acids in the mammalian brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coutreras MA., Greiner RS., Chang MC., Myers CS., Salem N JR. and Rapoport SI|first=|date=2000|title=Nutritional deprivation of alpha-linolenic acid decreases but does not abolish turnover and availability of unacylated docosahexaenoic acid and docosahexaenoyl-CoA in rat brain.|url=|journal=Journal of Neurochemistry|volume=75|pages=2392–400.|via=|doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.2000.0752392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arachidonic acid makes up high amounts in the membrane of most cells and has many pro-inflammatory actions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Taurine]] is an amino acid, which is essential in cat diets due to their low capacity to synthesize it. Because taurine has the ability to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] in the brain, it has been found to have a role in many neurological functions, especially in the visual development.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturman JA., Lu P., Xu Y. and Imaki H.

In controlled experiments, cats showed that they had fully developed concepts of [[object permanence]], meaning that sensorimotor intelligence is completely developed in cats. For human infants, tests involving multiple invisible displacements of an object are used to assess the beginning of mental representation in the sixth and last stage of sensorimotor intelligence. The cats' searches on these tasks were consistent with representation of an unsensed object and fully developed sensorimotor intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1981|title=Object permanence in cats and dogs|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03212035|journal=Animal Learning &amp; Behavior|volume=9|issue=1|pages=135–139|doi=10.3758/bf03212035 | last1 = Triana | first1 = Estrella}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1995|title=Human Analog Tests of the Sixth Stage of Object Permanence|url=http://pms.sagepub.com/content/80/3_suppl/1059.refs|journal=Percept Mot Skills|volume=80|issue=3 !pages=1059-1068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working memory for [[object permanence]] of the domesticated cat is surmised from experiment as being of 16 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fiset|first1=Sylvain|last2=Doré|first2=François Y.|year=2006|title=Duration of cats' (Felis catus) working memory for disappearing objects|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=9|issue=1|pages=62–70|doi=10.1007/s10071-005-0005-4|pmid=16133631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More negative results were obtained in an experiment conducted in 2009 where cats could pull on a string to retrieve a treat under a plastic screen. When presented with one string, cats had no trouble getting the treats, but when presented with multiple strings, some of which were not connected to treats, the cats were unable to consistently choose the correct strings, leading to the conclusion that cats do not understand cause and effect in the same way that humans do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/social-applied-sciences/applied-social-sciences/staff/Britta-Osthaus/ B.

Taken as a whole, cats have excellent [[memories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feline Intelligence|url=http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/cat-intelligence/|website=Animal Planet|quote=Once attained, even if by accident or trial and error, most knowledge is retained for life, thanks to the cat's excellent memory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In experimental conditions, the memory of a cat was demonstrated as having an information-retention or recall, of a duration totalling as much as 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catsinternational.org/articles/training/the_intelligent_cat.html|title=The Intelligent Cat|publisher=Cats International|access-date=24 January 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67mDoL8qM?url=http://www.catsinternational.org/articles/training/the_intelligent_cat.html#|archive-date=19 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, relationships with humans, individual differences in [[intelligence]], and age may all affect memory. Cats easily adapt to their current environment because they can adapt their memories of past environments throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Stock, Judith A.

=== In kittens ===
The period during which the cat is a [[kitten]] is the time when the cat learns and memorizes survival skills, which are acquired through observation of their mothers and playing with other cats. Playing, in fact, constitutes more than fun for a kitten, for it is essential for ranking social order, building hunting skills, and generally exercising for the adult roles.

The first two to seven weeks are a particularly critical time for kittens, for it is during this period that they bond with other cats. It has been suspected that without any human contact during this time, the cat would forever mistrust humans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== In older cats ===
Just as in humans, advancing age may affect [[Memory and aging|memory]] in cats. Some cats may experience a weakening of both learning ability and memory that affects them adversely in ways similar to those occurring in poorly aging humans. A slowing of function is normal, and this includes memory. Aging may affect memory by changing the way their brain stores information and by making it harder to recall stored information. Cats lose brain cells as they age, just as humans do.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Memory Loss With Aging. Family Doctor. 22 January 1996. Web. 24 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The older the cat, the more these changes can affect its memory. There have been no studies done on the memories of aging cats, but there is some speculation that, just like people, [[short-term memory]] is more affected by aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Cats Have Long-Term Memory?|url=http://pets.thenest.com/cats-longterm-memory-8646.html|website=The Nest|quote=As Kitty ages, his brain function will decline.

=== Diseases ===
Disease, such as [[feline cognitive dysfunction]] (FCD) – a condition similar to [[Alzheimer's disease]] in humans – could also affect cat memory. Symptoms of FCD include disorientation, reduced social interaction, sleep disturbances, and loss of house training. FCD causes degenerative changes in the brain that are the source of the functional impairment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

== Learning capacities ==
{{See also|Animal cognition}}
[[Edward Thorndike]] conducted some key experiments on cat's learning capacity. In one of Thorndike's experiments, cats were placed in various boxes approximately 20&amp;nbsp;inches long, 15&amp;nbsp;inches wide, and 12&amp;nbsp;inches tall with a door opened by pulling a weight attached to it. The cats were observed to free themselves from the boxes by "[[trial and error]] with accidental success."&lt;ref name="thorndike" /&gt;&lt;ref name="psychology-cengage"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.Bernstein |author2=L.

== Domestication effects ==

Cat intelligence study is mostly from consideration of the [[Domestication of animals|domesticated]] cat. The process of domestication has allowed for closer observation of cat behaviour and in the increased incidence of interspecies communication,&lt;ref&gt;Boone 1956{{verify source|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1980{{verify source|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the inherent plasticity of the cat's brain has become apparent as the number of studies in this have increased scientific insight.

A '''compressed earth block''' ('''CEB'''), also known as a ''pressed earth block'' or a ''compressed soil block'', is a [[building material]] made primarily from damp [[soil]] compressed at high pressure to form blocks. Compressed earth blocks use a mechanical press to form blocks out of an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic [[subsoil]], non-expansive [[clay]] and [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as [[Portland cement]] they are called ''compressed stabilized earth block'' (CSEB) or ''stabilized earth block'' (SEB). Typically, around {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} is applied in compression, and the original soil volume is reduced by about half.

Creating CEBs differs from [[rammed earth]] in that the latter uses a larger formwork into which earth is poured and manually tamped down, creating larger forms such as a whole wall or more at one time rather than building blocks. CEBs differ from [[mud brick]]s in that the latter are not compressed and solidify through chemical changes that take place as they air dry. The compression strength of properly made CEB can meet or exceed that of typical cement or mud brick. Building standards have been developed for CEB.

CEBs are assembled onto walls using standard [[bricklaying]] and [[masonry]] techniques. The [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] may be a simple [[slurry]] made of the same soil/clay mix without aggregate, spread or brushed very thinly between the blocks for bonding, or cement mortar may also be used for high strength, or when construction during freeze-thaw cycles causes stability issues. [[Hydraform block]]s are shaped to be interlocking.

==Development==
CEB technology has been developed  for low-cost construction, as an alternative to adobe, and with some advantages.  A commercial industry has been advanced by eco-friendly contractors, manufacturers of the mechanical presses, and by cultural acceptance of the method.  In the [[United States]], most general contractors building with CEB are in the Southwestern states: [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], and to a lesser extent in [[Texas]].  The methods and presses have been used for many years in [[Mexico]], and in [[developing countries]].

The [[South Africa]]n Department of Water Affairs and Forestry considers that CEB, locally called "'''Dutch brick'''" is an appropriate technology for a developing country, as are adobe, rammed earth and cob. All use natural building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=6|url=http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Masibambane/documents/civil/CrossCuttingFeb08.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Critical Sustainability Pillars for service delivery in the Water Sector|publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 the International Institute for Energy Conservation was one of the winners of a [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]] for a project to make an energy-efficient Dutch brick-making machine for home construction in South Africa. By making cheaper bricks that use earth, the project would reduce housing costs while stimulating the building industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/29725/south-africa-poverty-reduction-winners|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=SOUTH AFRICA: Poverty reduction winners|publisher=IRIN|date=11 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The machine would be mobile, allowing bricks to be made locally from earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbdm/idea/housing-and-jobs-better-future|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Housing and Jobs for a Better Future|publisher=[[World Bank]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of CEB production machines exist, from manual to semi-automated and fully automated,  with increasing capital-investment and production rates, and decreased labor.  Automated machines are more common in the developed world, and manual machines in the developing world.

==Advantages==
There are many advantages of the CEB system.   On-site materials can be used, which reduces cost, minimizes shipping costs for materials, and increases efficiency and sustainability.  The wait-time required to obtain materials is minimal, because after the blocks are pressed, materials are available very soon after a short drying period.  The uniformity of the blocks simplifies construction, and minimizes or eliminates the need for mortar, thus reducing both the labor and materials costs.  The blocks are strong, stable, water-resistant and long-lasting.
* CEB can be pressed from damp earth. Because it is not wet, the drying time is much shorter. Some soil conditions permit the blocks to go straight from the press onto the wall. A single mechanical press can produce from 800 to over 5,000 blocks per day, enough to build a {{convert|1200|sqft|m2}} house in one day.   A high performance CEB press, of [[open source]] design, named "The Liberator", can produce from 8,000 to 17,000 or more blocks per day.  The production rate is limited more by the ability to get material into the machine, than the machine itself.
* Shipping cost: Suitable soils are often available at or near the construction site. [[Adobe]] and CEB are of similar weight, but distance from a source supply gives CEB an advantage.  Also, CEB can be made available in places where adobe manufacturing operations are non-existent.
* Uniformity: CEB can be manufactured to a predictable size and has true flat sides and 90-degree angle edges.  This makes design and costing easier.  This also provides the contractor the option of making the exteriors look like conventional [[stucco]] houses. 
* Presses allow blocks to be consistently made of uniform size, while also obtaining strengths that exceed the ASTM standard for concrete blocks (1900 psi).
* Non-toxic:  materials are completely natural, non-toxic, and do not out-gas
* Sound resistant:  an important feature in high-density neighborhoods, residential areas adjacent to industrial zones
* Fire resistant:  earthen walls do not burn
* Insect resistant: Insects are discouraged because the walls are solid and very dense, and have no food value
* [[Mold]] resistant:  there is no cellulose material - such as in wood, [[Oriented Strand Board]] or [[drywall]] - that can host [[mold]] or rot
* In India, CSEB's with cement stabilization have shown to be very beneficial. The observed compressive strength, flexural strength at 28 days of aging with 9% cement stabilization has been observed to be 3.2 MPa and 1 MPa respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267637559|accessdate=2014-11-11|title=Effect Of Varying Cement Proportions On Properties Of Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEB) - A Sustainable Low-Cost Housing Material|publisher=DOI: 10.13140/2.1.4966.4963 Conference: International Conference on Sustainable Civil Infrastructure, ASCE India Section 17–18 October 2014, At Hyderabad, India, Volume: pg 1000-1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presses==
CEB had very limited use prior to the 1980s. It was known in the 1950s in [[South America]], where one of the most well-known presses, the [[Cinva Ram]], was developed by Raul Ramirez in the Inter-American Housing Center (CINVA) in Bogota, Colombia.  The Cinva Ram is a single-block, manual-press that uses a long, hand-operated lever to drive a [[cam]], generating high pressure.

Industrial manufacturers produce much larger machines that run with diesel or gasoline engines and hydraulic presses that receive the soil/aggregate mixture through a hopper. This is fed into a chamber to create a block that is then ejected onto a conveyor.

During the 1980s, soil-pressing technology became widespread. [[France]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[South Africa]] and [[Switzerland]] began to write standards. The [[Peace Corps]], [[USAID]], [[Habitat for Humanity]] and other programs began to implement it into housing projects.

==Finishing==
Completed walls require either a reinforced bond beam or a ring beam on top or between floors and if the blocks are not stabilized, a plaster finish, usually stucco wire/stucco cement and/or lime plaster. Stabilized blocks can be left exposed with no outer plaster finish. In tropical environments, polycarbonate varnish is often used to provide an additional layer of wet-weather protection.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Foundations==
Standards for foundations are similar to those for brick walls. A CEB wall is heavy. Footings must be at least 10&amp;nbsp;inches thick, with a minimum width that is 33 percent greater than the wall width. If a stem wall is used, it shall extend to an elevation not less than eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  above the exterior finish grade. Rubble-filled foundation trench designs with a reinforced concrete grade beam above are allowed to support CEB construction.

==Strength==
Using the [[ASTM]] D1633-00 stabilization standard, a pressed and cured block must be submerged in water for four hours. It is then pulled from the water and immediately subjected to a compression test. The blocks must score at least a 300 [[pound-force per square inch]] (p.s.i) (2 MPa) minimum.  This is a higher standard than for adobe, which must score an ''average'' of at least 300 p.s.i. (2 MPa)

'''Deep space exploration''' (or '''deep-space exploration''') is the branch of [[astronomy]], [[astronautics]] and [[space technology]] that is involved with exploring the distant regions of [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/education/space_ex/exploration.html |title=Space and its Exploration: How Space is Explored |work=NASA.gov |accessdate=2009-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702153058/http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/education/space_ex/exploration.html |archivedate=2009-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical [[space exploration|exploration of space]] is conducted both by [[human spaceflight]]s (deep-space astronautics) and by [[robotic spacecraft]].

==Current research==

In 2012, the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] announced the award of $500,000 to former astronaut [[Mae Jemison]] to fund a project with the goal of sending future astronauts out of the Solar System. Jemison aims to increase public interest in future deep space exploration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vastag |first=Brian |title=Starship dreamers launch 100-year mission with DARPA grant |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/starship-dreamers-launch-100-year-mission-with-darpa-grant/2012/05/22/gIQA2k8wiU_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon awarding the money to Jemison, a "[[100 Year Starship]]" symposium was held in [[Houston, Texas]] to discuss interstellar travel. Topics discussed include "time-distance solutions; life sciences in space exploration; destinations and habitats; becoming an interstellar civilization; space technologies enhancing life on earth; and commercial opportunities from interstellar efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=Interstellar Starship Meeting Warps Into Houston This Week|url=http://www.space.com/17507-interstellar-space-travel-100-year-starship.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in deep space is ongoing and rapidly developing. In 2011, after the retirement of the [[space shuttle]], NASA announced its intentions to invest money into developing three technologies vital to deep space exploration. The "must-have technologies" include a deep space atomic clock, a large solar sail and a more advanced laser communications system to improve communication, navigation, and propulsion in future missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wall|first=Mike|title=NASA Picks 3 Pioneering Technologies for Deep Space Travel|url=http://www.space.com/12697-nasa-space-technology-demonstration-missions.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, NASA announced the selection of eight American astronauts that will begin to train for future deep space missions beyond low Earth orbit.

The Single Aperture Far-Infrared Observatory ([[SAFIR]]), a proposed cryogenic space telescope, is tentatively set to launch in 2015 with the hopes of exploring "the formation of the first stars and galaxies" in deep space. The telescope will be more than 1000 times more sensitive than two current telescope spacecrafts, the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and the [[Herschel Space Observatory]]. NASA hopes to use SAFIR to learn about black holes, [[galaxy formation and evolution]] and the formation of [[star system]]s in the far reaches of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SAFIR - Single Aperture Far Infrared Observatory |url=http://safir.jpl.nasa.gov/index.shtml |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deferred sentence''' is a sentence that is suspended until after a defendant has completed a period of [[probation]]. If the defendant fulfills the stipulations surrounding probation, a judge may then throw out the sentence and guilty plea, clearing the incident from their record. If the defendant violates probation, he or she must serve the full sentence immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deferred Sentence|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/deferred-sentence|website=USLegal|publisher=US Legal, Inc.|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, a defendant must plead guilty to at least one of the crimes he or she is accused of in order to receive a deferred sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Sentencing in Criminal Cases - Fines, Probation and Jail|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/sentences.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of a deferred sentence is often traded in exchange for a guilty plea in [[plea bargain]]s.

Deferred sentences are often given to first time offenders, or to those who have committed relatively minor crimes, although ultimately, the choice to defer a sentence is left to a judge's discretion.

===New York===
{{main|Adjournment in contemplation of dismissal}}
In the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], a similar process is known as [[adjournment in contemplation of dismissal]] (ACOD).  What typically happens in such a case is that the potential sentence is deferred for six months, and if the defendant stays out of trouble, the charge is dropped entirely with no public record of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal Information Sheet|url=http://nassau18b.org/forms/adjournment_in_contemplation_of_dismissal.pdf|website=Nassau County New York  Assigned Counsel Defender Plan|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deferred sentence is not exactly the same as an ACOD. One of the primary differences is that receiving an ACOD doesn't require an admission of guilt or plea of guilty unlike a deferred sentence which requires such. Upon completion of the ACOD, the charges are automatically sealed, fingerprints &amp; mugshots are destroyed, and the arrest is annulled. There is no conviction and all rights you had prior to arrest are restored. In order to enter the deferred sentence program, a plea of guilt must be made. Even though successful completion of a deferred sentence results in a dismissal of charges and guilty plea withdrawal, most states still consider it to be a conviction since a plea of guilt was entered and you were considered "convicted" for the duration of the program. Furthermore, completion of a deferred sentence program usually requires a request to the court to have the underlying charges and arrest sealed.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Generally, the terms ''equality of opportunity'' and ''equal opportunity'' are interchangeable, with occasional slight variations; the former has more of a sense of being an abstract political concept while "equal opportunity" is sometimes used as an adjective, usually in the context of employment regulations, to identify an employer, a hiring approach, or law. Equal opportunity provisions have been written into regulations and have been debated in courtrooms.&lt;ref name=twsH44&gt;{{cite news

[[File:FactoryProcessing.png|thumb|In a factory setting, equality of opportunity is often seen as a procedural fairness along the lines of "if you assemble twice as many lamps, you'll be paid double" and in this sense the concept is in contrast to the concept of [[equality of outcome]], which might require that all workers be paid similarly regardless of how many lamps they made]]
According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', the concept assumes that society is stratified with a diverse range of roles, some of which are more desirable than others.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; The benefit of equality of opportunity is to bring fairness to the selection process for coveted roles in [[corporations]], [[Voluntary association|associations]], [[nonprofit organizations|nonprofits]], [[universities]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=twsL11&gt;{{citation

[[#Formal equality of opportunity|Formal equality of opportunity]] is a lack of (unfair) direct discrimination. It requires that deliberate discrimination be relevant and meritocratic. For instance, job interviews should only discriminate against applicants for job incompetence. Universities should not accept a less-capable applicant instead of a more-capable applicant who can't pay tuition.

[[#Substantive equality of opportunity|Substantive equality of opportunity]] is absence of indirect discrimination. It requires that society be fair and meritocratic. For instance, a person should not be more likely to die at work because they were born in a country with corrupt labor law enforcement. No one should have to drop out of school because their family needs of a full-time carer or wage earner.

Formal equality of opportunity does not imply substantive equality of opportunity. Firing any employee who gets pregnant is formally equal, but substantively it hurts women more.

Substantive inequality is often more difficult to address. A political party that formally allows anyone to join, but meets in a non-wheelchair-accessible building far from public transit, substantively discriminates against both young and old members as they are less likely to be able-bodied car-owners. However, if the party raises membership dues in order to afford a better building, it discourages poor members instead. Grade-cutoff university admission is formally fair, but if in practice it overwhelmingly picks women and graduates of expensive user-fee schools, it is substantively unfair to men and the poor. The unfairness has already taken place and the university can choose to try to counterbalance it, but it likely can not single-handedly make pre-university opportunities equal. [[Social mobility]] and the [[Great Gatsby curve]] are often used as an indicator of substantive equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"&gt;https://milescorak.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/income-inequality-equality-of-opportunity-and-intergenerational-mobility.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Both equality concepts say that it is unfair and inefficient if extraneous factors rule people's lives. Both accept as fair inequality based on relevant, meritocratic factors. They differ in the scope of the methods used to promote them.

Formal equality of opportunity&lt;ref name=twsL18/&gt; is sometimes referred to as the nondiscrimination principle&lt;ref name=twsH74/&gt; or described as the absence of direct discrimination,&lt;ref name=twsL18/&gt; or described in the narrow sense as equality of access.&lt;ref name=twsL18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cashmore, Ellis, Dictionary of Race and Ethnic Relations, London: Routledge, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by:
# Open call. Positions bringing superior advantages should be open to all applicants&lt;ref name=twsL21/&gt; and job openings should be publicized in advance giving applicants a "reasonable opportunity" to apply. Further, all applications should be accepted.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;
# Fair judging. Applications should be judged on their merits,&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; with procedures designed to identify those best-qualified.&lt;ref name=twsL21/&gt; The evaluation of the applicant should be in accord with the duties of the position and for the job opening of choir director, for example, the evaluation may judge applicants based on musical knowledge rather than some arbitrary criterion such as hair color.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;
# An application is chosen. The applicant judged as "most qualified" is offered the position while others are not. There is agreement that the result of the process is again unequal, in the sense that one person has the position while another does not, but that this outcome is deemed fair on procedural grounds.

The formal approach is seen as a somewhat basic "no frills" or "narrow"&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; approach to equality of opportunity, a minimal standard of sorts, limited to the [[public sphere]] as opposed to private areas such as the [[family]], [[marriage]], or [[religion]].&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; What is considered "fair" and "unfair" is spelled out in advance.&lt;ref name=twsL17&gt;{{cite news

In the substantive approach, the starting point before the race begins is unfair since people have had differing experiences before even approaching the competition. The substantive approach examines the applicants themselves before applying for a position and judges whether they have equal abilities or talents; and if not, then it suggests that authorities (usually the government) take steps to make applicants more equal before they get to the point where they compete for a position and fixing the before-the-starting-point issues has sometimes been described as working towards "fair access to qualifications".&lt;ref name=twsL21/&gt; It seeks to remedy inequalities perhaps because of an "unfair disadvantage" based sometimes on "prejudice in the past".&lt;ref name=twsL23/&gt;

According to John Hills, children of wealthy and well-connected parents usually have a decisive advantage over other types of children and he notes that "advantage and disadvantage reinforce themselves over the life cycle, and often on to the next generation" so that successful parents pass along their wealth and education to succeeding generations, making it difficult for others to climb up a social ladder.&lt;ref name=twsH14&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Daiane Conterato2 crop.jpg|thumb|Issues about equal opportunity have been raised about the skin color of runway models at the [[São Paulo Fashion Week]] and in 2009 quotas requiring that at least 10 per cent of models be "black or indigenous" were imposed as a substantive way to counteract a "bias towards white models", according to one account&lt;ref name=twsH43/&gt;]]
In a sense, substantive equality of opportunity moves the "starting point" further back in time. Sometimes it entails the use of [[affirmative action]] policies to help all contenders become equal before they get to the starting point, perhaps with greater training, or sometimes redistributing resources via [[restitution]] or [[taxation]] to make the contenders more equal. It holds that all who have a "genuine opportunity to become qualified" be given a chance to do so and it is sometimes based on a recognition that unfairness exists, hindering [[social mobility]], combined with a sense that the unfairness should not exist or should be lessened in some manner.&lt;ref name=twsH13&gt;{{cite news

The substantive approach tends to have a broader definition of extraneous circumstances which should be kept out of a hiring decision. One editorial writer suggested that among the many types of extraneous circumstances which should be kept out of hiring decisions was personal beauty, sometimes termed "[[lookism]]": {{quote|Lookism judges individuals by their physical allure rather than abilities or merit.

The substantive position was advocated by [[Bhikhu Parekh]] in 2000 in ''Rethinking Multiculturalism'', in which he wrote that "all citizens should enjoy equal opportunities to acquire the capacities and skills needed to function in society and to pursue their self-chosen goals equally effectively" and that "equalising measures are justified on grounds of justice as well as social integration and harmony".&lt;ref name=twsL18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parekh, Bhikhu, Rethinking Multiculturalism.

[[Affirmative action]] programs usually fall under the substantive category.&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; The idea is to help disadvantaged groups get back to a normal starting position after a long period of [[discrimination]]. The programs involve government action, sometimes with resources being transferred from an advantaged group to a disadvantaged one and these programs have been justified on the grounds that imposing [[:wikt:Quota|quotas]] counterbalances the past discrimination&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; as well as being a "compelling state interest" in diversity in society.&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt; For example, there was a case in [[São Paulo]] in [[Brazil]] of a quota imposed on the [[São Paulo Fashion Week]] to require that "at least 10 percent of the models to be black or indigenous" as a coercive measure to counteract a "longstanding bias towards white models".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==== Equality of fair opportunity ====
Philosopher [[John Rawls]] offered this variant of substantive equality of opportunity and explained that it happens when individuals with the same "native talent and the same ambition" have the same prospects of success in competitions.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsH77e&gt;{{cite news

This would imply that the unmusical individual who wants to be a concert pianist should receive more training than the child prodigy.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt;}}

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] agrees mostly with the [[Rawlsian]] approach in that he would like to "create the society each of us would want if we didn’t know in advance who we’d be".&lt;ref name=twsH12/&gt; Krugman elaborated: "If you admit that life is unfair, and that there's only so much you can do about that at the starting line, then you can try to ameliorate the consequences of that unfairness".&lt;ref name=twsH12/&gt;

==== Level playing field ====
[[File:Cesc Fàbregas Anderson.jpg|thumb|The match's outcome is deemed legitimate if there is a level playing field and rules do not favor either player or team arbitrarily (photo: [[w:Cesc Fàbregas|Cesc Fàbregas]] duels with [[w:Anderson Luís de Abreu Oliveira|Anderson]] in a [[football (soccer)|football]] match in 2008)]]
Some theorists have posed a level playing field conception of equality of opportunity,&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsL21/&gt; similar in many respects to the substantive principle (although it has been used in different contexts to describe formal equality of opportunity)&lt;ref name=twsL23/&gt; and it is a core idea regarding the subject of [[distributive justice]] espoused by [[John Roemer]]&lt;ref name=twsH74/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roemer, John, 1995, "Equality and Responsibility", Boston Review, April–May issue, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roemer, John, 1998, Equality of Opportunity, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ronald Dworkin]]&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald, 2000, ''Sovereign Virtue'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, chapters 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsH21&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Like the substantive notion, the level playing field conception goes farther than the usual formal approach.&lt;ref name=twsH74/&gt; The idea is that initial "unchosen inequalities" – prior circumstances over which an individual had no control, but which impact his or her success in a given competition for a particular post – these unchosen inequalities should be eliminated as much as possible, according to this conception. According to Roemer, society should "do what it can to level the playing field so that all those with relevant potential will eventually be admissible to pools of candidates competing for positions".&lt;ref name=twsH74/&gt; Afterwards, when an individual competes for a specific post, he or she might make specific choices which cause future inequalities – and these inequalities are deemed acceptable because of the previous presumption of fairness.&lt;ref name=twsH77f&gt;{{cite news

==== Meritocracy ====
There is some overlap among these different conceptions with the term ''[[meritocracy]]'' which describes an administrative system which rewards such factors as individual [[intelligence]], [[credentials]], [[education]], [[morality]], [[knowledge]] or other criteria believed to confer merit. Equality of opportunity is often seen as a major aspect of a meritocracy.&lt;ref name=twsL18/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; One view was that equality of opportunity was more focused on what happens before the race begins while meritocracy is more focused on fairness at the competition stage.&lt;ref name=twsH77b&gt;{{citation

=== Moral senses ===
There is general agreement that equality of opportunity is good for society, although there are diverse views about how it is good since it is a [[value judgement]].&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; It is generally viewed as a positive political ideal in the abstract sense.&lt;ref name=twsH11&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of equal opportunity can conflict with notions of [[meritocracy]] in circumstances in which [[individual differences]] in human abilities are believed to be determined mostly by [[genetics]] as in such circumstances there can be conflict about how to achieve fairness in such situations.&lt;ref&gt;Herrnstein, R. J. et al. ''The Bell Curve''. 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical considerations ==
=== Difficulties with implementation ===
There is general agreement that programs to bring about certain types of equality of opportunity can be difficult and that efforts to cause one result often have unintended consequences or cause other problems. There is agreement that the formal approach is easier to implement than the others, although there are difficulties there too.

A government policy that requires equal treatment can pose problems for lawmakers. A requirement for government to provide equal health care services for all citizens can be prohibitively expensive. If government seeks equality of opportunity for citizens to get health care by rationing services using a maximization model to try to save money, new difficulties might emerge. For example, trying to ration health care by maximizing the "quality-adjusted years of life" might steer monies away from disabled persons even though they may be more deserving, according to one analysis.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Dan W., 2000, "Health Care Resource Prioritization and Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities," in Leslie Pickering Francis and Anita Silvers, eds., Americans with Disabilities: Exploring Implications of the Law for Individuals and Institutions, New York and London: Routledge, pp. 223–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, BBC News questioned whether it was wise to ask female army recruits to undergo the same strenuous tests as their male counterparts since many women were being injured as a result.&lt;ref name=twsH36&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age discrimination can present vexing challenges for policymakers trying to implement equal opportunity.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Norman, 1985, Just Health Care, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKerlie, Dennis, 1989, "Equality and Time," Ethics 99, pp. 475–91&lt;/ref&gt; According to several studies, attempts to be equally fair to both a young and an old person are problematic because the older person has presumably fewer years left to live and it may make more sense for a society to invest greater resources in a younger person's health.&lt;ref&gt;McKerlie, Dennis, 1999, "Justice Between the Young and the Old," Philosophy and Public Affairs 30, pp. 152–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Temkin, Larry S., 1993, Inequality, New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; Treating both persons equally while following the letter of the equality of opportunity seems unfair from a different perspective.

Efforts to achieve equal opportunity along one dimension can exacerbate unfairness in other dimensions. For example, take public bathrooms: if for the sake of fairness the physical area of men's and women's bathrooms is equal, the overall result may be unfair since men can use urinals, which require less physical space.&lt;ref name=twsMolotch/&gt; In other words, a more fair arrangement may be to allot more physical space for women's restrooms. The sociologist [[Harvey Holotch]] explained: "By creating men's and women's rooms of the same size, society guarantees that individual women will be worse off than individual men."&lt;ref name=twsMolotch&gt;[[Harvey Molotch]], Sociological Forum, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/684625?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents The Rest Room and Equal Opportunity]'', Vol. 3, No. 1 (Winter, 1988), pp. 128–132, Retrieved September 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difficulty is that it is hard for a society to bring substantive equality of opportunity to every type of position or industry. If a nation focuses efforts on some industries or positions, then people with other talents may be left out. For example, in an example in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', a warrior society might provide equal opportunity for all kinds of people to achieve military success through fair competition, but people with non-military skills such as farming may be left out.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;

Lawmakers have run into problems trying to implement equality of opportunity. In 2010 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], a legal requirement "forcing public bodies to try to reduce inequalities caused by class disadvantage" was scrapped after much debate and replaced by a hope that organizations would try to focus more on "fairness" than "equality" as fairness is generally seen as a much vaguer concept than equality,&lt;ref name=twsH22&gt;{{cite news

=== Difficulties with measurement ===
The consensus view is that trying to measure equality of opportunity is difficult&lt;ref name=twsH77b/&gt; whether examining a single hiring decision or looking at groups over time.
* Single instance. It is possible to reexamine the procedures governing a specific hiring decision, see if they were followed and re-evaluate the selection by asking questions such as "Was it fair? Were fair procedures followed? Was the best applicant selected?". This is a judgment call and it is possible that biases may enter into the minds of decision-makers. The determination of equality of opportunity in such an instance is based on mathematical [[probability]]: if equality of opportunity is in effect, then it is seen as fair if each of two applicants has a 50 per cent chance of winning the job, that is, they both have equal chances to succeed (assuming of course that the person making the probability assessment is unaware of all variables – including valid ones such as talent or skill as well as arbitrary ones such as race or gender). However, it is hard to measure whether each applicant had in fact a 50 per cent chance based on the outcome.
* Groups. When assessing equal opportunity for a type of job or company or industry or nation, then [[statistical analysis]] is often done by looking at patterns and abnormalities,&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; typically comparing subgroups with larger groups on a percentage basis. If equality of opportunity is violated, perhaps by [[discrimination]] which affects a subgroup or population over time, it is possible to make this determination using statistical analysis, but there are numerous difficulties involved.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; Nevertheless, entities such as city governments&lt;ref name=twsP44a&gt;{{citation

It is difficult to prove unequal treatment although statistical analysis can provide indications of problems, but it is subject to conflicts over interpretation and methodological issues.

Statistical analysis of equal opportunity has been done using sophisticated examinations of computer databases.

=== Marketplace considerations ===
Equal opportunity has been described as a fundamental basic notion in business and commerce and described by [[economist]] [[Adam Smith]] as a basic economic precept.&lt;ref name=twsL19/&gt; There has been research suggesting that "competitive markets will tend to drive out such discrimination" since employers or institutions which hire based on arbitrary criteria will be weaker as a result and not perform as well as firms which embrace equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; Firms competing for overseas contracts have sometimes argued in the press for equal chances during the bidding process, such as when American oil corporations wanted equal shots at developing oil fields in [[Sumatra]];&lt;ref name=twsH41&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and firms, seeing how fairness is beneficial while competing for contracts, can apply the lesson to other areas such as internal hiring and promotion decisions. A report in ''[[USA Today]]'' suggested that the goal of equal opportunity was "being achieved throughout most of the business and government labor markets because major employers pay based on potential and actual productivity".&lt;ref name=twsH52&gt;{{cite news

Fair opportunity practices include measures taken by an organization to ensure fairness in the employment process. A basic definition of equality is the idea of equal treatment and respect. In job advertisements and descriptions, the fact that the employer is an equal opportunity employer is sometimes indicated by the abbreviations EOE or MFDV, which stands for Minority, Female, Disabled, Veteran. Analyst Ross Douthat in ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that equality of opportunity depends on a rising [[economy]] which brings new chances for [[social mobility#Upward and downward mobility|upward mobility]] and he suggested that greater equality of opportunity is more easily achieved during "times of plenty".&lt;ref name=twsH16&gt;{{cite news

=== History ===
According to professor [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] of Macquarie University, an underlying [[Big History]] trend has been a shift from seeing people as resources to exploit towards a perspective of seeing people as individuals to empower. According to Christian, in many ancient agrarian civilizations, roughly nine of every ten persons was a peasant exploited by a ruling class. In the past thousand years, there has been a gradual movement in the direction of greater respect for equal opportunity as political structures based on generational hierarchies and [[feudalism]] broke down during the late [[Middle Ages]] and new structures emerged during the [[Renaissance]]. [[monarchy|Monarchies]] were replaced by [[democracy|democracies]]: kings were replaced by parliaments and congresses. [[Slavery]] was also abolished generally. The new entity of the [[nation state]] emerged with highly specialized parts, including [[corporation]]s, laws and new ideas about [[citizenship]] as well as values about [[individual rights]] found expression in constitutions, laws and statutes.

[[File:Thurgoodmarshall1967.jpg|thumb|[[African Americans|African-American]] [[civil rights]] lawyer [[Thurgood Marshall]] fought numerous battles in the courts for equal opportunity for all races in the United States; argued the 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' case and won; and in 1967 was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]]]
In the United States, one legal analyst suggested that the real beginning of the modern sense of equal opportunity was in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] which provided "equal protection under the law".&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; The amendment did not mention equal opportunity directly, but it helped undergird a series of later rulings which dealt with legal struggles, particularly by [[African Americans]] and later women, seeking greater political and economic power in the growing republic. In 1933, a congressional "Unemployment Relief Act" forbade [[discrimination]] "on the basis of race, color, or creed".&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision furthered government initiatives to end discrimination.&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt;

In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] signed [[Executive Order 10925]] which enabled a presidential committee on equal opportunity,&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; which was soon followed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Executive Order 11246]].&lt;ref name=twsL33&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] became the legal underpinning of equal opportunity in employment.&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; Businesses and other organizations learned to comply with the rulings by specifying fair hiring and promoting practices and posting these policy notices on bulletin boards, employee handbooks and manuals as well as training sessions and films.&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; Courts dealt with issues about equal opportunity, such as the 1989 Wards Cove decision, the Supreme Court ruled that statistical evidence by itself was insufficient to prove racial discrimination. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] was established, sometimes reviewing charges of discrimination cases which numbered in the tens of thousands annually during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=twsL11/&gt; Some law practices specialized in [[employment law]]. Conflict between formal and substantive approaches manifested itself in backlashes, sometimes described as [[reverse discrimination]], such as the [[Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke|Bakke case]] when a white male applicant to medical school sued on the basis of being denied admission because of a quota system preferring minority applicants.&lt;ref name=twsL13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfuss, Joel (1979). The Bakke Case: the Politics of Inequality.

=== Measures ===
Many economists measure the degree of equal opportunity with measures of [[economic mobility]]. For instance, [[Joseph Stiglitz]] asserts that with five economic divisions and full equality of opportunity, "20 percent of those in the bottom fifth would see their children in the bottom fifth. Denmark almost achieves that&amp;nbsp;– 25 percent are stuck there. Britain, supposedly notorious for its class divisions, does only a little worse (30 percent). That means they have a 70 percent chance of moving up. The chances of moving up in America, though, are markedly smaller (only 58 percent of children born to the bottom group make it out), and when they do move up, they tend to move up only a little". Similar analyses can be performed for each economic division and overall. They all show how far from the ideal all industrialized nations are and how correlated measures of equal opportunity are with [[income inequality]] and [[wealth inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (June 4, 2012). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (pp. 18–19). Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Equal opportunity has ramifications beyond income; the American Human Development Index, rooted in the capabilities approach pioneered by [[Amartya Sen]], is used to measure opportunity across geographies in the U.S. using health, education and standard of living outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.measureofamerica.org/human-development/|title=Measure of America - Human Development|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is speculation that since equality of opportunity is only one of sometimes competing "justice norms", there is a risk that following equality of opportunity too strictly might cause problems in other areas.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estlund, David, 2000, "Political Quality," Social Philosophy and Policy 17, pp. 127–60.&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothetical example was suggested: suppose wealthier people gave excessive amounts of campaign contributions; suppose further that these contributions resulted in better regulations; and then laws limiting such contributions on the basis of equal opportunity for all political participants may have the unintended long term consequence of making political decision-making lackluster and possibly hurting the groups that it was trying to protect.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; Philosopher [[John Kekes]] makes a similar point in his book ''The Art of Politics'' in which he suggests that there is a danger to elevating any one particular political good&amp;nbsp;– including equality of opportunity&amp;nbsp;– without balancing competing goods such as justice, property rights and others.&lt;ref name=twsH77h&gt;{{cite news

[[Conservatism|Conservative]] thinker [[Dinesh D'Souza]] criticized equality of opportunity on the basis that "it is an ideal that cannot and should not be realized through the actions of the government" and added that "for the state to enforce equal opportunity would be to contravene the true meaning of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration]] and to subvert the principle of a free society".&lt;ref name=twsH63&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; D'Souza described how his parenting undermined equality of opportunity: {{quote|I have a five-year-old daughter. Since she was born&amp;nbsp;... my wife and I have gone to great lengths in the Great Yuppie Parenting Race.&amp;nbsp;... My wife goes over her workbooks. I am teaching her chess. Why are we doing these things? We are, of course, trying to develop her abilities so that she can get the most out of life. The practical effect of our actions, however, is that we are working to give our daughter an edge&amp;nbsp;– that is, a better chance to succeed than everybody else's children. Even though we might be embarrassed to think of it this way, we are doing our utmost to undermine equal opportunity. So are all the other parents who are trying to get their children into the best schools&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=twsH63/&gt;}}

[[File:BillyMills Crossing Finish Line 1964Olympics.jpg|thumb|Equal opportunity theorists generally agree that once the race begins, who wins is a function of talent, hard work and competitive drive (photo: runner [[Billy Mills]] crossing the finish line in the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]])]]
D'Souza argued that it was wrong for government to try to bring his daughter down, or to force him to raise up other people's children,&lt;ref name=twsH63/&gt; but a counterargument is that there is a benefit to everybody, including D'Souza's daughter, to have a society with less anxiety about downward mobility, less class resentment and less possible violence.&lt;ref name=twsH63/&gt;

An argument similar to D'Souza's was raised by Nozick in ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', who wrote that the only way to achieve equality of opportunity was "directly worsening the situations of those more favored with opportunity, or by improving the situation of those less well-favored".&lt;ref name=twsH77d&gt;{{citation

If Y did not exist, then "fair lady" would have married X, but Y exists and so she marries Y.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nozick suggests that there is no grounds for complaint. Nozick argued against equality of opportunity on the grounds that it violates the [[rights]] of property since the equal opportunity maxim interferes with an owner's right to do what he or she pleases with a property.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt;

Property rights were a major component of the philosophy of [[John Locke]] and are sometimes referred to as "Lockean rights".&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; The sense of the argument is along these lines: equal opportunity rules regarding, say, a hiring decision within a factory, made to bring about greater fairness, violate a factory owner's rights to run the factory as he or she sees best; it has been argued that a factory owner's right to property encompasses all decision-making within the factory as being part of those property rights. That some people's "natural assets" were unearned is irrelevant to the equation according to Nozick and he argued that people are nevertheless entitled to enjoy these assets and other things freely given by others.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]] felt that luck was too much of a variable in economics, such that one can not devise a system with any kind of fairness when many market outcomes are unintended.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; By sheer chance or random circumstances, a person may become wealthy just by being in the right place and time and Hayek argued that it is impossible to devise a system to make opportunities equal without knowing how such interactions may play out.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; Hayek saw not only equality of opportunity, but all of [[social justice]] as a "mirage".&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt;

Some conceptions of equality of opportunity, particularly the substantive and level playing field variants, have been criticized on the basis that they make assumptions to the effect that people have similar genetic makeups.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; Other critics have suggested that social justice is more complex than mere equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; [[Robert Nozick]] made the point that what happens in society can not always be reduced to competitions for a coveted position and in 1974 wrote that "life is not a race in which we all compete for a prize which someone has established", that there is "no unified race" and there is not some one person "judging swiftness".&lt;ref name=twsH77d33/&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''essence''' is the property or set of properties that make an entity or [[substance theory|substance]] what it fundamentally is, and which it has by [[metaphysical necessity|necessity]], and without which it loses its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]. Essence is contrasted with [[accident (philosophy)|accident]]: a property that the entity or substance has [[metaphysical contingency|contingently]], without which the substance can still retain its identity.  The concept originates rigorously with Aristotle (although it can also be found in Plato)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthyfro.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} Euthyphro by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who used the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] expression ''to ti ên einai'' (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1029b&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "the what it was to be" and corresponding to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] term [[quiddity]]) or sometimes the shorter phrase ''to ti esti'' (τὸ τί ἐστι,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 1030a&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "the what it is" and corresponding to the scholastic term [[haecceity]]) for the same idea. This phrase presented such difficulties for its Latin translators that they coined the word ''essentia'' (English "essence") to represent the whole expression. For Aristotle and his scholastic followers, the notion of essence is closely linked to that of definition (ὁρισμός ''[[horismos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysicys/ S. Marc Cohen, "Aristotle's Metaphysics"], [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], accessed 20 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of western thought, essence has often served as a vehicle for doctrines that tend to individuate different forms of existence as well as different identity conditions for objects and properties; in this logical meaning, the concept has given a strong theoretical and common-sense basis to the whole family of logical theories based on the "possible worlds" analogy set up by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and developed in the intensional logic from [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] to [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]], which was later challenged by "extensionalist" philosophers such as [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].

==Ontological status&lt;!--Linked from 'Étienne Gilson'--&gt;==
In his dialogues [[Plato]] suggests that concrete beings acquire their essence through their relations to "[[Theory of Forms|Forms]]"{{mdash}}abstract universals logically or ontologically separate from the objects of sense perception. These Forms are often put forth as the models or paradigms  of which sensible things are "copies". When used in this sense, the word form is often capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 28: Form" of ''The Great Ideas: A Synopticon of Great Books of the Western World'' (Vol. II). ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1952), p. 526-542. This source states that Form or Idea get capitalized according to this convention when they refer "to that which is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas in our mind."&lt;/ref&gt; Sensible bodies are in constant flux and imperfect and hence, by Plato's reckoning, less real than the Forms which are eternal, unchanging and complete. Typical examples of Forms given by Plato are largeness, smallness, equality, unity, goodness, beauty and justice.

[[Aristotle]] moves the Forms of Plato to the nucleus of the individual thing, which is called ''[[ousia]]'' or substance. Essence is the ''ti'' of the thing, the ''[[to ti en einai]]''. Essence corresponds to the ''ousia'''s definition; essence is a real and physical aspect of the ''ousia'' (Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', I).

According to [[nominalists]] ([[Roscelin of Compiègne]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Bernard of Chartres]]), universals aren't concrete entities, just voice's sounds; there are only individuals: "''nam cum habeat eorum sententia nihil esse praeter individuum [...]''" (Roscelin, ''De gener. et spec.'', 524). Universals are words that can to call several individuals; for example the word "homo". Therefore, a universal is reduced to a sound's emission (Roscelin, ''De generibus et speciebus'').

[[John Locke]] distinguished between "real essences" and "nominal essences". Real essences are the thing(s) that makes a thing a thing, whereas nominal essences are our conception of what makes a thing a thing.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/real-essence/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edmund Husserl]] essence is ''ideal''. However, ''ideal'' means that essence is an intentional object of consciousness. Essence is interpreted as ''sense'' (E. Husserl, ''Ideas pertaining to a pure phenomenology and to a phenomenological philosophy'', paragraphs 3 and 4).

==Existentialism==
{{main|Meaning (existential)}}
[[Existentialism]] was coined by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s endorsement of [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]] statement that for human beings "[[existence precedes essence]]."  In as much as "essence" is a cornerstone of all [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] philosophy and of [[Rationalism]], Sartre's statement was a repudiation of the philosophical system that had come before him (and, in particular, that of [[Husserl]], [[Hegel]], and [[Heidegger]]).  Instead of "is-ness" generating "actuality," he argued that existence and actuality come first, and the essence is derived afterward. For [[Kierkegaard]], it is the individual person who is the supreme moral entity, and the personal, subjective aspects of human life that are the most important; also, for Kierkegaard all of this had religious implications.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of Philosophy'', Bryan Magee, Dorling Kindersley Lond. 1998, {{ISBN|0-7513-0590-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In metaphysics==
"Essence," in metaphysics, is often synonymous with the [[soul]], and some existentialists argue that individuals gain their souls and spirits after they exist, that they develop their souls and spirits during their lifetimes.  For Kierkegaard, however, the emphasis was upon essence as "nature."  For him, there is no such thing as "human nature" that determines how a human will behave or what a human will be.  First, he or she exists, and then comes property.  [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s more materialist and skeptical existentialism furthered this existentialist tenet by flatly refuting any metaphysical essence, any soul, and arguing instead that there is merely existence, with attributes as essence.

Thus, in existentialist discourse, essence can refer to physical aspect or property to the ongoing being of a person (the character or internally determined goals), or to the infinite inbound within the human (which can be lost, can atrophy, or can be developed into an equal part with the finite), depending upon the type of existentialist discourse.

==Marxism's essentialism==

[[Karl Marx]] was a follower of [[Hegel]]'s thought, and he, too, developed a philosophy in reaction to his master. In his early work, Marx used [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] style [[teleology]] and derived a concept of humanity's essential nature. Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]] describe [[Marx's theory of alienation|a theory of alienation]] based on human existence being completely different from human essence.  Marx said human nature was social, and that humanity had the distinct essence of free activity and conscious thought.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Some scholars, such as Philip Kain, have argued that Marx abandoned the idea of a human essence, but many other scholars point to Marx's continued discussion of these ideas despite the decline of terms such as essence and alienation in his later work.

==Buddhism==
Within the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Candrakirti]] identifies the [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] as:{{quote|an essence of things that does not depend on others; it is an intrinsic nature. The non-existence of that is [[Anatta|selflessness]].| {{IAST|'''Bodhisattvayogacaryācatuḥśatakaṭikā'''}} 256.1.7&lt;ref name="Lam Rim"&gt;Translations from "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", Vol. 3 by Tsong-Kha-Pa, Snow Lion Publications {{ISBN|1-55939-166-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhapālita]] adds, while commenting on [[Nagarjuna|Nagārjuna]]'s [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], {{quote|What is the reality of things just as it is? It is the absence of essence. Unskilled persons whose eye of intelligence is obscured by the darkness of delusion conceive of an essence of things and then generate attachment and hostility with regard to them.|{{IAST|''Buddhapālita-mula-madhyamaka-vrtti''}}, P5242, 73.5.6-74.1.2&lt;ref name="Lam Rim"/&gt;}}

For the [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhists, '[[Shunyata|Emptiness]]' (also known as [[Anatta|Anatta or Anatman]]) is the strong assertion that all phenomena are empty of any essence, and that anti-essentialism lies at the root of Buddhist praxis and it is the innate belief in essence that is considered to be an afflictive obscuration which serves as the root of [[Samsara|all suffering]]. However, the [[Madhyamaka]] also rejects the tenets of [[Idealism]], [[Materialism]] or [[Cārvāka#No life after death|Nihilism]]; instead, the ideas of ''truth'' or ''existence'', along with any assertions that depend upon them are limited to their function within the contexts and conventions that assert them, possibly somewhat akin to [[Relativism]] or [[Pragmatism]]. For the [[Madhyamaka]], replacement paradoxes such as [[Ship of Theseus]] are answered by stating that the Ship of Theseus remains so (within the conventions that assert it) until it ceases to function as the Ship of Theseus.

In [[Nagarjuna]]'s [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]] Chapter XV examines essence itself.

==Hinduism==

In understanding any individual personality, a distinction is made between one's ''Swadharma'' (essence) and ''Swabhava'' (mental habits and conditionings of ego personality). Svabhava is the nature of a person, which is a result of his or her samskaras (impressions created in the mind due to one's interaction with the external world). These samskaras create habits and mental models and those become our nature. While there is another kind of svabhava that is a pure internal quality — [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|smarana]] — we are here focusing only on the svabhava that was created due to samskaras (because to discover the pure, internal svabhava and smarana, one should become aware of one's samskaras and take control over them). [[Dharma]] is derived from the root ''dhr'' "to hold." It is that which holds an entity together. That is, Dharma is that which gives integrity to an entity and holds the core quality and identity (essence), form and function of that entity. Dharma is also defined as righteousness and duty. To do one's dharma is to be righteous, to do one's dharma is to do one's duty (express one's essence).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prasadkaipa.com/blog/archives/2005/07/svabhava_and_sv.php Prasadkaipa.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8760">In East Asian Buddhism the Buddha of the [[Lotus Sutra]] is regarded as the '''eternal Buddha'''. It is a popular notion, which may have contributed to the [[tathagatagarbha]] doctrine, although the notion of an ''eternal Buddha'' is not explicitly stated in the Lotus Sutra.

The belief in the Eternal Buddha transcends through time and is commonly associated with [[Shakyamuni Buddha]], but can also refer to both his past and future incarnations. However, no exact definition of the ''Eternal Buddha'' is defined in the Lotus Sutra, which was also revealed by [[Siddhartha Gautama]]; thereby making open interpretations to various religious groups.

==Lotus Sutra and tathagatagarbha doctrine==

In east-Asian Buddhism, the Buddha of the [[Lotus Sutra]] is regarded as the eternal Buddha.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=157}} "The Tathagata´s Lifespan" chapter (ch 16) of the [[Lotus Sutra]] portrays the Buddha as indicating that he became awakened countless aeons ("kalpas") ago.{{sfn|Pye|1978|p=50}}  The sutra itself, however, does not directly employ the phrase "eternal Buddha".{{source?|date=July 2015}} 

In China the ''Lotus Sutra'' was associated with the ''[[Nirvana Sutra|Mahaparinirvana Sutra]]'', which propagates the [[Buddha-nature|tathagatagarbha-doctrine]], and with the ''[[Awakening of Faith]]''.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=157}} The Mahaparinirvana Sutra presents the Buddha as eternal, and equates him with the [[Trikaya|Dharmakaya]].{{sfn|Xing|2005|p=89}}{{refn|group=note|Commenting on the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, Guang Xing writes: "One of the main themes of the ''Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' is that the Buddha is eternal, a theme very much in contrast with the Hinayana idea that the Buddha departed for ever after his final nirvana. The Mahayanists assert the eternity of the Buddha in two ways in the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra''. They state that the Buddha is the ''dharmakaya'', and hence eternal. Next, they re-interpret the liberation of the Buddha as ''mahaparinirvana'' possessing four attributes: eternity, happiness, self and purity. In other words, according to the Mahayanists, the fact that the Buddha abides in the ''mahaparinirvana'' means not that he has departed for ever, but that he perpetually abides in intrinsic quiescence. The Buddha abiding in intrinsic quiescence is none other than the ''dharmakaya'' [...] This ''dharmakaya'' is the ''real'' Buddha. It is on this doctrinal foundation that the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' declares: "the dharmakaya has [the attributes of] eternity (''nitya''), happiness (''sukha''), self (''atman'') and purity (''subha'') and is perpetually free from birth, old age, sickness, death and all other sufferings [...] It exists eternally without change.""{{sfn|Xing|2005|p=89}}}} 

The ''Lotus Sutra'' itself does hardly seem to accept the tathagatagarbha-teachings.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=157}} According to Paul Williams, this association may be explained by the systematization of the ''Lotus Sutra'' teachings by the Tiantai school, using teachings from other schools "to equate the Buddha of the ''Lotus Sutra'' with the ultimate truth and to teach a cosmic Buddha."{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=157}}

==Understanding in east-Asian Buddhism==
===China===
The Chinese [[Tiantai]] scholar [[Zhiyi]] [天台] (538–597) divided the sutra into the "trace teaching" about the historical Shakyamuni Buddha (ch 1-14) and the "origin teaching" (ch 15-28) revealing the original Buddha of inconceivable life span.{{sfn|Fuss|1991|pp=29-30}}{{sfn|Leighton|2007|pp=29-30}}  
Zhiyi viewed Shakyamuni Buddha of Ch 16 of the Lotus Sutra as a unification of the [[Trikaya|three Buddha bodies]], possessing all three bodies, whereas other sutras are taught from the standpoint of a single Buddha body.{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=473}}{{sfn|The English Buddhist Dictionary Committee|2009|p=}}

===Japan===
The [[Nichiren Shu]], [[Rissho Kosei Kai]] and [[Kempon Hokke]] schools of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] revere Shakyamuni of Chapter 16 of the [[Lotus Sutra]] as the eternal Buddha. They also regard Shakyamuni of Ch 16 as a "Unification of the Three Bodies", as taught by Tiantai.{{sfn|The English Buddhist Dictionary Committee|2009|p=}} Other Buddhas, such as Amida of the Pure Land (J. Nembutsu) School, and Mahavairochana of the True Word (J. Shingon) School are seen as provisional manifestations of the Original Buddha Shakyamuni.&lt;ref&gt;Nichiren Daishonin, Rissho Ankoku Ron (Eng. On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land), 1260 CE&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jōdo Shinshū|Shin]] or Pure Land Buddhism, [[Amitābha|Amida]] Buddha is viewed as the eternal Buddha who manifested as Shakyamuni in India and who is the personification of Nirvana itself.&lt;ref name=jodo&gt;[http://www.jodo.org/about_plb/what_plb.html What is Pure Land Buddhism?] da Sho-on Hattori, ''A Raft from The Other Shore Honen and the Way of Pure Land Buddhism'', published by Jodo Shu Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amida, who attained Buddhahood in the infinite past, / Full of compassion for foolish beings of the five defilements, / Took the form of Sakyamuni Buddha/ And appeared in Gaya. (Shinran, Hymnes of Pure Land, 88)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shingon Buddhism]] sees [[Vairochana Buddha]] as the personification of the dharmakaya, and hence as the eternal Buddha.{{source?|date=July 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9844">[[Image:Sangreal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Holy Grail]], illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], 1917. [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] art at this time often represented contemporary interest in the "spirit body", "aura" or "body of light".]]
The '''etheric body''', '''ether-body''', '''æther body''', a name given by [[neo-Theosophy]] to a '''vital body''' or [[subtle body]] propounded in [[esoteric]] philosophies as the first or lowest layer in the "human energy field" or [[aura (paranormal)|aura]].&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Barbara, ''Hands of Light : A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field ([http://www.kheper.net/topics/subtlebody/BAB-etheric.htm Etheric body])'', Bantam Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be in immediate contact with the [[Human anatomy|physical body]], to sustain it and connect it with "higher" bodies.

The English term "etheric" in this context seems to derive from the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] writings of [[Madame Blavatsky]], but its use was formalised by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C.W. Leadbeater]]&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W., ''Man, Visible and Invisible'', 1902&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Annie Besant]]&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie, ''Man and His Bodies'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; due to the elimination of Hindu terminology from the system of seven planes and bodies. ([[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar School of Theosophy]]).

The term gained some general popularity after the 1914-18 war, [[Walter John Kilner]] having adopted it for a layer of the "human atmosphere" which, as he claimed in a popular book, could be rendered visible to the naked eye by means of certain exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Kilner, Walter J., ''The Human Atmosphere, or the Aura Made Visible by the aid of Chemical Screens'', 1911, reprinted as "The Human Aura" by Citadel Press, NY, 1965, {{ISBN|0-8065-0545-1}}. The Aura, by Walter J. Kilner. Introd. by Sibyl Ferguson. New York, S. Weiser, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical element [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]] of Platonic and Aristotlean physics continued in Victorian scientific proposals of a [[Luminiferous ether]] as well as the cognate chemical substance ether. According to Theosophists and [[Alice Bailey]] the etheric body inhabits an [[etheric plane]] which corresponds to the four higher subplanes of the [[physical plane]]. The intended reference is therefore to some extremely rarefied matter, analogous in usage to the word "spirit" (originally "breath"). In selecting it as the term for a clearly defined concept in an Indian-derived metaphysical system, the Theosophists aligned it with ideas such as the [[Kosha|prana-maya-kosha]] (sheath made of [[prana]], subtle breath or life-force) of [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] thought.

In popular use it is often confounded with the related concept of the [[astral body]] as for example in the term [[astral projection]] - the early Theosophists had called it the "astral double". Others prefer to speak of the "lower and higher astral".

== Accounts ==
{{planes of existence}}
[[Linga sarira]] is a Sanskrit term for the invisible double of the human body, the etheric body or etheric double (or [[astral body]] in some Theosophical concepts). It is one of the seven principles of the human being, according to Theosophical philosophy.

[[Rudolf Steiner]], the founder of [[Anthroposophy]], often referred to the etheric body (''Ätherleib'' or "Life Body") in association with the etheric formative forces and the [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] of [[Human|man]] and the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Rudolf, ''Occult science&amp;nbsp;– An Outline''. Trans. George and Mary Adams. London: Rudolf Steiner Press, 1909, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, it can be perceived by a person gifted with clairvoyance as being of "peach-blossom color".

Steiner considered the etheric reality or life principle as quite distinct from the physical material reality, being intermediate between the physical world and the astral or soul world.
The etheric body can be characterised as the life force also present in the plant kingdom. It maintains the physical body's form until death. At that time, it separates from the physical body and the physical reverts to natural disintegration.

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings,&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''The Rosicrucian Mysteries (Chapter IV, [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rms/rmseng02.htm#Chapter_IV The Constitution of Man: Vital Body - Desire Body - Mind])'', 1911, {{ISBN|0-911274-86-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the etheric body, composed of four ethers, is called the "Vital Body" since the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] is the way of ingress for vital force from the [[Sun]] and the field of agencies in nature which promote such vital activities as assimilation, growth, and propagation. It is an exact counterpart of our physical body, molecule for molecule, and organ for organ, but it is of the opposite polarity. It is slightly larger, extending about one and one-half inches beyond the periphery of the physical body.

[[Samael Aun Weor]] teaches that the vital body is the tetra-dimensional part of the physical body and the foundation of organic life.&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, ''The Pistis Sophia Unveiled'', Thelema Press, (1983) 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, "[http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/230/99/ Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509180046/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/230/99/ |date=2007-05-09 }}", ''The Book of the Dead'',  1966&lt;/ref&gt; He states that in the second Initiation of Fire, which is reached through working with [[Sex magic#Samael Aun Weor|sexual magic]] with a spouse, the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] rises in the vital body. Then the initiate learns how to separate the two superior ethers from the others in order for them to serve as a vehicle to travel out of the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, ''The Three Mountains'', Thelema Press, (1972) 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]] of the [[Kabbalah]], the vital body is often related to the [[Sephirot|sephirah]] [[Yesod (Kabbalah)|Yesod]].&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, ''The Initiatic Path in the Arcana of Tarot and Kabbalah'', Thelema Press, (1978) 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beings that possess only etheric bodies ==
In the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Deva (New Age)|Devas]] are regarded as living either in the [[atmosphere]]s of the [[planet]]s of the [[solar system]] (''Planetary Angels'') or inside the [[Sun]] (''Solar Angels'') (presumably other [[planetary system]]s and [[star]]s have their own angels) and they help to guide the operation of the processes of [[nature]] such as the process of [[evolution]] and the growth of [[plants]]; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human being.  It is believed by Theosophists that devas can be observed when the [[third eye]] is activated.  Some (but not most) devas originally incarnated as [[human being]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodson, Geoffrey, ''Kingdom of the Gods'' {{ISBN|0-7661-8134-0}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Has color pictures of what Devas supposedly look like when observed by the [[third eye]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human being. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040820064159/http://www.geocities.com/athens/Olympus/3987/devas2.html Paintings of some of the devas claimed to have been seen by Hodson from his book "Kingdom of the Gods":]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Theosophists that [[nature spirit]]s, [[elementals]] ([[gnome]]s, [[Ondine (mythology)|ondines]], [[sylphs]], and [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamanders]]), and [[Fairy|fairies]] can also be observed when the [[third eye]] is activated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021121131124/http://geocities.com/athens/Olympus/3987/devas4.html Eskild Tjalve’s paintings of devas, nature spirits, elementals and fairies:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained by Theosophists that these less evolutionarily developed beings have never been previously incarnated as human beings; they are regarded as on a separate line of spiritual evolution called the “deva evolution”; eventually, as their [[soul]]s advance as they [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], it is believed they will incarnate as devas.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See "Lifewave" chart (refer to index)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is asserted by Theosophists that all of the above-mentioned beings possess etheric bodies (but no physical bodies) that are composed of ''[[Etheric plane|etheric matter]]'', a type of matter finer and more pure that is composed of smaller particles than ordinary [[Matter|physical plane matter]].&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See "Lifewave" chart (refer to index)&lt;/ref&gt; (See the book ''[[Occult Chemistry (book)|Occult Chemistry]]'' by [[C.W. Leadbeater]])

'''Extended cognition''' is the view that [[mental process]]es and [[mind]] extend beyond the body to include aspects of the [[physical environment|environment]] in which an organism is embedded and the organism's interaction with that environment.&lt;ref name=Rupert/&gt; [[Cognition]] goes beyond the manipulation of symbols to include the [[emergence]] of order and structure evolving from active engagement with the world.&lt;ref name=VanGelder/&gt; 

==Overview==
As described by [[Mark Rowlands]], mental processes are:&lt;ref name=Rowlands/&gt;
* '''Embodied''' involving more than the brain, including a more general involvement of bodily structures and processes.
* '''Embedded''' functioning only in a related external environment.
* '''Enacted''' involving not only neural processes, but also things an organism ''does''.
* '''Extended''' into the organism's environment.

This contrasts with the view of the mind as a processing center that creates mental representations of reality and uses them to control the body's behaviour. The field of extended cognition focuses upon the processes involved in this creation, and subsumes these processes as part of consciousness. Which is no longer confined to the brain or body, but involves interaction with the environment. At a 'low' level, like [[motor learning]] and [[haptic perception]],&lt;ref name=Morasso/&gt; the body is involved in cognition, but there is a 'high' level where cultural factors play a role.&lt;ref name=Ratner/&gt;&lt;ref name=McGann/&gt; This view of cognition is sometimes referred to as {{'}}'''[[enaction]]'''{{'}} to emphasise the role of interplay between the organism and its environment and the [[Cybernetics|feedback processes]] involved in developing an awareness of, and a reformation of, the environment.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt; For example Japyassú and Laland argue that some spider's web is something between part of its sensory system and an additional part of its cognitive system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s10071-017-1069-7|pmid = 28176133|pmc = 5394149|title = Extended spider cognition|journal = Animal Cognition|volume = 20|issue = 3|pages = 375–395|year = 2017|last1 = Japyassú|first1 = Hilton F|last2 = Laland|first2 = Kevin N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminism''' is a range of [[political movement]]s, [[ideologies]], and [[social movement]]s that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social [[Gender equality|equality of sexes]].&lt;ref name="Hawkesworth"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hawkesworth | first=Mary E.|title=Globalization and Feminist Activism |year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |pages=25–27 |isbn=9780742537835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beasley"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Beasley |first=Chris |title=What is Feminism? |year=1999|publisher=Sage |location=New York |pages=3–11 |isbn=9780761963356}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men.

[[Feminist movement]]s have campaigned and continue to campaign for [[women's rights]], including the right to [[Women's suffrage|vote]], to hold public office, [[Right to work|to work]], to earn fair [[wages]] or [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]], to [[Right to property|own property]], [[Right to education|to receive education]], to enter contracts, to have equal rights within [[marriage]], and to have [[maternity leave]]. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and [[social integration]], and to protect women and girls from [[rape]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="Echols"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Echols |first=Alice |authorlink=Alice Echols |title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-1787-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |magazine=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical [[Social change|societal changes]] for [[women's rights]], particularly in [[Western world|the West]], where they are near-universally credited with achieving [[women's suffrage]], [[gender neutrality in English]], [[reproductive rights]] for women (including access to [[contraceptive]]s and [[support for the legalization of abortion|abortion]]), and the right to enter into contracts and [[property|own property]].&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Messer-Davidow |first=Ellen |title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse |year=2002 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, [[North Carolina|NC]] |isbn=978-0-8223-2843-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including [[bell hooks]], argue for the inclusion of [[men's liberation]] within its aims because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="hooks"/&gt;
[[Feminist theory]], which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.&lt;ref name="Chodorow1989"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Chodorow, Nancy |title=Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory |year=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=978-0-300-05116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gilligan1977"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |year=1977 |title=In a Different Voice: Women's Conceptions of Self and of Morality|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=47|issue=4 |pages=481–517|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-47,-issue-4/herarticle/women-s-conceptions-of-self-and-of-morality_917 |accessdate=8 June 2008 |doi=10.17763/haer.47.4.g6167429416hg5l0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism have been [[feminism#Civil rights movement and anti-racism|criticized]] for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism led to the creation of ethnically specific or [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] forms of feminism, including [[black feminism]] and [[Intersectionality|intersectional feminism]].&lt;ref name=Weedon/&gt;

The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] comprised women's suffrage movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, promoting women's right to vote. The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] was associated with the ideas and actions of the [[women's liberation movement]] beginning in the 1960s. The second wave campaigned for legal and social equality for women. The [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] is a continuation of, and a reaction to, the perceived failures of second-wave feminism, which began in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Suffragettes to Grrls"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krolokke |first1=Charlotte |first2=Anne Scott |last2=Sorensen |title=Gender Communication Theories and Analyses: From Silence to Performance |year=2005 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-2918-5 |page=24 |chapter=Three Waves of Feminism: From Suffragettes to Grrls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] which introduced the [[Tender years doctrine]] for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1 872 870 57 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=L.

For example, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] passed legislation in 1884, [[New South Wales]] in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's [[suffrage]], though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's [[Sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual]], [[reproductive rights|reproductive]], and [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]] as well.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464&gt;{{cite book |author=Freedman, Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back : The History of Feminism and the Future of Women |year=2003 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's suffrage]] (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain's [[Australasia]]n colonies at the close of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of [[Feminism in New Zealand|New Zealand]] granting women the [[right to vote]] in 1893 and South Australia granting female suffrage in 1895. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/votes-women |title=Votes for Women Electoral Commission|publisher=Elections New Zealand |date=13 April 2005 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm|title=Women and the right to vote in Australia|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] the Suffragettes and the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies|Suffragists]] campaigned for the women's vote, and in 1918 the [[Representation of the People Act 1918|Representation of the People Act]] was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property.

Anthony]], who each campaigned for the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] prior to championing women's right to vote. These women were influenced by the [[Quaker]] theology of spiritual equality, which asserts that men and women are equal under God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruether|first=Rosemary Radford|title=Women and Redemption: A Theological History|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8006-9816-4|pages=112–18, 136–39|edition=2nd|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1919), granting women the right to vote in all states.

According to Nawar al-Hassan Golley, Arab feminism was closely connected with [[Arab nationalism]]. In 1899, [[Qasim Amin]], considered the "father" of Arab feminism, wrote ''The Liberation of Women'', which argued for legal and social reforms for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stange |first1=Mary Zeiss |first2=Carol K. |last2=Oyster |first3=Jane E. |last3=Sloan |title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World |publisher=SAGE |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4129-7685-5 |pages=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew links between women's position in Egyptian society and nationalism, leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement.&lt;ref name=Golley&gt;{{cite book |last=Golley |first=Nawar Al-Hassan |title=Reading Arab women's autobiographies: Shahrazad tells her story |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2003 |pages=30–50 |isbn=978-0-292-70545-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 [[Hoda Shaarawi]] founded the [[Egyptian Feminist Union]], became its president and a symbol of the Arab women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Golley/&gt;

In [[Women in France|France]], women obtained the [[Women's suffrage#France|right to vote]] only with the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] of 21 April 1944. The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by [[Fernand Grenier]], they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier's proposition was adopted 51 to 16. In May 1947, following the [[French legislative election, November 1946|November 1946 elections]], the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the "[[gender differences|gender gap]]", stating in ''[[Le Populaire]]'' that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] period, feminism waned in importance. Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles.&lt;ref name=Bard&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christine |last=Bard |url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&amp;rub=dossier&amp;item=7 |title=Les premières femmes au Gouvernement (France, 1936–1981) |trans-title=First Women in Government (France, 1936–1981) |journal=[[Histoire@Politique]] |issue=1 |date=May–June 2007 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mid-twentieth century ===
By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, women still lacked some significant rights. Feminists in these countries continued to fight for voting rights. In [[Women in Switzerland|Switzerland]], women gained the [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland|right to vote]] in federal [[Elections in Switzerland|elections]] in 1971;&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=United Nations press release of a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), issued on 14 January 2003 |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Liechtenstein]], women were given the right to vote by the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]]. Three prior referendums held in [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1968|1968]], [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1971|1971]] and [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1973|1973]] had failed to secure women's right to vote.

Feminists continued to campaign for the reform of [[family law]]s which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the 20th century [[coverture]] had been abolished in the UK and the US, in many [[continental European]] countries married women still had very few rights. For instance, in France married women did not receive the right to work without their husband's permission until 1965.&lt;ref name=Guillaumin&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillaumin|first=Colette|year=1994 |title=Racism, Sexism, Power, and Ideology |pages=193–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meltzer&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Françoise |year=1995 |title=Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have also worked to abolish the [[marital rape|"marital exemption" in rape laws]] which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite book |last=Allison |first=Julie A. |year=1995 |title=Rape: The Misunderstood Crime |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], [[Victoria Woodhull]] and [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy]] to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed;&lt;ref name=Bland&gt;{{cite book |last=Bland |first=Lucy |year=2002 |title=Banishing the Beast: Feminism, Sex and Morality |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cl8nLdfgz1IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |accessdate=25 August 2013 |pages=135–49|isbn=9781860646812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1040-0656 | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 54–68 [60] | last = Palczewski | first = Catherine Helen | title = Voltairine de Cleyre: Sexual Slavery and Sexual Pleasure in the Nineteenth Century | journal = NWSA Journal | date = 1995-10-01 | jstor = 4316402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries, but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowell |first1=Nancy A. |last2=Burgess |first2=Ann W. |year=1997 |title=Understanding Violence Against Women |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] provided a [[Marxist]] solution and an [[existentialist]] view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' (''[[The Second Sex]]'') in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bergoffen |first=Debra |title=Simone de Beauvoir |date=16 August 2010 |origyear=17 August 2004 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/ |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice.

Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;

Second-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author [[Carol Hanisch]] coined the slogan "The Personal is Political", which became synonymous with the second wave.&lt;ref name=Echols/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanisch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |title=Hanisch, New Intro to 'The Personal is Political' – Second Wave and Beyond |accessdate=8 June 2008 |last=Hanisch |first=Carol |date=1 January 2006 |website=The Personal Is Political |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515014413/http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |archivedate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved.&lt;ref name="Dooling" /&gt;

In 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Feminism in Egypt|Egypt]] initiated "[[state feminism]]", which outlawed [[Human rights in Egypt#Status of women|discrimination based on gender]] and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political [[activism]] by feminist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badran |first=Margot |title=Feminists, Islam, and nation: gender and the making of modern Egypt |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-691-02605-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]]'s presidency, his wife, [[Jehan Sadat]], publicly advocated further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new [[Islamist]] movement and growing conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Bonnie G. |title=Global feminisms since 1945 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-18491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [[Islamic feminism]], which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/16-31Jan04-Print-Edition/1631200425.htm |title=Islamic feminism means justice to women |website= The Mili Gazette |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Feminism in Latin America|Latin America]], revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as [[Role of women in Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]], where [[feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution]] aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.&lt;ref name="parpart"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parpart |first=Jane L. |last2=Connelly |first2=M.

In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]]'s book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' was published and helped voice the discontent that American women felt. The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/us/betty-friedan-who-ignited-cause-in-feminine-mystique-dies-at-85.html|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85|date=5 February 2006|author=Margalit Fox|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's success also meant that Friedan could lecture her views while she was on tour in 1970.

==== Third-wave feminism ====
{{main|Third-wave feminism}}
[[File:Lozu mont oct8 bellhooooooooks.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Feminist, author and social activist [[bell hooks]] (b. 1952).]]
[[Third-wave feminism]] is traced to the emergence of the [[Riot grrrl]] feminist [[punk subculture]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Feliciano (New York Public Library, 2013): "The emergence of the Riot Grrrl movement began in the early 1990s, when a group of women in Olympia, Washington, held a meeting to discuss how to address sexism in the punk scene. The women decided they wanted to start a 'girl riot' against a society they felt offered no validation of women's experiences. And thus the Riot Grrrl movement was born."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement|url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Anita Hill]]'s televised testimony in 1991—to an all-male, all-white [[Senate Judiciary Committee]]—that [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]], nominated for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], had [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] her. The term ''third wave'' is credited to [[Rebecca Walker]], who responded to Thomas's appointment to the Supreme Court with an article in ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine, "Becoming the Third Wave" (1992).&lt;ref name="MsMagazineThirdWave"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Walker| first1 = Rebecca | authorlink1 = Rebecca Walker| editor-last=| editor-first =| editor-link=| title = Becoming the Third Wave| journal = [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]| issue = | pages = 39–41| issn = 0047-8318| oclc = 194419734|date= January 1992|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2002/BecomingThirdWaveRebeccaWalker.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future |last1=Baumgardner |first1=Jennifer |author1-link=Jennifer Baumgardner |last2=Richards |first2=Amy |author2-link=Amy Richards |year=2000 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-52622-1 |p=77|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote:

{{quote|So I write this as a plea to all women, especially women of my generation: Let Thomas’ confirmation serve to remind you, as it did me, that the fight is far from over.

I am the Third Wave.&lt;ref name="MsMagazineThirdWave"/&gt;}}

Third-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's [[Essentialism|essentialist]] definitions of [[femininity]], which, third-wave feminists argued, over-emphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on "[[wikt:micropolitics|micro-politics]]" and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Astrid |title=Not my mother's sister: generational conflict and third-wave feminism |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-21713-4 |pages=1–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillis |first1=Stacy |last2=Howie |first2=Gillian |last3=Munford |first3=Rebecca |title=Third wave feminism: a critical exploration |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-0-230-52174-2 |pages=xxviii, 275–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faludi&gt;{{cite book |last=Faludi |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Faludi |title=Backlash: the undeclared war against women |year=1992 |publisher=Vintage |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-922271-2}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities.&lt;ref name=Gillis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leslie |first1=Heywood |last2=Drake |first2=Jennifer |title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-3005-9}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between [[difference feminism|difference feminists]], who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to [[social conditioning]].&lt;ref name=Gilligan&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |authorlink=Carol Gilligan |title=In a different voice: psychological theory and women's development |year=1993 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-44544-4 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Standpoint theory ====
Standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view that believes a persons' social position influences their knowledge.  This perspective argues that research and theory treats women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = standpoint theory {{!}} feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/standpoint-theory|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, [[Standpoint feminism|standpoint feminists]] have argued that the feminist movement should address [[global issue]]s (such as rape, [[incest]], and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as [[female genital mutilation]] in some parts of [[Women in Africa|Africa]] and [[Women in Arab societies|Arab societies]], as well as [[glass ceiling]] practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, [[homophobia]], [[classism]] and [[colonization]] in a "[[matrix of domination]]".&lt;ref name="BFT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harding2003&gt;{{cite book |last=Harding |first=Sandra |authorlink=Sandra Harding |title=The Feminist Standpoint Theory Reader: Intellectual and Political Controversies |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-94501-1 |pages=1–16, 67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fourth-wave feminism ====
{{main|Fourth-wave feminism}}
[[Fourth-wave feminism]] refers to a resurgence of interest in feminism that began around 2012 and is associated with the use of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=4thWave-Guardian20131210/&gt; According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to [[sexual harassment]] and [[violence against women]]. Its essence, she writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Chamberlain|first=Prudence|title=The Feminist Fourth Wave: Affective Temporality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AIkDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=2017|publisher=Springer|location=Cham|isbn=978-3-319-53682-8|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology", according to [[Kira Cochrane]], and is characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]] and further [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|website=NOW Toronto|publisher=|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"/&gt;

Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include [[street harassment|street]] and [[workplace harassment]], [[campus sexual assault]] and [[rape culture]]. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement. These have included the 2012 [[2012 Delhi gang rape|Delhi gang rape]], 2012 [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile allegations]], the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault case|Bill Cosby allegations]], 2014 [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]], 2016 [[trial of Jian Ghomeshi]], 2017 [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein allegations]] and subsequent [[Weinstein effect]], and the 2017 [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals|Westminster sexual scandals]].&lt;ref&gt;For Cosby, Ghomeshi, #MeToo, and fourth wave, see Matheson, Kelsey (17 October 2017).

==== Post-feminism ====
The term [[post-feminism]] is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being "anti-feminist", post-feminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third and fourth wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth |title=Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) |year=2000 |publisher=Totem Books |isbn=978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other post-feminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modleski |first=Tania |title=Feminism without women: culture and criticism in a 'postfeminist' age |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-90416-2 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Amelia |chapter=Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art |title=New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action |editor1-first=Joana |editor1-last=Frueh |editor2-first=Cassandra L. |editor2-last=Langer |editor3-first=Arlene |editor3-last=Raven |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1994 |pages=16–41, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Chunn notes a "blaming narrative" under the post-feminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for [[gender equality]] in a "post-feminist" society, where "gender equality has (already) been achieved." According to Chunn, "many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them."&lt;ref&gt;Chunn, D. (2007).

While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, [[stereotyping]], [[objectification]] (especially [[sexual objectification]]), [[oppression]], and [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name=Chodorow1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=gilligan1977/&gt;
In the field of [[literary criticism]], [[Elaine Showalter]] describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls "feminist critique", in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls "[[gynocriticism]]", in which the "woman is producer of textual meaning". The last phase she calls "gender theory", in which the "ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored".&lt;ref name=showalter1979&gt;{{cite book |last1=Showalter |first1=Elaine |authorlink1=Elaine Showalter |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Jacobus |title=Women Writing about Women |year=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-85664-745-1 |pages=25–36 |chapter=Towards a Feminist Poetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was paralleled in the 1970s by [[French structuralist feminism|French feminists]], who developed the concept of ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (which translates as 'female or feminine writing').&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; [[Helene Cixous]] argues that writing and philosophy are ''[[Wikt:phallocentric|phallocentric]]'' and along with other French feminists such as [[Luce Irigaray]] emphasize "writing from the body" as a subversive exercise.&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; The work of [[Julia Kristeva]], a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and [[Bracha Ettinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, 'The Matrixial Borderspace'.

However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, "none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] world".&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moi1986&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kristeva |first1=Julia |last2=Moi |first2=Toril |authorlink2=Toril Moi |title=The Kristeva reader |year=1986 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-06325-8 |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent feminist theory, such as that of Lisa Lucile Owens,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite journal |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |first=Lisa Lucile |last=Owens |journal=Alabama Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=5 |page=1 |year=2003 |ssrn=2439294}}&lt;/ref&gt; has concentrated on characterizing feminism as a universal emancipatory movement.

== Movements and ideologies ==
{{Main|Feminist movements and ideologies}}
[[File:Woman-power emblem.svg|upright=0.45|thumb|right|A symbol of feminism based on the [[Venus symbol]] ]]
Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years.

=== Political movements ===
Some branches of feminism closely track the political leanings of the larger society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. [[Liberal feminism]] seeks individualistic equality of men and women through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality.&lt;ref name="rotten"/&gt; Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;Catherine Rottenberg, "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502386.2013.857361 The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism]", Cultural Studies. (2014) Vol. 28 (3), pgs. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radical feminism]] considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary.&lt;ref name="Echols" /&gt; [[List of conservative feminisms|Conservative feminism]] is conservative relative to the society in which it resides.

=== Materialist ideologies ===

According to 2014 [[Ipsos]] poll covering 15 developed countries, 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists, and 87% agreed that "women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency, not their gender". However, only 55% of women agreed that they have "full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations".&lt;ref name=ipsos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=6511 |last=Clark |first=Julia |title= Can Men Be Feminists Too?

Among women, some of the strongest support for feminism was found in Sweden, where one in three (36%) agreed very much that they defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by women in Italy (31%) and Argentina (29%). Those in the middle of the ranking were from Great Britain (22%), Spain (22%), United States (20%), Australia (18%), Belgium (18%), France (18%), Canada (17%), Poland (17%), and Hungary (15%). Women least likely to agree very much were from Japan (8%), Germany (7%) and South Korea (7%).&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

One quarter of men in Italy (25%) and Argentina (25%), and two in ten of those in Poland (21%) and France (19%), defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by those from Sweden (17%), Spain (16%), the United States (16%), Canada (15%), Great Britain (14%), Hungary (12%), Belgium (11%) and Australia (10%). Men least likely to identify this way were from South Korea (7%), Germany (3%) and Japan (3%).&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

Women were more likely to self-identify as being feminists than men in every country in the study except for Poland, where 21% of men were and only 17% of women were likely to agree very much with the statement, and South Korea, where there was no difference between men and women (7%) on this measure.&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

== Sexuality ==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexuality}}
[[Feminist views on sexuality]] vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the [[sex industry]], sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the [[feminist sex wars]], which pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.&lt;ref name=Duggan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Karen Tranberg |last2=Philipson |first2=Ilene J. |title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-87722-630-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-11204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leidholdt |first1=Dorchen |authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt |last2=Raymond |first2=Janice G. |title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-08-037457-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=978-0-04-440593-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the [[sexual revolution]] from the 1960s and 70s.

=== Sex industry ===
{{main|Sex industry|Feminist views on pornography|Feminist views on prostitution|Feminist sex wars| Male prostitution#Feminist studies}}
Opinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality. For the views of feminism on male prostitutes see the article on [[Male prostitution#Feminist studies|male prostitution]].

Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of [[violence against women]], to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91036-1 |pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance/&gt; Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affirming female sexual autonomy ===
For feminists, a woman's right to control her own [[Right to sexuality|sexuality]] is a key issue. Feminists such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement, and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rohana Ariffin|author2=Women's Crisis Centre (Pinang, Malaysia)|title=Shame, secrecy, and silence: study on rape in Penang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfsDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=1997|publisher=Women's Crisis Centre|isbn=978-983-99348-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett L, Manderson L, Astbury J.

University of Melbourne, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} cultures, men do not believe that a woman has the right to reject a man's sexual advances or to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} parts of the world, especially in [[conservative]] and religious cultures, marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jewkes R, Abrahams N |title= The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview|pmid=12365533|year=2002|volume=55|issue=7|pages=1231–44|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00242-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen P. Ending the presumption of consent: nonconsensual sex in marriage. London, Centre for Health and Gender Equity, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In more liberal cultures, this entitlement takes the form of a general [[sexualization]] of the whole culture. This is played out in the [[sexual objectification]] of women, with pornography and other forms of sexual entertainment creating the fantasy that all women exist solely for men's sexual pleasure, and that women are readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on a man's terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon |date=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Harding]] says that the "moral and political insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds."&lt;ref name=Harding_method&gt;{{cite book|author=Harding, Sandra|editor=Nancy Tuana|year=1989|title=Feminism &amp; Science|chapter=Is There a Feminist Method|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQQkAvU4S1oC&amp;pg=PA17|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20525-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminists, such as [[Ruth Hubbard]] and [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], criticize traditional [[rhetoric of science|scientific discourse]] as being historically biased towards a male perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hubbard, Ruth|year=1990|title=The Politics of Women's Biology|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-1490-1|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lindlof | first1 = Thomas R. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Bryan C. | title = Qualitative Communication Research Methods | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, Calif | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7619-2493-7 |page = 357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Lisa Randall]], appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president [[Lawrence Summers]] after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, "I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don't have to come up anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Holloway, Marguerite|title=The Beauty of Branes|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-beauty-of-branes|date=26 September 2005|work=Scientific American|publisher=Nature America|accessdate=12 December 2011|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn Hankinson Nelson notes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women, and to "uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them" to account for a range of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1990|title=Who Knows: from Quine To a Feminist Empiricism|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-0-87722-647-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"/&gt; Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortina |first1=L.

One criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1997|title=Feminism, Science, and the Philosophy of Science |publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4611-1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Haack]] also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women's thinking (as intuitive and emotional, etc.); [[Meera Nanda]] further cautions that this may in fact trap women within "traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/ |title=Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science |author=Anderson, Elizabeth |accessdate=6 December 2011|year=2011 |journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |issue=Spring 2011 |editor=Edward N.

=== Feminist psychology ===
{{main|Feminist psychology}}
Feminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates in psychology, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Worell|first1=Judith|title=Feminism in Psychology: Revolution or Evolution?|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2000|volume=571|pages=183–96|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~pchsiung/summer/SCMEDIA/Worell.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2014|doi=10.1177/0002716200571001013|jstor=1049142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as [[Psychology's Feminist Voices]] have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology's Feminist Voices|url=http://www.feministvoices.com|website=Psychology's Feminist Voices|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender-based inquiries into and conceptualization of architecture have also come about, leading to [[Feminism and modern architecture|feminism in modern architecture]]. Piyush Mathur coined the term "archigenderic". Claiming that "architectural planning has an inextricable link with the defining and regulation of gender roles, responsibilities, rights, and limitations", Mathur came up with that term "to explore&amp;nbsp;... the meaning of 'architecture' in terms of gender" and "to explore the meaning of 'gender' in terms of architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09699089800200034 |title=The archigenderic territories: Mansfield park and a handful of dust |year=1998 |last1=Mathur |first1=Piyush |journal=Women's Writing |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Businesses ===
Feminist activists have established a range of [[feminist businesses]], including women's bookstores, feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, and feminist restaurants. These businesses flourished as part of the [[Second-wave feminism|second]] and [[Third-wave feminism|third-waves]] of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.{{sfnp|Echols|1989|pp=269–278}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminist Bookstore Movement: Lesbian Antiracism and Feminist Accountability|last=Hogan|first=Kristen|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corresponding with general developments within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Gopnik/&gt; Jeremy Strick, director of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles]], described the feminist art movement as "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period", and [[Peggy Phelan]] says that it "brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing over the past four decades".&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/20/AR2007042000400.html |title=What Is Feminist Art? |author=Blake Gopnik |date=22 April 2007 |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist artist [[Judy Chicago]], who created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', a set of [[Vagina and vulva in art|vulva-themed ceramic plates]] in the 1970s, said in 2009 to ''[[ARTnews]]'', "There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] narrative.

The feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]]. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel  |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a close link between feminist literature and [[activism]], with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.

Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandra M. |last=Gilbert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260 |title=Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 May 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Broadview Press]] continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the [[University of Kentucky]] has a series of republications of early women's novels.

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) by [[Virginia Woolf]], is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Literary genre|genres and subgenres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies has entered new territories such as the "[[Gothic fiction#The female Gothic and the supernatural explained|female gothic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976). See also Juliann E. Fleenor, ed., ''The Female Gothic'' (Montreal: Eden Press, 1983) and Gary Kelly, ed., ''Varieties of Female Gothic'' 6 Vols. (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Women in science fiction|women's science fiction]].

According to Elyce Rae Helford, "Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helford, Elyce Rae |editor-first=Gary |editor-last=Westfahl |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=Feminist Science Fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15328023top1703_17 |title=Using Science Fiction to Teach the Psychology of Sex and Gender |year=1990 |last1=Lips |first1=Hilary M. |journal=Teaching of Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=197–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts of this kind are [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1970), [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985).

Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, [[Maya Angelou]]'s ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings]]'' was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2018/08/10/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-review-maya-angelou/|title=I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings: Angelou's Quest to Truth and Power|last=Shah|first=Mahvish|date=2018|website=Feminism in India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many feminist movements have embraced [[poetry]] as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/144696/a-change-of-world|title=A Change of World|last=Poetry Foundation|date=2018-11-29|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminism became a principal concern of [[Musicology|musicologists]] in the 1980s&lt;ref name=mus&gt;Beard, David; Gload, Kenneth. 2005. Musicology : The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[New Musicology]]. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of [[Western canon|canon]], genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt; Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like [[Susan McClary]], [[Marcia Citron]] and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and [[Female education|education of women]]; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt;

While the [[music industry]] has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end|first=Jessica |last=Duchen |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[Record producer|music producers]], the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rosina |last=Ncube |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women in Audio? |website=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013 |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/people/sounding-why-so-few-women-audio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{main|Feminist film theory}}
{{see also|Women's cinema}}

Feminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of [[feminist film theory]] in the late '60s and early '70s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward S., ''Cinema Studies – The Key Concepts'', 3rd edn, Routledge, 2006;134–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Differences were particularly marked between [[Feminist film theory#History|feminists on either side of the Atlantic]]. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, [[List of film periodicals|''Women and Film'']]. Trailblazers from this period included [[Claire Johnston]] and [[Laura Mulvey]], who also organized the Women's Event at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival|Edinburgh Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Erens, P., ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism'', Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991; 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include [[Teresa de Lauretis]], Anneke Smelik and [[Kaja Silverman]]. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.

It has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. 'Deconstruction' concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kuhn |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Radstone |editor2-first=S. |title=Women's Companion to International Film |publisher=Virago |year=1990 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/what-really-makes-a-film-feminist/281402/ |title=What really makes a feminist film? |work=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Holly L. |last=Derr |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of "feminist film" approaches has centred around a Swedish rating system called the [[Bechdel test]].

Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the twentieth century.

=== Socialism ===
{{main|Left-wing politics#Social progressivism and counterculture|l1=Social Progressivism and Counterculture}}
Since the late nineteenth century some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. [[August Bebel]], an early activist of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), published his work ''Die Frau und der Sozialismus'', juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Stuttgart 1907|International Conference of Socialist Women]] in [[Stuttgart]] where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. [[Clara Zetkin]] of the SPD called for women's suffrage to build a "''socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Badia, Gilbert |title=Zetkin.

In Britain, the women's movement was allied with the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]]. In the U.S., [[Betty Friedan]] emerged from a radical background to take leadership.

[[File:Feministas en lucha anti Pinochet (de Kena Lorenzini).jpg|thumb|Chilean feminists protest against the regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]]]]
Fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the [[Fascist manifesto]] in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the ''fasci femminilli'' and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s more conservative coalition partners.&lt;ref name="hagg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hägg |first=Göran |year=2008 |title=Mussolini: En studie i makt |trans-title=A study in power |language=sv |publisher=Norstedt |location=Stockholm |isbn=978-91-1-301949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="passmore"&gt;{{cite book |last=Passmore |first=Kevin |authorlink=Definitions_of_fascism#Kevin_Passmore |year=2003 |title=Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–45 |publisher=Rutgers Univ.

Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], feminism has a complicated relationship with the [[Nazi]] movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment.&lt;ref name=Blamires&gt;{{cite book |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |last=Blamires |first=Cyprian |volume=1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-940-9 |pages=232–33|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism,&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt; and after the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=hww5/&gt; Georges Duby et al. note that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position.&lt;ref name=hww5&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duby |first1=Georges |last2=Perrot |first2=Michelle |last3=Schmitt Pantel |first3=Pauline |title=A history of women in the West |year=1994 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-40369-7 |page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blamires also notes that Neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept "their traditional roles".&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt;

=== Civil rights movement and anti-racism ===
The [[civil rights movement]] has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Peter |year=1998 |title=The Civil Rights Movement |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-29854-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Code |first=Lorraine |title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories |chapter=Civil rights |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-13274-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns.&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt; These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, [[classism]], and [[sexism]], and new feminisms, such as [[black feminism]] and [[Chicana feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roth |first=Benita |title=Separate Roads to Feminism: Black, Chicana, and White feminist movements in America's second wave |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-52972-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winddance Twine |first1=France |first2=Kathleen M. |last2=Blee |title=Feminism and Antiracism: International struggles for justice |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8147-9855-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoliberalism===
[[Neoliberalism]] has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe, especially in the global south.  Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=V. Spike |year=2014 |chapter=International/Global Political Economy |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |edition=2 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134752591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177}} Women's experiences in non-industrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|175}}

Proponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women's participation in the workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have noted that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations.&lt;ref name="elias"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elias |first1=Juanita |last2=Ferguson |first2=Lucy |year=2014 |chapter=Production, Employment, and Consumption |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134752591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|186–98}} Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination in the family and the workplace.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|176}} The "feminization of employment" refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|179}}  Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|180}}  Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as 'secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.&lt;ref name="elias"/&gt;{{rp|189}}

== Societal impact ==
{{Main|Feminist effects on society}}
The feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; greater access to education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"/&gt;

From the 1960s on, the campaign for women's rights&lt;ref name="quarterly"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Lockwood, Bert B. |title=Women's Rights: A Human Rights Quarterly Reader |year=2006 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; was met with mixed results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=FROM SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN'S LIBERATION: FEMINISM IN TWENTIETH CENTURY AMERICA by Jo Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.

Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to [[child sexual abuse]]. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rush |first=Florence |authorlink=Florence Rush |year=1988 |title=The Best Kept Secret: Sexual Abuse of Children |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs |isbn=978-0070542235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://now.org/about/history/statement-of-purpose/|title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not pass, although [[Equal Rights Amendment#State constitutions|some states enacted their own]]. [[Reproductive rights]] in the U.S. centred on the court decision in [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' v. ''Wade'']] enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable [[birth control]], allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under [[Margaret Sanger]] and elsewhere under [[Marie Stopes]]. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through [[birth control]], which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1676.html|title=Margaret Sanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[division of labor|division of labour]] within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework,&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |author2=Machung, Anne |title=The Second Shift |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-14-200292-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild2"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |title=The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-8050-6643-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Cathy Young]] responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/|title=The Mama Lion at the Gate |accessdate=17 December 2015 |publisher=Salon.com |author=Young, Cathy |authorlink=Cathy Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith K. Brown writes, "Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics: the participant is not obliged to be far from home; the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration; and the work is not dangerous, can be performed in spite of interruptions, and is easily resumed once interrupted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Judith K. | last = Brown | title = A Note on the Division of Labor by Sex | date = October 1970 | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 1073–78 | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | doi=10.1525/aa.1970.72.5.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international law, the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]'' (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CEDAW.aspx|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women New York, 18 December 1979 |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisprudence ===
{{Main|Feminist legal theory}}

Feminist jurisprudence is a branch of [[jurisprudence]] that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.&lt;ref name="blacks"&gt;{{cite book |year=2014 |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Bryan |editor-link=Bryan A. Garner |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=10th |location=St. Paul, Minn. |publisher=Thomson Reuters |page=985 |isbn=978-0-314-61300-4 |quote=Feminist jurisprudence examines ... the history of legal and social biases against women, the elimination of those biases in modern law, and the enhancement of women's legal rights and recognition [status] in society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the [[Philosophy of law|philosophical approach]] of modern [[Law#Legal theory|legal scholars]], who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.&lt;ref name="minda"&gt;{{cite book |last=Minda |first=Gary |year=1995 |title=Postmodern Legal Movements: Law and Jurisprudence at Century's End |publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]] |location=N.Y.C. |isbn=978-0814755105 |pages=129–30 |quote=Feminist legal scholars, despite their differences, appear united in claiming that 'masculine' jurisprudence ... fails to acknowledge, let alone respond to, the interests, values, fears, and harms experienced by women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
{{details|Gender-neutral language in English}}
Proponents of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Casey |authorlink1=Casey Miller |last2=Swift |first2=Kate |authorlink2=Kate Swift |year=1988 |title=The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=N.Y.C. |isbn=978-0061816024 |pages=45, 64, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Handbook of English Linguistics'', generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances "where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species."&lt;ref name="handbook linguistics"&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |editor1-last=Aarts |editor1-first=Bas |editor2-last=McMahon |editor2-first=April |title=The Handbook of English Linguistics |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-1405113823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.&lt;ref name=Bundesen&gt;{{cite book |author=Bundesen, Lynne |title=The Feminine Spirit: Recapturing the Heart of Scripture |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-8495-3|date=2007-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian feminism]] is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the [[Christian egalitarianism|equality]] of [[Women in Christianity|women]] and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the [[ordination of women]], male dominance and the balance of parenting in [[Christian views on marriage|Christian marriage]], claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church.&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haddad, Mimi |title=Egalitarian Pioneers: Betty Friedan or Catherine Booth? |journal=Priscilla Papers |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=2006 |url=http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713193304/http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=andeson&gt;{{cite book |author=Anderson, Pamela Sue |author2=Clack, Beverley |title=Feminist philosophy of religion: critical readings |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-25749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian [[Women in the Bible|Bible refers to women]] in positions of authority in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 4:4 and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 22:14.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|4:4|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|22:14|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=April 2016}}

[[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminists]] advocate women's rights, [[gender equality]], and [[social justice]] grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the [[Women in the Quran|Quran]] and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]), and ''[[Sharia#Women|sharia]]'' (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/international/Islamic-Feminism-01.html|title=Islamic Feminism: What's in a Name?|author=Badran, Margot |accessdate=17 December 2015 |date=17–23 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized [[Islam and secularism|secular]] and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm|publisher=feminismeislamic.org |author=Catalonian Islamic Board |title=II International Congress on Islamic Feminism|accessdate=9 July 2008 |date=24–27 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114144940/http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm|archivedate=14 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhist feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and [[social status]] of [[Women in Buddhism|women within Buddhism]]. It is an aspect of [[feminist theology]] which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective. The Buddhist feminist [[Rita Gross]] describes Buddhist feminism as "the radical practice of the co-humanity of women and men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism|last= Gross|first= Rita M.|year= 1992|publisher= [[State University of New York Press]]|location= Albany, New York|isbn= 978-0-7914-1403-3|page= 127|accessdate=7 October 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3eurUjHo1IC&amp;pg=PA127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of [[Women in Judaism|women]] within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women.

Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege, and is dependent on female subordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of sex and gender |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |location=Detroit, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women.

''The Sexual Contract'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[feminist theory]] the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tickner, Ann J.|chapter=Patriarchy|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries PZ|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-24352-0|pages=1197–98|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, [[Separatist feminism|separatism]] is the only viable solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hoagland, Lesbian Ethics: toward new value&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminists have criticized these views as being anti-men.&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty.

Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality.

== Reactions ==
Different groups of people have responded to feminism, and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00159.x |title=Disavowing Social Identities: What It Means when Women Say, 'I'm Not a Feminist, but&amp;nbsp;...' |year=2004 |last1=Zucker |first1=Alyssa N. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=423–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1007044802798 |year=2000 |last1=Burn |first1=Shawn Meghan |last2=Aboud |first2=Roger |last3=Moyles |first3=Carey |title=The Relationship Between Gender Social Identity and Support for Feminism |journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] |volume=42 |issue=11/12 |pages=1081–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00289954 |title=New wave or second stage?

=== Pro-feminism ===
{{main|Pro-feminism}}
Pro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, [[men's studies]], and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.&lt;ref name=Lingard&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Lingard |first1=Bob |last2=Douglas |first2=Peter |title=Men Engaging Feminisms: Pro-Feminism, Backlashes and Schooling |year=1999 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham, England |isbn=978-0-335-19818-4 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimmel-Tide"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Kimmel |first1=Michael S. |authorlink1=Michael Kimmel |last2=Mosmiller |first2=Thomas E. |title=Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990: A Documentary History |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-6767-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-feminism and criticism of feminism===
{{Anchor|Critique of Feminism and Anti-feminism|Criticism of feminism and anti-feminism}} &lt;!--Former name--&gt;
{{main|Antifeminism}}
Anti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Simpson | first1 = John A. | last2 = Weiner | first2 = Edmund S.C. | author-link1 = John Simpson (lexicographer) | author-link2 = Edmund Weiner | contribution = Anti-feminist | editor-last1 = Simpson | editor-first1 = John A. | editor-last2 = Weiner | editor-first2 = Edmund S.

In the nineteenth century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWj5OBvTh1IC&amp;pg=PA35 |chapter=Antifeminism |first=Michael |last=Kimmel |authorlink=Michael Kimmel | editor-last1 = Kimmel | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Aronson | editor-first2 = Amy | editor-link1 = Michael Kimmel | editor-link2 = Amy Aronson | title = Men and masculinities a social, cultural, and historical encyclopedia | pages = 35–37 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781576077740 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. These anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lukas | first = Carrie | author-link = Carrie Lukas | contribution = Marriage: happier ever after | editor-last = Lukas | editor-first = Carrie | editor-link = Carrie Lukas | title = The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism | page = 75 | publisher = Regency Publishing | location = Washington, DC Lanham, Maryland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781596980037 | quote = Feminists' assault on marriage also has played a role in devaluing marriage. Radical feminists view marriage as a cruel trap for women, perpetuating patriarchy, and keeping women subservient to men. They lament the roles that women and men tend to assume in traditional marriages, believing that women get the worse deal from the marriage contract. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Kassian | first = Mary | contribution = Introduction: the tsunami of feminism | editor-last = Kassian | editor-first = Mary | title = The feminist &lt;del&gt;mystique&lt;/del&gt; mistake: the radical impact of feminism on church and culture | page = 10 | publisher = [[Good News Publishers|Crossway Books]] | location = Wheaton, Illinois | year = 2005 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781581345704 | quote = The feminist assault on traditional gender roles and families began in earnest in the 1960s and increasingly turned radical in the 1970s. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schlafly | first = Phyllis | author-link = Phyllis Schlafly | contribution = Understanding the difference | editor-last = Schlafly | editor-first = Phyllis | editor-link = Phyllis Schlafly | title = The power of the positive woman | page = 12 | publisher = Arlington House | location = New Rochelle, New York | year = 1977 | isbn = 9780870003738 | quote = The second dogma of the women's liberationists is that, of all the injustices perpetuated upon women through the centuries, the most oppressive is the cruel fact that women have babies and men do not. Within the confines of the women's liberationist ideology, therefore, the abolition of this overriding inequality of women becomes the primary goal. This goal must be achieved at any at all costs – to the woman herself, to the baby, to the family, and to society. Women must be made equal to men in their ability ''not'' to become pregnant and ''not'' to be expected to care for babies they may bring into the world. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gottfried |first=Paul | author-link = Paul Gottfried |title=The trouble with feminism  |url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/ | work = [[LewRockwell.com]] (web magazine) |publisher= [[Lew Rockwell]] |date= 21 April 2001 |accessdate=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = al-Qaradawi | first = Yusuf | author-link = Yusuf al-Qaradawi | contribution = Women and family in Islamist discourses: 'When Islam prohibits something, it closes all the avenues of approach to it'| editor-last = Calvert | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Calvert (scholar) | title = Islamism: a documentary and reference guide | page = 62 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780313338564 | quote = Islamists are aggrieved at the support of ostensibly Muslim governments for the 'alleged' legal emancipation of women, including granting women the right to vote and hold public office, in addition to limited rights to initiate divorce. Although many Muslim women take pride in the fact that they now perform jobs and enter professions once reserved for men, for most Islamists female employment and legal emancipation are dangerous trends that lead to the dissolution of traditional gender roles associated with the extended family. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers such as [[Camille Paglia]], [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], [[Jean Bethke Elshtain]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], Lisa Lucile Owens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Department of Sociology: Lisa Lucile Owens | url = http://sociology.columbia.edu/node/347 | publisher = [[Columbia University|Columbia University in the City of New York]] | access-date = 13 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Daphne Patai]] oppose some forms of feminism, though they identify as feminists. They argue, for example, that feminism often promotes [[misandry]] and the elevation of women's interests above men's, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women.&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sommers |first=Christina Hoff |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers |title=Who Stole Feminism?

Harris argues that the truth about the human [[mind]] (that [[free will]] is an [[illusion]]) does not undermine [[morality]] or diminish the importance of [[political freedom|political]] and [[Liberty|social]] freedom, and can as well as should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = ‘Free Will,’ by Sam Harris|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/books/review/free-will-by-sam-harris.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2012-07-13|access-date = 2015-10-31|issn = 0362-4331|first = Daniel|last = Menaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Book Review: Sam Harris’ Free Will|url = http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-03-book-review-sam-harris-free-will|website = American Humanist Association|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Will This Post Make Sam Harris Change His Mind About Free Will?|url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/will-this-post-make-sam-harris-change-his-mind-about-free-will/|website = blogs.scientificamerican.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How free is the will?

==Overview==
Harris says the idea of free will "cannot be mapped on to any conceivable reality" and is incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;Pardi, Paul (May 15, 2012). [http://www.philosophynews.com/post/2012/05/15/An-Analysis-of-Sam-Harris-Free-Will.aspx "An Analysis of Sam Harris' Free Will"]. Philosophy News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|title=Free Will and "Free Will"|url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/free-will-and-free-will|publisher=SamHarris.Org|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harris, science "reveals you to be a biochemical puppet."&lt;ref&gt;Nahmias, Eddy (August 13, 2012). [https://www.bigquestionsonline.com/content/does-contemporary-neuroscience-support-or-challenge-reality-free-will "Does Contemporary Neuroscience Support or Challenge the Reality of Free Will?"] Big Questions Online.&lt;/ref&gt; People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, "emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control." Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Even without free will, consciousness has an important role to play in the choices we make. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.

==Critique==
The book has undergone some critique.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/will-this-post-make-sam-harris-change-his-mind-about-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pardi, Paul (May 15, 2012).

{{About|the emotion}}
'''Hope''' is an [[Optimism|optimistic]] state of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one's life or the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hope |title=Hope &amp;#124; Define Hope at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=1992-11-27 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a verb, its definitions include: "expect with confidence" and "to cherish a desire with anticipation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hope |title=Hope – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its opposites are [[Dejection: An Ode|dejection]], [[Hopelessness scale|hopelessness]], and [[Depression (mood)|despair]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Kirkpatrick ed., ''Roget's Thesaurus'' (1995) pp.  852–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of Psychology [[Barbara Fredrickson]] argues that hope comes into its own when crisis looms, opening us to new creative possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fredrickson |first=Barbara L. |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/positivity/200903/why-choose-hope |title=Why Choose Hope? |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederickson argues that with great need comes an unusually wide range of ideas, as well as such positive emotions as happiness and joy, courage, and empowerment, drawn from four different areas of one’s self: from a cognitive, psychological, social, or physical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fredrickson, Barbara L., et al. (2008)|title=Open Hearts Build Lives: Positive Emotions, Induced Through Loving-Kindness Meditation, Build Consequential Personal Resources|publisher=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 95, pp. 1045–1062|url=http://psycnet.apa.org.suproxy.su.edu/journals/psp/95/5/1045.pdf|accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopeful people are "like the little engine that could, [because] they keep telling themselves "I think I can, I think I can".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php |title=Mental Health, Depression, Anxiety, Wellness, Family &amp; Relationship Issues, Sexual Disorders &amp; ADHD Medications |publisher=Mentalhelp.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211327/http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php |archivedate=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[Optimism|positive thinking]] bears fruit when based on a realistic sense of optimism, not on a naive "false hope".&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996)  p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Charles R. Snyder]] linked hope to the existence of a goal, combined with a determined plan for reaching that goal:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=28966&amp;cn=110 |title=Breaking down Barack Obama's Psychology of Hope and how it may help you in trying times… – Wellness, Disease Prevention, And Stress Reduction Information |publisher=Mentalhelp.net |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110102512/http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=28966&amp;cn=110 |archivedate=November 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Adler]] had similarly argued for the centrality of goal-seeking in human psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 57-8&lt;/ref&gt; as too had philosophical anthropologists like [[Ernst Bloch]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1973) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder also stressed the link between hope and mental willpower, as well as the need for realistic perception of goals,&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Charles D.  The Psychology of Hope: You Can Get Here from There.  New York: The Free Press, 1994, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the difference between hope and optimism was that the former included practical pathways to an improved future.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Charles D.  The Psychology of Hope: You Can Get Here from There.  New York: The Free Press, 1994, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. W. Winnicott]] saw a child's antisocial behavior as expressing an unconscious hope{{elucidate|date=August 2015}} for management by the wider society, when containment within the immediate family had failed.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (1973) pp. 228–9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Object relations theory]] similarly sees the analytic [[transference]] as motivated in part by an unconscious hope that past conflicts and traumas can be dealt with anew.&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hope theory===
As a specialist in [[positive psychology]], Snyder studied how hope and forgiveness can impact several aspects of life such as health, work, education, and personal meaning. He postulated that there are three main things that make up hopeful thinking:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://teachingpsychology.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/hope-theory.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hope Theory |website=Teachingpsychology.files.wordpress.com |accessdate=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Goals – Approaching life in a goal-oriented way.
* Pathways – Finding different ways to achieve your goals.
* Agency – Believing that you can instigate change and achieve these goals.

[[File:Auschwitz-hope after terror.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Auschwitz]], a rose expressing hope]]

In other words, hope was defined as the perceived capability to derive pathways to desired goals and motivate oneself via agency thinking to use those pathways.

Snyder argues that individuals who are able to realize these three components and develop a belief in their ability are hopeful people who can establish clear goals, imagine multiple workable pathways toward those goals, and persevere, even when obstacles get in their way. 

Snyder proposed a "Hope Scale" which considered that a person's determination to achieve their goal is their measured hope. Snyder differentiates between adult-measured hope and child-measured hope. The Adult Hope Scale by Snyder contains 12 questions; 4  measuring 'pathways thinking', 4 measuring 'agency thinking', and 4 that are simply fillers.  Each subject responds to each question using an 8-point scale.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C. R., Rand, K. L., &amp; Sigmon, D. R. (2002). Hope Theory: A Member of the Positive Psychology Family. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 257–276). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Fibel and Hale measure hope by combining Snyder's Hope Scale with their own Generalized Expectancy for Success Scale (GESS) to empirically measure hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missouriwestern.edu/psychology/research/psy302/spring97/teresa_hunt.html |title=Self-concept, Hope and Achievement: A look at the relationship between the individual self-concept, level of hope, and academic achievement |publisher=Missouriwestern.edu |date=1997-05-01 |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128043439/http://www.missouriwestern.edu/psychology/research/psy302/spring97/teresa_hunt.html |archivedate=November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder regarded that psychotherapy can help focus attention on one's goals, drawing on [[tacit knowledge]] of how to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Charles D., ''The Psychology of Hope: You Can Get Here from There''.  New York: The Free Press, 1994, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is an ''outlook'' and a ''grasp of reality'' to hope, distinguishing '''No Hope''', '''Lost Hope''', '''False Hope''' and '''Real Hope''', which differ in terms of viewpoint and realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/hope.htm|title=Emotional Competency - Hope|website=www.emotionalcompetency.com|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In healthcare ==

=== Major theories ===
Of the countless models that examine the importance of hope in an individual’s life, there are two major theories that have gained a significant amount of recognition in the field of [[psychology]]. One of these theories, developed by [[Charles R. Snyder]], argues that hope should be viewed as a cognitive skill that demonstrates an individual’s ability to maintain drive in the pursuit of a particular goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=C.R|title=The Psychology of Hope|date=1994|publisher=Free Press|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model reasons that an individual’s ability to be hopeful depends on two types of thinking: agency thinking and pathway thinking. Agency thinking refers to an individual’s determination to achieve their goals despite possible obstacles, while pathway thinking refers to the ways in which an individual believes they can achieve these personal goals.

Snyder’s theory uses hope as a mechanism that is most often seen in [[psychotherapy]]. In these instances, the therapist helps their client overcome barriers that have prevented them from achieving goals. The therapist would then help the client set realistic and relevant personal goals (i.e. "I am going to find something I am passionate about and that makes me feel good about myself"), and would help them remain hopeful of their ability to achieve these goals, and suggest the correct pathways to do so.

Whereas Snyder’s theory focuses on hope as a mechanism to overcome an individual’s lack of motivation to achieve goals, the other major theory developed by K.A Herth deals more specifically with an individual’s future goals as they relate to coping with illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weis|first1=Robert|last2=Speridakos|first2=Elena|title=A Meta-Analysis of Hope Enhancement  Strategies in Clinical and Community Setting|journal=Psychology of Well-Being: Theory, Research and Practice|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herth views hope as "a motivational and cognitive attribute that is theoretically necessary to initiate and sustain action toward goal attainment".&lt;ref name=Herth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herth|first1=K.A.|title=Enhancing hope in people with a first recurrence of cancer|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|date=2000|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1431–1441|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2000.01619.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing realistic and attainable goals in this situation is more difficult, as the individual most likely does not have direct control over the future of their health. Instead, Herth suggests that the goals should be concerned with how the individual is going to personally deal with the illness—"Instead of drinking to ease the pain of my illness, I am going to surround myself with friends and family".&lt;ref name=Herth /&gt;

While the nature of the goals in Snyder’s model differ with those in Herth’s model, they both view hope as a way to maintain personal motivation, which ultimately will result in a greater sense of optimism.

=== Major empirical findings ===
Hope, and more specifically, particularized hope, has been shown to be an important part of the recovery process from illness; it has strong psychological benefits for patients, helping them to cope more effectively with their disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiles|first1=R.|last2=Cott|first2=C.|last3=Gibson|first3=B.E.|title=Hope, expectations, and recovery from illness: A narrative synthesis of qualitative research|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|date=2008|volume=64|issue=6|pages=564–573|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04815.x|pmid=19120569}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, hope motivates people to pursue healthy behaviors for recovery, such as eating fruits and vegetables, quitting smoking, and engaging in regular [[physical activity]]. This not only helps to enhance people’s recovery from illnesses, but also helps prevent illness from developing in the first place.&lt;ref name="Enayati 2013" /&gt; Patients who maintain high levels of hope have an improved prognosis for life-threatening illness and an enhanced quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simonik|first1=T.|title=Reflections on hope and recovery|url=http://nedic.ca/|publisher=National Eating Disorder Information Centre|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Belief and expectation, which are key elements of hope, block pain in patients suffering from chronic illness by releasing endorphins and mimicking the effects of morphine. Consequently, through this process, belief and expectation can set off a chain reaction in the body that can make recovery from chronic illness more likely.  This chain reaction is especially evident with studies demonstrating the [[placebo effect]], a situation when hope is the only variable aiding in these patients’ recovery.&lt;ref name="Enayati 2013" /&gt;

Overall, studies have demonstrated that maintaining a sense of hope during a period of recovery from illness is beneficial. A sense of hopelessness during the recovery period has, in many instances, resulted in adverse health conditions for the patient (i.e. depression and anxiety following the recovery process).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knabe|first1=Hannah|title=The Meaning of Hope for Patients Coping with a Terminal Illness: A Review of Literature|journal=J Palliative Care Med|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, having a greater amount of hope before and during cognitive therapy has led to decreased PTSD-related depression symptoms in war veterans.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2012" /&gt; Hope has also been found to be associated with more positive perceptions of subjective health. However, reviews of research literature have noted that the connections between hope and symptom severity in other mental health disorders are less clear, such as in cases of individuals with [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Schrank et al. 2008" /&gt;

=== Applications ===
The inclusion of hope in treatment programs has potential in both physical and mental health settings. Hope as a mechanism for improved treatment has been studied in the contexts of PTSD, chronic physical illness, and terminal illness, among other disorders and ailments.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Suzanne|title=Does Hope Really Make a Difference? Scientific Findings|url=http://blogs.psychcentral.com/healing-together/2012/07/does-hope-really-make-a-difference-scientific-findings/|website=PsychCentral|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schrank et al. 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Schrank|first1=Beate|last2=Stanghellini|first2=G|last3=Slade|first3=M|title=Hope in psychiatry: a review of the literature|journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica|volume=118|issue=6|pages=421–33|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2008.01271.x|pmid=18851720|year=2008|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/hope-in-psychiatry-a-review-of-the-literature(d22cdded-f92e-4240-9e94-868928a538f6).html|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within mental health practice, clinicians have suggested using hope interventions as a supplement to more traditional [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapies]].&lt;ref name="Schrank et al. 2008" /&gt; In terms of support for physical illness, research suggests that hope can encourage the release of [[endorphins]] and [[enkephalin]]s, which help to block pain.&lt;ref name="Enayati 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Enayati|first1=Amanda|title=How hope can help you heal|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/11/health/hope-healing-enayati/|website=CNN|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impediments ===
There are two main arguments based on [[Decision-making|judgement]] against those who are advocates of using hope to help treat [[Catastrophic illness|severe illnesses]]. The first of which is that if physicians have too much hope, they may aggressively treat the patient. The physician will hold on to a small shred of hope that the patient may get better. Thus, this causes them to try methods that are costly and may have many side effects. One physician noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jarrett|first1=Christian|title=Is it ethical to instill false hope?|url=http://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/09/is-it-ethical-to-instil-false-hope-in.html|website=Research Digest|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that she regretted having hope for her patient; it resulted in her patient suffering through three more years of pain that the patient would not have endured if the physician had realized recovery was infeasible.

The second argument is the division between hope and [[wish]]ing. Those that are hopeful are actively trying to investigate the best path of action while taking into consideration the obstacles. Research&lt;ref name="Enayati 2013" /&gt; has shown though that many of those who have "hope" are wishfully thinking and passively going through the motions, as if they are in denial about their actual circumstances. Being in [[denial]] and having too much hope may negatively impact both the patient and the physician.

=== Benefits ===
The impact that hope can have on a patient’s recovery process is strongly supported through both empirical research and theoretical approaches. Also always have hope. However, reviews of literature also maintain that more longitudinal and methodologically-sound research is needed to establish which hope interventions are actually the most effective, and in what setting (i.e. [[Chronic condition|chronic illness]] vs. [[terminal illness]]).&lt;ref name="Schrank et al. 2008" /&gt;

== In culture ==


In the matter of [[globalization]], hope is focused on economic and social empowerment.

Focusing on parts of Asia, hope has taken on a [[secular]] or [[materialistic]] form in relation to the pursuit of economic growth. Primary examples are the rise of the economies of [[Economy of China|China]] and [[Economy of India|India]], correlating with the notion of [[Chindia]]. A secondary relevant example is the increased use of [[contemporary architecture]] in rising economies, such as the building of the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]], [[Burj Khalifa]] and [[Taipei 101]], which has given rise to a prevailing hope within the countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Moïsi, Dominique. "The Culture of Hope." The Geopolitics of Emotion: How Cultures of Fear, Humiliation, and Hope Are Reshaping the World. New York: Doubleday, 2009. 30–55.

A classic reference to hope which has entered modern language is the concept that "Hope springs eternal" taken from [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''Essay on Man'', the phrase reading "Hope springs eternal in the human breast, Man never is, but always ''to be'' blest:"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8pEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Essays%20on%20Man%2C%20Pope&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=An essay on man – Alexander Pope – Google Boeken |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02|year=1811 |last1=Pope |first1=Alexander }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular reference, "Hope is the thing with feathers," is from a poem by [[Emily Dickinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/113/1032.html|first=Emily|last=Dickinson|title=Hope is the thing with feathers|publisher=|accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hope can be used as an artistic plot device and is often a motivating force for change in dynamic characters. A commonly understood reference from western popular culture is the subtitle "[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]" from the original first installment (now considered Episode IV) in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' science fiction [[space opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/|title="A New Hope" – Star Wars|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtitle refers to one of the lead characters, [[Luke Skywalker]], who is expected in the future to allow good to triumph over evil within the plot of the films.

Contemporary philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] understands hope as more than [[goal setting]], rather as a [[metanarrative]], a story that serves as a promise or reason for expecting a better future. Rorty as [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] believes past meta–narratives, including the Christian story, utilitarianism, and [[Marxism]] have proved false hopes; that theory cannot offer social hope; and that liberal man must learn to live without a consensual theory of social hope.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Hall, ''Richard Rorty'' (1994) p. 150 and p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Rorty says a new document of promise is needed for social hope to exist again.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Richard. Philosophy and Social Hope. London: Penguin Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swallow (bird)|swallow]] has been a symbol of hope, in [[Aesop's fables]] and numerous other historic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Christos A. Zafiropoulos (2001), Ethics in Aesop's Fables: The Augustana Collection, {{ISBN|978-9004118676}}, Brill Academic, page 61&lt;/ref&gt; It symbolizes hope, in part because it is among the first birds to appear at the end of winter and the start of spring.&lt;ref&gt;Hope B. Werness (2006), The Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in Art, {{ISBN|978-0826419132}}, page 395&lt;/ref&gt; Other symbols of hope include the [[anchor]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferber, ''A Dictionary of Literary Symbolism'' (2007) 'Anchor'&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[dove]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Matthews, ''The Grail Tradition'' (2011) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

== In mythology ==
[[Elpis]] (Hope) appears in ancient [[Greek mythology]] with the story of [[Zeus]] and [[Prometheus]]. Prometheus stole fire from the god Zeus, which infuriated the supreme god.  In turn, Zeus created a box that contained all manners of evil, unbeknownst to the receiver of the box.  [[Pandora]] opened the box after being warned not to, and unleashed a multitude of harmful spirits that inflicted plagues, diseases, and illnesses on mankind. Spirits of greed, envy, hatred, mistrust, sorrow, anger, revenge, lust, and despair scattered far and wide looking for humans to torment. Inside the box, however, there was also an unreleased healing spirit named Hope. From ancient times, people have recognized that a spirit of hope had the power to heal afflictions and helps them bear times of great suffering, illnesses, disasters, loss, and pain caused by the malevolent spirits and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Magaletta, Philip R., &amp; Oliver, J.M |date=April 1999|title=The Hope Construct, Will, and Ways: Their Relations with Self-Efficacy, Optimism, and General Well-Being.

[[Norse mythology]] however considered Hope (''Vön'') to be the slobber dripping from the mouth of [[Fenris Wolf]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''J. R. R. Tolkien'' (2001) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; their concept of courage rated most highly a cheerful bravery in the ''absence'' of hope.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''The Road to Middle-Earth'' (1992) p. 140-3&lt;/ref&gt;

== In religion ==
Hope is a key concept in most major world religions, often signifying the "hoper" believes an individual or a collective group will reach a concept of [[heaven]]. Depending on the religion, hope can be seen as a prerequisite for and/or byproduct of spiritual attainment.

=== Hinduism ===
In historic literature of Hinduism, hope is referred to with ''Pratidhi'' (Sanskrit: प्रतिधी),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/index.php?sfx=pdf prati-dhi] Sanskrit Lexicon, University of Koeln, Germany (2009), see page 666&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Apêksh'' (Sanskrit: अपेक्ष).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/index.php?sfx=pdf Apêksh] Sanskrit Lexicon, University of Koeln, Germany (2009), see page 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=apekSA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 apekSA] Spoken Sanskrit-English dictionary Version 4.2, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; It is discussed with the concepts of desire and wish. In [[Vedas|Vedic philosophy]], ''karma'' was linked to ritual sacrifices (''yajna''), hope and success linked to correct performance of these rituals.&lt;ref name=djr&gt;De John Romus (1995), [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/ijt/37-1_001.pdf Karma and Bhakti ways of Salvation: A Christological Perspective], Indian Journal of Theology, Volume 37, Issue 1, pages 1–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dsr&gt;De Smet, R. (1977), A Copernican Reversal: The Gītākāra's Reformulation of Karma, Philosophy East and West, 27(1), pages 53–63&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vishnu Smriti]], the image of hope, morals and work is represented as the virtuous man who rides in a chariot directed by his hopeful mind to his desired wishes, drawn by his five senses, who keeps the chariot on the path of the virtuous, and thus is not distracted by the wrongs such as wrath, greed, and other vices.&lt;ref name=mb&gt;[[Maurice Bloomfield]], [https://archive.org/details/jstor-592741 The Mind as Wish-Car in the Veda], Journal of the American Oriental Society, Volume 39, pages 280–282&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centuries that followed, the concept of ''karma'' changed from sacramental rituals to actual human action that builds and serves society and human existence&lt;ref name=djr/&gt;&lt;ref name=dsr/&gt;–a philosophy epitomized in the [[Bhagavad Gita]]. Hope, in the structure of beliefs and motivations, is a long-term ''karmic'' concept.

{{Hinduism}}

'''Ishvara''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ईश्वर, [[IAST]]: Īśvara) is a concept in [[Hinduism]], with a wide range of meanings that depend on the era and the school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara/&gt;&lt;ref name=riepe/&gt; In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, depending on the context, ''Ishvara'' can mean supreme soul, ruler, lord, king, queen  or husband.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara/&gt; In medieval era Hindu texts, depending on the school of Hinduism, ''Ishvara'' means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]].&lt;ref name=riepe/&gt;&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt;&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73/&gt;

In [[Shaivism]], ''Ishvara'' is synonymous with "[[Shiva]]", sometimes as ''Maheshvara'' or ''Parameshvara'' meaning the "Supreme lord", or as an [[Ishta-deva]] (personal god).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=235, 379–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vaishnavism]], it is synonymous with [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=olilea/&gt; In traditional [[Bhakti]] movements, Ishvara is one or more deities of an individual's preference from Hinduism's polytheistic canon of deities. In modern sectarian movements such as [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Brahmoism]], Ishvara takes the form of a monotheistic  God.&lt;ref name=rkpr/&gt; In [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of Hinduism, it is any "personal deity" or "spiritual inspiration".&lt;ref name=lpfl/&gt; In [[Advaita Vedanta]] school, Ishvara is a monistic Universal Absolute that connects and is the Oneness in everyone and everything.&lt;ref name=lance&gt;Lance Nelson (1996), Living liberation in Shankara and classical Advaita, in Living Liberation in Hindu Thought (Editors: Andrew O. Fort, Patricia Y. Mumme), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791427064}}, pages 38-39, 59 (footnote 105)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jkoller/&gt;

==Etymology==
The root of the word Ishvara comes from ''īś-'' (ईश, Ish) which means "capable of" and "owner, ruler, chief of",&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell]] (2004), A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820005}}, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately cognate with English ''own'' (Germanic ''[[:wikt:agnian|*aigana-]]'', PIE ''*aik-''). The second part of the word ''Ishvara'' is ''vara'' which means depending on context, "best, excellent, beautiful", "choice, wish, blessing, boon, gift", and "suitor, lover, one who solicits a girl in marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonell (2004), A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820005}}, page 270&lt;/ref&gt; The composite word, ''Ishvara'' literally means "owner of best, beautiful", "ruler of choices, blessings, boons", or "chief of suitor, lover".

As a concept, ''Ishvara'' in ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts, variously means God, Supreme Being, Supreme Soul, lord, king or ruler, rich or wealthy man, god of love, deity Shiva, one of the [[Rudra]]s, prince, husband and the number eleven.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara&gt;Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/ Search for Izvara], University of Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apte Sanskrit-English dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/AP90Scan/2014/web/webtc2/index.php Search for Izvara], University of Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Ishvara", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 306&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Īśvara'' never appears in [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name=madhav/&gt; However, the verb ''īś-'' does appear in Rig veda, where the context suggests that the meaning of it is "capable of, able to".&lt;ref name=madhav&gt;Madhav Deshpande (1991), Sense and Syntax in Vedic (Editors: Joel Brereton and Stephenie Jamison), Volumes 4-5, Brill, {{ISBN|978-9004093560}}, pages 23-27&lt;/ref&gt; It is absent in [[Samaveda]], is rare in [[Atharvaveda]], appears in [[Samhita]]s of [[Yajurveda]]. The contextual meaning, however as the ancient Indian grammarian [[Pāṇini]] explains, is neither god nor supreme being.&lt;ref name=madhav/&gt;

The word ''Ishvara'' appears in numerous ancient [[Dharmaśāstra#Principal Root Texts|Dharmasutra]]s. However, [[Patrick Olivelle]] states that there ''Ishvara'' does not mean God, but means [[Veda]]s.&lt;ref name=patrick/&gt; Deshpande states that ''Ishvara'' in Dharmasutras could alternatively mean king, with the context literally asserting that "the Dharmasutras are as important as ''Ishvara'' (the king) on matters of public importance".&lt;ref name=patrick&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2006), Between the Empires : Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE: Society in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195305326}}, page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Saivite]] traditions of [[Hinduism]], the term is used as part of the compound "[[Maheshvara]]" ("great lord") as a name for [[Shiva]].  In [[Mahayana Buddhism]] it is used as part of the compound "[[Avalokiteśvara]]" ("lord who hears the cries of the world"), the name of a [[bodhisattva]] revered for his compassion. When referring to divine as female, particularly in [[Shaktism]], the feminine ''{{IAST|Īśvarī}}'' is sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
Among the six systems of [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa]] do not consider the concept of ''Ishvara'', i.e., a supreme being, relevant. [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Vedanta]] and [[Nyaya]] schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara, but assign different meanings.

Desmarais states that Isvara is a metaphysical concept in Yogasutras.&lt;ref name=mmd&gt;Michele Marie Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds : Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patanjali's Yoga-Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120833364}}, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; It does not mention deity anywhere, nor does it mention any devotional practices (''[[Bhakti]]''), nor does it give ''Ishvara'' characteristics typically associated with a deity.&lt;ref name=mmd/&gt; In Yoga school of Hinduism, states Whicher, Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt; Whicher also notes that some theistic sub-schools of Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, inspired by the Yoga school, explain the term ''Ishvara'' as the "Supreme Being that rules over the cosmos and the individuated beings".&lt;ref name=ianw&gt;Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana, State University of New York press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, pages 82-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="knut"/&gt; Malinar states that in Samkhya-Yoga schools of Hinduism, ''Isvara'' is neither a creator-God, nor a savior-God.&lt;ref&gt;A Malinar (2014), Current Approaches: Articles on Key Themes, in The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmer in his 1951 Indian philosophies book noted that the Bhakti sub-schools refer to Isvara as a Divine Lord, or the deity of specific Bhakti sub-school.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer (1951), Philosophies of India, Reprinted by Routledge in 2008, {{ISBN|978-0415462327}}, pages 242-243, 309-311&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sectarian movements have emphasized Ishvara as Supreme Lord; for example, [[ISKCON|Hare Krishna]] movement considers Krishna as the Lord,&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner (1997), A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700710492}}, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Brahmoism]] movements – influenced by Christian and Islamic movements in India – conceptualize Ishvara as a monotheistic all powerful Lord.&lt;ref name=rkpr&gt;RK Pruthi (2004), Arya Samaj and Indian Civilization, {{ISBN|978-8171417803}}, pages 5-6, 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional theistic sub-schools of Hinduism, such as the [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] of Ramanuja and [[Dvaita|Dvaita Vedanta]] of Madhva, Ishvara is identified as Lord Vishnu/Narayana, that is distinct from the ''Prakriti'' (material world) and ''Purusa'' (soul, spirit).

Radhakrishnan and Moore state that these variations in ''Isvara'' concept is consistent with Hinduism's notion of "personal God" where the "ideals or manifestation of individual's highest Self values that are esteemed".&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan and Moore (1967, Reprinted 1989), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019581}}, pages 37-39, 401-403, 498-503&lt;/ref&gt; Riepe, and others,&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73&gt;Mircea Eliade (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691142036}}, pages 73-76&lt;/ref&gt; state that schools of Hinduism leave the individual with freedom and choice of conceptualizing Isvara in any meaningful manner he or she wishes, either in the form of "deity of one's choice" or "formless [[Brahman]] (Absolute Reality, Universal Principle, true special Self)".&lt;ref name=riepe&gt;Dale Riepe (1961, Reprinted 1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 177-184, 208-215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1975), Our savage god: The perverse use of eastern thought, {{ISBN|978-0836206111}}, pages 69-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1966), Hinduism, Oxford University Press, 1980 edition: pages 126-129, Reprinted in 1983 as {{ISBN|978-0198880127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Samkhya school of Hinduism===
[[Samkhya]] is called one of the several major atheistic schools of Hinduism by some scholars.&lt;ref name=lpfl&gt;Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Garbe (2013), Die Samkhya-Philosophie, Indische Philosophie Volume 11, {{ISBN|978-1484030615}}, pages 25-27 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[:no:Knut A. Jacobsen|Jacobsen]], Samkhya is more accurately described as non-theistic.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; Isvara is considered an irrelevant concept, neither defined nor denied, in Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Yoga school of Hinduism===
The Yogasutras of Patanjali, the foundational text of [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of Hinduism, uses the term ''Ishvara'' in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Ever since the Sutra's release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is ''Isvara''? These commentaries range from defining ''Isvara'' from a "personal god" to "special self" to "anything that has spiritual significance to the individual".&lt;ref name=lpfl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Parabhaktisutra, Aporisms on Sublime Devotion, (Translator: A Chatterjee), in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 55-93; Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Eternally Liberated Isvara and Purusa Principle, in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; Whicher explains that while Patanjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of ''Isvara'' in Yoga philosophy functions as a "transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, page 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali defines ''Isvara'' (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as "a special Self (पुरुषविशेष, ''puruṣa-viśeṣa'')",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Āgāśe|first1=K. S.|title=Pātañjalayogasūtrāṇi|date=1904|publisher=Ānandāśrama|location=Puṇe|page=25|url=https://archive.org/stream/patanjaliyoga/yoga_sutras_three_commentaries#page/n33/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sanskrit: {{IAST|क्लेश कर्म विपाकाशयैःपरामृष्टः पुरुषविशेष '''ईश्वरः''' ॥२४॥}}&lt;br&gt;
– Yoga Sutras I.24&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sutra of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism adds the characteristics of ''Isvara'' as that special Self which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, ''aparamrsta'') by one's obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, ''klesha''), one's circumstances created by past or one's current actions (कर्म, ''karma''), one's life fruits (विपाक, ''vipâka''), and one's psychological dispositions/intentions (आशय, ashaya).&lt;ref name=se5&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=aparAmRSTa&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes aparAmRSTa], [http://spokensanskrit.de kleza, karma, vipaka and ashaya]; Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 31-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali's concept of Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt;&lt;ref name=knut&gt;[[:no:Knut A. Jacobsen|Knut Jacobsen]] (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vaisesika school of Hinduism===
[[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]] school of Hinduism, as founded by Kanada in 1st millennium BC, neither required nor relied on ''Ishvara'' for its [[atomism|atomistic]] naturalism philosophy. To it, substances and ''paramāṇu'' (atoms) were eternal, they moved and interacted based on impersonal, eternal ''adrsta'' (अदृष्ट, invisible) laws of nature.&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Goel (1984), Indian philosophy: Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and modern science, Sterling, {{ISBN|978-0865902787}}, pages 149-151&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''Ishvara'', among others, entered into Vaisheshika school many centuries later in 1st millennium AD.&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Collins (2000), The sociology of philosophies, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674001879}}, page 836&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution in ideas aimed to explain how and why its so-called "atoms" have a particular order and proportions. These later-age ancient Vaiśeṣika scholars retained their belief that substances are eternal, added Ishvara as another eternal who is also omniscient and omnipresent (not omnipotent). Ishvara did not create the world, according to this school of Hindu scholars, but He only created invisible laws that operate the world and then He becomes passive and lets those hidden universal laws do its thing.&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt; Thus, Vaisheshika's Ishvara mirrors [[Deus otiosus]] of [[Deism]]. Vaisheshika school's ''Ishvara'', states [[Klaus Klostermaier]], can be understood as an eternal God who co-exists in the universe with eternal substances and atoms, but He "winds up the clock, and lets it run its course".&lt;ref name=klausk&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, Third Edition, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0791470824}}, page 337&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Nyaya school of Hinduism===
Early [[Nyaya]] school scholars considered the hypothesis of Ishvara as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits. However, the early Nyaya scholars rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists.&lt;ref&gt;John Clayton (2010), Religions, Reasons and Gods: Essays in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Religion, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521126274}}, page 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Oberhammer (1965), Zum problem des Gottesbeweises in der Indischen Philosophie, Numen, 12: 1-34&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is Ishvara and various arguments to prove the existence of ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref name=fxc&gt;Francis X. Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, pages 18-19, 35-39&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nyayasutra's Book 4, Chapter 1 examines what causes production and destruction of entities (life, matter) in universe. It considers many hypotheses, including ''Ishvara''. Verses 19-21, postulates Ishvara exists and is the cause, states a consequence of postulate, then presents contrary evidence, and from contradiction concludes that the postulate must be invalid.&lt;ref name=fxc2/&gt;

{{Quote|

सिद्धान्तसूत्र : तत्कारितत्वादहेतुः&lt;br&gt;

Proposition sutra: '''Ishvara''' is the cause, since we see sometimes human action lacks fruits (results).&lt;br&gt;
Prima facie objection sutra: This is not so since, as a matter of fact, no fruit is accomplished without human action.&lt;br&gt;

Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Centuries later, the 5th century CE Nyaya school scholar Prastapada revisited the premise of Ishvara. He was followed by [[Udayana]], who in his text ''[[Nyayakusumanjali]]'', interpreted "it" in verse 4.1.21 of Nyaya Sutra above, as "human action" and "him" as "Ishvara", then he developed counter arguments to prove the existence of Ishvara.&lt;ref name=csharma&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp. 209-10&lt;/ref&gt; In developing his arguments, he inherently defined ''Ishvara'' as efficient cause, omnipotent, omniscient, infallible, giver of gifts, ability and meaning to humanity, divine creator of the world as well as the moral principles, and the unseen power that makes the [[karma]] doctrine work.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VR Rao (1987), Selected Doctrines from Indian Philosophy, {{ISBN|81-70990009}}, pages 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Mimamsa school of Hinduism===
[[Mīmāṃsā]] scholars of Hinduism questioned what is ''Ishvara'' (God)?&lt;ref name=fxc3&gt;FX Clooney (1997), What’s a god? The quest for the right understanding of devatā in Brāhmaṅical ritual theory (Mīmāṃsā), International Journal of Hindu Studies, August 1997, Volume 1, Issue 2, pages 337-385&lt;/ref&gt; They used their ''[[pramana]]'' tools to cross examine answers offered by other schools of Hinduism. For example, when Nyaya scholars stated God is omnipotent, omniscient and infallible, that the world is the result of God's creation which is proved by the presence of creatures, just like human work proves human existence, Mimamsa scholars asked, why does this God create the world, for what reason? Further, they added, it cannot be because of Ishvara's love to human beings because this world – if Ishvara created it – is imperfect and human souls are suffering in it. Mimamsa scholars of Hinduism raised numerous objections to any definition of Ishvara along with its premises, deconstructed justifications offered, and considered Ishvara concept unnecessary for a consistent philosophy and moksha (soteriology).&lt;ref name=fxc3/&gt;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P. Bilimoria (2001), Hindu doubts about God: Towards Mimamsa Deconstruction, in Philosophy of Religion: Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Volume 4, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3611-2}}, pages 87-106&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vedanta school of Hinduism===

====Advaita Vedanta====
[[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism proclaims that at the empirical level Ishvara is the cause of the universe and the one who awards the fruits of every action. He is defined as the one without likes and dislikes, as well embodied with compassion (vaiShamya NairgghruNya doSha vihInaH).  Ishvara is that which is "free from ''avidya'' (ignorance), free from ''ahamkrti'' (ego-sense), free from ''bandhana'' (bondage)", a Self that is "pure, enlightened, liberated".&lt;ref name=lance/&gt;&lt;ref name=jkoller&gt;John Koller (2012), Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415782944}}, pages 99-107&lt;/ref&gt; 
Having accepted and established Ishvara, Advaita Vedanta proclaims that the real nature of Ishvara (existence, consciousness and bliss) is non different from the real nature of an individual. This gives room in Advaita Vedanta to show the nature of Ishvara as both the material and instrumental cause of this universe and the individual who is limited in his own capacities as unreal and declare that there is oneness between the two having negated the qualities. This establishes Ishvara as 'saguNa' or with attributes from the empirical existence and 'nirguNa' from the absolute sense.  This oneness is accepted only at the level of 'mukti' or ultimate realization and not at the 'vyavahara' or empirical level. At the absolute level there is no otherness nor distinction between ''Jiva'' (living being) and ''Ishvara'', and any attempts to distinguish the two is a false idea, one based on wrong knowledge, according to Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hacker (1978), Eigentumlichkeiten dr Lehre und Terminologie Sankara: Avidya, Namarupa, Maya, Isvara, in Kleine Schriften (Editor: L. Schmithausen), Franz Steiner Verlag, Weisbaden, pages 101-109 (in German), also pages 69-99&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
ईश्वरः अहम् &lt;br&gt;
Ishvara, I am.
|[[Adi Shankara]]| Upadesasahasri 2.3.1, 2.10.8 &lt;ref name=lance/&gt;}}

Other Advaitin Hindu texts resonate with the [[monism|monist]] views of Adi Shankara. For example, Isa Upanishad, in hymn 1.5-7, states Ishvara is "above everything, outside everything, beyond everything, yet also within everything"; he who knows himself as all beings and all beings as himself – he never becomes alarmed before anyone. He becomes free from fears, from delusions, from root cause of evil. He becomes pure, invulnerable, unified, free from evil, true to truth, liberated like Ishvara.&lt;ref&gt;William Indich (2000), Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812512}}, page 23-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, pages 547-551&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-------------Commenting out these sentences as all of it failed verification. If alternate reliable source(s) with page numbers can be cited, please re-add

[[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitism]] holds that when human beings think of [[Brahman]], the Supreme Cosmic Spirit is projected upon the limited, finite human mind and appears as ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|81-208-2144-0}}"&gt;See generally, Sinha, H.P. (1993), ''Bhāratīya Darshan kī rūprekhā'' (Features of Indian Philosophy). Motilal Banarasidas Publ. {{ISBN|81-208-2144-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=January 2015}} Therefore, the mind projects human attributes, such as personality, motherhood, and fatherhood on the Supreme Being. An interesting metaphor is that when the "reflection" of the Cosmic Spirit falls upon the mirror of ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'' (''{{IAST|Māyā}}''; the principle of illusion, which binds the mind), it appears as the Supreme Lord.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|81-208-2144-0}}"/&gt;{{pn|date=January 2015}} Brahman is not thought to have such attributes in the true sense.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|1-884852-02-5}}"&gt;See generally, Swami Bhaskarananda, ''The Essentials of Hinduism'' (Viveka Press 1994) {{ISBN|1-884852-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=January 2015}} However it may be helpful to project such attributes onto Brahman.
------------&gt;

====Vishishtadvaita Vedanta====
''Ishvara'', in [[Vishishtadvaita]] Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism, is a composite concept of dualism and non-dualism, or "non-dualism with differentiation".&lt;ref name=mcc&gt;McCasland et al. (1969), Religions of the world, Random House, {{ISBN|978-0394303840}}, page 471&lt;/ref&gt; Ishvara, Vishishtadvaitin scholars such as the 11th century [[Ramanuja]] state, is the supreme creator and synonymous with [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="Chari1988p212"&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

Srinivasa Chari|title=Tattvamuktākalāpa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un1i5icdpdoC |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0266-7|pages=212, 231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equated with Vishnu in Vishishtadvaita or one of his [[avatar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. M.

Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita concepts provided the foundation for several Bhakti movements of Hinduism, such as those by [[Sri Aurobindo]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, page 151&lt;/ref&gt; and has been suggested as having influenced Basava's [[Lingayatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|978-0813540689}}, pages 243-244&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dvaita Vedanta====
The Dvaita ([[Dualistic cosmology#In Hinduism|dualism]]) sub-school of Vedanta Hinduism, founded by 13th century Madhva, defines ''Ishvara'' as creator God that is distinct from ''Jiva'' (individual souls in living beings).&lt;ref name=rajpra&gt;R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narayana]] (Vishnu) is considered to be ''Ishvara'', and the [[Vaishnavism]] movement arose on the foundation developed by Dvaita Vedanta sub-school.&lt;ref name=olilea&gt;Oliver Leaman (2000), Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173582}}, page 251&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ishvara'' (God) is a complete, perfect and the highest reality to Dvaitins, and simultaneously the world is separate reality for them, unlike competing thoughts in other sub-schools of Vedanta.&lt;ref name=olilea/&gt; In [[Dvaita]] sub-school, ''Jiva'' (individual soul) is different, yet dependent on ''Ishvara'' (God). Both possess the attributes of consciousness, bliss and existence, but the individual soul is considered atomic, while God is all encompassing. The attributes of ''Jiva'' struggle to manifest, while of God it is fully manifested.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt;

Madhva states there are five permutations of differences between ''Jiva'' (individual souls) and ''Ishvara'' (God): between God and souls, between God and matter, between souls and matter, between one soul and another soul, and between one material thing and another material thing. The differences are both qualitative and quantitative.&lt;ref name=tompad/&gt; Unlike Advaita Vedantins who hold that knowledge can lead to Oneness with Everyone and fusion with Universal Absolute, to the state of [[moksha]] in this life, Dvaita Vedantins hold that moksha is possible only in after-life if God so wills (if not, then one's soul is reborn). Further, Madhva highlights that God creates individual souls, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.&lt;ref name=tompad&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

The world, called ''Maya'', is held as the divine will of Ishvara.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt; ''Jiva'' suffers, experiences misery and bondage, state Dvaitins, because of "ignorance and incorrect knowledge" (''ajnana''). Liberation occurs with the correct knowledge and attainment unto Lord Narayana.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt; It is His grace that gives salvation according to Dvaita sub-school, which is achievable by predominance of ''sattva'' [[Guṇa|guna]] (moral, constructive, simple, kindness-filled life), and therefore Dvaitins must live a [[Dharma|dharmic]] life while constantly remembering, deeply loving ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref name=rajpra/&gt;

====Achintya-Bheda-Abheda====
{{IAST|Acintya bhedābheda}} is a sub-school of [[Vedanta]] representing the philosophy of ''inconceivable one-ness and difference'', in relation to the power creation and creator, Ishvara, ([[Krishna]]).&lt;ref name=Kaviraja&gt;{{cite book | author = Kaviraja, K.G. | year = | title =  Sri Caitanya-caritamrita. Bengali text, translation, and commentary by AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada | publisher = [[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] | isbn =}}[http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/108-109/en1 ''Madhya'' 20.108-109] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511153501/http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/108-109/en1 |date=11 May 2008 }} "It is the living entity's constitutional position to be an eternal servant of Krishna because he is the marginal energy of Krishna and a manifestation simultaneously one with and different from the Lord, like a molecular particle of sunshine or fire."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Kṛṣṇa Upaniṣad}} 1.25: ''{{IAST|...na bhinnam. nā bhinnamābhirbhinno na vai vibhuḥ}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sanskrit]] ''achintya'' means 'inconceivable', ''bheda'' translates as 'difference', and ''abheda'' translates as 'one-ness'. Spirit souls are considered part of God and thus one with Him in quality, and yet at the same time different from Him in quantity. This is called acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva, inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spiritual Dialectics|last=Mukundananda|first=Swami|publisher=Jagadguru Kripaluji Yog|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=96|quote=Hence, he called his philosophy Achintya Bhedabhed vad, or Inconceivable Simultaneous Oneness and Difference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caitanya's philosophy of acintya-bhedābheda-tattva completed the progression to devotional [[theism]]. [[Rāmānuja]] had agreed with [[Śaṅkara|{{IAST|Śaṅkara}}]] that the Absolute is one only, but he had disagreed by affirming individual variety within that oneness. [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] had underscored the eternal duality of the Supreme and the [[Jiva|Jīva]]: he had maintained that this duality endures even after liberation. Caitanya, in turn, specified that the Supreme and the jīvas are "inconceivably, simultaneously one and different" (acintya-bheda-abheda).&lt;ref name = SDG&gt;{{Cite book| first = dasa Goswami| last = Satsvarupa| author-link = Satsvarupa dasa Goswami| title =Readings in Vedit Literature: The Tradition Speaks for Itself|   publisher = Assoc Publishing Group| year = 1976| pages = 240 pages | isbn = 0-912776-88-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Carvaka school of Hinduism===
[[Cārvāka]], another atheist tradition in Hinduism, was materialist and a school of [[philosophical scepticism]]. They rejected all concepts of ''Ishvara'' as well as all forms of supernaturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Flint, {{Google books|7es0AQAAIAAJ|Anti-theistic theories|page=463}}, Appendix Note VII - Hindu Materialism: The Charvaka System; William Blackwood, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.V. Raman (2012), Hinduism and Science: Some Reflections, Zygon - Journal of Religion and Science, 47(3): 549–574, Quote (page 557): "Aside from nontheistic schools like the [[Samkhya]], there have also been explicitly atheistic schools in the Hindu tradition. One virulently anti-supernatural system is/was the so-called Carvaka school.", {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9744.2012.01274.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KN Tiwari (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816077}}, page 67, Quote: "Of the three heterodox systems, the remaining one, the Caravaka system, is a Hindu system."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19315">The '''Jewish skeleton collection''' was an attempt by the Nazis to create an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] display to showcase the alleged racial inferiority of the "[[Jews|Jewish]] race" and to emphasize the Jews' status as ''[[Untermensch]]en'' ("sub-humans"), in contrast to the [[Germans|German]] race, which the Nazis considered to be [[Aryan]] ''[[Übermensch]]en''. The collection was to be housed at the Anatomy Institute at the [[Reichsuniversität Straßburg|Reich University of Strasbourg]] in the annexed region of [[Alsace]], where the initial preparation of the corpses was performed.

The collection was sanctioned by  Reichsführer of the SS [[Heinrich Himmler]], and designed by and under the direction of [[August Hirt]] with [[Rudolf Brandt]] and [[Wolfram Sievers]], general manager of the [[Ahnenerbe]], being responsible for procuring and preparing the corpses.

Work by [[Hans-Joachim Lang]] published in 2004 revealed the identities and family history of all the victims of this project, based on discovery of the prisoner numbers found at Natzweiler-Struthof in records of those vaccinated against typhus at Auschwitz. The list of names has been placed on a memorial at the cemetery where all were buried, at the facility used to murder them, and at the Anatomical Institute where the corpses were found in 1944.

==Selection==

The project was designed by August Hirt, who directed the phases that were performed before the end of the war ceased the project prior to its completion. Originally the "specimens" to be used in the collection were to be Jewish [[Commissar|commisars]] in the [[Red Army]] captured on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]] by the [[Wehrmacht]]. The 86 individuals ultimately chosen for the collection were obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish inmates at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Occupied Poland]]. They were chosen for their perceived [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] racial characteristics. The initial selections and preparations were carried out by SS-Hauptsturmführer Dr. [[Bruno Beger]] and Dr. [[Hans Fleischhacker]], who arrived in Auschwitz in the first half of 1943 and finished the preliminary work by June 15, 1943. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Due to a [[typhus]] [[epidemic]] at Auschwitz, the candidates chosen for the skeleton collection were [[quarantine]]d in order to prevent them from becoming ill and ruining their value as anatomical specimens. In that time, the physical measurements were taken from the selected group of people. An excerpt from a letter written by Sievers in June 1943 reports on the preparation and the typhus epidemic: "Altogether 115 persons were worked on, 79 were Jews, 30 were Jewesses, 2 were Poles, and 4 were Asiatics. At the present time these prisoners are segregated by sex and are under [[quarantine]] in the two hospital buildings of Auschwitz."
In February 1942, Sievers submitted to Himmler, through Rudolf Brandt, a report from which the following is an extract read at the Nuremberg Doctors Trial by  General [[Telford Taylor]], Chief Counsel for the prosecution at Nuremberg:

{{quote|We have a nearly complete collection of skulls of all races and peoples at our disposal. Only very few specimens of skulls of the Jewish race, however, are available with the result that it is impossible to arrive at precise conclusions from examining them. The [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war in the East]] now presents us with the opportunity to overcome this deficiency. By procuring the skulls of the Jewish-[[Bolshevik]] [[Commissar]]s, who represent the prototype of the repulsive, but characteristic subhuman, we have the chance now to obtain a palpable, scientific document.

The best, practical method for obtaining and collecting this skull material could be handled by directing the Wehrmacht to turn over alive all captured Jewish-Bolshevik Commissars to the [[Feldgendarmerie|Field Police]]. They in turn are to be given special directives to inform a certain office at regular intervals of the number and place of detention of these captured Jews and to give them special close attention and care until a special delegate arrives. This special delegate, who will be in charge of securing the "material" has the job of taking a series of previously established photographs, anthropological measurements, and in addition has to determine, as far as possible, the background, date of birth, and other personal data of the prisoner. Following the subsequently induced death of the Jew, whose head should not be damaged, the delegate will separate the head from the body and will forward it to its proper point of destination in a [[Hermetic seal|hermetically]] sealed tin can especially produced for this purpose and filled with a conserving fluid.

Having arrived at the laboratory, the comparison tests and anatomical research on the skull, as well as determination of the race membership of pathological features of the skull form, the form and size of the brain, etc., can proceed. The basis of these studies will be the photos, measurements, and other data supplied on the head, and finally the tests of the skull itself.}}

==Preparation==

Ultimately, 87 of the inmates were shipped to [[Natzweiler-Struthof]]. These people were kept for about two weeks in Block 13 of the camp so that they might eat well to improve their appearance for the desired casts of their corpses. The deaths of 86 of these inmates were, in the words of Hirt, "induced" in an improvised [[Gas chamber|gassing facility]] at [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], and their corpses were sent to Strasbourg — 57 men and 29 women. The gassing occurred on August 11, 13, 17, and 19th, conducted by commandant [[Josef Kramer]], who directed the victims to undress, placed the poison in the ventilation, and watched the people fall to their deaths. One victim was shot for fighting to avoid being gassed and thus was not part of the collection.&lt;ref name=Bernas&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rfi.fr/hebdo/20141024-au-nom-de-la-race-et-de-la-science-documentaire-crime-nazi-meconnu-prime-waterloo/ |title=Un documentaire sur un crime nazi méconnu primé à Waterloo |trans-title=A documentary about a misunderstood Nazi crime winning at Waterloo |date=October 24, 2014 |accessdate=March 8, 2016 |author=Bernas, Anne |language=French |publisher=RFI les voix du monde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josef Kramer, acting commandant of Natzweiler-Struthof (who became the commandant at Auschwitz and the last commandant of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen Belsen]]), personally carried out the gassing of the victims, per his testimony at his post-war trial.

The next part of the process for this "collection" was to make anatomical casts of the bodies prior to reducing them to skeletons. With the approach of the Allies in 1944, there was concern over the possibility that the corpses could be discovered, as they had still not been [[excarnation|defleshed]]. In September 1944, Sievers telegrammed Brandt: "The collection can be defleshed and rendered unrecognizable. This, however, would mean that the whole work had been done for nothing-at least in part-and that this singular collection would be lost to science, since it would be impossible to make plaster casts afterwards."

He was chosen to be an anatomical specimen, shipped to [[Natzweiler-Struthof]] and executed in the gas chamber in August 1943]]

Some work had been done at the Anatomical Institute, but the project was never completed. The body casts were not made, and the corpses were not defleshed as skeletons. When the Allies arrived, they found the corpses, some complete and some beheaded, preserved by formalin.&lt;ref name="Bazelon" /&gt;

==Aftermath==


Brandt and Sievers were indicted, tried, and convicted in the [[Doctors' Trial]] in [[Nuremberg]], and both were hanged in [[Landsberg Prison]] on June 2, 1948. Josef Kramer was convicted of war crimes and hanged in {{ill|Hamelin prison|de|Gefängnis Hameln}} by British executioner [[Albert Pierrepoint]] on December 13, 1945. August Hirt, who conceived the project, was sentenced to death in absentia at the Military War Crimes Trial at Metz on 23 December 1953.&lt;ref name=LangZeit /&gt; It was unknown at the time that Hirt had shot himself in the head on June 2, 1945 near the town of [[Schluchsee, Baden-Württemberg|Schluchsee]], while hiding in the [[Black Forest]].&lt;ref name=LangZeit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Hans-Joachim |title=Skelette für Straßburg Eines der grausigsten Wissenschaftsverbrechen des "Dritten Reiches" ist endlich aufgeklärt |trans-title=Skeletons for Strasbourg: One of the most gruesome crimes of science in the "Third Reich" is finally cleared |url=http://www.zeit.de/2004/35/A-Strassburg|website=Die Zeit|accessdate=April 3, 2016|language=German|date=19 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Bruno Beger was convicted by a West German court as an accessory to 86 murders for his role in procuring the victims of the Jewish skeleton collection.

For many years, only a single victim was positively identified through the efforts of [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld]]: Menachem Taffel (prisoner no. 107969), a [[Polish Jew|Polish born Jew]] who had been living in [[Berlin]]. In 2003, Dr. [[Hans-Joachim Lang]], a German professor at the [[University of Tübingen]], succeeded in identifying all the victims by comparing a list of inmate numbers of the 86 corpses at the Reichs University in Strasbourg, surreptitiously recorded by Hirt's French assistant Henri Henrypierre, with a list of numbers of inmates vaccinated at Auschwitz. The names and biographical information of the victims were published in the book ''Die Namen der Nummern'' (''The Names of the Numbers'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Namen der Nummern:  Wie es gelang, die 86 Opfer eines NS-Verbrechens zu identifizieren |trans-title=The names of the numbers: How it was possible to identify the 86 victims of a Nazi crime |edition=hardback |author=Hans-Joachim Lang |publisher=Hoffmann + Campe Vlg GmbH |date=August 31, 2004 |isbn=3-455-09464-3 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Gordon and Joachim Zepelin translated the Introduction to the book into English at the web site where the whole book is posted in German, including the biographies of the 86 people.&lt;ref name=LangEng&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.die-namen-der-nummern.de/html/the_names.html |title=Die Namen Der Nummern |year=2007 |author=Rachel Gordon, translator |author2=Joachim Zepelin, translator |location=Berlin |accessdate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208080253/http://die-namen-der-nummern.de/html/the_names.html |archivedate=February 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang recounts in detail the story of how he determined the identities of the 86 victims gassed for Dr. August Hirt's project of the Jewish skeleton collection.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''k''-cell (mathematics)}}
A '''''k''-cell''' is a higher-dimensional version of a rectangle or [[rectangular solid]]. It is the [[Cartesian product]] of ''k'' [[closed set|closed]] intervals on the [[real line]].&lt;ref name="Foran1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foran|first=James|title=Fundamentals of Real Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDjz8x0hJ44C&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=23 May 2014|date=1991-01-07|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780824784539|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a ''k''-dimensional rectangular solid has each of its edges equal to one of the closed intervals used in the definition.  The ''k'' intervals need not be identical. For example, a 2-cell is a rectangle in {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} such that the sides of the rectangles are parallel to the coordinate axes.

== Formal definition ==

Let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  ∈ {{nowrap|1='''R'''}} and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  ∈ {{nowrap|1='''R'''}}. If ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' = 1,...,''k'', the set of all points '''x''' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) in {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} whose coordinates satisfy the inequalities ''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a '''''k''-cell'''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudin, W: ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis'', page 31. McGraw-Hill, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
Every ''k''-cell is [[compact (mathematics)|compact]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudin, W: ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis'', page 39. McGraw-Hill, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intuition ==

A ''k''-cell of dimension ''k'' ≤ 3 is especially simple. For example, a 1-cell is simply the interval [''a'',''b''] with ''a'' &lt; ''b''. A 2-cell is the rectangle formed by the Cartesian product of two closed intervals, and a 3-cell is a rectangular solid. 

The sides and edges of a ''k''-cell need not be equal in (Euclidean) length; although the [[unit cube]] (which has boundaries of equal Euclidean length) is a 3-cell, the set of all 3-cells with equal-length edges is a strict subset of the set of all 3-cells.

In perceiving a sequence of consecutive stimuli, subjects tend to overestimate the elapsed time between two successive stimuli when the distance between the stimuli is sufficiently large, and to underestimate the elapsed time when the distance is sufficiently small.

==In different sensory modalities==
The kappa effect can occur with visual (e.g., flashes of light), auditory (e.g., tones), or tactile (e.g. taps to the skin) stimuli. Many studies of the kappa effect have been conducted using visual stimuli. For example, suppose three light sources, X, Y, and Z, are flashed successively in the dark with equal time intervals between each of the flashes. If the light sources are placed at different positions, with X and Y closer together than Y and Z, the temporal interval between the X and Y flashes is perceived to be shorter than that between the Y and Z flashes.&lt;ref name="TAU-AND KAPPA-EFECTS"&gt;TAU- AND KAPPA-EFFECTS.

Advances in Sound Localization, 95-104&lt;/ref&gt; In touch, the kappa effect was first described as the "S-effect" by Suto (1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suto|first=Y|title=The effect of space on time estimation (S-effect) in tactual space|journal=Japanese Journal of Psychology|year=1952|volume=22|pages=45–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; refers to the kappa effect as "perceptual time dilation" in analogy with the physical [[time dilation]] of the [[theory of relativity]].

==Theories based in velocity expectation==
Physically, traversed space and elapsed time are linked by velocity. Accordingly, several theories regarding the brain's expectations about stimulus velocity have been put forward to account for the kappa effect.

===Constant velocity expectation===
According to the constant velocity hypothesis proposed by Jones and Huang (1982), the brain incorporates a prior expectation of speed when judging spatiotemporal intervals. Specifically, the brain expects temporal intervals that would produce constant velocity (i.e., [[Kinematics|uniform motion]]) movement.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, B. &amp; Huang, Y. L. (1982). Space-time dependencies in psychophysical judgment of extent and duration: algebraic models of the tau and kappa effects. Psychological Bulletin, 91(1), 128-142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masuda"&gt;Masuda, T., Kimura, A., Dan, I. &amp; Wada, Y. (2011). Effects of environmental context on temporal perception bias in apparent motion" ''Vision Research'' 51, 1728-1740&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the kappa effect occurs when we apply our knowledge of motion to stimulus sequences, which sometimes leads us to make mistakes.&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;Dr. Molly J. Henry, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences; Leipzig, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the role of a uniform motion expectation in temporal perception comes from a study&lt;ref name="Sarrazin"&gt;Sarrazin, J. C., Giraudo, M. D., Pailhous, J., &amp; Bootsma, R. (2004). Dynamics of balancing space and time in memory: tau and kappa effects revisited. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 30(3), 411-430,&lt;/ref&gt; in which participants observed eight white dots that successively appeared in one direction in a horizontal alignment along a straight line. When the temporal separation was constant and the spatial separation between the dots varied, they observed the kappa effect, which follows the constant velocity hypothesis. However, when both the temporal and spatial separation between the dots varied, they failed to observe the response pattern that the constant velocity hypothesis predicts. A possible explanation is that it is difficult to perceive a uniform motion from such varying, complicated patterns; thus, the context of observed events may affect our temporal perception.

===Low-speed expectation===
A [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian]] perceptual model&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=D|title=A Bayesian perceptual model replicates the cutaneous rabbit and other tactile spatiotemporal illusions.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=Mar 28, 2007|volume=2|issue=3|pages=e333|pmid=17389923|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000333|pmc=1828626}}&lt;/ref&gt; replicates the tactile kappa effect and other tactile spatiotemporal illusions, including the tau effect and the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]]. According to this model, brain circuitry encodes the expectation that tactile stimuli tend to move slowly. The Bayesian model reaches an optimal probabilistic inference by combining uncertain spatial and temporal sensory information with a prior expectation for low-speed movement. The expectation that stimuli tend to move slowly results in the perceptual overestimation of the time elapsed between rapidly successive taps applied to separate skin locations. Simultaneously, the model perceptually underestimates the spatial separation between stimuli, thereby reproducing the cutaneous rabbit illusion and the tau effect. Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; speculated that a Bayesian slow-speed prior might explain the visual kappa effect as well the tactile one. Recent empirical studies support this suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Youguo|last2=Zhang|first2=Bangwu|last3=Kording|first3=Konrad Paul|authorlink3=Konrad Kording|last4=Luo|first4=Wenbo|title=Speed Constancy or Only Slowness: What Drives the Kappa Effect|journal=PLOS ONE|date=21 April 2016|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0154013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0154013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuroda|first1=Tsuyoshi|last2=Grondin|first2=Simon|last3=Miyazaki|first3=Makoto|last4=Ogata|first4=Katsuya|last5=Tobimatsu|first5=Shozo|title=The Kappa Effect With Only Two Visual Markers|journal=Multisensory Research|date=31 October 2016|volume=29|issue=8|pages=703–725|doi=10.1163/22134808-00002533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion in different contexts===
The kappa effect appears to depend strongly on phenomenal rather than physical extent.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; The kappa effect gets bigger as stimuli move faster.&lt;ref name="Masuda"/&gt; Observers tend to apply their previous knowledge of motion to a sequence of stimuli. When subjects observed vertically arranged stimuli, the kappa effect was stronger for sequences moving downward. This can be attributed to the expectation of downward acceleration and upward deceleration, in that the perceived accelerated downward motion causes us to underestimate temporal separation judgments.

==Related illusions==
If observers interpret rapid stimulus sequences in light of an expectation regarding velocity, then it would be expected that not only temporal, but also spatial illusions would result. This indeed occurs in the [[tau effect]], when the spatial separation between stimuli is constant and the temporal separation is varied. In this case, the observer decreases the judgment of spatial separation as temporal separation decreases, and vice versa. For example, when equally spaced light sources X, Y, and Z are flashed successively in the dark with a shorter time between X and Y than between Y and Z, X and Y are perceived to be closer together in space than are Y and Z.&lt;ref name="TAU-AND KAPPA-EFECTS" /&gt; Goldreich (2007) &lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; linked the tau and kappa effects to the same underlying expectation regarding movement speed. He noted that, when stimuli move rapidly across space, "perception strikingly shrinks the intervening distance, and expands the elapsed time, between consecutive events".&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; termed these two fundamental perceptual distortions "perceptual length contraction" (tau effect) and "perceptual time dilation" (kappa effect) in analogy with the physical [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]] of the [[theory of relativity]]. Perceptual length contraction and perceptual time dilation result from the same Bayesian observer model, one that expects stimuli to move slowly.&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; Analogously, in the theory of relativity, length contraction and time dilation both occur when a physical speed ([[Speed of light|the speed of light]]) cannot be exceeded.

The supposed '''Lady Macbeth effect''' or '''''Macbeth'' effect''' is a [[Priming (psychology)|priming effect]] said to occur when response to a [[cleanliness|cleaning]] cue is increased after having been induced by a feeling of [[shame]].&lt;ref name="zhong" /&gt; The effect is named after the [[Lady Macbeth]] character in the [[Shakespeare]] play ''[[Macbeth (play)|Macbeth]]''; she imagined [[Blood residue|bloodstain]]s on her hands after committing murder.

In one experiment, different groups of participants were asked to recall a good or bad past deed, after which they were asked to fill in the letters of three incomplete words: "W_&amp;nbsp;_H", "SH_&amp;nbsp;_ER" and "S_&amp;nbsp;_P". Those who had been asked to recall a bad deed were about 60% more likely to respond with cleansing-related words like "wash", "shower" and "soap" instead of alternatives such as "wish", "shaker" or "stop".&lt;ref name="zhong"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhong|first=Chen-Bo|author2=Katie Liljenquist |title=Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing|journal=Science|year=2006|volume=313|issue=5792|pages=1451–1452|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313/5792/1451|doi=10.1126/science.1130726|pmid=16960010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another experiment, experimenters were able to reduce [[choice-supportive bias]] by having subjects engage in forms of self-cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Spike W. S.|author2=Norbert Schwarz |title=Washing away postdecisional dissonance|journal=Science|year=2010|volume=328|issue=5979|pages=709|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/709.abstract|doi=10.1126/science.1186799|pmid=20448177}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The effect is apparently localized enough that those who had been asked to lie verbally preferred an oral cleaning product and those asked to lie in writing preferred a hand cleaning product over the other kind of cleanser and other control items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Spike W.

'''[[Law]] in [[Asia]]''' is undergoing rapid change and modernisation{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, especially given the economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]]. Asian countries share a substantial heritage with European law{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, whilst keeping their own distinct identity.

==History==
[[Image:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[preamble]] of the '''Constitution of India''']]
[[History of China|Ancient China]] and [[History of India|ancient India]] had historically independent schools of legal theory and practice such as the ''[[Manusmriti|Laws of Manu]]'' or the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' in India and [[traditional Chinese law]] in China. Because [[Germany]] was a rising power in the late 19th century, and codified [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is more 'exportable' than large bodies of common law jurisprudence, the German Civil Code has been highly influential for most oriental legal systems, and forms the basis of civil law in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In [[China]], the German Civil Code was introduced in the later years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and formed the basis of the law of the [[Republic of China]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} which remains in force in [[Taiwan]]. The current legal infrastructure in the [[People's Republic of China]] reflects influences from the German-based civil law, English-based common law in Hong Kong, Soviet-influenced [[Socialist law]], United States-style banking and securities law, and [[traditional Chinese law]]. In India, and other previous members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], English common law forms the basis of private law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24695">In common usage, the '''[[mass]]''' of an object is often referred to as its '''[[weight]]''', though these are in fact different concepts and quantities. In scientific contexts, mass is the amount of "[[matter]]" in an object (though "matter" may be difficult to define), whereas weight is the [[force]] exerted on an object by [[gravitation|gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;de Silva, G.M.S. (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbOf_Ap-ijkC&amp;dq=%22International+Prototype+Kilogram%22&amp;q=%22mass+and+weight+are+often+confused%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22mass%20and%20weight%20are%20often%20confused%22&amp;f=false Basic Metrology for ISO 9000 Certification], Butterworth-Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, an object with a mass of 1.0 kilogram will weigh approximately 9.81 newtons on the surface of the [[Earth]] (its mass multiplied by the [[gravity|gravitational field strength]]), since the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] is a unit of force, while the [[kilogram]] is a unit of mass. The object's weight will be less on [[Mars]] (where gravity is weaker), more on [[Saturn]], and negligible in space when far from any significant source of gravity, but it will always have the same mass.

Objects on the surface of the Earth have weight, although sometimes this weight is difficult to measure. An example is a small object floating in water, which does not appear to have weight since it is buoyed by the water; but it is found to have its usual weight when it is added to water in a container which is entirely supported by and weighed on a scale. Thus, the "weightless object" floating in water actually transfers its weight to the bottom of the container (where the pressure increases). Similarly, a balloon has mass but may appear to have no weight or even ''negative'' weight, due to [[buoyancy]] in air. However the weight of the balloon and the gas inside it has merely been transferred to a large area of the Earth's surface, making the weight difficult to measure. The weight of a flying airplane is similarly distributed to the ground, but does not disappear. If the airplane is in level flight, the same weight-force is distributed to the surface of the Earth as when the plane was on the runway, but spread over a larger area.

A better scientific definition of mass is its description as being composed of [[inertia]], which is the resistance of an object being accelerated when acted on by an external force. Gravitational "weight" is the force created when a mass is acted upon by a [[Gravitation|gravitational field]] and the object is not allowed to free-fall, but is supported or retarded by a mechanical force, such as the surface of a planet. Such a force constitutes weight.&lt;ref&gt;National Physical Laboratory: [http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/what-are-the-differences-between-mass,-weight,-force-and-load-(faq-mass-and-density) What are the differences between mass, weight, force and load? (FAQ - Mass &amp; Density)]&lt;/ref&gt; This force can be added to by any other kind of force.

While the ''weight'' of an object varies in proportion to the strength of the gravitational field, its ''mass'' is constant (ignoring [[Relativity theory|relativistic effects]]) as long as no energy or matter is added to the object.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Mass in special relativity]] for a discussion of mass in this context. An object or particle does not have to be traveling very close to the [[speed of light]], ''c'', for its [[Mass in special relativity|relativistic mass]], ''M'' (or&amp;nbsp;γ&lt;span style="margin-left:-0.15em"&gt;''m''&lt;/span&gt;) to vary measurably from its rest mass ''m''&lt;span style="margin-left:0.15em"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Per the [[Lorentz transformation]]s and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein’s]] 1905 paper, ''[[Special relativity|The Special Theory of Relativity]]'', relativistic mass is 0.5% greater than ''m''&lt;span style="margin-left:0.15em"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at only 9.96%&amp;nbsp;''c'', thus affecting measurements performed with a precision of 1%. Whereas 10% of the speed of light is exceedingly fast in most contexts, it is not "close to the speed of light".&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although a satellite in orbit (essentially a free-fall) is "weightless," it still retains its mass and inertia. Accordingly, even in orbit, an astronaut trying to accelerate the satellite in any direction will still be required to exert force, and will need to exert ten times as much force to accelerate a 10{{nbhyph}}ton satellite at the same rate as one with a mass of only 1&amp;nbsp;ton.

==Overview==
[[Image:8ball break.jpg|thumb|300px|Matter's mass strongly influences many familiar kinetic properties.]]
Mass is (among other properties) an ''[[inertia]]l'' property; that is, the tendency of an object to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside [[force]]. Under [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton's]] {{age|1687|1|1}}-year-old [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and an important formula that sprang from his work, {{nowrap|''F'' {{=}}&amp;thinsp;''ma'',}} an object with a mass, ''m'', of one [[kilogram]] will [[acceleration|accelerate]], ''a'', at one [[Metre per second squared|meter per second per second]] (about one-tenth the acceleration due to [[Earth's gravity|earth’s gravity]])&lt;ref&gt;In professional [[metrology]] (the  science of measurement), the acceleration of Earth’s gravity is taken as [[standard gravity]] (symbol: ''g''&lt;span style="margin-left:0.15em"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), which is defined as precisely {{val|fmt=commas|9.80665}}{{nbsp}}[[metre per second squared|meters{{nbsp}}per square second]] (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The expression {{nowrap|"1 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;"}} means that ''for every second that elapses'', velocity changes an additional 1&amp;nbsp;meter per second. An acceleration of 1{{nbsp}}m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the same rate of change in velocity as 3.6&amp;nbsp;km/h per second (≈2.2&amp;nbsp;mph per second).&lt;/ref&gt; when acted upon by a force, ''F'', of one [[Newton (unit)|newton]].

Inertia is seen when a [[bowling ball]] is pushed horizontally on a level, smooth surface, and continues in horizontal motion. This is quite distinct from its weight, which is the downwards gravitational force of the bowling ball one must counter when holding it off the floor. The weight of the bowling ball on the Moon would be one-sixth of that on the Earth, although its mass remains unchanged. Consequently, whenever the physics of ''recoil kinetics'' (mass, velocity, inertia, [[inelastic collision|inelastic]] and [[elastic collision]]s) dominate and the influence of gravity is a negligible factor, the behavior of objects remains consistent even where gravity is relatively weak. For instance, billiard balls on a billiard table would scatter and recoil with the same speeds and energies after a break shot on the Moon as on Earth; they would, however, drop into the pockets much more slowly.

In the physical sciences, the terms "mass" and "weight" are rigidly defined as separate measures, as they are different physical properties. In everyday use, as all everyday objects have both mass and weight and one is almost exactly proportional to the other, "weight" often serves to describe both properties, its meaning being dependent upon context. For example, in retail commerce, the "net weight" of products actually refers to mass, and is expressed in mass units such as grams or ounces (see also ''[[Pound (mass)#Use in commerce|Pound: Use in commerce]])''. Conversely, the [[Tire code|load index]] rating on automobile tires, which specifies the maximum [[structural load]] for a tire in kilograms, refers to weight; that is, the force due to gravity. Before the late 20th century, the distinction between the two was not strictly applied in technical writing, so that expressions such as "molecular weight" (for [[molecular mass]]) are still seen.

Because mass and weight are separate quantities, they have different units of measure. In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the [[kilogram]] is the basic unit of mass, and the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] is the basic unit of force. The non-SI [[kilogram-force]] is also a unit of force typically used in the measure of weight. Similarly, the [[avoirdupois]] [[Pound (mass)|pound]], used in both the [[Imperial system]] and [[United States customary units|U.S. customary units]], is a unit of mass, and its related unit of force is the [[pound-force]].

==Converting units of mass to equivalent forces on Earth==
[[Image:Southern ocean gravity hg.png|thumb|260px|Gravity anomalies covering the Southern Ocean are shown here in [[false-color]] relief. This image has been normalized to remove variation due to differences in latitude.]]
When an object's weight (its gravitational force) is expressed in "kilograms", this actually refers to the kilogram-force (kgf or kg-f), also known as the ''kilopond'' (kp), which is a non-SI unit of force. All objects on the Earth's surface are subject to a gravitational acceleration of approximately 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] fixed the value of standard gravity at precisely 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; so that disciplines such as [[metrology]] would have a standard value for converting units of defined mass into defined forces and [[pressure]]s. Thus the kilogram-force is defined as precisely 9.80665 newtons. In reality, gravitational acceleration (symbol: ''g'') varies slightly with [[latitude]], [[elevation]] and subsurface density; these variations are typically only a few tenths of a percent. See also ''[[Gravimetry]]''.

Engineers and scientists understand the distinctions between mass, force, and weight. Engineers in disciplines involving [[weight]] [[Structural load|loading]] (force on a structure due to gravity), such as [[structural engineering]], convert the mass of objects like concrete and automobiles (expressed in kilograms) to a force in newtons (by multiplying by some factor around 9.8; 2 significant figures is usually sufficient for such calculations) to derive the load of the object. Material properties like [[elastic modulus]] are measured and published in terms of the newton and [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (a unit of pressure related to the newton).

[[Image:Submerged-and-Displacing.svg|thumb|174px|Regardless of the [[fluid]] in which an object is immersed (gas or liquid), the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.]]
[[Image:Hot air balloon just above the ground.jpg|thumb|left|255px|A hot air balloon when it has [[neutral buoyancy]] has no weight for the men to support but still retains great inertia due to its mass.]]
Usually, the relationship between mass and weight on Earth is highly proportional; objects that are a hundred times more massive than a one-liter bottle of soda almost always weigh a hundred times more—approximately 1,000 newtons, which is the weight one would expect on Earth from an object with a mass slightly greater than 100 kilograms. Yet, this is not always the case and there are familiar objects that violate this {{nowrap|mass&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;weight}} proportionality.

A common helium-filled toy balloon is something familiar to many. When such a balloon is fully filled with helium, it has [[buoyancy]]—a force that opposes gravity. When a toy balloon becomes partially deflated, it will often become [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]] and can float about the house a meter or two off the floor. In such a state, there are moments when the balloon is neither rising nor falling and—in the sense that a scale placed under it will have no force applied to it—is, in a sense perfectly weightless (actually as noted below, weight has merely been redistributed along the Earth's surface so it cannot be measured). Though the rubber comprising the balloon has a mass of only a few grams, which might be almost unnoticeable, the rubber still retains all its mass when inflated.

Again, unlike the effect that low-gravity environments have on weight, buoyancy does not make a portion of an object’s weight vanish; the missing weight is instead being borne by the ground, which leaves less force (weight) being applied to any scale theoretically placed underneath the object in question (though one may perhaps have some trouble with the practical aspects of accurately weighing something individually in that condition). If one were however to weigh a small wading pool that someone then entered and began floating in, they would find that the full weight of the person was being borne by the pool and, ultimately, the scale underneath the pool. Whereas a buoyant object (on a properly working scale for weighing buoyant objects) would weigh less, the ''object&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;/&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;fluid system''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; becomes heavier by the value of object's full mass once the object is added. Since air is a fluid, this principle applies to object&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;/&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;air&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; systems as well; large volumes of air—and ultimately the ground—supports the weight a body loses through mid-air buoyancy.

The effects of buoyancy don’t just affect balloons; both liquids and gases are [[fluid]]s in the physical sciences, and when all macro{{nbhyph}}size objects larger than dust particles are immersed in fluids on Earth, they have some degree of buoyancy.&lt;ref&gt;Objects the size of small dust particles, or smaller, are so strongly influenced by [[Brownian motion]] that they are no longer influenced by buoyancy.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of either a swimmer floating in a pool or a balloon floating in air, buoyancy can fully counter the gravitational weight of the object being weighed, for a weighing device in the pool. However, as noted, an object supported by a fluid is fundamentally no different from an object supported by a sling or cable—the weight has merely been transferred to another location, not made to disappear.

The mass of "weightless" (neutrally buoyant) balloons can be better appreciated with much larger hot air balloons. Although no effort is required to counter their weight when they are hovering over the ground (when they can often be within one hundred newtons of zero weight), the inertia associated with their appreciable mass of several hundred kilograms or more can knock fully grown men off their feet when the balloon’s basket is moving horizontally over the ground.

Buoyancy and the resultant reduction in the downward force of objects being weighed underlies [[Archimedes' principle]], which states that the buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. If this fluid is air, the force may be small.

==Buoyancy effects of air on measurement==
Normally, the effect of air buoyancy on objects of normal [[density]] is too small to be of any consequence in day-to-day activities.  For instance, buoyancy’s diminishing effect upon one’s body weight (a relatively low-density object) is {{frac|860}} that of gravity (for pure water it is about {{frac|770}} that of gravity). Furthermore, ''variations'' in barometric pressure will rarely affect one’s weight more than ±1 part in 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Assumptions: An air density of 1160&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, an average density of a human body (with collapsed lungs) equal to that of water, and variations in barometric pressure rarely exceeding ±{{convert|22|torr}}. Assumptions primary variables: An altitude of 194 meters above mean sea level (the worldwide median altitude of human habitation), an indoor temperature of 23&amp;nbsp;°C, a dewpoint of 9&amp;nbsp;°C, and {{convert|760|mmHg|abbr=on|kPa}} sea level–corrected barometric pressure.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[metrology]] (the science of measurement), the precision mass standards for calibrating laboratory scales and balances are manufactured with such accuracy that air density is accounted for to compensate for buoyancy effects. Given the extremely high cost of [[platinum]]-[[iridium]] mass standards like the [[Kilogram#International prototype kilogram|International Prototype Kilogram]] (''the'' mass standard in France that defines the magnitude of the kilogram), high-quality "working" standards are made of special [[stainless steel]] alloys&lt;ref&gt;For example, for the recalibration of the US National Prototype Kilogram in 1985, two [[Stainless Steel#Types of stainless steel|austenitic]] stainless steel artifacts were used for comparison. One, named D2, is similar to 18-8 ([[SAE 304 stainless steel|type 304]]) stainless (ie 18% Chromium, 8% Nickel); the other, named CH-1, is a more complex alloy that could be roughly designated as CrNiMo30-25-2 (chemical composition is 29.9% Cr, 25.1% Ni, 2.2% Mo, 1.45% Mn, 0.53 Si, 0.2% Cu, 0.07% C, 0.0019% P).{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=R. N.|year=1985|title=Recalibration of the US National Prototype Kilogram|journal=Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards|volume=90|issue=4|page=267|publisher=[[US Government Printing Office]]|location=Washington|url=http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/090/4/V90-4.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2011|doi=10.6028/jres.090.015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603212929/http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/090/4/V90-4.pdf|archive-date=3 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with densities of about 8,000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which occupy greater volume than those made of platinum-iridium, which have a density of about 21,550&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For convenience, a standard value of buoyancy relative to stainless steel was developed for metrology work and this results in the term "conventional mass".&lt;ref&gt;''International Recommendation OIML&amp;nbsp;R33'', [[International Organization of Legal Metrology]].&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional mass is defined as follows: "For a mass at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, ‘conventional mass’ is the mass of a reference standard of density 8,000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; which it balances in air with a density of 1.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;." The effect is a small one, 150&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]] for stainless steel mass standards, but the appropriate corrections are made during the manufacture of all precision mass standards so they have the true labeled mass.

Whenever a high-precision scale (or balance) in routine laboratory use is calibrated using stainless steel standards, the scale is actually being calibrated to conventional mass; that is, true mass minus 150&amp;nbsp;ppm of buoyancy. Since objects with precisely the same mass but with different densities displace different volumes and therefore have different buoyancies and weights, any object measured on this scale (compared to a stainless steel mass standard) has ''its'' conventional mass measured; that is, its true mass minus an ''unknown'' degree of buoyancy. In high-accuracy work, the volume of the article can be measured to mathematically null the effect of buoyancy.

==Types of scales and what they measure==

[[Image:Balance à tabac 1850.JPG|thumb|203px|left|A balance-type weighing scale: Unaffected by the strength of gravity.]]
[[Image:Bathroomscales.jpg|thumb|250px|Load-cell based bathroom scale: Affected by the strength of gravity.]]

When one stands on a [[Weighing scale#Balance|balance-beam]]-type [[Weighing scale|scale]] at a doctor’s office, they are having their mass measured directly. This is because balances ("dual-pan" mass comparators) compare the gravitational force exerted on the person on the platform with that on the sliding counterweights on the beams; gravity is the force-generating mechanism that allows the needle to diverge from the "balanced" (null) point. These balances could be moved from Earth's equator to the poles and give exactly the same measurement, i.e. they would not spuriously indicate that the doctor's patient became 0.3% heavier; they are immune to the gravity-countering centrifugal force due to Earth's rotation about its axis. But if you step onto spring-based or digital [[load cell]]-based scales (single-pan devices), you are having your weight (gravitational force) measured; and variations in the strength of the gravitational field affect the reading. In practice, when such scales are used in commerce or hospitals, they are often calibrated on-site and certified on that basis, so that the mass they measure, expressed in pounds or kilograms, is at the desired level of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;National General Conference on Weights and Measures, ''Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices'', NIST Handbook 44&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

==Use in commerce==
In the United States of America the [[United States Department of Commerce]], the [[Technology Administration]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) have defined the use of mass and weight in the exchange of goods under the Uniform Laws and Regulations in the areas of [[metrology|legal metrology]] and engine fuel quality in NIST Handbook 130.

NIST Handbook 130 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''V.''' "Mass" and "Weight." [NOTE 1, See page 6]
:The mass of an object is a measure of the object’s inertial property, or the amount of matter it contains. The weight of an object is a measure of the force exerted on the object by gravity, or the force needed to support it. The pull of gravity on the earth gives an object a downward acceleration of about 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In trade and commerce and everyday use, the term "weight" is often used as a synonym for "mass." The "net mass" or "net weight" declared on a label indicates that the package contains a specific amount of commodity exclusive of wrapping materials. The use of the term "mass" is predominant throughout the world, and is becoming increasingly common in the United States. (Added 1993)

:'''W.''' Use of the Terms "Mass" and "Weight." [NOTE 1, See page 6]
:When used in this handbook, the term "weight" means "mass". The term "weight" appears when inch-pound units are cited, or when both inch-pound and SI units are included in a requirement. The terms "mass" or "masses" are used when only SI units are cited in a requirement. The following note appears where the term "weight" is first used in a law or regulation.

:'''NOTE 1:''' When used in this law (or regulation), the term "weight" means "mass." (See paragraph V. and W. in Section I., Introduction, of NIST Handbook 130 for an explanation of these terms.) (Added 1993) 6"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

U.S. federal law, which supersedes this handbook, also defines weight, particularly Net Weight, in terms of the avoirdupois pound or mass pound. From [http://frwebgate6.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=02666786821+1+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve 21CFR101 Part 101.105 – Declaration of net quantity of contents when exempt]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:    (a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. The statement shall be in terms of fluid measure if the food is liquid, or in terms of weight if the food is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid; except that such statement may be in terms of dry measure if the food is a fresh fruit, fresh vegetable, or other dry commodity that is customarily sold by dry measure. If there is a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the contents of a liquid by weight, or a solid, semisolid, or viscous product by fluid measure, it may be used. Whenever the Commissioner determines that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination in the case of a specific packaged food does not facilitate value comparisons by consumers and offers opportunity for consumer confusion, he will by regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such commodity.
:    (b)(1) Statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{about|the philosophical concept|the Italian political concept|Meliorism (politics)}}

'''Meliorism''' is an idea in [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] thinking holding that [[Progress (history)|progress]] is a real concept leading to an improvement of the world.  It holds that humans can, through their interference with processes that would otherwise be natural, produce an outcome which is an improvement over the aforementioned natural one.

Meliorism, as a conception of the person and society, is at the foundation of contemporary [[liberal democracy]] and [[human rights]] and is a basic component of [[liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sprc.unsw.edu.au/media/SPRCFile/dp068.pdf|title=Liberalism, gender and social policy|author=Shaver, S.|date=July 1996|editor=T. Eardly|publisher=Social Policy Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important understanding of the meliorist tradition comes from the American Pragmatic tradition.  One can read about it in the works of [[Lester Frank Ward]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].

Meliorism has also been used by [[Arthur Caplan]] to describe positions in [[bioethics]] that are in favor of ameliorating conditions which cause suffering, even if the conditions have long existed (e.g. being in favor of cures for common diseases, being in favor of serious anti-aging therapies as they are developed).

A closely related concept discussed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet]] is that of [[perfectibility of man]].  

Condorcet's statement, "Such is the object of the work I have undertaken; the result of which will be to show, from reasoning and from facts, that no bounds have been fixed to the improvement of the human faculties; that the ''perfectibility of man'' is absolutely indefinite; that the progress of this perfectibility, henceforth above the controul of every power that would impede it, has no other limit than the duration of the globe upon which nature has placed us."&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/condorcet-outlines-of-an-historical-view-of-the-progress-of-the-human-mind "Outlines of an historical view of the progress of the human mind"] [1795]&lt;/ref&gt; anticipates James' meliorism.

Rousseau's treatment is somewhat weaker&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, J. J., (1754). [http://www.liupoliticalphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/5019_Rousseau_Discourse_on_the_Origin_of_Inequality.pdf "Discourse on the Origin of Inequality"(Translated by G. D. H. Cole)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5465">The term '''middle-class values''' is used by various writers and [[politician]]s to include such qualities as hard work, self-discipline, [[frugality|thrift]], [[honesty]], aspiration and ambition.&lt;ref name='death-speccie'&gt;{{Cite web|title = The strange death of the British middle class|url = http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9000951/the-missing-middle/|accessdate = 2015-05-25|website = [[The Spectator]]|last = West|first = Ed|last2 = Nelson|first2 = Fraser|authorlink = Ed West (journalist)|authorlink2 = Fraser Nelson|date = 24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why sneer at the worthy values of our middle class?|url = http://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/398449/Why-sneer-at-the-worthy-values-of-our-middle-class|accessdate = 2015-05-25|first = James|last = Delingpole|publisher = [[Daily Express]]|authorlink = James Delingpole|date = 10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, people in lower or upper classes can also possess middle-class values, they are not exclusive to people who are actually [[middle-class]]. Contemporary politicians in Western countries frequently refer to such values, and to the middle-class families that uphold them, as worthy of political support.&lt;ref name='death-speccie'/&gt;

== Contrasts ==
Middle-class values can be contrasted with other values that may be held by other people belonging to other classes and historical time periods, such as:
* [[Tribal]] thinking or [[clan]]nishness
* Contentment with a low material [[standard of living]]
* Valorisation of strength and petty [[violence]]
* [[Anti-intellectualism]]
* [[Criminality]]
* A life of easy leisure and being served by servants (a value often exhibited by the [[upper classes]]), as opposed to hard work
* [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] values - rejecting middle class materialism, embracing artistic creation
* [[Fundamentalism|Religious fundamentalism]] (various types) - rejecting earthly goals (illusions) and/or disdaining middle class empiricism and material desires
* [[Contrarian]]ism - rejecting various aspects of middle class life and values
* [[Revolutionary]] - aiming through political or cultural means to overturn or destroy the existing societal order, replacing it with a different and superior system
* [[Utopia]]nism - striving to design and/or create create a perfect or ideal society (in practice, as a small community within a larger state)
* [[Absurdism|Absurdism -]] rejecting given values systems and seeking to understand the true value and meaning of life, while accepting that such understanding is impossible

== History ==

=== Spread of middle-class values ===
{{expand section|more mainstream views|date=May 2015}}
British economic historian [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] has controversially claimed, in his book ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'', on the basis of extensive research, that Britain may have been where the [[Industrial Revolution]] began because the British people had a head start in "evolving"{{spaced ndash}}through a combination of cultural and possibly even genetic changes{{spaced ndash}}a [[critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]] of people with middle-class values.

Others have claimed, by contrast, that the "natural inclination" of workers at the early stages of the Industrial Revolution was to work as few hours as needed to earn a subsistence living, and workers had to be [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] into working long hours. Some have claimed that [[compulsory education]] and [[advertising]] played a part in this brainwashing - compulsory education instilling obedience and hard work at an early age, and advertising instilling desire for consumer goods that had to be paid for with more work.

In [[A Farewell to Alms]] Clark disputes such explanations, citing persistent large differences in labour productivity in [[India]] and Britain, even when British managers and identical machines to those used in Britain were used, and even though both countries have compulsory education for children.

== Mechanism of transmission ==
Since the middle class is the dominant class in western modernity (specifically after the industrial revolution), middle-class values hold cultural capital and hegemony over western modernial cultures. Middle class values are thus imposed upon an entire population through economic and cultural means. That is, those living within the bounds of western modernity must conform to middle-class expectations in order to gain access to wealth or cultural legibility. Middle-class values, or the lack thereof, are transmitted from parents to children, by schools, by employers, and by [[mainstream media]], such as the quintessentially middle-class newspaper ''[[The Daily Mail]]''.

According to Gregory Clark, it is possible that there is also a substantial genetic component, and this is why [[social mobility]] is so low across societies and across history, as he establishes in his book [[The Son Also Rises (book)|The Son Also Rises]]. However, this view is highly problematic, ethnocentric, and eurocentric as it naturalizes and self-validates middle-class dominance.

The '''National Equality Standard''' ('''NES''') is an initiative created by [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]]. It was developed for business, by business and sets clear [[Equality, Diversity and Inclusion]] (EDI) criteria against which companies are assessed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Home/National-Equality-Standard|title= The National Equality Standard official website|format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The NES has been developed and sponsored by [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]], supported by the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC), the [[Home Office]] and the [[Confederation of British Industry]] and developed in partnership with the following UK and global companies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehrdirector.com/business-news/diversity_and_equality/untitled-resource/|title= The HR Director magazine |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arun is supported by Harry Gaskell, the managing partner of [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]]s UK &amp; Ireland advisory Practice and Head of D&amp;I, and the Chair of the Employers Network for Equality &amp; Inclusion (enei).&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.recruiter.co.uk/news/2012/07/ey-leads-launch-for-national-equality-standard-for-britain/#sthash.VlS0iTMw.dpuf|title= The Recruiter Magazine |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[David Bell (publisher)|Sir David Bell]] has been appointed as the Non-executive Chair of the steering committee that drives the development of the NES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.top-consultant.com/UK/Ernst-Young-pens-national-equality-standard-9008.html|title= Top Consultant Magazine |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The National Equality Standard Assessment ==
Through the NES, companies are subjected to a robust EDI assessment which has been devised by the NES Board and [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2c14e85e-c13c-11e2-9767-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2ftK5A0gr|title= The Financial Times |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NES Assessment provides companies with a comprehensive quality review of their EDI policies and practices, identifies areas for improvement and provides implementation recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Home/National-Equality-Standard|title= The National Equality Standard official website |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each company that undertakes the NES undergoes a robust assessment against a defined set of criteria across 7 standards. Trained NES Assessors review documentation, ensure legal compliance, conduct comprehensive interviews and sample staff through in-depth surveys. The outcome is detailed in a comprehensive report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehrdirector.com/business-news/diversity_and_equality/untitled-resource|title= The HR Director |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Objectives ==
The objectives of the NES are to provide an assessment tool which:
*Aims to significantly impact the way diversity and inclusion is integrated into everyday business activity across the country
*Provides a single reference point incorporating all elements of the [[Equality Act 2010]]
*Enables businesses to undertake a comprehensive assessment specifically focused on EDI
*Consists of best practice standards that can be applied to any business sector or size
*Provides a pragmatic solution to EDI which rewards ambition
*Supports the private sector by providing one recognisable holistic framework for industry good practice
*Enables companies to showcase their businesses as leaders in this field
*Bridges the gap between legal requirements and best practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edf.org.uk/blog/?p=26602|title= EDF Energy Website |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feedback ==
The feedback from those undertaking assessments has been positive; Tina Southall, Director, Diversity and Inclusion at [[Vodafone]] Group Services described the assessment process in an interview:
:“The assessment process was excellent. It really captured both the macro status but also important details. It consisted of an in-depth review of materials and a very professional and well structured audit. It provided thought provoking insights combined with pragmatic and actionable recommendations. The Standard has potential to drive a real change in Equality Standards.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Home/National-Equality-Standard---Testimonials|title= Testimonials from the National Equality Standard Website |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noogenesis''' is the emergence and evolution of [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name=wordinfo&gt;[http://wordinfo.info/unit/1410 Noogenesis // Word Info about English Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Term origin ==
Noo, [[Nous|nous]] ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|n|aʊ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|n|uː|s}}) – from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: νόος|νόος]]}}, has synonyms in other languages {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: 智慧|智慧]]}} ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]), is a term that currently encompasses the semantics: [[mind]], [[intelligence]], [[intellect]], [[reason]]; [[wisdom]]; [[insight]], [[intuition]],  [[thought]], - in a single phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles|edition=3 |page=1417|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος]'' in [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dintellectus2 intellectus]'' in [[Lewis &amp; Short]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Noogenesis was first mentioned in the posthumously published in 1955 book ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'' by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], an [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and philosopher, in a few places:
{{quote|"With and within the crisis of reflection, the next term in the series manifests itself. Psychogenesis has led to man. Now it effaces itself, relieved or absorbed by another and a higher function—the engendering and subsequent development of the mind, in one word noogenesis. When for the first time in a living creature instinct perceived itself in its own mirror, the whole world took a pace forward."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; "There is only one way in which our minds can integrate into a coherent picture of noogenesis these two essential properties of the autonomous centre of all centres, and that is to resume and complement our Principle of Emergence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea is that of noogenesis ascending irreversibly towards Omega through the strictly limited cycle of a geogenesis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; "To make room for thought in the world, I have needed to ' interiorise ' matter : to imagine an energetics of the mind; to conceive a noogenesis rising upstream against the flow of entropy ; to provide evolution with a direction, a line of advance and critical points..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; —"[[Omega point]]".}}
The lack of any kind of definition of the term has led to a variety of interpretations reflected in the book,&lt;ref&gt;Glycerio, M. L. &amp; Paulsen, J. B. (1999). Is Noogenesis Progressing? Richmond, VA. [http://sites.google.com/site/pellegrinodellavvenire/la-noosfera-e-lo-sviluppo-del-pensiero/teilhard-de-chardin-and-the-formation-of-the-noosphere/from-noosphere-to-fheosphere-cyclotrons-cyberspace-and-teilhard-de-chardin-vision-of-cosmic-love/noosfera-oggi/is-noogenesis-progressing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinhart E.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2972816/]&lt;/ref&gt; including "the contemporary period of evolution on Earth, signified by transformation of biosphere onto the sphere of intelligence—noosphere",&lt;ref name=eco&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/ecolog/5147/НООГЕНЕЗ Noogenesis // Environmental encyclopedic dictionary. — Chisinau: editorial of the Moldovan Soviet encyclopedia. — 1990. — 408 p.] ({{ISBN|5-88550-006-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; "evolution run by human mind"&lt;ref name=ts&gt;Yatsenko N. E. Explanatory dictionary of social science terms. - Lan. — 1999. — 528 p. ({{ISBN|5-8114-0167-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
The most widespread interpretation is thought to be "the emergence of mind, which follows geogenesis, [[biogenesis]] and [[wikt:Hominization|anthropogenesis]], forming a new sphere on [[Earth]]—[[noosphere]]".

A new understanding of the term "noogenesis" as an evolution of the intellect was proposed by A. Eryomin. A hypothesis based on [[recapitulation theory]] links the evolution of the human brain to the development of human civilization. The parallel between the amount of people living on Earth and the amount of neurons becomes more and more obvious leading us to viewing global intelligence as an analogy for human brain.
All of the people living on this planet have undoubtedly inherited the amazing cultural treasures of the past, be it production, social and intellectual ones. We are genetically hardwired to be a sort of "live RAM" of the global intellectual system. Alexey Eryomin suggests that humanity is moving towards a unified self-contained informational and intellectual system.  His research has shown the probability of Super Intellect realizing itself as Global Intelligence on Earth. We could get closer to understanding the most profound patterns and laws of the Universe if these kinds of research were given enough attention. Also, the resemblance between the individual human development and such of the whole human race has to be explored further if we are to face some of the threats of the future.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2005/26/67197.html Krivosheev S.

Therefore, generalizing and summarizing: 
{{quote|"Noogenesis—the expansion process in space and development in time (evolution) of intelligent systems (intelligent matter). Noogenesis represents a set of natural, interconnected, characterized by a certain temporal sequence of structural and functional transformations of the entire hierarchy and set of interacting among themselves on the basic structures and processes ranging from the formation and separation of the rational system to the present (the phylogenesis of the nervous systems of organisms; the evolution of humanity as [[autonomy|autonomous]] intelligent systems) or death (in the course of ontogenesis of the human brain)".&lt;ref&gt;Eryomin A.L.

== Aspects of emergence and evolution of mind ==

=== To the parameters of the phenomenon "noo", "intellectus" ===
The emergence of the human mind is considered to be one of the five fundamental phenomenons of [[emergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/science/emergence-science Emergence. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
To understand the mind, it is necessary to determine how human thinking differs from other thinking beings. Such differences include the ability to generate calculations, to combine dissimilar concepts, to use mental symbols, and to think abstractly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html Hauser M. The Origin of the Mind // Scientific American. - 2009. September. 301. - P. 44-51.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325141142/http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html |date=2010-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The knowledge of the phenomenon of intelligent systems—the emergence of reason (noogenesis) boils down to:

* Emergence and evolution of the "[[Homo sapiens|sapiens]]" (phylogenesis);
* A conception of a new idea ([[insight]], [[creativity]] synthesis, [[intuition]], [[decision-making]], [[eureka (word)|eureka]]);
* Development of an individual mind (ontogenesis );
* Appearance of the Global Intelligence concept.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16186">'''Pavlovian-instrumental transfer''' ('''PIT''') is a [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomenon that occurs when a [[conditioned stimulus]] (CS, also known as a "cue") that has been associated with [[reward system|rewarding]] or [[aversives|aversive]] [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] via [[classical conditioning]] alters [[motivational salience]] and [[operant behavior]].&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aversive PIT in humans - review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geurts DE, Huys QJ, den Ouden HE, Cools R | title = Aversive Pavlovian control of instrumental behavior in humans | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 1428–1441 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23691985 | doi = 10.1162/jocn_a_00425 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer of reward - review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartoni E, Balleine B, Baldassarre G | title = Appetitive Pavlovian-instrumental Transfer: A review | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 829–848 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27693227 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.020 | quote = This paper reviews one of the experimental paradigms used to study the effects of cues, the Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer paradigm. In this paradigm, cues associated with rewards through Pavlovian conditioning alter motivation and choice of instrumental actions.&amp;nbsp;... Predictive cues are an important part of our life that continuously influence and guide our actions. Hearing the sound of a horn makes us stop before we attempt to cross the street. Seeing an advertisement for fast food might make us hungry and lead us to seek out a specific type and source of food. In general, cues can both prompt us towards or stop us from engaging in a certain course of action. They can be adaptive (saving our life in crossing the street) or maladaptive, leading to suboptimal choices, e.g. making us eat when we are not really hungry (Colagiuri and Lovibond, 2015). In extreme cases they can even play a part in pathologies such as in addiction, where drug associated cues produce craving and provoke relapse (Belin et al., 2009).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC | title = From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation | journal = Eur.

This is a signature feature of incentive salience. In daily life, the smell of food may make you suddenly feel hungry, when you hadn’t felt that way a minute before. In animal neuroscience experiments, a CS for reward may trigger a more frenzied pulse of increased instrumental efforts to obtain that associated UCS reward in situations that purify the measurement of incentive salience, such as in Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) experiments&amp;nbsp;... Similarly, including a CS can often spur increased consumption of a reward UCS by rats or people, compared to consumption of the same UCS when CSs are absent&amp;nbsp;... Thus Pavlovian cues can elicit pulses of increased motivation to consume their UCS reward, whetting and intensifying the appetite. However, the motivation power is never simply in the cues themselves or their associations, since cue-triggered motivation can be easily modulated and reversed by drugs, hungers, satieties, etc., as discussed below.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two distinct forms of Pavlovian-instrumental transfer have been identified in humans and other animals&amp;nbsp;– '''specific PIT''' and '''general PIT'''&amp;nbsp;– with unique [[neural substrate]]s mediating each type.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salamone JD, Pardo M, Yohn SE, López-Cruz L, SanMiguel N, Correa M | title = Mesolimbic Dopamine and the Regulation of Motivated Behavior | journal = Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 231–257 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26323245 | doi = 10.1007/7854_2015_383 | quote = Considerable evidence indicates that accumbens DA is important for Pavlovian approach and Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer [(PIT)]&amp;nbsp;... PIT is a behavioral process that reflects the impact of Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli (CS) on instrumental responding. For example, presentation of a Pavlovian CS paired with food can increase output of food-reinforced instrumental behaviors, such as lever pressing. Outcome-specific PIT occurs when the Pavlovian unconditioned stimulus (US) and the instrumental reinforcer are the same stimulus, whereas general PIT is said to occur when the Pavlovian US and the reinforcer are different.&amp;nbsp;... More recent evidence indicates that accumbens core and shell appear to mediate different aspects of PIT; shell lesions and inactivation reduced outcome-specific PIT, while core lesions and inactivation suppressed general PIT (Corbit and Balleine 2011). These core versus shell differences are likely due to the different anatomical inputs and pallidal outputs associated with these accumbens subregions (Root et al. 2015). These results led Corbit and Balleine (2011) to suggest that accumbens core mediates the general excitatory effects of reward-related cues. PIT provides a fundamental behavioral process by which conditioned stimuli can exert activating effects upon instrumental responding}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to rewarding stimuli, specific PIT occurs when a CS is associated with a specific rewarding stimulus through classical conditioning and subsequent exposure to the CS enhances an operant response that is directed toward the same reward with which it was paired (i.e., it promotes approach behavior).&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt; General PIT occurs when a CS is paired with one reward and it enhances an operant response that is directed toward a different rewarding stimulus.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt;

An example of specific PIT, as described by a neuroscience review from 2013 on Pavlovian-instrumental transfer,&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt; is as follows: "in a typical experimental scenario a rat is trained to associate a sound (CS) with the delivery of food. Later, the rat undergoes an instrumental training where it learns to press a lever to get some food (without the sound being present). Finally, the rat is presented again with the opportunity to press the lever, this time both in the presence and absence of the sound. The results show that the rat will press the lever more in the presence of the sound than without, even if the sound has not been previously paired with lever pressing. The Pavlovian sound-food association learned in the first phase has somehow transferred to the instrumental situation, hence the name 'Pavlovian-instrumental transfer.'"&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;

==Specific and general transfer==
In relation to rewarding stimuli, specific PIT occurs when a CS is associated with a specific rewarding stimulus through classical conditioning and subsequent exposure to the CS enhances an operant response that is directed toward the same reward with which it was paired (i.e., it promotes approach behavior).&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt; General PIT occurs when a CS is paired with one reward and it enhances an operant response that is directed toward a different rewarding stimulus.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt; Neurobiological state factors (e.g., [[appetite]] and [[satiety]] states, [[Psychological stress|stress level]], drug states such as [[drug intoxication|intoxication]] and [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], etc.), and particularly the motivational state of an animal, strongly affect the amount of appetitive motivational salience (i.e., [[incentive salience]]) that a ''reward cue''{{#tag:ref|A "reward cue" is a conditioned stimulus (CS) that has been paired with a rewarding stimulus via classical conditioning.&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review" /&gt;|group="note"|name=""}} confers to an associated rewarding stimulus via Pavlovian-instrumental transfer.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;  Acute stress amplifies the motivational salience that reward cues confer to rewarding stimuli through both specific and general PIT;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt; however, chronic stress reduces the motivational impact reward cues.&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;

Specific PIT and general PIT also occur with aversive stimuli and are defined analogously.&lt;ref name="Aversive PIT in humans - review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt; Specific PIT with an aversive stimulus occurs when a CS is paired with an aversive stimulus and subsequent exposure to the CS enhances an operant response that is directed away from the aversive stimulus with which it was paired (i.e., it promotes escape and avoidance behavior).&lt;ref name="Aversive PIT in humans - review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt; General PIT with an aversive stimulus occurs when a CS is paired with one aversive stimulus and it enhances an operant response that is directed away from a different aversive stimulus.&lt;ref name="Aversive PIT in humans - review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corbit LH, Balleine BW | title = Learning and Motivational Processes Contributing to Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer and Their Neural Bases: Dopamine and Beyond | journal = Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 259–289 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26695169 | doi = 10.1007/7854_2015_388 | quote = Such effects suggest that specific motivational states gate the arousing effects of Pavlovian incentives processes on instrumental performance&amp;nbsp;... Behavioral findings are supported by evidence that distinct neural circuits centered on the NAc core and shell mediate the general and specific forms of transfer, respectively&amp;nbsp;... Finally, stress has been shown to increase the magnitude of transfer effects, particularly general transfer, suggesting a shift in cognitive control under stress conditions.&amp;nbsp;... corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) administered directly into the NAc shell enhances transfer in a dose-dependent fashion without affecting baseline lever-press performance (Pecina et al. 2006), suggesting that CRF amplifies the motivational impact of cued rewards in much the same manner as dopamine.&amp;nbsp;... In general, acute treatments seem to enhance transfer effects, whereas chronic treatments decrease transfer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural substrates==

Based upon studies on rats that involved PIT with rewards, specific PIT is mediated by the [[nucleus accumbens shell]] and [[basolateral amygdala]], while general PIT is mediated by the [[nucleus accumbens core]] and [[Central nucleus of the amygdala|central amygdala]].&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt;  Studies on humans which employed neuroimaging during PIT experiments with rewards appear to be consistent with these findings.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartoni E, Puglisi-Allegra S, Baldassarre G | title = The three principles of action: a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer hypothesis | journal = Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 153 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24312025 | pmc = 3832805 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00153 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==

===Addiction===
Due to the effect of reward cues and Pavlovian-instrumental transfer on the amplification of incentive salience for rewarding stimuli, PIT is believed to be one of the mechanisms responsible for producing "cue-triggered wanting", or craving, for a drug that occurs when an individual with a [[drug addiction]] is exposed to [[drug cue]]s{{#tag:ref|Drug cues are environmental contexts, situations, and objects which have been repeatedly associated with drug use through classical conditioning.|group="note"}} even after long periods of abstinence.&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learning+Motivation in PIT - neural mechanisms review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Preclinical PIT and incentive salience in addiction review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamb RJ, Schindler CW, Pinkston JW | title = Conditioned stimuli's role in relapse: preclinical research on Pavlovian-Instrumental-Transfer | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 233 | issue = 10 | pages = 1933–1944 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26800688 | pmc = 4863941 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-016-4216-y | quote = Pavlovian learning plays a central role in many theories of addiction, particularly with regard to relapse. In broad terms, encountering drug-paired CSs are hypothesized to precipitate relapse, often, though not always, by increasing motivation to take drugs. Presumably, if a drug-paired CS increases motivation to take drugs, then a drug-paired CS should increase drug consumption.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of [[drug paraphernalia]]&amp;nbsp;– which is a type of drug cue –&amp;nbsp;as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effect of incentive salience in causing cravings and [[relapse]] upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.

===Dieting===
The sight or smell of food which one has consumed and enjoyed in the past can elicit hunger (i.e., the motivation to eat) in humans, an effect which is presumably mediated through PIT.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian-instrumental transfer of reward - review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic computation of reward motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt;  In PIT experiments with rats, the presentation of a conditioned stimulus which has been paired with food has been shown to increase instrumental actions that have been reinforced by food, such as pressing a lever which leads to the delivery of a food pellet.&lt;ref name="Mesolimbic dopamine in motivation and PIT" /&gt;

'''Plausible deniability''' is the ability of people (typically senior officials in a formal or informal [[chain of command]]) to [[denial|deny]] knowledge of or responsibility for any damnable actions committed by others in an organizational hierarchy because of a lack of evidence that can confirm their participation, even if they were personally involved in or at least [[willful blindness|willfully ignorant]] of the actions. In the case that illegal or otherwise disreputable and unpopular activities become public, high-ranking officials may deny any awareness of such acts to insulate themselves and [[Blame#Blame shifting|shift blame]] onto the agents who carried out the acts, as they are confident that their doubters will be unable to prove otherwise. The lack of evidence to the contrary ostensibly makes the denial plausible, that is, credible, although sometimes it merely makes it [[cause of action|unactionable]]. The term typically implies forethought, such as intentionally setting up the conditions to plausibly avoid responsibility for one's (future) actions or knowledge. In some organizations, legal doctrines such as [[command responsibility]] exist to hold major parties responsible for the actions of subordinates involved in heinous acts and nullify any legal protection that their denial of involvement would carry.

High-ranking officials in more typically Eastern cultures, such as Japan or Korea, are often expected to take full responsibility for improper actions by their subordinates. As an example, Japanese CEOs have made dramatic public apologies and even committed suicide when their companies have been dishonored in some way.''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/728976.stm],''

In [[politics]] and [[espionage]], deniability refers to the ability of a powerful player or intelligence agency to [[buck passing|pass the buck]] and avoid [[blowback (intelligence)|blowback]] by secretly arranging for an action to be taken on their behalf by a third party ostensibly unconnected with the major player. In political campaigns, plausible deniability enables candidates to stay clean and denounce third-party advertisements that use unethical approaches or potentially libellous innuendo.

In the US, plausible deniability is also a legal concept.  It refers to lack of evidence proving an allegation.  Standards of proof vary in civil and criminal cases.  In civil cases, the standard of proof is "preponderance of the evidence" whereas in a criminal matter, the standard is "beyond a reasonable doubt".  If an opponent cannot provide evidence for his allegation, one can plausibly deny the allegation even though it may be true.

Although plausible deniability has existed throughout history, that name for it was coined by the [[CIA]] in the early 1960s to describe the withholding of information from senior officials in order to protect them from repercussions in the event that illegal or unpopular activities by the CIA became public knowledge. The roots of the name go back to Harry Truman's national security council paper 10/2 of June 18, 1948, which defined "covert operations" as "...all activities (except as noted herein) which are conducted or sponsored by this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that if uncovered the US Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them."&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Historian, Department of State. ''[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945-50Intel/d292 National Security Council Directive on Office of Special Projects (NSC 10/2)],'' Washington, June 18, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower's administration]], NSC 10/2 was incorporated into more specific NSC 5412/2 "Covert Operations."&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Historian, Department of State. ''[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950-55Intel/d250 Covert Operations (NSC 5412/2)],'' Washington, undated.&lt;/ref&gt; NSC 5412 was de-classified in 1977, and is located at the National Archives.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/273.html Records of the National Security Council (NSC), Record Group 273.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Arguably, the key concept of plausible deniability is plausibility. It is relatively easy for a government official to issue a blanket denial of an action, and it is possible to destroy or cover up evidence after the fact, and this might be sufficient to avoid a criminal prosecution, for instance. However, the public might well disbelieve the denial, particularly if there is strong circumstantial evidence, or if the action is believed to be so unlikely that the only logical explanation is that the denial is false.

The concept is even more important in espionage. Intelligence may come from many sources, including [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection)|human sources]]. The exposure of information to which only a few people are privileged may directly implicate some of those people in the disclosure. Take for example a scenario where an official is traveling secretly, and only one of his aides knows the specific travel plans. The official is assassinated during his travels, and the circumstances of the assassination strongly suggest that the assassin had foreknowledge of the official's travel plans. The probable conclusion is that his aide has betrayed the official. There may be no direct evidence linking the aide to the assassin, but collaboration can be inferred from the facts alone, thus making the aide's denial implausible.

==History==
The expression "plausibly deniable" was first used publicly by [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) director [[Allen Dulles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea, on the other hand, is considerably older.  For example, in the 19th century, [[Charles Babbage]] described the importance of having "a few simply honest men" on a committee who could be temporarily removed from the deliberations when "a peculiarly delicate question arises" so that one of them could "declare truly, if necessary, that he never was present at any meeting at which even a questionable course had been proposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Church Committee===
A [[U.S. Senate]] committee, the [[Church Committee]], in 1974–1975 conducted an investigation of the intelligence agencies. In the course of the investigation, it was revealed that the [[CIA]], going back to the [[Kennedy administration]], had plotted the assassination of a number of foreign leaders, including [[Cuba]]'s [[Fidel Castro]]. But the president himself, who clearly was in favor of such actions, was not to be directly involved, so that he could deny knowledge of it. This was given the term 'plausible denial'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Zinn, Howard | title=Declarations of Independence: Cross Examining American Ideology | publisher=Perennial | year=1991 | isbn=0-06-092108-0}}, pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;

{{"|Non-attribution to the United States for covert operations was the original and principal purpose of the so-called doctrine of "plausible denial." Evidence before the Committee clearly demonstrates that this concept, designed to protect the United States and its operatives from the consequences of disclosures, has been expanded to mask decisions of the president and his senior staff members.|[[Church Committee]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Church Committee]] Reports United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, Senate, Nov. 20, 1975, II. Section B Covert Action as a Vehicle for Foreign Policy Implementation Page 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Plausible denial involves the creation of power structures and chains of command loose and informal enough to be denied if necessary. The idea was that the CIA (and, later, other bodies) could be given controversial instructions by powerful figures—up to and including the [[President of the United States|President]] himself—but that the existence and true source of those instructions could be denied if necessary; if, for example, an operation went disastrously wrong and it was necessary for the administration to disclaim responsibility.

===Legislative barriers after the Church Committee===
The [[Hughes–Ryan Act]] of 1974 sought to put an end to plausible denial by requiring a Presidential finding that each operation is important to national security, and the [[Intelligence Oversight Act]] of 1980 required that Congress be notified of all [[covert operation]]s. But both laws are full of enough vague terms and escape hatches to allow the executive branch to thwart their authors' intentions, as the [[Iran–Contra affair]] has shown. Indeed, the members of Congress are in a dilemma: when they are informed, they are in no position to stop the action, unless they leak its existence and thereby foreclose the option of covertness.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[[New York Times]] Under Cover, or Out of Control?

===Media reports===
{{quote|The ([[Church Committee]]) conceded that to provide the United States with "plausible denial" in the event that the anti-Castro plots were discovered, Presidential authorization might have been subsequently "obscured".  (The Church Committee) also declared that, whatever the extent of the knowledge, Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson should bear the "ultimate responsibility" for the actions of their subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]] Castro Study Plot finds No Role by White House, November 21, 1975, page 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|CIA officials deliberately used [[Aesopian language]]&lt;ref&gt;Definition: Using or having ambiguous or allegorical meanings, especially to elude political censorship: “They could express their views only in a diluted form, resorting to Aesopian hints and allusions” ''(Isaac Deutscher)''.&lt;/ref&gt; in talking to the President and others outside the agency.  ([[Richard Helms]]) testified that he did not want to "embarrass a President" or sit around an official table talking about "killing or murdering."  The report found this "circumlocution"&lt;ref&gt;Definition: The use of unnecessarily wordy and indirect language, Evasion in speech or writing, An indirect way of expressing something&lt;/ref&gt; reprehensible, saying: "Failing to call dirty business by its rightful name may have increased the risk of dirty business being done."

{{quote|What made the responsibility difficult to pin down in retrospect was a sophisticated system of institutionalized vagueness and circumlocution whereby no official - and particularly a President - had to officially endorse questionable activities. Unsavory orders were rarely committed to paper and what record the committee found was shot through with references to "removal," "the magic button"&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the "Magic Button" from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Article: The Search for a 'Magic Button' In American Foreign Policy; October 18, 1987; ''(Review by David Aaron of the book Covert Action)'' ''I recall during my days as a Senate investigator finding a piece of yellow note pad with jottings from a meeting with White House officials during the Kennedy Administration that discussed an "Executive Action" or, in plain English, an assassination capability. The notes referred to it as the "magic button."''&lt;/ref&gt; and "the resort beyond the last resort." Thus the agency might at times have misread instructions from on high, but it seemed more often to be easing the burden of presidents who knew there were things they didn't want to know. As former CIA director Richard Helms told the committee: "The difficulty with this kind of thing, as you gentlemen are all painfully aware, is that nobody wants to embarrass a President of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[[Newsweek]] The CIA'S Hit List, December 1, 1975, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Iran–Contra affair===

In his testimony to the congressional committee studying the [[Iran–Contra affair]], Vice Admiral [[John Poindexter]] stated: "I made a deliberate decision not to ask the President, so that I could insulate him from the decision and provide some future deniability for the President if it ever leaked out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Flaws==
The doctrine has at least five major flaws: 

* It was an open door to the abuse of authority; it required that the parties in question could be said to have acted independently, which in the end was tantamount to giving them license to act independently.&lt;ref&gt;[[Church Committee]] II. Section B Page 11; IV. Findings and Conclusions Section C Subsection 1 Page 261:
::''An additional possibility is that the President may, in fact, not be fully and accurately informed about a sensitive operation because he failed to receive the “circumlocutious” message...The Committee finds that the system of Executive command and control was so inherently ambiguous that it is difficult to be certain at what level assassination activity was known and authorized. This creates the disturbing prospect that assassination activity might have been undertaken by officials of the United States Government without its having been incontrovertibly clear that there was explicit authorization from the President of the United States.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The denials are sometimes seen as plausible and were sometimes seen through by both the media and the populace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Church Committee]] IV. Findings and Conclusions Section C Subsection 5  Page 277:
::''It was naive for policymakers to assume that sponsorship of actions as big as the [Bay of Pigs] invasion could be concealed.  The Committee’s investigation of assassination and the public disclosures which preceded the inquiry demonstrate that when the United States resorted to cloak-and-dagger tactics, its hand was ultimately exposed.''&lt;/ref&gt;  One aspect of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] crisis is the repeated failure of the doctrine of plausible deniability, which the administration repeatedly attempted to use to stop the scandal affecting President [[Richard Nixon]] and his aides.
* "Plausible denial" only increases the risk of misunderstanding between senior officials and their employees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Church Committee]] IV. Section C Subsection 5  Page 277:
::''"Plausible denial" increases the risk of misunderstanding. Subordinate officials should describe their proposals in clear, precise, and brutally frank language; superiors are entitled to, and should demand, no less''&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the claim fails, it seriously discredits the political figure invoking it as a defense. ("It's not the crime, it's the cover-up"){{cn|date=May 2017}}
* If it succeeds, it creates the impression that the government is not in control of the state.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Other examples==
Another example of plausible deniability is someone who actively avoids gaining certain knowledge of facts because it benefits that person not to know.

As an example, an [[lawyer|attorney]] may suspect that facts exist which would hurt his case, but decide not to investigate the issue because if the attorney had actual knowledge, the rules of ethics might require him to reveal those facts to the opposing side.  

===Council on Foreign Relations===
"...the U.S. government may at times require a certain deniability. Private activities can provide that deniability." —[[Council on Foreign Relations]], an American foreign policy think tank, in the 2003 report, "Finding America’s Voice: A Strategy for Reinvigorating U.S. Public Diplomacy" {{fact|date=April 2016}}

===Use in computer networks===
In computer networks, deniability often refers to a situation where a person can deny transmitting a file, even when it is proven to come from their computer.  

This is sometimes done by setting the computer to relay certain types of broadcasts automatically, in such a way that the original transmitter of a file is indistinguishable from those who are merely relaying it.  In this way, the person who first transmitted the file can claim that their computer had merely relayed it from elsewhere.

It can also be done by a [[VPN]] where the host is not known.{{dubious|date=March 2018}}

In any case, this claim cannot be disproven without a complete decrypted log of all network connections.

====Freenet file sharing====
The [[Freenet]] [[file sharing]] network is another application of the idea.  It obfuscates data sources and flows in order to protect operators and users of the network by preventing them (and, by extension, observers such as [[censorship|censor]]s) from knowing where data comes from and where it is stored.

===Use in cryptography===
In [[cryptography]], [[deniable encryption]] may be used to describe [[steganography|steganographic techniques]], where the very existence of an encrypted file or message is ''deniable'' in the sense that an adversary cannot prove that an encrypted message exists. In this case the system is said to be 'fully undetectable' (FUD).{{fact|date=December 2014}}

Some systems take this further, such as [[MaruTukku]], [[FreeOTFE]] and (to a much lesser extent) [[TrueCrypt]] and [[VeraCrypt]], which nest encrypted data.  The owner of the encrypted data may reveal one or more keys to decrypt certain information from it, and then deny that more keys exist, a statement which cannot be disproven without knowledge of all encryption keys involved.  The existence of "hidden" data within the overtly encrypted data is then ''deniable'' in the sense that it cannot be proven to exist.

===Programming===
The [[Underhanded C Contest]] is an annual programming contest involving the creation of carefully crafted defects, which have to be both very hard to find and plausibly deniable as mistakes once found.

{{No footnotes|date=February 2011}}

In [[geometry]], '''Plücker coordinates''', introduced by [[Julius Plücker]] in the 19th century, are a way to assign six [[homogeneous coordinates]] to each [[line (mathematics)|line]] in [[projective space|projective 3-space]], '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Because they satisfy a quadratic constraint, they establish a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the 4-dimensional space of lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and points on a [[quadric (projective geometry)|quadric]] in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (projective 5-space). A predecessor and special case of [[Grassmann coordinates]] (which describe ''k''-dimensional linear subspaces, or ''flats'', in an ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]), Plücker coordinates arise naturally in [[geometric algebra]]. They have proved useful for [[computer graphics]], and also can be extended to coordinates for the [[screw theory|screws and wrenches]] in the theory of [[kinematics]] used for [[robot control]].

== Geometric intuition ==
[[File:Plücker line coordinate geometry.png|thumb|right|Displacement and moment of two points on line]]
A line ''L'' in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is determined by two distinct points that it contains, or by two distinct planes that contain it. Consider the first case, with points '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The vector displacement from '''''x''''' to '''''y''''' is nonzero because the points are distinct, and represents the ''direction'' of the line. That is, every displacement between points on ''L'' is a scalar multiple of '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;'''''x'''''. If a physical particle of unit mass were to move from '''''x''''' to '''''y''''', it would have a [[moment (physics)|moment]] about the origin. The geometric equivalent is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing ''L'' and the origin, and whose length equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the displacement and the origin. Treating the points as displacements from the origin, the moment is '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= '''''x'''''×'''''y''''', where "×" denotes the vector [[cross product]]. For a fixed line, ''L'', the area of the triangle is proportional to the length of the segment between '''''x''''' and '''''y''''', considered as the base of the triangle; it is not changed by sliding the base along the line, parallel to itself. By definition the moment vector is perpendicular to every displacement along the line, so '''''d'''''•'''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= 0, where "•" denotes the vector [[dot product]].

Although neither '''''d''''' nor '''''m''''' alone is sufficient to determine ''L'', together the pair does so uniquely, up to a common (nonzero) scalar multiple which depends on the distance between '''''x''''' and '''''y'''''. That is, the coordinates

: ('''''d''''':'''''m''''') = (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''d''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)

may be considered [[homogeneous coordinates]] for ''L'', in the sense that all pairs (''λ'''d''''':''λ'''m'''''), for ''λ''&amp;nbsp;≠ 0, can be produced by points on ''L'' and only ''L'', and any such pair determines a unique line so long as '''''d''''' is not zero and '''''d'''''•'''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= 0. Furthermore, this approach extends to include [[point at infinity|points]], [[line at infinity|lines]], and a [[plane at infinity|plane]] "at infinity", in the sense of [[projective geometry]].

: '''Example.''' Let '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (2,3,7) and '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;= (2,1,0). Then ('''''d''''':'''''m''''')&amp;nbsp;= (0:−2:−7:−7:14:−4).

Alternatively, let the equations for points '''''x''''' of two distinct planes containing ''L'' be

: 0 = ''a'' + '''''a'''''•'''''x'''''
: 0 = ''b'' + '''''b'''''•'''''x''''' .

Then their respective planes are perpendicular to vectors '''''a''''' and '''''b''''', and the direction of ''L'' must be perpendicular to both. Hence we may set '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= '''''a'''''×'''''b''''', which is nonzero because '''''a''''' and '''''b''''' are neither zero nor parallel (the planes being distinct and intersecting). If point '''''x''''' satisfies both plane equations, then it also satisfies the linear combination

:{|
|-
| 0 || = ''a'' (''b'' + '''''b'''''•'''''x''''') − ''b'' (''a'' + '''''a'''''•'''''x''''')
|-
| || = (''a'' '''''b''''' − ''b'' '''''a''''')•'''''x''''' .
|}

That is, '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= ''a''&amp;nbsp;'''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;'''''a''''' is a vector perpendicular to displacements to points on ''L'' from the origin; it is, in fact, a moment consistent with the '''''d''''' previously defined from '''''a''''' and '''''b'''''.

proof：need to show '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= ''a''&amp;nbsp;'''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;'''''a = r×d = r× a×b, let  a•a = b•b = 1'''''
[[File:BaiduShurufa 2018-9-29 20-38-43.png|thumb|plane orthogonal to the line and include the origin]]
point B is the origin.  the line is pass point D and orthogonal to the plane, the 2 plane pass CD and DE both orthogonal to the plane, BD is diameter

: '''''a ='''''  BE/ ||BE||,  '''''b =''''' BC/ ||BC||，'''''r''''' = BD,  −a = ||BF|| = ||BE||，−b = ||BG|| = ||BC||, '''''m'''''= a'''''b'''''−b'''''a =''''' FG,  ||'''''d''&amp;nbsp;|| = || ''a''×''b'' ||''' = sin(FBG)

angle BCE = BDE = BGF, so points D,G,E,H on a circle, and angle GHG is right angle, FG orthogonal to BD, so 4 points C, D, H, F on a circle, and 

||BF||&amp;nbsp;||BC|| = ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||BD||, that is ''ab''&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG) = ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG), 2&amp;middot;area of triangle BFG = ''ab''&amp;middot;sin(FBG) =  ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||FG|| = ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG), 
||'''''m'''''|| = ||FG|| = ||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG) = ||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;||'''''d&amp;nbsp;||,''''' check direction and '''''m = r''×''d.'''''

when ||'''''r'''''|| = 0, the line is the one pass origin with direction '''''d'''''; if ||'''''r'''''|| &gt; 0,  the line is with direction '''''d,''''' the plane including the origin and the line has normal vector '''''m''''', the line is tangent to a circle on the plane centered origin and with radius ||''r''|| at point '''''r'''''.

: '''Example.''' Let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2, '''''a'''''&amp;nbsp;= (−1,0,0) and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= −7, '''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;= (0,7,−2). Then ('''''d''''':'''''m''''')&amp;nbsp;= (0:−2:−7:−7:14:−4).

Although the usual algebraic definition tends to obscure the relationship, ('''''d''''':'''''m''''') are the Plücker coordinates of ''L''.

== Algebraic definition ==

=== Primal coordinates ===
In a 3-dimensional projective space '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, let ''L'' be a line through distinct points '''x''' and '''y''' with [[homogeneous coordinates]] (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).
The Plücker coordinates ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined as follows:
:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;p_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; {}= \begin{vmatrix} x_{i} &amp; y_{i} \\ x_{j} &amp; y_{j}\end{vmatrix} = x_{i}y_{j}-x_{j}y_{i} . &lt;/math&gt;
|}
This implies ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ii''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0 and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= −''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;, reducing the possibilities to only six (4 [[binomial coefficient|choose]] 2) independent quantities. The sixtuple

: &lt;math&gt;(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12}) &lt;/math&gt;

is uniquely determined by ''L'' up to a common nonzero scale factor. Furthermore, not all six components can be zero.
Thus the Plücker coordinates of ''L'' may be considered as homogeneous coordinates of a point in a 5-dimensional projective space, as suggested by the colon notation.

To see these facts, let ''M'' be the 4×2 matrix with the point coordinates as columns.

: &lt;math&gt; M = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 &amp;  y_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 \\ x_3 &amp; y_3 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The Plücker coordinate ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the determinant of rows ''i'' and ''j'' of ''M''.
Because '''x''' and '''y''' are distinct points, the columns of ''M'' are [[linear independence|linearly independent]]; ''M'' has [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] 2. Let ''M&amp;prime;'' be a second matrix, with columns '''x&amp;prime;''' and '''y&amp;prime;''' a different pair of distinct points on ''L''. Then the columns of ''M&amp;prime;'' are [[linear combination]]s of the columns of ''M''; so for some 2×2 [[nonsingular matrix]] Λ,

: &lt;math&gt; M' = M\Lambda . &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, rows ''i'' and ''j'' of ''M&amp;prime;'' and ''M'' are related by

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} x'_{i} &amp; y'_{i}\\x'_{j}&amp; y'_{j} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{i} &amp; y_{i}\\x_{j}&amp; y_{j} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_{00} &amp; \lambda_{01} \\ \lambda_{10} &amp; \lambda_{11} \end{bmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the determinant of the left side 2×2 matrix equals the product of the determinants of the right side 2×2 matrices, the latter of which is a fixed scalar, det&amp;nbsp;Λ. Furthermore, all six 2×2 subdeterminants in ''M'' cannot be zero because the rank of ''M'' is 2.

=== Plücker map ===
Denote the set of all lines (linear images of '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;.  We thus have a map:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\alpha \colon \mathrm{G}_{1,3} &amp; \rightarrow \mathbf{P}^5 \\
L &amp; \mapsto L^{\alpha},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; L^{\alpha}=(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12}) . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Dual coordinates ===
Alternatively, a line can be described as the intersection of two planes. Let ''L'' 
be a line contained in distinct planes '''a''' and '''b''' with homogeneous coefficients (''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and (''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''b''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''b''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. (The first plane equation is ∑&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;=0, for example.) The dual Plücker coordinate ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt; is

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;p^{ij} &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; {}= \begin{vmatrix} a^{i} &amp; a^{j} \\ b^{i} &amp; b^{j}\end{vmatrix}  = a^{i}b^{j}-a^{j}b^{i} . &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Dual coordinates are convenient in some computations, and they are equivalent to primary coordinates:
: &lt;math&gt;
(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12})=
(p^{23}:p^{31}:p^{12}:p^{01}:p^{02}:p^{03})
&lt;/math&gt;
Here, equality between the two vectors in homogeneous coordinates means that the numbers on the right side are equal to the numbers on the left side up to some common scaling factor &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Specifically, let (''i'',''j'',''k'',''ℓ'') be an [[even permutation]] of (0,1,2,3); then

: &lt;math&gt;p_{ij} = \lambda p^{k\ell} .  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Geometry ===
To relate back to the geometric intuition, take ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0 as the plane at infinity; thus the coordinates of points ''not'' at infinity can be normalized so that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1. Then ''M'' becomes

: &lt;math&gt; M = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;  1 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 \\ x_2&amp; y_2 \\ x_3 &amp; y_3 \end{bmatrix} , &lt;/math&gt;

and setting '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), we have '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;).

Dually, we have '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) and '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sup&gt;01&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;02&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;03&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Bijection between lines and Klein quadric==
=== Plane equations ===
If the point '''z'''&amp;nbsp;= (''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) lies on ''L'', then the columns of

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 &amp; z_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\ x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

are [[linearly dependent]], so that the rank of this larger matrix is still 2. This implies that all 3×3 submatrices have determinant zero, generating four (4 choose 3) plane equations, such as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = \begin{vmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 &amp; z_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \end{vmatrix} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \begin{vmatrix} x_1 &amp; y_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 \end{vmatrix} z_0 - \begin{vmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 \end{vmatrix} z_1 + \begin{vmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 \end{vmatrix} z_2 \\[5pt]
&amp; = p_{12} z_0 - p_{02} z_1 + p_{01} z_2 . \\[5pt]
&amp; = p^{03} z_0 + p^{13} z_1 + p^{23} z_2 .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The four possible planes obtained are as follows.

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix}
0 &amp; = &amp; {}+ p_{12} z_0 &amp; {}- p_{02} z_1 &amp; {}+ p_{01} z_2 &amp; \\
0 &amp; = &amp; {}- p_{31} z_0 &amp; {}- p_{03} z_1 &amp; &amp; {}+ p_{01} z_3 \\
0 &amp; = &amp; {}+p_{23} z_0 &amp; &amp; {}- p_{03} z_2 &amp; {}+ p_{02} z_3 \\
0 &amp; = &amp; &amp; {}+p_{23} z_1 &amp; {}+ p_{31} z_2 &amp; {}+ p_{12} z_3
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Using dual coordinates, and letting (''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) be the line coefficients, each of these is simply ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt;, or

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \sum_{i=0}^3 p^{ij} z_i , \qquad j = 0,\ldots,3 . &lt;/math&gt;

Each Plücker coordinate appears in two of the four equations, each time multiplying a different variable; and as at least one of the coordinates is nonzero, we are guaranteed non-vacuous equations for two distinct planes intersecting in ''L''. Thus the Plücker coordinates of a line determine that line uniquely, and the map α is an [[Injective function|injection]].

=== Quadratic relation ===
The image of α is not the complete set of points in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;; the Plücker coordinates of a line ''L'' satisfy the quadratic Plücker relation

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = p_{01}p^{01}+p_{02}p^{02}+p_{03}p^{03} \\
&amp; = p_{01}p_{23}+p_{02}p_{31}+p_{03}p_{12}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For proof, write this homogeneous polynomial as determinants and use [[Laplace expansion]] (in reverse).

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = \begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0\\x_1&amp;y_1\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
\begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}x_3&amp;y_3\\x_1&amp;y_1\end{vmatrix}+
\begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix} \\[5pt]
&amp; = (x_0 y_1-y_0 x_1)\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}-
(x_0 y_2-y_0 x_2)\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
(x_0 y_3-y_0 x_3)\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix} \\[5pt]
&amp; = x_0 \left(y_1\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}-
y_2\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
y_3\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix}\right)
-y_0 \left(x_1\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}-
x_2\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
x_3\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix}\right) \\[5pt]
&amp; = x_0 \begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}
-y_0 \begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since both 3×3 determinants have duplicate columns, the right hand side is identically zero.

Another proof may be done like this:
Since vector

: &lt;math&gt; d = \left( p_{01}, p_{02}, p_{03} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

is perpendicular to vector

: &lt;math&gt; m = \left( p_{23}, p_{31}, p_{12} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

(see above), the scalar product of ''d'' and ''m'' must be zero! q.e.d.

=== Point equations ===
Letting (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) be the point coordinates, four possible points on a line each have coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''j''&amp;nbsp;= 0…3. Some of these possible points may be inadmissible because all coordinates are zero, but since at least one Plücker coordinate is nonzero, at least two distinct points are guaranteed.

=== Bijectivity ===
If (''q''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) are the homogeneous coordinates of a point in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, without loss of generality assume that ''q''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; is nonzero. Then the matrix

: &lt;math&gt; M = \begin{bmatrix} q_{01} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; q_{01} \\ -q_{12} &amp; q_{02} \\ q_{31} &amp; q_{03} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

has rank 2, and so its columns are distinct points defining a line ''L''. When the '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; coordinates, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, satisfy the quadratic Plücker relation, they are the Plücker coordinates of ''L''. To see this, first normalize ''q''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; to 1. Then we immediately have that for the Plücker coordinates computed from ''M'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, except for

: &lt;math&gt; p_{23} = - q_{03} q_{12} - q_{02} q_{31} . &lt;/math&gt;

But if the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the Plücker relation ''q''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;+''q''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;+''q''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0, then ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''23''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''23''&lt;/sub&gt;, completing the set of identities.

Consequently, α is a [[surjection]] onto the [[algebraic variety]] consisting of the set of zeros of the quadratic polynomial

: &lt;math&gt; p_{01}p_{23}+p_{02}p_{31}+p_{03}p_{12} . &lt;/math&gt;

And since α is also an injection, the lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are thus in [[bijection|bijective]] correspondence with the points of this [[quadric]] in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, called the Plücker quadric or [[Klein quadric]].

==Uses==
Plücker coordinates allow concise solutions to problems of line geometry in 3-dimensional space, especially those involving [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]].

=== Line-line crossing ===
Two lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are either [[skew lines|skew]] or [[coplanar]], and in the latter case they are either coincident or intersect in a unique point. If ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are the Plücker coordinates of two lines, then they are coplanar precisely when '''''d'''''⋅'''''m'''''&amp;prime;+'''''m'''''⋅'''''d'''''&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;= 0, as shown by

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = p_{01}p'_{23} + p_{02}p'_{31} + p_{03}p'_{12} + p_{23}p'_{01} + p_{31}p'_{02} + p_{12}p'_{03} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0&amp;x'_0&amp;y'_0\\
x_1&amp;y_1&amp;x'_1&amp;y'_1\\
x_2&amp;y_2&amp;x'_2&amp;y'_2\\
x_3&amp;y_3&amp;x'_3&amp;y'_3\end{vmatrix}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

When the lines are skew, the sign of the result indicates the sense of crossing: positive if a right-handed screw takes ''L'' into ''L''&amp;prime;, else negative.

The quadratic Plücker relation essentially states that a line is coplanar with itself.

=== Line-line join ===
In the event that two lines are coplanar but not parallel, their common plane has equation

: 0 = ('''''m'''''•'''''d'''''&amp;prime;)''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ('''''d'''''×'''''d'''''&amp;prime;)•'''''x''''' ,

where '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

The slightest perturbation will destroy the existence of a common plane, and near-parallelism of the lines will cause numeric difficulties in finding such a plane even if it does exist.

=== Line-line meet ===
Dually, two coplanar lines, neither of which contains the origin, have common point

: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : '''''x''''') = ('''d'''•'''m'''&amp;prime;:'''m'''×'''m'''&amp;prime;) .

To handle lines not meeting this restriction, see the references.

=== Plane-line meet ===
Given a plane with equation

: &lt;math&gt; 0 =  a^0x_0 + a^1x_1 + a^2x_2 + a^3x_3 , &lt;/math&gt;

or more concisely 0&amp;nbsp;= ''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+'''''a'''''•'''''x'''''; and given a line not in it with Plücker coordinates ('''''d''''':'''''m'''''), then their point of intersection is

: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : '''''x''''') = ('''''a'''''•'''''d''''' : '''''a'''''×'''''m''''' − ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''''d''''') .

The point coordinates, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), can also be expressed in terms of Plücker coordinates as

: &lt;math&gt; x_i = \sum_{j \ne i} a^j p_{ij} , \qquad i = 0 \ldots 3 . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Point-line join ===
Dually, given a point (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:'''''y''''') and a line not containing it, their common plane has equation

: 0 = ('''''y'''''•'''''m''''') ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ('''''y'''''×'''''d'''''−''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''''m''''')•'''''x''''' .

The plane coordinates, (''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), can also be expressed in terms of dual Plücker coordinates as

: &lt;math&gt; a^i = \sum_{j \ne i} y_j p^{ij} , \qquad i = 0 \ldots 3 . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Line families ===
Because the [[Klein quadric]] is in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, it contains linear subspaces of dimensions one and two (but no higher). These correspond to one- and two-parameter families of lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

For example, suppose ''L'' and ''L''&amp;prime; are distinct lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; determined by points '''x''', '''y''' and '''x'''&amp;prime;, '''y'''&amp;prime;, respectively. Linear combinations of their determining points give linear combinations of their Plücker coordinates, generating a one-parameter family of lines containing ''L'' and ''L''&amp;prime;. This corresponds to a one-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Lines in plane ====
If three distinct and non-parallel lines are coplanar; their linear combinations generate a two-parameter family of lines, all the lines in the plane. This corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Lines through point ====
If three distinct and non-coplanar lines intersect in a point, their linear combinations generate a two-parameter family of lines, all the lines through the point. This also corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Ruled surface ====
A [[ruled surface]] is a family of lines that is not necessarily linear. It corresponds to a curve on the Klein quadric. For example, a [[hyperboloid of one sheet]] is a quadric surface in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ruled by two different families of lines, one line of each passing through each point of the surface; each family corresponds under the Plücker map to a [[conic section]] within the Klein quadric in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Line geometry ===
During the nineteenth century, ''line geometry'' was studied intensively. In terms of the bijection given above, this is a description of the intrinsic geometry of the Klein quadric.

==== Ray tracing ====
Line geometry is extensively used in [[Ray_tracing_(graphics)|ray tracing]] application where the geometry and intersections of rays need to be calculated in 3D. An implementation is described in
[http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Introduction_To_Plcker_Coordinates.shtml Introduction to Plücker Coordinates] written for the Ray Tracing forum by Thouis Jones.

The '''Red Umbrella Project''' is a [[New York City|New York]] based [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] that advocates on behalf of [[sex worker]]s and strives to empower them by giving them a voice.

== History  ==
The Red Umbrella Project was founded in 2010 by writer and activist [[Audacia Ray]]. As a former sex worker, Ray witnessed first-hand the [[discrimination]] against sex workers by police and society.  Ray envisioned an organization where sex workers could come together to share their stories, advocate for change and help one another.  She chose the name The Red Umbrella Project because in 2001 during the 49th Venice Biennale of Art in [[Venice|Venice, Italy]], sex workers demonstrated against inhumane work conditions and [[human rights violation]] by holding up [[International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers|red umbrellas]], making this a symbol of resistance to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexworkeurope.org/campaigns/red-umbrella-campaigns|title=Under the Red Umbrella  {{!}} Sex Work Europe|website=www.sexworkeurope.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Ray started hosting storytelling events for sex workers at the Happy Ending Lounge on New York's Lower East Side. The goals of these workshops and storytelling events were to shine light and empower sex workers, but it soon became apparent that these sex workers shared several common burdens. Many identified as [[Transgender|trans]] or [[queer]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; there was an alarming rate of [[HIV/AIDS]] cases among them,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/trans-sex-workers-are-25-times-more-likely-to-be-hiv-positive-than-the-general-population/|title=Trans Sex Workers Are 25 Times More Likely to Be HIV Positive Than the General Population|newspaper=The Nation|issn=0027-8378|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; they feared carrying condoms due to the criminalization of condoms,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  and most of all they were tossed aside and mistreated by most of society, when all they were doing is trying to make a living and find economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/03/sex-workers-legalization-c-v-r.html|title=Is Prostitution Just Another Job?|last=|first=|date=2016-03-21|work=|newspaper=New York Magazine|access-date=2016-12-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/nyregion/08bodies.html|title=Prostitute Disappearances Unnoticed Until Bodies Were Found|last=Fernandez|first=Manny|date=2011-04-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy issues ==

=== Sex-worker diversion programs ===
In 2014 New York City created a series of special courts for sex workers arrested on prostitution-related charges. The new courts, known as [[Human trafficking|Human Trafficking]] Intervention Courts (HTIC),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/12/sex-trafficking-victims-not-prostitutes-finally-getting-help-and-a-new-name-in-court.html|title=Sex Trafficking Victims, Not 'Prostitutes,' Finally Getting Help (and a New Name) in Court|last=Ungar-Sargon|first=Batya|date=2015-01-12|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  treated all sex workers as human trafficking victims, and through a variety of [[bullying]] tactics forced defendants to forgo their [[constitutional right]] of a [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] and agree to a [[plea bargain]] of a sex worker diversion program which consisted of a court mandated treatment program, followed by [[adjournment in contemplation of dismissal]] (ACD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/why-are-new-york-courts-lumping-in-sex-workers-with-the-victims-of-human-trafficking-6680891|title=Why Are New York Courts Lumping in Sex Workers With the Victims of Human Trafficking?|last=Merlan|first=Anna|date=2014-10-01|newspaper=Village Voice|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Umbrella Project argued that the city's intentions were good and that the new court does help people who are forced into sex work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the court still treats the sex workers like criminals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/sex-workers-and-the-city-0000550-v22n1|title=Special Prostitution Courts and the Myth of 'Rescuing' Sex Workers - VICE|website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-20|date=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes the assumption that all sex workers are victims of human trafficking and that no one does sex work out of free will, for their personal economic gain. There may also be assumed [[Workplace discrimination|discrimination within the workforce]] due to the fact that many sex workers are of [[Person of color|color,]] queer or trans. The counseling and assistance offered through the court mandated treatment program provides them with no way of economic opportunity other than sex work. The Red Umbrella Project wants to see the sex-worker diversion program restructured with an emphasis on [[economic empowerment]] through job training and economic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/why-do-sex-work-diversion-programs-fail/|title=Why Do Sex-Work Diversion Programs Fail?|newspaper=The Nation|issn=0027-8378|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/article/not-everyone-is-happy-with-the-ny-courts-treating-sex-workers-as-trafficking-victims|title=Not Everyone Is Happy with the NY Courts Treating Sex Workers as Trafficking Victims {{!}} VICE News|newspaper=VICE News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/gira-grant-flawed-justice-sex-workers-article-1.1958688?cid=bitly|title=Gira Grant: Flawed justice for sex workers|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS and trans health disparity ===
The Red Umbrella Project along with the Nation Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) and Best Practices Policy Project (BPPP) published a report that [[transgender]] people in the sex trade are twelve times more likely to be living with HIV/AIDS than transgender people who were never involved in the sex trade and twenty-five times more likely to be living with HIV/AIDS than the general population. The Red Umbrella Project points to the fear of [[condom]]s as being used as evidence of prostitution along with [[Racial profiling|profiling of race]] and [[Gender policing|gender]] by police officers where: "Women and trans people having condoms on them is criminalized, whereas a white [[Cisgender|cis male]] having condoms on him is looked at as safe-sex practice." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/13553/Criminalizing_Condoms_Sex_Workers_Get_Policed_but_Remain_Unprotected|title=Criminalizing Condoms: Sex Workers Get Policed but Remain Unprotected|last=Chen|first=Michelle|date=2012-07-20|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Red Umbrella Project and other advocacy groups have been able to push for reform in heavily [[Liberalism|liberal]] cities such as New York City, [[San Francisco]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-nypd-condoms-20140513-story.html|title=NYPD limits use of condoms seized from sex workers as evidence|last=Susman|first=Tine|date=2014-05-12|work=|publisher=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2016-12-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other more [[Conservatism|conservative]] cities such as [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] use condoms as evidence as part of their anti-prostitution campaign Project Rose.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== The Red Umbrella Diaries ==
[[File:Nahshon and Audacia Ray.jpg|thumb|Nahshon Dion Anderson and Audacia Ray founder of Red Umbrella Project.]]
The Red Umbrella Diaries started as a monthly story-telling event at the Happy Ending Lounge on New York's Lower East Side that sought to shed the [[Social stigma|stigma]] around sex work, make it less isolating and show that it can be both [[Exploitation of labour|exploitative]] and empowering" at the same time. The Red Umbrella Diaries was listed by ''[[The Village Voice]]'' as "The Best Way to Meet Sex Workers (for Free)",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/new-documentary-aims-to-complicate-the-narrative-about-sex-workers-7885128|title=New Documentary Aims to 'Complicate the Narrative' About Sex Workers|last=Margolin|first=Madison|date=2015-11-10|newspaper=Village Voice|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/best-of/2010/sports-and-recreation/best-way-to-meet-sex-workers-for-free-6449197|title=Best Way to Meet Sex Workers (for Free): Red Umbrella Diaries {{!}} Best of NYC® 2010: Your Key to the City|website=Village Voice|access-date=2016-12-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170510170711/http://www.villagevoice.com/best-of/2010/sports-and-recreation/best-way-to-meet-sex-workers-for-free-6449197
 |archive-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was listed as "Best of New York City's Sports and Recreation" in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

The monthly event eventually led to a documentary produced by [[Audacia Ray]] and multi-[[Emmy Award]]-Winning director David Kornfield and funded by the Red Umbrella Project. The documentary featured seven sex workers telling their stories about trading money for sex on the streets of New York City. The documentary premiered at the [[Portland Film Festival]], in [[Portland, Oregon]] and at the [[IFC Center|IFC theater]] in New York City, and was a [[Doc NYC]] official selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/96311-talking-sex-work-with-the-red-umbrella-diaries-producer-audacia-ray/#.WFmLxnrauUm|title=Talking Sex Work with The Red Umbrella Diaries Producer Audacia Ray {{!}} Filmmaker Magazine|last=Wissot|first=Lauren|newspaper=Filmmaker Magazine|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memoir writing workshop ==
In 2012 the Red Umbrella Project started offering [[memoir]] writing workshops in New York City which was made possible in part by a grant from Poets &amp; Writers. The peer-facilitated workshops were open to all people with experience in the [[sex trade]] and allows sex workers a safe space to build writing skills, share their stories with others, and get feedback from their peers. Attendees of the workshop have the option of having their work published in the Red Umbrella Project's biannual literary journal ''Prose &amp; Lore'', and to share their work on stage as part of their Page to Stage workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redumbrellaproject.org/memoir/|title=Memoir Writing Workshops {{!}} Red Umbrella Project|website=redumbrellaproject.org|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pw.org/content/melissa_petro_and_red_umbrella_writers_dispel_myths_about_sex_work?cmnt_all=1|title=Melissa Petro and Red Umbrella Writers Dispel Myths About Sex Work {{!}} Poets and Writers|website=www.pw.org|access-date=2016-12-20|date=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One participant was [[Nahshon Dion Anderson|Nahshon Anderson]], who for eight weeks in 2013 workshopped the first chapter of their nonfiction manuscript Shooting Range that won a 2014 [[Bronx Recognizes Its Own Award]] (BRIO), given by the [[Bronx Council on the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/50th/stories/nahshon-d-ratcliff|title=Nahshon D.

{{good article}}
{{Economic systems sidebar}}
A '''Robinson Crusoe economy''' is a simple framework used to study some fundamental issues in economics.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; It assumes an economy with one consumer, one producer and two goods. The title "[[Robinson Crusoe]]" is a reference to the novel of the same name authored by [[Daniel Defoe]] in 1719.

As a thought experiment in economics, many international trade economists have found this simplified and idealized version of the story important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of [[consumer behaviour]], producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in [[public finance]] the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of [[public goods]] and certain aspects of collective benefits.&lt;ref name="pubfin"/&gt; It is used in [[growth economics]] to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.&lt;ref name="barro"/&gt;

In the Robinson Crusoe economy, there is only one individual – Robinson Crusoe himself. He acts both as a producer to maximise profits, as well as consumer to maximise his utility.&lt;ref name="RMS"/&gt; The possibility of trade can be introduced by adding another person to the economy. This person is Crusoe's friend, [[Man Friday]]. Although in the novel he plays the role of Crusoe's servant, in the Robinson Crusoe economy he is considered as another actor with equal decision making abilities as Crusoe. Along with this, conditions of [[Pareto Efficiency]] can be analysed by bringing in the concept of the [[Edgeworth box]].&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The basic assumptions of the Robinson Crusoe economy are as follows:&lt;ref name="cowell"/&gt; 
# The island is cut off from the rest of the world (and hence cannot trade)
# There is only a single economic agent (Crusoe himself)
# All commodities on the island have to be produced or found from existing stocks

==Framework==
[[File:Income Leisure Preference in a Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=The Robinson Crusoe Economy framework|Figure 1: Income Leisure Preference in a Robinson Crusoe Economy.]]
Robinson Crusoe is assumed to be shipwrecked on a deserted island. Similar to the choices that households (suppliers of labour) face, Crusoe has only two activities to participate in – earn income or pass his time in leisure.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The income generating activity in this case is gathering coconuts.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; As usual, the more time he spends in leisure, the less food he has to eat, and conversely, the more time he spends gathering coconuts, the less time he has for leisure. This is depicted in figure 1.
{{Clear }}

==Production function and indifference curves==
Crusoe's [[indifference curves]] depict his preferences for leisure and coconuts while the [[production function]] depicts the technological relationship between how much he works and how many coconuts he gathers. If the axes depicting coconut collection and leisure are reversed and plotted with Crusoe's indifference map and production function,&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; figure 2 can be drawn:

[[File:The Robinson Crusoe Economy's Production Function and Indifference Curves.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 2: The Robinson Crusoe Economy's Production Function and Indifference Curves]]

The production function is [[Concave function|concave]] in two dimensions and [[Quasiconvex function|quasi-convex]] in three dimensions. This means that the longer Robinson works, the more coconuts he will be able to gather. But due to diminishing marginal returns of labour, the additional number of coconuts he gets from every additional hour of labour is declining.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The point at which Crusoe will reach an equilibrium between the number of hours he works and relaxes can be found out when the highest indifference curve is tangent to the production function.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; This will be Crusoe's most preferred point provided the technology constraint is given and cannot be changed. At this equilibrium point, the slope of the highest indifference curve must equal the slope of the production function.

Recall that the [[Marginal rate of substitution]] is the rate at which a consumer is ready to give up one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of utility.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt; Additionally, an input's marginal product  is the extra output that can be produced by using one more unit of the input, assuming that the quantities of no other inputs to production change.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt; Then,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt;'''

where,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Marginal Product of Labour,''' and

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = Marginal rate of substitution between Leisure and Coconuts'''

==Crusoe's multifaceted role==
Suppose Crusoe decides to stop being a producer and consumer simultaneously. He decides he will produce one day and consume the next. His two roles of consumer and producer are being split up and studied separately to understand the elementary form of consumer theory and producer theory in microeconomics. For dividing his time between being a consumer and producer, he must set up two [[collectively exhaustive]] markets, the coconut market and the labour market.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt; He also sets up a firm, of which he becomes the sole [[shareholder]]. The firm will want to maximise profits by deciding how much labour to hire and how many coconuts to produce according to their prices. As a worker of the firm, Crusoe will collect wages, as a shareholder, he will collect profits and as a consumer, he will decide how much of the firm's output to purchase according to his income and the prevailing market prices.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt; Let's assume that a currency called "Dollars" has been created by Robinson to manage his finances. For simplicity, assume that '''Price&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = $1.00'''. This assumption is made to make the calculations in the numerical example easy because the inclusion of prices will not alter the result of the analysis. For more details, refer to [[Numéraire]] commodities.

===Producer===
{{Main|Production theory}}

[[File:Profit Maximising Condition for the firm in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Figure 3: Profit Maximising Condition for the firm in the Robinson Crusoe Economy]]

Assume that when the firm produces ''C'' amount of total coconuts, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; represents its profit level. Also assume that when the wage rate at which the firm employs labour is ''w'', L amount of labour will be employed. Then,

&lt;math&gt;\Pi=C - wL \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=\Pi + wL \,&lt;/math&gt;

The above function describes iso-profit lines (the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of combinations between labour and coconuts that produce a constant profit of Π). Profits can be maximised when the marginal product of labour equals the wage rate (marginal cost of production).&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; Symbolically,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

Graphically, the iso-profit line must be tangent to the production function.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The vertical intercept of the iso-profit line measures the level of profit that Robinson Crusoe's firm will make. This level of profit, Π, has the ability to purchase Π dollars worth of coconuts. Since '''Price&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt;''' is $1.00, Π number of coconuts can be purchased. Also, the firm will declare a [[dividend]] of Π dollars. This will be given to the firm's sole shareholder, Crusoe himself.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

{{Clear }}

===Consumer===
{{Main|Consumer choice}}

[[File:Robinson Crusoe's Maximisation Problem showing his budget line and indifference curve.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 4: Robinson Crusoe's Maximisation Problem showing his budget line and indifference curve]]

As a consumer, Crusoe will have to decide how much to work (or indulge in leisure) and hence consume.&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; He can choose to not work at all, since he has an endowment of Π dollars from being a shareholder.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;  Let us instead consider the more realistic case of him deciding to work for a few hours. His labour consumption choice can be illustrated in figure 4:

Note that labour is assumed to be a '[[bad (economics)|bad]]', i.e., a commodity that a consumer doesn't like. Its presence in his consumption basket lowers the utility he derives.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; On the other hand, coconuts are goods. This is why the indifference curves are positively sloped. The maximum amount of labour is indicated by L'. The distance from L' to the chosen supply of labour (L*) gives Crusoe's demand for leisure.

Notice Crusoe's budget line. It has a slope of ''w'' and passes through the point '''(0,Π)'''. This point is his endowment level i.e., even when he supplies 0 amount of labour, he has Π amount of coconuts (dollars) to consume. Given the wage rate, Crusoe will choose how much to work and how much to consume at that point where,

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

{{Clear }}

==Equilibrium==

[[File:Equilibrium in both production and consumption in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Figure 5: Equilibrium in both production and consumption in the Robinson Crusoe Economy]]

At equilibrium, the demand for coconuts will equal the supply of coconuts and the demand for labour will equal the supply of labour.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt;

Graphically this occurs when the diagrams under consumer and producer are superimposed.&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; Notice that,

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

-=&gt; '''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'''

This ensures that the slopes of the indifference curves and the production set are the same.

As a result, Crusoe ends up consuming at the same point he would have if he made all the above decisions together. In other words, using the market system has the same outcome as choosing the individual utility maximisation and cost minimisation plans.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; This is an important result when put into a macro level perspective because it implies that there exists a set of prices for inputs and outputs in the economy such that the profit-maximising behaviour of firms along with the utility-maximizing actions of individuals results in the demand for each good equaling the supply in all markets. This means that a
competitive equilibrium can exist. The merit of a competitive equilibrium is that an efficient allocation of resources is achievable.&lt;ref name="HRV"/&gt; In other words, no economic agent can be made better off without making another economic agent worse off.&lt;ref name="vijay"/&gt;

==Production possibilities with two goods==
{{Main|Production-possibility frontier}}
Let's assume that there is another commodity that Crusoe can produce apart from coconuts, for example, fish. Now, Robinson has to decide how much time to spare for both activities, i.e. how many coconuts to gather and how many fish to hunt.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; The locus of the various combinations of fish and coconuts that he can produce from devoting different amounts of time to each activity is known as the production possibilities set.&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; This is depicted in the figure 6:

[[File:Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy with two commodities.jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=Production possibilities with two goods|Figure 6: Production possibilities set in the Robinson Crusoe economy with two commodities.]]

The boundary of the production possibilities set is known as the Production-possibility frontier (PPF).&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; This curve measures the feasible outputs that Crusoe can produce, with a fixed technological constraint and given amount of resources. In this case, the resources and technological constraints are Robinson Crusoe's labour.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

It is crucial to note that the shape of the PPF depends on the nature of the technology in use.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; Here, technology refers to the type of [[returns to scale]] prevalent. In figure 6, the underlying assumption is the usual decreasing returns to scale, due to which the PPF is concave to the origin. In case we assumed increasing returns to scale, say if Crusoe embarked upon a mass production movement and hence faced decreasing costs, the PPF would be convex to the origin. The PPF is linear with a downward slope in two circumstances:
# If the technology for gathering coconuts and hunting fish exhibits constant returns to scale
# If there is only one input in production

So in the Robinson Crusoe economy, the PPF will be linear due to the presence of only one input.

===Marginal rate of transformation===
{{Main|Marginal rate of transformation}}
Suppose that Crusoe can produce 4 pounds of fish or 8 pounds of coconuts per hour. If he devotes L&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; hours to fish gathering and L&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; hours to gathering coconuts, he will produce 4L&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of fish and 8L&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of coconuts. Suppose that he decides to work for 12 hours a day. Then the production possibilities set will consist of all combinations of fish, F, and coconuts, C, such that

&lt;math&gt;F=4L_f \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=8L_c \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_f + L_c=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Solve the first two equations and substitute in the third to get,

&lt;math&gt;F/4 + C/8=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation represents Crusoe's PPF. The slope of this PPF measures the [[Marginal rate of transformation]] (MRT), i.e., how much of the first good must be given up in order to increase the production of the second good by one unit. If Crusoe works one hour less on hunting fish, he will have 4 less fish. If he devotes this extra hour to collecting coconuts, he will have 8 extra coconuts. The MRT is thus,

'''MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;'''
&lt;math&gt;={\Delta C \over{\Delta F}} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;= -8/4=-2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Comparative advantage===
{{Main|Comparative advantage}}
Under this section, the possibility of trade is introduced by adding another person to the economy. Suppose that the new worker who is added to the Robinson Crusoe Economy has different skills in gathering coconuts and hunting fish.&lt;ref name="JADM" /&gt; The second person is called "Friday".

Friday can produce 8 pounds of fish or 4 pounds of coconuts per hour. If he too decides to work for 12 hours, his production possibilities set will be determined by the following relations:

&lt;math&gt;F=8L_f \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=4L_c \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_f + L_c=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=&gt;F/8 + C/4=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,''' MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''' 
&lt;math&gt;={\Delta C \over{\Delta F}} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;= -4/8=-1/2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This means that for every pound of coconuts Friday gives up, he can produce 2 more pounds of fish.

So, we can say that Friday has a Comparative advantage &lt;ref name="JADM" /&gt; in hunting fish while Crusoe has a comparative advantage in gathering coconuts. Their respective PPFs can be shown in the following diagram:

[[File:Joint production possibilities in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|550px|500px|alt=Comparative Advantage||Figure 7: Joint production possibilities in the Robinson Crusoe economy.]]

The joint production possibilities set at the extreme right shows the total amount of both commodities that can be produced by Crusoe and Friday together. It combines the best of both workers.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; If both of them work to gather coconuts only, the economy will have 144 coconuts in all, 96 from Crusoe and 48 from Friday. (This can be obtained by setting F=0 in their respective PPF equations and summing them up). Here the slope of the joint PPF is -1/2.

If we want more fish, we should shift that person who has a comparative advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, the slope of the joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Pareto efficiency==
{{Main|Pareto efficiency}}
Assume that there are '''''c''''' units of coconut and '''''f''''' units of fish available for consumption in the Crusoe Friday economy. Given this endowment bundle '''''(c,f)''''', the Pareto efficient bundle can be determined at the mutual tangency of Crusoe's and Friday's indifference curves in the [[Edgeworth box]] along the Pareto Set ([[Contract curve]]). These are the bundles at which Crusoe's and Friday's [[Marginal rate of substitution]] are equal.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;
In a simple exchange economy, the contract curve describes the set of bundles that exhaust the gains from trade. But in a Robinson Crusoe/Friday economy, there is another way to exchange goods – to produce less of one good and more of the other.&lt;ref name="RMS"/&gt;

[[File:Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy and the Edgeworth Box.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 8: Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy and the Edgeworth Box showing a Pareto Efficient situation within]]

From the figure 8, it is clear that an economy operating at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be [[Pareto efficient]]. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, there is a way to make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

Thus for Pareto Efficiency,

'''''MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = '''''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''''' &lt;ref name="CD"/&gt;

(''for both Crusoe and Friday'')

This can be achieved in a competitive market by decentralising production and consumption decisions, i.e. Crusoe and Friday will both solve their own problems of how much to consume and produce independently.&lt;ref name="TN"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">From a sociological perspective, [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]] is defined as the violation or drift from the accepted [[Norm (social)|social norms]].

'''Secondary deviance''' is a stage in a theory of deviant identity formation.&lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Edwin. 1967. ''Human Deviance, Social Problems and Social Control''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced by [[Edwin Lemert]] in 1951, [[primary deviance]] is  engaging in the initial act of deviance, he subsequently suggested that secondary deviance is the process of a deviant identity, integrating it into conceptions of self, potentially affecting the individual long term. For example, if a gang engaged in primary deviant behavior such as acts of violence, dishonesty or [[Addiction|drug addiction]], subsequently moved to legally deviant or criminal behavior, such as murder, this would be the stage of secondary deviance.

Primary acts of deviance are common in everyone, however these are rarely thought of as criminal acts. Secondary deviance is much more likely to be considered as criminal in a social context. The act is likely to be labelled as deviant and criminal, which can have the effect of an individual internalizing that label and acting out accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sociologyindex.com/deviant-behavior.htm|title=Sociology Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemert made another distinction between primary deviance and secondary deviance. Originally, there may not be a distinguished group of "deviant" people, but instead we all switch in and out of deviant behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Delinquency &amp; Drift|last=Matza|first=David|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1967|isbn=1412821436|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a minority or these individuals starting the rule-breaking acts actually get the attention of others. In that very moment, a person is engaging in secondary deviance and it is said that they start following a more deviant path, or a deviant career - would be a set of roles shaped by the reactions of others in different situations. One's self-identity is vulnerable to all of the social judgement and criticism, and once more we see the continued interplay between the [[Mind, Self and Society|mind, self and society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quarrel Between Invariance and Flux: A Guide for Philosophers and Other Players|last=Margolis|first=Joseph|last2=Catudal|first2=Jacques|publisher=Penn State Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=223–224|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Erving Goffman]] (1961, 1963) showed, when an individual is labelled with a "discrediting" social attribute like shyness can often serve as a permanent mark on one's character.

== Deviancy Process ==
Lemert listed out the process, which he decided, was the way that an individual becomes a secondary deviant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sociology of Deviance: Differences, Tradition, and Stigma|last=Franzese|first=Robert J.|publisher=Charles C Thomas|year=2009|isbn=9780398079949|location=|pages=71–72|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secondary Deviance in Culture and Society ==

=== Japan ===
In [[Japan]] the punitive sanctions tend to be more important. The conditions in [[Penal system of Japan|prison]] are harsh and some of the interrogated offenders have their rights disregarded. However, Japan has decreased their criminal recidivism rate. Criminal [[Recidivism]] is repetition of criminal behavior by an offender previously convicted and punished for an offence. It is also a measure of the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs or the deterrent effect of punishment. Explaining recidivism in the U.S, the [[Labeling theory|labeling]] or secondary deviance perspective has some merit to go with it. Individuals in both countries have common point of views that are unique to their own cultures. As part of the [[individualism]] enforced in the United States, individuals are taught to seek self-importance and [[Libertarian personal autonomy|personal autonomy]]. One learns that he or she is not supposed to submit to others but should always try to ascend above and beyond others. The offender surfaces in the weak relationship built between the individual and the society in which it requires them to accept authority. The offender is usually prepared to test their social power and have a negative response in order to prove that they are still more important than society itself. Opposite to the conventional labeling perspective which is said t promote secondary deviance, social reaction actually provides for aggravating secondary deviance. In Japan, an individual appreciates the society in which he was born and raised. That tendency comes from what is learned culturally about integration with the society. The social reaction towards offenders in Japan has slighter recidivist consequences rather than in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legacy of Anomie Theory: Advances in Criminological Theory|last=Adler|first=Freda|last2=Laufer|first2=William S.|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=|volume=6|location=|pages=329–347|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sociologyindex.com/secondary_deviance.htm|title=Sociology Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simplexity''' is an emerging theory that proposes a possible complementary relationship between [[complexity]] and [[simplicity]]. The term draws from [[General Systems Theory]], [[Dialectics]] (philosophy) and [[Design]]. Jeffrey Kluger wrote a book about this phenomenon that describes how house plants can be more complicated than industrial plants, how a truck driver's job can be as difficult as a CEO's and why 90% of the money donated to help cure diseases are given only to the research of 10% of them (and vice versa).

The term has been adopted in [[advertising]], [[marketing]] and other industries.

== Design aspects ==
* Complexity tends to rise as system elements specialize and diversify to solve specific challenges.
* Simple interfaces tend to improve the usability of complex systems.

== History of the term ==
Like most terms, it has been shaped through dialogues and discussion. Several individuals have participated in the development of the meaning of this term in both formal and informal venues. Most notable is Anuraj Gambhir who is attributed with the creation and popularisation of this term through various presentations and conferences around the world.

=== Education ===

One of the first formally published instances of the word was in the journal 'Childhood Education' (1924), in the article it appears to be used to discuss education and psychology related issues.&lt;ref name="unknown"&gt;(Unknown).

The [[analysis of algorithms|complexity of algorithms and of mathematical problems]] is one of the central subjects of [[theoretical computer science]].  Simplexity was whimsically defined by computer scientists [[Andrei Broder|Broder]] and [[Jorge Stolfi|Stolfi]] as a concept worthy of as much attention as complexity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The simplexity of a problem is the maximum inefficiency among the reluctant algorithms that solve P .  An algorithm is said to be pessimal for a problem P if the best-cast inefficiency of A is asymptotically equal to the simplexity of P"&lt;ref name="Broder"&gt;Broder, Andrei and Jorge Stolfi. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=990536 "Pessimal Algorithms and Simplexity Analysis."]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The concept of Simplexity was amplified in the mid 1970s by Bruce Schiff (self-described theorist) and restated as "The process by which nature strives towards simple ends by complex means. The result of a simple random act can only be predicted by complicated means. The spatial placement of each atom in a transplanted plant root ball is difficult to predict, but, the plant will adapt its root ball to the hole, and continue to thrive. This conceptual expression harkens back to original statements of Newton, "Nature is pleased with simplicity", Dalton, "rule of greatest simplicity," and Einstein, "Nature is the realization of the simplest conceivable mathematical ideas."

In 1974 [[Rustum Roy]] and Olaf Müller noted simplexity in the structure of [[ternary compound]]s:
:By dealing with approximately ten ternary structural groupings we can cover the most important structures of science and technology specific to the non-metallics world. It is a remarkable instance of nature's 'simplexity'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] &amp; Olaf Müller (1974) ''The Major Ternary Structural Families'', pages 3 &amp; 4,Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|9780387064307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, simplexity has been defined by Philippe Compain in the context of an article on the future of synthetic chemistry as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Simplexity may be defined as the combination of simplicity and complexity within the context of a dynamic relationship between means and ends.";&lt;ref name="Compain"&gt;[http://www.lactualitechimique.org/spip.php?numero_article437 Philippe Compain "The challenge of simplexity. The simple and the complex in organic synthesis" Act. Chim., 2003, 263-264, pages 129-134.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pCompain"&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2006/nj/b601837h#!divAbstract Philippe Compain et al. "Looking forward: a glance into the future of organic chemistry" New J. Chem., 2006, 30, pages 823-831.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The quest for simplicity constitutes indeed the basis for all future challenges of [[chemical synthesis]] including diversity, selectivity and [[green chemistry]]. Due to the almost infinity of molecules that could in theory be synthesized,&lt;ref name="Lipinski"&gt;A. Lipinski, F. Lombardo, B. W. Dominy, P. J. Feeney, Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001,46,3.&lt;/ref&gt; the focus of synthetic research has been shifted gradually from target-oriented synthesis to  diversity-oriented synthesis ([[divergent synthesis]]). A scientific approach based on the power of the molecular construction game and guided by an ideal for simplicity, has a high potential for discovery. The creative combination of synthetic methodologies, mixing simplicity and maximization of structural complexity, is indeed expected to be a powerful tool to produce unprecedented molecular structures with beneficial properties for mankind.

=== Interdisciplinary ===

Simplexity became the topic of formal discussion at the Hamburg Trend Day in Germany.  Among the formal contributors were [[Peter Wippermann]], Dr. [[Norbert Bolz]], [[David Bosshart]], Designer [[Ora Ito]], [[Markus Shepherd]], [[Susane Tide Frater]].

''Simplexity: Why Simple Things Become Complex (and How Complex Things Can Be Made Simple)'' by [[Jeffrey Kluger]] details many ways in which simplexity theory can be applied to multiple disciplines.  Kluger offers a look at simplexity at work in economics, sports, linguistics, technology, medicine, and dozens of human behaviors.  ''Simplexity'' also provides insight into how readers can improve their lives by understanding the interplay of complexity and simplicity.

=== Finance ===
Simplexity has been used by [[Jens Nordvig]] to describe the particular aim of his analytics firm Exante Data.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Maybe the best word for what we are trying to achieve is ''simplexity''. A research product that draws on a very complex analytical foundation, but is presented in a very simple and easy to digest manner. ... This concept of ''simplexity'' may be important in a much broader sense. The general idea of simplexity could be key to effectively service a growing community of so-called “quantmental” fund managers that use large amounts of data and modeling in their processes, while still applying a human touch in the final investment decisions. We think ''simplexity'' will be increasingly important to how we develop our overall research at Exante."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://exantedata.com/news/letter-simplexity-in-research|title=Letter: Simplexity in Research|last=|first=|date=|work=exante data|access-date=2018-05-03|publisher=Exante Data|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Social aspects ==
Professor [[Peter Wipperman]] proposed a social definition &lt;blockquote&gt;"We long for simplicity and satisfaction.  Simplexity therefore stands for a balance between the growing complexity of daily life and our own personal satisfaction.  In order to attain this state, we have to stop always striving to make optimal decisions.  In the future, it will be more important to make judgments that are just good enough."&lt;ref name="Wipperman"&gt;Wipperman, Peter. (year unknown).

'''Simplicity''' is the state or quality of being [[wikt:simple|simple]]. Something easy to understand or explain seems simple, in contrast to something complicated. Alternatively, as [[Herbert A. Simon]] suggests, something is simple or [[Complexity|complex]] depending on the way we choose to describe it.&lt;ref&gt;Simon 1962, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; In some uses, the label "simplicity" can imply [[beauty]], purity, or clarity. In other cases, the term may occur with negative connotations to suggest, a deficit or insufficiency of nuance or of complexity of a thing, relative to what one supposes as required.

The concept of simplicity has been related to in the field of [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]] (e.g., in [[Occam's razor]]). Religions also reflect on simplicity with concepts such as [[divine simplicity]]. In the context of human [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], simplicity can denote freedom from hardship, effort or confusion;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} specifically, it can refer to a [[simple living]] style.

==Uncomplicated==
{{See also|Degree of difficulty|Complexity|Concision}}
"Simplicity" is the state or quality of being [[wikt:simple|simple]]. An easy-to-understand [[tutorial]] or [[white paper]] with a narrow focus can be seen as simple, particularly in contrast more complicated thorough [[documentation]] covering a topic's breadth. Similarly, "simplicity" can be used in reference to tasks that need little [[skill]] to perform well.

In some uses, the label "simplicity" can imply [[beauty]], purity, or clarity. In other cases, the term may occur with negative connotations to suggest, a deficit or insufficiency of nuance or of complexity of a thing, relative to what one supposes as required, as when referring to people as [[simpleton]]s.

==In philosophy of science==
{{Expert needed|philosophy
|date=May 2018}}

The concept of simplicity has been related to in{{clarify|date=April 2015}} the field of [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]].

According to [[Occam's razor]], all other things being equal, the ''simplest'' theory is most likely true. In other words, simplicity is a meta-scientific criterion by which scientists evaluate competing theories.

A distinction is often made{{by whom|date=April 2015}} between two senses of simplicity: [[syntactic simplicity]] (the number and complexity of hypotheses), and [[ontological simplicity]] (the number and complexity of things postulated). These two aspects of simplicity are often referred to as [[elegance]] and [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;

[...] The terms ‘parsimony’ and ‘simplicity’ are used virtually interchangeably in much of the philosophical literature.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John von Neumann]] defines simplicity as important esthetic criteria of scientific models: {{Quote|[...] (scientific model) must satisfy certain esthetic criteria - that is, in relation to how much it describes, it must be rather simple. I think it is worth while insisting on these vague terms - for instance, on the use of word rather. One cannot tell exactly how "simple" simple is. [...] Simplicity is largely a matter of historical background, of previous conditioning, of antecedents, of customary procedures, and it is very much a function of what is explained by it.&lt;ref&gt;

==In religion==
Simplicity is a theme in the [[Christian]] religion. According to [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], God is [[Divine simplicity|infinitely simple]]. The Roman Catholic and Anglican religious orders of [[Franciscan]]s also strive for personal simplicity. Members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) practice the [[Testimony of Simplicity]], which involves simplifying one's  [[personal life|life]] to focus on what is important and disregard or avoid what is least important. Simplicity is tenet of Anabaptistism, and some [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups like the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]], make an effort to live simply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qcfamilytree.org/a-visit-to-spring-valley-bruderhof/|title=A visit to Spring Valley Bruderhof|date=2014-03-13|work=QC Family Tree|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''social construction of disability''' is the idea that society and its institutions have the power to construct disability around social expectations of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea argues that disability is construction based on several localized social expectations. For example, in the medieval period disability was constructed around a person's moral behavior. Disability was seen as divine punishment or a side effect of a moral failing being physically or biologically different was not enough to be considered disabled. Only until the European Enlightenment did society change its definition of disability to be more related to biology. However these biological definitions of health centered around what is considered to be healthy for most Western Europeans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
Around the year 1970, in North America various groups including sociologists, disabled people, and disabled focused political groups began to pull away from the accepted medical lens of viewing disability. These groups began to discuss things like oppression, civil rights, and accessibility. This change in discourse resulted in conceptualizations of disability that was rooted in social constructions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Overview===
Canada and the United States have operated under the premise that social assistance benefits should not exceed the amount of money that can be earned through labor in order to give citizens an incentive to search for and maintain employment. This has led to widespread poverty amongst disabled citizens. In the 1950s, disability pensions were established and included various forms of direct economic assistance; however, these amounts were set at exceedingly low monetary levels. Since the 1970s, both governments have viewed unemployed disabled citizens as excess labor due to continuous high rates of unemployment and have made minimal attempts to increase employment, which keeps disabled people at poverty- level incomes due to the ‘incentive’ principle. Poverty is the most debilitating circumstance handicapped people face, resulting in the inability to afford proper medical, technological and other assistance necessary to participate in society.&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite book|last=Wendell|first=Wendell|title=The Social Construction of Disability|publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=1996 |pages=60|url=http://moodle.fhs.cuni.cz/pluginfile.php/19118/mod_resource/content/0/Wendell_Social_construction.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws and public policy===
Laws have helped to recognize disability as a social construct rather than simply physical impairment. In 1776, the Continental Congress passed the first national law regarding wounded soldiers. Rather than stating attitudes towards disability, the act proposed that how the US viewed disability was closely linked to its views about the worth of the soldiers. This segment of the Act contains a few inferences which relate to disability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whereas, in the course of the present war, some commissioned and non-commissioned officers of the army and navy, as also private soldiers, marines, and seamen, may lose a limb, or be otherwise so disabled as to prevent their serving in the army or navy, or getting their livelihood, and may stand in need of relief[.]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liachowitz|first=Claire|title=Disability as a Social Construct|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=22–23|isbn=0-8122-8134-9}}

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this resolution related disability to “getting a livelihood,” it also implies through the recognition of an additional connection to serving in the military that disability is not just a failure to function properly but rather built systemically through the ability to function in certain settings. Also, this resolution states that disability is not only based upon physical capabilities and societal roles but social aspects as well.

The [[Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA) is a prime example of how laws have changed the societal roles of disabled people. The Act was signed by President Bush in July 1990. It prohibited the discrimination of disabled people by employers and also required that mass transportation, commercial buildings and public accommodations be accessible to disabled people. After the law was passed, Congress realized that many people with disabilities were secluded from society and could not live independently. Before the ADA was made into a law, disabled people could not land a job, enter a restaurant or store, or access the bus. A 1986 poll revealed that 66 percent of disabled citizens were jobless, in spite of the fact that many proclaimed they desired and were capable of employment. The same poll showed that 40 percent of handicapped people could not find a job due to the inaccessibility of transportation and public places. As a result of implementation of the ADA, 6&amp;nbsp;million private businesses and 80,000 state and local governments made their facilities available to the disabled. In July 1992, the provisions of the Act incorporating 43&amp;nbsp;million disabled individuals in to the workforce were set into motion. Many business owners realized that the changes made to their establishment were of little financial consequence, typically under $500. The conditions of disabled people before and after this law was passed are examples of how society constructs disability through discrimination and physical barriers. By eliminating these obstacles, the disabled are more integrated into society.&lt;ref&gt;Stalcup, pp. 17, 23, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment of disability==
In the United States, according to the [[Social Security Administration]], to be considered "disabled," a claimant must provide medical evidence displaying proof of and severity of the impairment(s). Medical evidence comes from sources that have treated or evaluated the claimant for his/her impairment(s). Acceptable medical sources include medical professionals including licensed physicians, licensed or certified psychologists, licensed optometrists (only for purposes of establishing visual disorders), licensed podiatrists (only for purposes of establishing impairments of the foot and/or ankle), and qualified speech-language pathologists (only for purposes of establishing speech or language impairments). Qualified speech-language pathologists must be licensed by the State education in the State in which he/she practices, or hold a Certificate of clinical Competence from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/evidentiary.htm|title=Disability Evaluation Under Social Security Part II - Evidentiary Requirements. |publisher=The United States Social Security Administration |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying for disability (and the assessment of) can take place in person at the Social Security field office, by telephone, by mail, or by filing online. The application process involves supplying a description of the impairment, treatment sources, and other information. A field office then verifies non-medical eligibility requirement (including age, employment, marital status, or Social Security coverage information) and sends the case to the state agency ([[Disability Determination Services]], or DDS) for evaluation (DDS are state agencies that develop medical evidence and deciding whether or not a claimant - the person requesting disability benefits - is disabled or blind under the law).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/general-info.htm|title=Disability Evaluation Under Social Security Part I - General Information. |publisher=The United States Social Security Administration |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Paralympics===
Since the invention of the television in the early 1900s, this medium has held a pervasive influence on our outlook on many aspects of society, disability being one of them. One example is how the 2000 Paralympics versus the Olympics were televised. The 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games, one of the biggest in history, was barely acknowledged by mainstream media prior to the event. The Sydney Paralympic organizers worked extensively to try to solicit coverage of the Games. For more than two years, they negotiated with Channel 7 to broadcast the competitions. Channel 7 proposed that if the Paralympics paid them $3&amp;nbsp;million in case of lack of advertising revenue they would agree to broadcast the event. Eventually, the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) and Channel 7 announced they would be broadcasting the Games and Channel 7 would “complement” the coverage with a highlights package that ran daily on its pay-TV Channel. ABC also promised to broadcast at least 60&amp;nbsp;minutes of daily highlights. Later on, ABC finally agreed to air a live broadcast of the opening and closing ceremonies. The opening and closing ceremonies were actually quite popular amongst viewers, watched by 2.5&amp;nbsp;million; however the rest of the games proved to be quite the opposite. While the Olympics were covered live throughout the entire event, the Paralympics apparently was not important enough to deserve the same live coverage before the initial showing. By deeming the disabled to be less important than those without disabilities and by separating the Olympics and Paralympics, disability is socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Goggin, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last several decades, technology has transformed networks, services, and communication, and promoted convergence of telecommunications, computer use, etc. Technology changes, or, the [[Digital Revolution]], has changed how people work, learn, and interact. The digital revolution has directed people to use computers, cell phones, and other technologies more and more. However, many people who use such technology experience a form of disability. Even if it is not physically visible, those with, for example, cognitive impairments, hand tremors, vision impairments, have some form of disability that don't allow them to be able to fully access technology the way that those without a "technological disability" do.

===Education===
Special education "...is a social construction whereby a society can label a group in order to isolate responsibility for that group's welfare and thereby protect normal sources of power. In education, society has created many social categories, including learning disabilities. Such social categories represent the structure of society. The success of special educations students who have learning disabilities seems to be measured in material terms; but if they don't have the opportunity to achieve this success, it is hard to turn to the American community for support, as so many people in this community condemn them for their differences.

Thus, education tries to restore the idea of a moral community, one in which the members question what constitutes a good life, to form a reconceptualization of education, where physical and mental conditions would be seen as part of a range of abilities, where different talents were distributed in different ways, and all talents would be recognized. All students would be included in the educational network instead of being set apart as special cases, and it would be acknowledged that all humans have special needs and no one is normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capper|first=Colleen|title=Educational Administration in a Pluralistic Society|publisher=State University of New York Pr|date=July 1993|pages=173–174, 176–177|isbn=978-0791413739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6114">In [[Sweden]], a common '''system for weights and measures''' was introduced by law in 1665. Before that, there were a number of local variants. The system was slightly revised in 1735. In 1855, a decimal reform was instituted that defined a new Swedish inch as {{frac|1|10}} Swedish foot ({{convert|2.96|cm |in|abbr=in|disp=or}}). Up to the middle of the 19th century, there was a law allowing the imposition of the [[death penalty]] for falsifying weights or measures. Sweden adopted the [[metric system]] in 1889. Only the [[Swedish mile]], ''mil'', has been preserved, now measuring {{convert|10|km|smi |abbr=off}}. 

== Length ==
The Swedish units of length included the following:
* ''aln'' – Forearm (cf. [[Ell]]) (pl. ''alnar''). After 1863, {{cvt|59.37|cm|ft}}. Before that, from 1605, 59.38 cm as defined by King [[Carl IX of Sweden]] in [[Norrköping]] 1604, based on ''Rydaholmsalnen''.
* ''famn'' – [[Fathom]], 3 ''alnar''.
* ''kvarter'' – Quarter, {{frac|1|4}} ''aln''
* ''fot'' – Foot, 1/2 ''aln''. Before 1863, the [[Stockholm]] ''fot'' was the commonly accepted unit, at {{cvt|29.69|cm |ft}}.
* ''linje'' – Line, after 1863 {{frac|1|10}} ''tum'', {{convert|2.96|mm |in|abbr=in}}. Before that, {{frac|1|12}} ''tum'' or 2.06 mm.
* ''mil'' – Mile, also ''lantmil''. From 1699, defined as a unity mile of 18000 ''alnar'' or {{cvt|10.69|km|smi}}. The unified mile was meant to define the suitable distance between inns. (The current [[Swedish mil]] is exactly 10 [[kilometer]]s.)
* ''nymil'' – New mile from 1889, 10 km exactly. Commonly used to this day, only referred to as ''mil''.
* ''kyndemil'' – The distance a torch will last, approx {{cvt|16|km|smi}}.
* ''skogsmil'' – Also ''rast'', distance between rests in the woods, approx. {{cvt|5|km|smi}}. 
* ''fjärdingsväg'' – {{frac|1|4}} ''mil''
* ''stenkast'' – Stone's throw, about {{cvt|50|m|0}}, used to this day as an approximate measure.
* ''rev'' – 160 ''fot'', for land measurement, was 100 ''fot'' after 1855.
* ''stång'' – 16 ''fot'', for land measurement
* ''tum'' – Thumb (inch), {{frac|1|12}} ''fot'', 2.474 cm. After 1863 {{frac|1|10}} ''fot'', 2.96 cm, not much accepted by professional users in mechanics and carpentry who later switched to English inch (2.54 cm, abandoned only late 20th century) and metric system.
* ''tvärhand'' – Hand, 4 inches.

== Area ==
* ''kannaland'' – 1000 ''fot''², or {{cvt|88.15|m2|sqft}}
* ''kappland'' – {{cvt|154.3|m2}}.
* ''spannland'' – 16 ''kappland''
* ''tunnland'' – 2 ''spannland'' or {{cvt|4,937.6|m2|sqft}}, about 1 acre
* ''kvadratmil'' – Square ''mil'', 36 million square ''favnar'', from 1739.

'''''The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent''''' is an influential essay, part of the essay collection ''The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent, and Other Essays'' published in 1915 by [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]], English professor at [[Columbia University]].{{Sfn|Graff|1989|p=278}}{{Sfn|Rubin|1992|p=161}}

The essay was first read before the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] of [[Amherst College]], where Erskine taught before joining Columbia. {{Sfn|Erskine|1992|p=vii}} Later, it was published in quarterly magazine ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'' in 1914. {{Sfn|Trilling|2008|p=x}}{{Sfn|Erskine|1992|p=vii}} During his tenure at Columbia  from 1909 and 1937, Erskine formulated General Honors Course. In the early 1920s he started teaching a ''great books'' course at Columbia,  which later founded the influential [[Great Books]] movement.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==History==
In 1963, the essay was published in the ''[[Gateway to the Great Books]]'' - Volume 10: Philosophical Essays, a 10-volume book series published by [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Gateway to the Great Books |publisher=Centre for Study of Great Ideas| url = http://www.thegreatideas.org/gbgateway.html | accessdate = 2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently it was also included in the book of selected essays also titled ''The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent: Selected Essays'' (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) published posthumously in 2000),  edited by [[Lionel Trilling]], another Columbia faculty and literary critic, and had an introduction by critic [[Leon Wieseltier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Night Vision by Andrew Delbanco |publisher= The New York Review of Books | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2001/jan/11/night-vision/ |author=Andrew Delbanco|date= January 11, 2001|accessdate = 2014-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trilling was one of Erskine's students and later taught the "Great Books" course himself; he chose the essay as the lead and the title as it characterized the essence his selection. {{Sfn|Kimmage|2009|p=322}}&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |author=Richard Gilman|authorlink=Richard Gilman|title=The Foremost Authority |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/books/00/09/24/reviews/000924.24gilmant.html |date=September 24, 2000 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theta nigrum''' ("black [[theta]]") or '''theta infelix''' ("unlucky theta") is a [[Symbols of death|symbol of death]] in Greek and Latin [[epigraphy]].&lt;ref name="Mednik"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mednikarova  |first=Iveta |last2= |first2= |date= |title=The Use of Θ in Latin Funerary Inscriptions |url= |journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=136 |issue=|pages=267–276 |doi= |access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore of Seville]] notes the letter was appended after the name of a deceased soldier and finds of [[papyrus|papyri]] containing military records have confirmed this use.&lt;ref name="Mednik" /&gt; Additionally it can be seen in [[Gladiator Mosaic|The Gladiator Mosaic]].

'''Thubten Jigme Norbu''' ({{bo|t=ཐུབ་བསྟན་འཇིགས་མེད་ནོར་བུ་|w=Thub-stan 'Jigs-med Nor-bu}}) (August 16, 1922 – September 5, 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/09/america/obits.php Thubten Norbu, eldest brother of Dalai Lama, dies], Douglas Martin, September 9, 2008 [[The New York Times International Edition]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/08/tibet Obituary:Thubten Jigme Norbu]&lt;/ref&gt;), recognised as the [[Taktser Rinpoche]], was a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[lama]], writer, [[civil and political rights|civil rights activist]] and professor of Tibetan studies and is the eldest brother of the [[14th Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso. He was one of the first high-profile Tibetans to go into exile and was the first Tibetan to [[Tibetan Americans|settle in the United States]].

==Early life==
Thubten Jigme Norbu was born in 1922 in the small, mountain village of [[Taktser]] in the [[Amdo County]] of Eastern [[Tibet]]. At the age of three, he was recognized by the [[13th Dalai Lama]] as the 24th incarnation of Taktser Rinpoche. At the age of eight, he was taken to [[Kumbum Monastery]] in [[Amdo]], the birthplace of [[Je Tsongkhapa]] who is the founder of the [[Gelug]] sect of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Historically, [[Kumbum]] was also the frequent residence of previous Dalai Lamas and [[Panchen Lama]]s. At Kumbum, Norbu began his training as a monk. At the age of 27, he was selected to serve as the [[abbot]] of [[Kumbum Monastery]]. At this time, Kumbum was one of the largest monasteries in Eastern Tibet.

Kumbum, however was one of the first areas to be invaded by the army of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC). The PRC held Norbu under [[house arrest]] in the monastery, sleeping in his room and following him 24 hours a day. The PRC demanded that he travel to [[Lhasa]], denounce the Tibetan government, and denounce his younger brother the Dalai Lama, who was then about 15 years old. Norbu pretended to agree with the PRC's demands and, as a result, was able to reach Lhasa to warn his brother of the [[History of Tibet (1950–present)|seriousness of the Chinese invasion]].

Norbu decided in 1950 that he would leave Tibet and attempt to [[protests and uprisings in Tibet since 1950|educate the world]] about the atrocities in Tibet and the actions of the PRC.

After leaving Tibet, Norbu worked continually for Tibet and the Tibetans in exile. He served as the Representative of the Dalai Lama and the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] to Japan and North America. He also served as Professor of Tibetan Studies at [[Indiana University Bloomington]]. He wrote a number of books, including, in 1959, his autobiography, ''Tibet Is My Country'' as told to [[Heinrich Harrer]] and in 1968 ''Tibet: Its History, Religion and People'', with [[Colin Turnbull]]. During the years, Norbu frequently lectured about the Tibetan situation at seminars throughout the world.

In 1979, Rinpoche founded the [[Tibetan Cultural Center]] (TCC) in Bloomington, a center devoted to preserving [[Tibetan culture]] and religion. In 1989, Colin Turnbull came and participated in the building of Tibetan Cultural Center with him. The facility, renamed the [[Tibetan-Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center]] (or TMBCC) in 2006, has a Cultural Building, housing Tibetan works of art such as a [[Bhaisajyaguru|Medicine Buddha]] [[sand mandala]], and Tibetan butter sculptures. The Cultural Building also has a library of Tibetan-related works and a gift shop where visitors may purchase articles made by Tibetan refugees in exile.

His brother the Dalai Lama has visited the TMBCC on five separate occasions. In 1987, he dedicated the [[Changchub Chorten]]; in 1996 the Dalai Lama consecrated the cornerstone of the [[Kumbum Chamtse Ling Temple]]; in 1999, he was at the Center for 12 days when he gave the [[Kalachakra]] Initiation for World Peace and Harmony for the [[Kalachakra stupa]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmbcc.org/our-past/ Founder of TMBCC]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003, the Dalai Lama dedicated the Kumbum Chamtse Ling Temple in an interfaith ceremony; in 2007 he dedicated a new arch at the temple as well as holding a series of classes over six days.

==Independence walks==

In 1995, Norbu cofounded the [[International Tibet Independence Movement]] (ITIM). He has led three walks for Tibet's independence. In 1995, he led a week-long walk 80 miles from Bloomington, Indiana to [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. In 1996, this was followed by a 300-mile, 45-day walk from the PRC embassy in Washington, DC to the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]], surrounded by New York City. The following year, joined by [[Dadon]] with her 3 years old son, he led a 600-mile walk from [[Toronto]] to New York City, beginning on March 10 ([[Tibetan Uprising Day]]) and ending June 14 ([[Flag Day]]). In 1998, ITIM walked for independence starting in [[Portland, Oregon]] and ending in [[Vancouver]]. In 2000, one arm of ITIM walked from San Francisco and another from [[San Diego]]. The two branches met in Los Angeles to greet the Dalai Lama who was giving a teaching and empowerment at [[Thubten Dhargye Ling]].

==Life in the US==
[[File:Bloomington-TibetanCC-Stupa-9107.jpg|thumb|On the grounds of Tibetan Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center, Bloomington, Indiana]]
Norbu lived at the Tibetan-Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center with his wife Kunyang. They have three sons, Lhundrup, Kunga and Jigme Norbu, all born in New York. In late 2002, Norbu suffered a series of strokes and became an invalid. In 2005, the Dalai Lama appointed the  [[8th Arjia Rinpoche]], another former abbot of Kumbum Monastery, to take over the directorship of the Tibetan-Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center.  Norbu remained until his death part of the daily life of the TMBCC where he was acclaimed as the founder of the facility and the foremost proponent in the world for the recognition and preservation of the culture of Tibet.

Norbu died at the age of 86 on September 5, 2008 at his home in Indiana in the United States having been ill for several years. His body was [[cremation|cremated]] in a traditional Buddhist ceremony.&lt;ref name="cremation"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=62690&amp;comview=1 |title=Dalai Lama's brother cremated Thursday |author=Elvia Malagon |publisher=''[[Indiana Daily Student]]'' |date=September 12, 2008 |accessdate=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His youngest son, Jigme, died at the age of 45 on February 14, 2011 while carrying on his father's work. He was hit by a car in Florida during a walk to promote Tibetan independence and raise awareness of Tibet.

In [[law]] and [[ethics]], '''universal law''' or '''universal principle''' refers as concepts of legal [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] actions, whereby those [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] and rules for governing human beings' conduct which are most universal in their acceptability, their applicability, translation, and [[philosophical]] basis, are therefore considered to be most legitimate.  One type of Universal Law is the Law of Logic which prohibits logical contradictions known as sophistry.  The Law of Logic is based upon the universal idea that logic is defined as that which is not illogical and that which is illogical is that which involves a logical contradiction, such as attempting to assert that an apple and no apple can exist at and in the same time and in the same place, and attempting to assert that A and not A can exist at and in the same time and in the same place. What goes around , comes around.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1380">In [[law]] and [[philosophy]], '''voluntariness''' is a choice being made of a person's [[free will]], as opposed to being made as the result of [[coercion]] or [[duress]]. Philosophies such as [[libertarianism]] and [[voluntaryism]], as well as many legal systems, hold that a contract must be voluntarily agreed to by a party in order to be binding on that party. The [[social contract]] rests on the concept of the voluntary [[consent of the governed]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] provide that "Before accepting a plea of guilty or [[nolo contendere]], the court must address the defendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force, threats, or promises (other than promises in a plea agreement)."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/Rule11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The actual voluntariness is suspect, in that it is common for prosecutors to threaten to seek more prison time unless the defendant agrees to plead guilty.

{{Rights}}{{Chinese|s=维权运动|t=維權運動|p=Wéiquán Yùndòng|l=rights defending movement}} 
The '''Weiquan movement''' is a non-centralized group of lawyers, legal experts, and intellectuals in China who seek to protect and defend the [[civil right]]s of the citizenry through litigation and legal activism. The movement, which began in the early 2000s, has organized demonstrations, sought reform via the legal system and media, defended victims of [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights abuses]], and written appeal letters, despite opposition from [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] authorities. Among the issues adopted by Weiquan lawyers are property and housing rights, protection for [[HIV/AIDS in the People's Republic of China|AIDS]] victims, [[Pollution in China|environmental damage]], [[Freedom of religion in China|religious freedom]], [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|the press]], and defending the rights of other lawyers facing disbarment or imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice" /&gt;

Individuals involved in the Weiquan movement have met with occasionally harsh reprisals from Chinese officials, including disbarment, detention, harassment, and, in extreme instances, torture.&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice" /&gt; Authorities have also responded to the movement with the launch of an education campaign on the "socialist concept of rule of law," which reasserts the role of the Communist Party and the primacy of political considerations in the legal profession, and with the [[Three Supremes]], which entrenches the supremacy of the Communist Party in the judicial process.

==Background==
Since the [[Legal history of China#1978-1981|legal reforms]] of the late 1970s and 1980s, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has moved to embrace the language of the [[rule of law]] and establish a modern [[Court system of the People's Republic of China|court system]]. In the process, it has enacted thousands of new laws and regulations, and begun training more legal professionals.&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice" /&gt; The concept of "rule of law" was enshrined in the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]], and the CCP embarked on campaigns to publicize the idea that citizens have protection under the law. At the same time, however, a fundamental contradiction exists in the implementation of rule of law wherein the CCP insists that its authority supersedes that of the law;&lt;ref name=fordham/&gt; the constitution enshrines rule of law, but also emphasizes the principle of the "leadership of the Communist Party." The judiciary is not independent, and is therefore subject to politicization and control by the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice"/&gt; This has produced a system that is often described as "rule by law," rather than rule of law.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Because judicial decisions are subject to the sometimes arbitrary assessments of the CCP, citizens who attempt to make use of the legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their cause is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Cai Yongshun, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Collective_resistance_in_China.html?id=e97ErKeqb08C "Collective Resistance in China: Why Popular Protests Succeed or Fail"] (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Defendants who find themselves facing criminal charges, such as for conducting activism or for their religious beliefs, often have few means of pursuing an effective defense.

The Weiquan movement coalesced in the early 2000s in response to these inherent contradictions and the arbitrary exercise of [[Judicial system of the People's Republic of China|legal authority in China]], though its roots could be traced to the consumer protection movement that began in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt; The movement is informal, and can be understood as including lawyers and legal activists who advocate for [[civil rights]] and defend the interests of citizens against corporations, government or Communist Party organs. Fu Hualing and Richard Cullen note that Weiquan lawyers "are generally always on the side of the weaker party:  (migrant) workers v. employers in labor disputes; peasants in cases involving taxation, persons contesting environmental pollution, land appropriation, and village committee elections; journalists facing government censorship; defendants subject to criminal prosecution; and ordinary citizens who are discriminated against by government policies and actions."&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt;

The emergence of the Weiquan movement was made possible by a confluence of factors, including a market for their services, and an emerging rights consciousness. It was also facilitated by the 1996 "Lawyers Law," which changed the definition of lawyers from "state legal workers" to professionals holding a legal certificate who perform legal services. The law effectively delinked lawyers from the state, and gave lawyers greater (though still limited) autonomy within the profession.&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lynch&gt;Elizabeth Lynch, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1825431 Rule of Law Mirage], George Washington International Law Review, 26 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weiquan lawyers tend to be especially critical of the lack of judicial independence in China. Rather than challenging particular laws, they frame their work as being in keeping with Chinese laws, and describe their activities as a means of defending and upholding the Constitution against abuses.&lt;ref name="transnational"/&gt; As such, Weiquan lawyering has been described as a form of [[Rightful resistance]].&lt;ref name="conscientious"/&gt;

==Weiquan lawyers==
{{Weiquan Lawyers}}
{{main|Weiquan Lawyers}}
Weiquan Lawyers ({{zh|维权律师}}), or "rights protection" lawyers, refer to a small but influential movement of lawyers, legal practitioners, scholars and activists who help Chinese citizens to assert their constitutional, civil rights and/or public interest through litigation and legal activism.&lt;ref name="MarazziChen2012"/&gt; In the context of a rising number of lawyers in China,&lt;ref name="peopledaily"/&gt; the proportion of Weiquan lawyers is very small&lt;ref&gt;Teng Biao, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/24/AR2009072402940.html 'Chinese Human Rights Lawyers Under Assault'], ''The Washington Post'', 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Weiquan Lawyers face considerable personal, financial and professional risks.&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt;

Notable Weiquan Lawyers include [[He Weifang]], [[Xu Zhiyong]], [[Teng Biao]], [[Guo Feixiong]] and [[Chen Guangcheng]], [[Gao Zhisheng]], [[Zheng Enchong]], and [[Li Heping]].&lt;ref name="purdue"/&gt; Many barefoot lawyers are peasants who teach themselves enough law to file civil complaints, engage in litigation, and educate fellow citizens about their rights.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Some Weiquan lawyers are the pragmatists and some are more radical.&lt;ref name="fordham"/&gt;

==Major fields==

===Freedom of expression===

Although freedom of speech is enshrined in Article 35 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Chinese authorities enforce restrictions on political and religious expression.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/hrrolindex.php 'Human rights and rule of law in China']&lt;/ref&gt; Such restrictions are sometimes in accordance with [[Political offences in China#Inciting subversion of the state|Article 105]] of the criminal code, which contains vague and broadly defined provisions against "[[inciting subversion of state power]]". Weiquan lawyers, along with international human rights organizations, have argued that the provisions against subversion are inconsistent both with China's own constitution and with international human rights standards, particularly in light of the lack of transparency and clear guidelines used in applying the laws.&lt;ref name="freedom"/&gt;

Several Weiquan lawyers have been involved in litigation and other forms of advocacy to defend the rights to free expression for individuals charged with the crime of subversion.&lt;ref name="gpo"/&gt; Notable cases include that of [[Liu Xiaobo]], a prominent Beijing intellectual sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion in December 2009. [[Chengdu]] activist [[Tan Zuoren]] was sentenced to five years for inciting subversion for publishing writings on the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square Massacre]], advocating for the families of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]] victims, and accepting interviews from the Falun Gong-affiliated [[Sound of Hope]] radio. His lawyers were reportedly barred from entering the courtroom.&lt;ref name="chinageeks"/&gt; In October 2009, intellectual [[Guo Quan]] was sentenced to 10 years in prison for publishing "reactionary" articles online.&lt;ref name="intermediate"/&gt;
 
Weiquan lawyers have also challenged the application of state secret laws, which are sometimes used to prosecute individuals who disseminate information on politically sensitive issues. In November 2009, for instance, lawyers were involved in arguing for [[Huang Qi]], a [[Sichuan]] activist who had advocated online for the parents of Sichuan earthquake victims. Huang was sentenced to three years in prison for possession of state secrets.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

===Judicial independence===
The Chinese Constitution enshrines rule of law, but simultaneously emphasizes the principle of the "leadership of the Communist Party."&lt;ref name="HRW Thin Ice"/&gt; The legal profession itself is subordinate to the authority of the Communist Party; the [[Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Justice]], not the [[All China Lawyers Association|bar associations]], is responsible for issuing and renewing lawyers' licenses.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; Weiquan lawyers have argued that this structure precludes the emergence of genuine rule of law, and in some cases have advocated for reforms to advance judicial independence and the protection of legal professionals.

In late August 2008, a collection of several dozen Beijing lawyers signed a petition stating that the Beijing Bar Association leaders should be elected by the organization's members, rather than being appointed. The petition letter stated that selection process in place for the Association's directors is inconsistent with official guidelines and the Chinese constitution, and should be replaced with a democratic voting process.&lt;ref name="chinafreepress"/&gt; The Beijing Bar Association responded to the campaign by asserting that "Any individual who uses text messages, the web or other media to privately promote and disseminate the concept of direct elections, express controversial opinions, thereby spreading rumors within the Beijing Bar Association, confuse and poison people's minds, and convince people of circumstances that do not exist regarding the so-called 'Call For Direct Elections For the Beijing Bar Association' is illegal."&lt;ref name="chinafreepress2"/&gt; The following year, the Beijing Bureau of Justice refused to renew the licenses of 53 Beijing Weiquan lawyers, all of whom had signed the petition for elections to the Bar Association.&lt;ref name="nytimes3"/&gt;

===Land rights===
{{Main|Forced evictions in China}}

[[File:Shanghai Tower construction, April 12, 2011.jpg|thumb|250px|The practice of land requisitions and forced evictions is widespread in China as local governments make way for private real estate developers.]]
Under [[Property Law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese property law]], there is no privately held land; "urban land" is owned by the state, which grants land rights for a set number of years. Rural, or "collectively owned land," is leased by the state for periods of 30 years, and is theoretically reserved for agricultural purposes, housing and services for farmers.&lt;ref name=CECCproperty/&gt;

[[Forced eviction (China)|Forced evictions]] are forbidden under [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which China has ratified. Under China's constitution and other property laws, expropriation of urban land is permitted only if it is for the purpose of supporting the "public interest," and those being evicted are supposed to receive compensation, resettlement, and protection of one's living conditions.  The "public interest" is not defined, however, and abuses are common in the expropriation process, with many citizens complaining of receiving little or no compensation.&lt;ref name=CECCproperty&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_house_committee_prints&amp;docid=f:61507.pdf 2010 Annual Report]. 10 October 2010, pp 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced evictions with little or no compensation occur frequently in both urban and rural China, with even fewer legal protections for rural citizens. Collectively owned rural land may be "reallocated" at the discretion of authorities, and in many regions local governments collude with private developers to reclassify rural land as urban land, which can then be sold.&lt;ref name=CECCproperty/&gt; from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, an estimated 40 million Chinese peasants were affected by land requisitions.&lt;ref name=fordham/&gt; Citizens who resist or protest the evictions have reportedly been subjected to harassment, beatings, or detention,&lt;ref name=CECCproperty/&gt; and land-related grievances occasionally escalate into large-scale protests or riots.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, [http://www.economist.com/node/4462719 “Protest in China: The Cauldron Boils”], 29 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Weiquan lawyers have advocated for the rights of individual citizens whose land and homes were taken with inadequate compensation, including Shanghai lawyer Zheng Enchong.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; [[Ni Yulan]], a Beijing lawyer, was herself left homeless by forced eviction, and became an outspoken advocate for victims before being sentenced to two years in prison.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"/&gt;

In 2007, a 54-year-old farmer in Heilongjiang [[Yang Chunlin]] published numerous articles on human rights and land rights, and helped to organise a petition entitled: "We want human rights, not the Olympics."&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; The petition reportedly collected over ten thousand signatures.&lt;ref name="voanews"/&gt; Yang was put to trial, and sentenced to five years in prison, where he has allegedly been tortured. [[Li Fangping]] was hired to defend him, but was denied access to his client.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

===Defense of ethnic minorities===
Several Weiquan lawyers, including Teng Biao, [[Jiang Tianyong]],&lt;ref name="thestar"/&gt; and Li Fangping,&lt;ref name="rfa"/&gt; offered legal aid to [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] in the wake of the March 2008 [[2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan protests]]. The protests resulted in the imprisonment of at least 670 Tibetans, and the execution of at least four individuals. Chinese government sources asserted that the unrest and violence in Tibet had been masterminded by the [[Dalai Lama]] and executed by his followers for the purpose of fomenting unrest and disrupting the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing. The [[Open Constitution Initiative]] (OCI), operated by several Weiquan lawyers and intellectuals, issued a paper in May 2009 challenging the official narrative, and suggesting that the protests were instead a response to economic inequities, [[Han Chinese]] migration, and religious sentiments. The OCI recommended that Chinese authorities better respect and protect the rights and interests of the Tibetan people, including religious freedom, and pursue the reduction of economic inequality and official corruption.&lt;ref name="cecc"/&gt;

Tibetan Filmmaker Dhondup Wangcheng was sentenced to six years in prison for making a documentary on [[human rights in Tibet]] in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics. Two lawyers who sought to represent him, [[Chang Boyang]] and [[Li Dunyong]], faced threats and harassment for their advocacy.&lt;ref name="amnesty"/&gt;

In July 2010, a group of Chinese activists including Teng Biao co-signed a letter to the Chinese leadership to protest the 15-year prison sentence that had been meted out to [[Uyghurs|Uighur]] journalist Halaite Niyaze.&lt;ref name="uyghurcongress"/&gt; Niyaze was not permitted to have a lawyer at his trial, where he was charged with "endangering state security." According to reports, Niyaze was being charged because he had criticized the Chinese government in an interview with a Hong Kong news agency for not doing enough to prevent the [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

===Falun Gong===
[[Image:April25Zhognanhai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Falun Gong practitioners demonstrate outside the [[Zhongnanhai]] compound in April 1999 to demand official recognition. The practice was banned three months later.]]
Falun Gong, a spiritual qigong discipline that once claimed tens of million adherents in China, was banned in July 1999 under the leadership of the Communist Party, and a campaign was launched to suppress the group.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; In an attempt to have Falun Gong adherents renounce their belief in the practice, they are subject to state-sanctioned, systematic violence in custody,&lt;ref name="washingtonpost4"/&gt; sometimes resulting in death.  Some sources indicate hundreds of thousands may have been detained in reeducation-through-labor camps for practicing Falun Gong and/or resisting persecution.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalpost"/&gt;

In November 1999, the [[Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China|Supreme People's Court]] offered a judicial interpretation of article 300 of the criminal code, stating that Falun Gong should be regarded as a ''"xie jiao''," or cult.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; Large numbers were subsequently sentenced to long prison terms, often under article 300, in what are typically very short trials without the presence of a lawyer.&lt;ref name=CECC2010&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_house_committee_prints&amp;docid=f:61507.pdf ' Annual Report 2010], 10 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 alone, the Falun Dafa Information Center reported that several hundred Falun Gong adherents have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 18 years.&lt;ref name="faluninfo"/&gt; Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, note that the application of the law to persecute Falun Gong adherents contravenes both China's own constitution and international standards.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; Several Weiquan lawyers have argued similarly while defending Falun Gong adherents who face criminal or administrative sentencing for their beliefs. Lawyers who have defended Falun Gong include [[Guo Guoting]], Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu,&lt;ref name="hrichina"/&gt; Wang Yonghang,&lt;ref name="amnesty5"/&gt;[[Tang Jitian]] and Liu Wei,&lt;ref name="nytimes3"/&gt; among others.

In addition to litigation work, Weiquan lawyers like Gao Zhisheng have also advocated publicly and in the media for human rights for Falun Gong. In 2004 and 2005, Gao wrote a series of letters to China's top leadership detailing accounts of torture and sexual abuse against Falun Gong practitioners, and calling for an end to the persecution of the group.&lt;ref name=fordham/&gt; In response, Gao lost his legal license, was put under house arrest, detained, and was reportedly tortured.&lt;ref name="nytimes7"/&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
Some Weiquan lawyers have advocated for the rights of HIV/AIDS victims who contracted the virus as a result of state-sponsored blood drives. In the 1990s, government officials in central China, and especially in [[Henan]], encouraged rural citizens to sell blood plasma in order to supplement their incomes. Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV. According to activists, victims have not been compensated, and no government officials were held accountable.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic, which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of [[Li Changchun]], the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan.

[[Hu Jia (activist)|Hu Jia]] is arguably the most well known advocate for HIV/AIDS victims, having served as the executive director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute of Health Education and as one of the founders of the non-governmental organization Loving Source.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/chinese-activist-gets-jail-sentence-20080403 'Hu Jia jailed for three and a half years], 4 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's rights===
[[Chen Guangcheng]], a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to prominence for defending victims of China's [[one-child policy]]. First implemented in 1979, the one-child policy mandates that couples may only have one child, though there are exceptions for some rural citizens, ethnic minorities, and couples who were themselves only children.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Fitzpatrick, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912861,00.html 'A Brief History of China's One-Child Policy'], ''Time'', 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures, Chinese authorities and family planning staff have been accused of carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 'Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China'], 22 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Elegant, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1615936,00.html 'Why Forced Abortions Persist in China'], ''Time'', 30 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions.&lt;ref name="wp_8July06"&gt;{{cite news| title = Chinese to Prosecute Peasant Who Resisted One-Child Policy |work=The Washington Post| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/07/AR2006070701510.html| date = 8 July 2006 | first=Philip P. | last=Pan | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underground Christians===
China's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, yet also provides a caveat specifying that only "normal" religious activities are permitted. In practice, religious freedom is granted only within the strictly prescribed parameters of the five officially sanctioned "patriotic" religious associations of [[Buddhist Association of China|Buddhism]], [[Chinese Taoist Association|Taoism]], [[Islamic Association of China|Islam]], [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement|Protestantism]] and [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association|Catholicism]].  Groups falling outside the state-administered religions, including "underground" or [[Chinese house church|"house church"]] Christians, are subject to varying degrees of repression and persecution.&lt;ref name=DOS2011&gt;U.S. Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/171651.pdf July–December, 2010 International Religious Freedom Report: China (Includes Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau)], 13 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are no definitive figures on the number of underground Christians in China, some estimates have put their total number in excess of 70 million. At least 40 Catholic bishops operate independently of official sanction, and some are under surveillance, house arrest, detention, or have disappeared.&lt;ref name=DOS2011/&gt; Several leaders and members of underground [[Protestant]] churches have also been detained and sentenced to reeducation through labor or prison terms. Violent raids and demolitions have been carried out on underground churches, sometimes resulting in injury to congregants inside. Chinese officials have labelled several underground Protestant churches as a ''xie jiao'' (translated literally as "evil religion"), or cult, thus providing a pretext for harsher punishment of members.&lt;ref name="cecc8"/&gt;

Several prominent Weiquan lawyers themselves identify with the underground Protestant movement, and have sought to defend church members and leaders facing imprisonment. These include Zhang Kai, Li Heping, and Gao Zhisheng. Former house church leader [[Bob Fu]]'s US-based organization "ChinaAid" has sponsored legal cases, and provided "rule-of-law training" and legal help for distressed clients in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/02/nation/la-na-nn-texas-chinaaid-20120502|title=Chen Guangcheng plight: To Texas man, it echoes of the familiar|first=Molly|last=Hennessy-Fiske|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=28 June 2013|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/respect-for-life-declining-in-china-dissident-20130404-2h826.html|title=Respect for life declining in China: dissident|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=28 June 2013|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|first=Audrie|last=Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other initiatives===
A number of specific events have attracted the help and attention of Weiquan activists. In the March 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province, [[Sichuan schools corruption scandal|shoddy school construction]] resulted in the collapse of several schools full of students. A number of Weiquan lawyers, including [[Tan Zuoren]], were involved in advocating for the rights of parents, and in investigating allegations that corrupt officials were responsible for the poor construction. Parents and lawyers met with reprisals from Chinese officials for their activism.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Later the same year, it was revealed that large quantities of infant formula had been [[2008 Chinese milk scandal|tainted with melamine]], causing 300,000 infants to fall ill and resulting in several deaths. A group of parents of the victims were reportedly detained for attempting to draw media attention to their plight. Dozens of lawyers—particularly from the provinces of Hebei, Henan and Shandong—offered pro-bono legal services to victims, but their efforts were [[2008 Chinese milk scandal#Pressure on the legal profession|obstructed by authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Jane Macartney| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5152668.ece |title=US places ban on Chinese food imports |date= 14 November 2008 |work=The Times |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radio Free Asia, [http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/lawyer-10072008150126.html 'Lawyers’ Outrage at Milk Case Ban'], 7 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual human rights cases, such as the [[Deng Yujiao incident]] and the death of [[Qian Yunhui]], have also drawn help from rights defenders such as Wu Gan.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

In 2003, a group of legal scholars, including [[Teng Biao]] and [[Xu Zhiyong]], formed the [[Open Constitution Initiative]] ({{zh|公盟}}) to advocate for greater rule of law. The organization was involved in the [[Sun Zhigang]] case, and has advocated for petitioners, labor rights, freedom of expression, HIV/AIDS victims, Tibetans, land rights, and protection of public health, among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, [http://www.economist.com/node/14098751 'Open Constitution Closed'], 23 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government response==

===Retrenchment on rule of law===
In response to the emergence of the Weiquan movement, which often makes use of the official language about "rule of law" to justify its work, in April 2006 a political campaign was launched to solidify the Communist Party's leadership over judicial work, combat the idea of greater independence for judges and lawyers, and educate people and judicial authorities about the "socialist concept of rule of law." The campaign was announced by [[Luo Gan]], then the head of the Party Central Committee's [[Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China|Political and Legislative Affairs Committee]].  Luo urged that in order to protect political stability, "forceful measures" be adopted "against those who, under the pretext of rights-protection (weiquan), carry out sabotage."&lt;ref name="qsjournal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald C. Clarke, "China's Legal System: New Developments, New Challenges," Cambridge University Press, (Cambridge, UK: The China Quarterly, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The launch of the campaign coincided with a crackdown on Weiquan lawyers.

Shortly after the campaign's launch, Party Committees provided instruction to judges reminding them of the political goals that their work must uphold. According to one document issued to judges in [[Zhejiang]] and quoted by [[Human Rights Watch]], "Recently, some judges have started to believe that to be a judge you just have to strictly apply the law in a case. In fact, this kind of concept is erroneous [...] all the legal formulations have a clear political background and direction [...] We must stamp out the kind of narrow viewpoint that thinks that you can also do court work by having judicial independence."&lt;ref name="lawbase"/&gt;

During a December 2007 conference on political-legal work, CCP general secretary [[Hu Jintao]] articulated the theory of the "[[Three Supremes]]," which emphasized again that legal work should regard as supreme the concerns and interests of the Communist Party. In March 2008, [[Wang Shengjun]] was confirmed as the new head of the [[Supreme People's Court]]. Wang, who has no formal legal training himself, abandoned the efforts of his predecessors to improve judicial competence, training, and autonomy, and instead placed primary importance on the ideological implications of the "Three Supremes" theory and upholding the leadership of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="harvard"/&gt;

In 2010, China's Ministry of Justice issued two new regulations intended to "strengthen the supervision and management of lawyers and law firms". According to the Associated Press, the new regulations would serve to "allow authorities to punish lawyers ... for actions such as talking to the media or even causing 'traffic troubles.'"&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt;

In March 2012, China's Ministry of Justice issued a new directive requiring lawyers first obtaining their license or renewing an existing license to swear an oath of loyalty to the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong|first=Edward|title=Chinese Lawyers Chafe at New Oath to Communist Party|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/world/asia/chinese-lawyers-chafe-at-new-oath-to-communist-party.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ministry's website, a section of oath includes the following: “I swear to faithfully fulfill the sacred mission of legal workers in socialism with Chinese characteristics. I swear my loyalty to the motherland, to the people, to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, and to protect the dignity of the Constitution and laws." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Oath Lawyers Must Take" (进入律师队伍必须进行宣誓)|url=http://www.moj.gov.cn/index/content/2012-03/21/content_3445267.htm?node=7318|publisher=Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression of lawyers and coercive measures===
Weiquan lawyers have faced various challenges to their work from the Chinese government, including disbarment or suspension, violence, threats, surveillance, arbitrary detention, and prosecution.&lt;ref name="hrw9"/&gt; This is particularly true for lawyers who take up politically sensitive cases. Reports of harassment, intimidation, and violence against Weiquan lawyers increased in 2006 following the launch of the campaign to promote the "socialist concept of the rule of law." Authorities have refused to renew the licenses of several dozen Weiquan lawyers,&lt;ref name="cecc10"/&gt; and several have effectively been banned for life from the legal profession. In 2009, for instance, at least 17 Weiquan lawyers were not permitted to renew their legal licenses after taking on politically sensitive cases.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights in China, [http://hrichina.org/content/300 Chinese Rights Defense Lawyers Under All-out Attack by the Authorities], 4 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Weiquan lawyers have themselves been sentenced to prison in response to their activism. A selection of notable instances of suppression are listed here:

* [[Gao Zhisheng]], once recognized as one of China's ten most promising lawyers, was an advocate for a range of disenfranchised individuals and minorities. In 2006, after he wrote a series of letters to the Chinese leadership concerning the torture of Falun Gong adherents, Gao had his legal license revoked and his law firm was shut down.&lt;ref name="nyt1134536400"/&gt; His family was placed under house arrest, and he was detained for six months. Gao was sentenced, with a five-year reprieve, to four years in prison. He has been the subject of several prolonged disappearances into custody, during which he has reportedly been tortured.&lt;ref name="taipeitimes"/&gt;
* On 27 December 2007, AIDS and pro-democracy activist Hu Jia was detained as part of a crackdown on dissents during the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. A well known rights advocate who had advocated on behalf of AIDS victims, peasants, victims of land requisitions, Hu had also been critical of the lack of human rights progress that had been made ahead of the Olympic games.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Yardley, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/world/asia/01iht-dissident.1.9665869.html 'China formally arrests detained activist Hu Jia'], ''The New York Times'', 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Hu pleaded not guilty at his trial in March 2008. On 3 April 2008, he was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison for "inciting subversion of state power."&lt;ref name="Chinese civil rights activist sentenced for subversion"/&gt; He had previously been under house arrest, and has reportedly been beaten by police.&lt;ref name="amnesty11"/&gt;
* In response to his work to bring a class action lawsuit against family planning authorities in Linyi, Shandong Province in 2005, [[Chen Guangcheng]] was put under house arrest, threatened, detained, and beaten. Three other Weiquan activists – [[Li Fangping]], Li Subin, and [[Xu Zhiyong]]— visited him to offer support, but were themselves beaten and interrogated. On 24 August 2006, he was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for "damaging property and gathering crowds to disturb transport order." Following his release, he remains under house arrest.&lt;ref name="hrw12"/&gt;
* On 22 April 2010, Beijing lawyers Liu Wei and Tang Jitian were permanently disbarred for defending Falun Gong practitioners.&lt;ref name="amnesty13"/&gt;
* On 13 May 2009, lawyers Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu are violently beaten and detained in [[Chongqing]] for investigating the death of Jiang Xiqing, a 66-year-old Falun Gong practitioner killed in a labor camp. One month earlier, Beijing lawyer Cheng Hai was similarly beaten by police in Sichuan province for seeking to defend a Falun Gong adherent.&lt;ref name="hrichina"/&gt;
* [[Yang Chunlin]] was arrested in July 2007 and charged with "inciting subversion of state power".&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; His trial began in February 2008 in the city of [[Jiamusi]].&lt;ref name="rfa15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www"/&gt; Yang was sentenced to five years in prison on 24 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chrdnet.org/2008/03/24/“olympics-prisoner”-yang-chunlin-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison/ "'Olympic Protester' Yang Chunlin sentenced to five years in prison"], Chinese Human Rights Defenders, 24 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained his innocence throughout the trial. During and after the hearing at which he was sentenced, Yang was reportedly beaten with an electric rod on at least two occasions.&lt;ref name="rfa17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost18"/&gt;
* On 4 July 2009, around 20 security agents broke into the home of Wang Yonghang. Wang, a Weiquan lawyer from [[Dalian]] City, had defended Falun Gong adherents. He was taken into custody for interrogation and was reportedly beaten severely.&lt;ref name="amnesty5"/&gt; Wang's lawyers were not permitted to contact him. In November 2009, Wang was sentenced in a closed court to seven years in prison for his advocacy on behalf of Falun Gong practitioners. When his lawyers were permitted to see him in January 2010, they reported that he had been tortured.&lt;ref name="gpo20"/&gt;
* On 17 July 2009, authorities in Beijing raided and shuttered the Open Constitution Initiative, an NGO established by legal scholars Teng Biao and Xu Zhiyong.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost21"/&gt;
* On 20 February 2011, several Weiquan activists were detained following online calls for pro-democracy protests in China, including Chen Wei, Jiang Tianyong, Tang Jitian, and Teng Biao.&lt;ref name="guardian22"/&gt;
* In May 2014, as multiple Chinese activists began preparing for the 25th anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], a number of lawyers were arrested for planning or being suspected of planning demonstrations. Among those arrested was [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a lawyer who was involved in organising the demonstrations in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Kaiman, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/china-cracks-down-dissent-tiananmen-anniversary China cracks down on dissent ahead of Tiananmen anniversary], ''The Guardian'', 13 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International response==
Although there is relatively little awareness of the Weiquan phenomenon as a movement outside of China, Western governments and human rights organizations have consistently expressed concern over the treatment of individual Weiquan lawyers in China, some of whom have faced disbarment, imprisonment, prolonged disappearance, sentencing and alleged torture for their work in promoting civil rights and speaking out against one-party rule. In October 2010, a bipartisan group of 29 members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] pressed President Obama to raise the cases of Liu Xiaobo and Gao Zhisheng with the Chinese leadership, writing of Gao Zhizheng's prolonged detention: "If lawyers are hauled away for the "crime" of defending their clients, then even the pretense of rule of law in China has failed."&lt;ref name="indiatimes"/&gt; The U.S. State Department claims to have raised the cases of these two individuals with their Chinese counterparts.&lt;ref name="america"/&gt;

In 2008, Hu Jia was awarded the [[Sakharov Prize]] by the [[European Parliament]] recognizing his human rights advocacy.&lt;ref name="bbc23"/&gt; The same year, Hu and Gao Zhisheng received nominations for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and were considered to be favorites for the award.&lt;ref name="telegraph24"/&gt; Two years later, seven members of the U.S. House of Representatives nominated imprisoned lawyers Gao Zhisheng and Chen Guangcheng, along with fellow dissident Liu Xiaobo for the prize.&lt;ref name="members"/&gt; The letter noted that these individuals have sought to "raise the Chinese people's awareness of their dignity and rights, and to call their government to govern within its constitution, its laws, and the international human rights agreements it has signed," and thereby made a significant contribution to peace. The Nobel Prize Committee awarded the honor to Liu in absentia in December 2010.&lt;ref name="nytimes25"/&gt;

'''Wolf ticket''' is a literal translation of the [[Russian language]] phrase {{lang|ru|волчий билет}} (volchiy bilyet), a colloquial expression to denote a version of a document with restrictive clauses in comparison to the full document. Figuratively, the phrase remains in use in many of the countries of the former [[communist bloc]], usually to denote any kind of document that negatively affects one's career.

Originally the phrase was used in [[Imperial Russia]] to denote a document issued in lieu of the [[internal passport]] to persons who were given a half-year postponement of [[katorga]] or [[exile]] for settling personal affairs. Later, it denoted a limited certificate for completion of studies. Unlike a regular diploma, it merely stated that the studies were completed, but the student was not allowed to take exams for reasons of poor study or improper behavior.

A wolf ticket was a serious impediment to one's career. Still later this phrase was applied to a document issued in place of an [[internal passport]] to persons released from imprisonment ("certificate of release"). Usually this kind of document restricted the rights of a citizen in terms of place of residence (the [[101st kilometre]] rule), occupation, and so on.

Throughout his school years, he had been pushed away from a similar peer group. In December 2002, he planned to leave school in order to attend [[Seil High School]]. From 1999 to 2003, he was active in the anti-LGBT discrimination movement, the [[LGBT rights movement]], and homophobia opposition movement. In 2001, he debuted in literary world, involving himself in poetry, writing and columnist activities also, but mainly poetry. He received much discrimination and was the victim of prejudice, because of his sexual identity. In 2002, he joined the [[Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea]], and was also a peace activist and a [[conscientious objector]] to [[military service]]. Up until his death, he wrote more poetry and prose, but his work was rejected, as he was [[gay]].

After 2000 he was involved in a LGBT human rights, anti-discrimination, disability rights, and an anti-war peace movement.

Yun created an Interpia 98 homepage, but his website was visited by an internet terrorist, and due to personal attacks in 2002, he closed his homepage.

He awoke to his sexual identity during his time in middle school. He was recognized for his [[sexual identity problems]], and as a result of this, he was picked on.&lt;ref name="bhitto"&gt;[http://www.sisapress.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7901 죽음으로 마감한 ‘커밍아웃’] The Sisajournal 2003.05.15 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was excluded by his peer group and his neighbourhood due to discrimination.&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; On October 8, 2002, he was sent to a psychiatric clinic by his family, despite his emphatic claims that he was not a psychopath.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; He was dependent on [[green tea]] (녹차), rosary, tobacco, alcohol, foundation and hypnotics,&lt;ref name="clemen"/&gt; which became known metaphorically as his "six friends"&lt;ref name="rapido"/&gt; as Korean writer [[Kwak Byong-chan]] was based on his one nickname ''Yook Woo-dang'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/opinion/column/588397.html 지상에 천국을 일군 한 동성애인의 꿈] Hangyeorye 2013.05.21 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also means "six friends" in the Hangul language. In his last years of life, it was Yun's favorite phrase for the majority of his activity and content, and was used as a signature.

His family disapproved of his [[homosexuality]] and [[homophobia|pressured him to be heterosexual]], but Yun said, "I can't be heterosexual and don't want to be heterosexual.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt;" He was thoroughly isolated, about which he would complain in his diary. In October 2002, one diary entry from Yun said, "I do not think I'm abnormal. In this world born and living right-handed, also naturally left-handed is born and living. This road exists as also another road exists. Most persons use the well-worn path, but I have to go on a lone desolate path.&lt;ref name="suja"/&gt;" He enjoyed reading, ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' and ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''.

=== Poetry and writings ===
During his adolescence, he tried to drown his pain in writing and also went to volunteer in orphanages and disabled groups. Some famous quotes from his works include the following:

: ''"The world is hatred to like monster for we / So we living lurking place here and there / do you know, but this we is one of human. (Complain)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20130423029028 “동성애는 사람이 사람 좋아하는 문제… 이상한가요”] The Seoulnews 2013-04-23, 29 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;"''

: ''"Before you say, going to heaven to believe in Jesus Christ/ Pastor! begin with you first conduct. / after death, you when excuse see to Jesus?(one Pastor)&lt;ref name="didros"&gt;[http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=109051 10년전 기독 청소년 ‘육우당’이 왜 목을 맨 지 아십니까?] 미디어오늘 2013.04.27 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;"''

Another famous poem by Yun, "Reborn", reads:

: ''"My soul was transform for the flower rain / after I went to your side / You are so insensibility to this me / Dear You please listen to My sweet soft whisper.&lt;ref name="suja" /&gt;"''

Yun hinted of the censorship present in South Korean society through his many works and stories. He often embedded satire within his poems, prose, novels and social criticism, yet still sang softly about love.

After completing elementary school, Yun wrote poetry and prose, but the majority of his work was given the notoriety to not be seen or read, due to his sexual identity. In his writings, he openly confessed his disappointment in prejudices and conventions, superstition and the remnants of blind faith, and the tradition of clinging to old customs, which strongly dominated the lives of many in South Korea.

: ''"Possibly before die, never I will not get a good evaluation eponymous poet. A heterosexual and asceticism and moralism, formalism aim for this society, because I am only just heretic and deviants.&lt;ref name="bhitto" /&gt;"''

He harbored ill feelings towards South Korean political leaders due to the institutionalized homophobia rampant in South Korea, and because the majority of South Korean political figures were opposed to homosexuality, feeling that it violated [[Conservatism|traditional social norms and values]].

He was deeply upset by the assertion by political figures that his work violated traditional Korean social mores, due to the conservative attitudes prevalent in South Korean society.&lt;ref name="bhitto"/&gt;

=== LGBT rights movement ===
From March 1, 2000, he attended [[Seil High-school]] in [[Bupyeong-gu]]. However, in December 2002, he dropped out of high school. After leaving school, he moved to the [[Dongdaemun District]] in [[Seoul]] and became involved in the literary and LGBT activist scene. Due to the widespread criticism of the homosexual themes in his writings, especially by fundamental Christians, he was unable to write under his real name despite wanting to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsmaker.khan.co.kr/khnm.html?mode=view&amp;code=115&amp;artid=201304291149471&amp; &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;특집| 차별금지법 논란&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;‘차별의 범위’에 무슨 내용 담겼길래?] wikly Kyonghyang 1024 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=3408 교회는 성(性)소수자를 향한 차별과 혐오에 침묵할 것인가?] Catollic news 2010.04.22 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he used the pseudonym Yook Woo Dang, a reference to the six objects he relied on most - green tea, cosmetic foundation, alcohol, tobacco, rosary beads and sleeping pills.

After the year 2000, Yun objected to the theory that [[HIV]] and related infections are directly transmitted by homosexuals, who were considered to be vectors for the virus. In his objection, he stated that the theory was a groundless assumption. Early on in the movement, he was a person who persuaded people that homophobia was unacceptable and fought against discriminatory objections to homosexuality on the internet. In January 2002, he became a long-distance activist. In January 2001, he joined the D [[Sijo]](시조 詩調) poet club and W Sijo poet club,&lt;ref name="bhitto"/&gt; with a rank as a student member. He continued his activity and contributed many writings, including poetry, to [[Sijo]] for a period of two years.&lt;ref name="bhitto"/&gt; In February 2001, he joined and later worked for the organization [[Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaus.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=14405 또 한 명의 게이가 자살하기를 바라는 건가] medias 2010.11.02 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became a [[conscientious objector]] to Korea's conscription military service.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; Yun emphasised that viewing homosexuality as sinful and denying acceptance for homosexuals as 'children of God' is wrong, whereas some Conservative Christian groups' ideology viewed it as anti-biblical activity.&lt;ref name="jonnon"&gt;[http://sarangbang.or.kr/kr/info/hrinput/hr_content.html?seqnum=11561 한 동성애자의 죽음을 통한 절규] 인권운동사랑방 No.2325, 2003.04.29 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn of 2002, Yun sought after more volunteers or full-time employees for the [[Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea]].&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; His earnest desires were approved for March of the following year.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt;

=== Other activity ===
In January 2003, he was hired to work in a gay bar in [[Gangnam-gu]], [[Seoul]]. However, due to anxiety, he soon retired from the job.&lt;ref name="bhitto"/&gt; Afterwards, parallel with several part-time jobs, he committed to become a civil and human rights activist. On March 24, 2003, he became a full-time employee of [[Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea]].&lt;ref name="suja"/&gt; He participated in media censorship-opposition movements. Yun was repetitively insistent, particularly with some South Koreans who were intent on trampling many artists, entertainers and writers, even though pop culture was fresh with a variety of creativity and various artists. They were condemned in the name of morals and ethics.

Yun was an LGBT rights activist, and during this time participated in the abolition movement of LGBT and LGBT related media which was regarded as "youth Harmful media specified"(청소년 유해 매체). At the same time, he always attended anti-war and peace rallies in Jongro, Seoul.&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; Slowly, he became the leading representative in anti-war and peace movements  as a guest speaker.&lt;ref name="bhitto"/&gt; Additionally, he participated in an opposition campaign in Seoul which aimed to prevent the government from sending troops overseas to participate in the [[Iraq War|Iraq war]].&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; On April 3, he was a determined participant in the [[Conscientious objector|Conscientious objection to military service]](양심적 병역 거부).&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; Yun declared his refusal the wholesale slaughter of innocent peoples. Also, he participated in the sex worker rights movement and antidiscrimination movements, sex workers discrimination opposition movements. also with joint to [[Ableism]] objection movements.

=== Conflict with fundamentalist Christianity ===
South Korean fundamentalist Christians and some South Korean Christian denominations hated on homosexuality. For a long time, fundamentalist Christians and some Christian denominations believed that homosexuals and transgender individuals were "crazy". In the year 2000, Yun disputed with them. Yun insisted that homosexuality was not a [[mental illness]] and that it was personal taste. Although Yun was a devout Catholic, there was an immense amount of criticism by Christianity on homosexuality. It is known that he largely despaired.&lt;ref name="ralbo"&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/rights/584469.html 소년의 자살 10년 지났지만…동성애 따가운 시선은 여전] The Hangyeorye 2013.04.24 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2003, the [[South Korea]]n [[National Human Rights Commission of Korea]] Association made a formal announcement that the LGBT and LGBT-related media regarded as "youth Harmful media specified" was human rights abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=4468 신앙인의 고뇌 담은 동성애자 이야기 발간] 가톨릭뉴스 지금여기 2010.12.08 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was welcoming and at the same time condemning of some of the more Christian groups, while government agencies instigated that there was sexual corruption. Yun debated them by setting forth counterarguments and objections to contribute to daily newspapers. Two day later, some South Korean conservative Christian groups said, "Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed to the wrath of God for judgment of sulfur, sexual depravity because homosexuals. the Bible strictly forbids homosexuality. Commission has to withdraw the decision.&lt;ref name="didros"/&gt;"; they argued that homosexuality disrupted the natural order and caused HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmynews.com/nws_web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001369587 동성애자 천주교 형제의 죽음, 그후 6년 변한 건 없다] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128114257/http://www.ohmynews.com/nws_web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001369587 |date=January 28, 2015 }}  오마이뉴스 2010.04.22 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, he said:

He vigorously protested, but his objections were viewed to still not be acceptable, so on April 13 he made a real name contribution to Hnagyeorye:&lt;ref name="rasons"&gt;[http://legacy.www.hani.co.kr/section-001042000/2003/04/001042000200304131819236.html 동성애자도 인권 존중해야 약자희생 모는 편견 곤란] Hangyeorye 2003.04.13 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, he withdrew from Catholic society, causing a backlash of Christian fundamentalist homophobia,&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; which was later taken back in the following two days.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; Afterwards, he prayed daily, with a desire for homosexuals to not be discriminated by his God.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; Yun Hyon-seok was determined to commit suicide from this point, due to the anger and hatred against many homosexual Christians.

=== Death ===
In April 2003, Hyon-seok and other human-rights activists were making preparations for a May Day meeting.&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; For a long time, he was a devout Christian, despite the criticism from other Christians because of his sexual identity. Yun had been disappointed for a long time, but he was devoted to his religion.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; He had immediately suffered [[Homophobia|homosexual discrimination]] and contempt. On 26 April 2003, he committed suicide at Dongdaemun street in [[Seoul]] by hanging himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newamericamedia.org/2014/02/queer-rights-activists-in-south-korea-step-up-efforts-to-support-lgbtq-youth.php Queer Rights Activists in South Korea Step Up Efforts to Support LGBTQ Youth]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26 at 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm, Yun was reported to have been drinking alcohol.
