The '''136th Civil Engineer Squadron (136 CES)''' is a unit of the [[136th Airlift Wing]], [[Texas Air National Guard]], [[Texas Military Forces]], stationed at [[Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base]], Fort Worth, Texas. If activated to federal service, the Squadron is gained by the [[United States Air Force]] [[Air Mobility Command]].

==Summary==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Air Force Civil Engineering is an exciting and dynamic contingency related career field. [[Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force]] (Prime BEEF) personnel are called upon to participate in recovery operations as a result of natural and man-made disasters, or maybe subject to deploy and employ forces in hostile environments both conventional and non-conventional warfare.

Wartime tasked units must be prepared to mobilize and deploy within 52-hours of notification. In support of the Geographic Combatant Commanders and warfighters, the 136th Civil Engineer Squadron provides engineering support for initial Force Beddown at bare base and forward operating areas, base recovery after attack in contingency environments, rapid runway repair, and response to nuclear, biological, chemical, and conventional attacks.

The unit's peacetime role primarily focuses on contingency training in support of our wartime tasking, base infrastructure support, humanitarian aid to underprivileged countries, and assisting the citizens of the State of Texas in times of natural or man-made disasters. Unit expertise is divided into four main functional areas: Command and Control, Engineering, Emergency Management, and Operations, which consists of Electrical Systems, Power Production, Mechanical Systems, Utility/Fuel Systems, Horizontal (Heavy Equipment), and Vertical (Structural) Flights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10665">{{Technical|date=September 2018}}In [[political theory|political]] and [[social theory]], '''accelerationism''' is the idea that either the prevailing system of [[capitalism]], or certain technosocial processes that have historically characterised it, should be expanded, repurposed, or accelerated in order to generate radical social change. Some contemporary accelerationist philosophy takes as its starting point the [[Deleuze and Guattari|Deleuzo-Guattarian]] theory of [[deterritorialisation]], aiming to identify, deepen, and radicalise the forces of deterritorialisation with a view to overcoming the [[reterritorialization|countervailing tendencies]] that suppress the possibility of far-reaching social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wolfendale |first=Peter |url=http://deontologistics.tumblr.com/post/91953882443/so-accelerationism-whats-all-that-about| title=So, Accelerationism, what's all that about? |website=Dialectical Insurgency&lt;!--Peter Wolfendale's personal blog --&gt; |year= 2014|access-date= 5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=November 2015}} Accelerationism may also refer more broadly, and usually pejoratively, to support for the deepening of capitalism in the belief that this will hasten its self-destructive tendencies and ultimately lead to its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaviro |first=Steven |year=2010 |title=Post Cinematic Affect |url= |location=Ropley |publisher=O Books |page= 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Jason |year=2013 |title=Occupy Time: Technoculture, Immediacy, and Resistance After Occupy Wall Street |url= |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page= 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerationist theory has been divided into mutually contradictory [[left-wing]] and [[right-wing]] variants.  "Left-accelerationism" attempts to press "the process of technological evolution" beyond the constrictive horizon of capitalism, for example by repurposing modern technology for socially beneficial and emancipatory ends; "right-accelerationism" supports the indefinite intensification of capitalism itself, possibly in order to bring about a [[technological singularity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cccb.org/lab/en/article_el-vertigen-acceleracionista-ii-entrevista-a-robin-mackay/|title=The Accelerationist Vertigo (II): Interview with Robin Mackay|first=Roc|last=Jiménez de Cisneros|publisher=[[Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona]]|date=5 November 2014|access-date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/|title=#ACCELERATE MANIFESTO for an Accelerationist Politics|publisher=Critical Legal Thinking|first1=Alex|last1=Williams|first2=Nick|last2=Srnicek|date=14 May 2013|access-date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufblog.net/accelerate/|title=#Accelerate|date=13 February 2014|access-date=5 February 2015|first1=Nick|last1=Land|website=Urban Future (2.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

A number of philosophers have expressed apparently accelerationist attitudes, including [[Karl Marx]] in his 1848 speech "On the Question of Free Trade":
:But, in general, the protective system of our day is conservative, while the free trade system is destructive. It breaks up old nationalities and pushes the antagonism of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to the extreme point. In a word, the free trade system hastens the social revolution. It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor of free trade.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/free-trade/ On the question of free trade], Speech to the Democratic Association of Brussels, 9 January 1848.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a similar vein, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that "the leveling process of European man is the great process which should not be checked: one should even accelerate it...",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book |last=Strong |first=Tracy |year=1988 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of Transfiguration |url= |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |page= 211}} Original in ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' §898.&lt;/ref&gt; a statement often simplified, following Deleuze and Guattari, to a command to "accelerate the process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deleuze |first1=Gilles |last2=Guattari |first2=Félix |year=2004 |title=Anti-Oedipus |url= |location=London |publisher=Continuum |page= 260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary accelerationism==

Prominent theorists include right-accelerationist [[Nick Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Quick-and-Dirty Introduction to Accelerationism|url = https://jacobitemag.com/2017/05/25/a-quick-and-dirty-introduction-to-accelerationism/|website = Jacobite Magazine|accessdate = 2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cybernetic Culture Research Unit]] (CCRU), an unofficial research unit at the [[University of Warwick]] from 1995–2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCRU|url = http://v2.nl/archive/organizations/ccru|website = V2_Institute for the Unstable Media|accessdate = 2015-10-09|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which Land was a member, is considered a key progenitor in both left- and right-accelerationist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwarz |first1=Jonas Andersson |year=2013 |title=Online File Sharing: Innovations in Media Consumption |url= |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |pages= 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent contemporary left-accelerationists include [[Nick Srnicek]] and Alex Williams, authors of the "Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = #ACCELERATE MANIFESTO for an Accelerationist Politics|url = http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/|website = Critical Legal Thinking|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Laboria Cuboniks collective, who authored the manifesto "Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = After Accelerationism: The Xenofeminist manifesto|url = http://tripleampersand.org/after-accelerationism-the-xenofeminist-manifesto/|website = &amp;&amp;&amp; Journal|accessdate = 2015-10-09|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along accelerationist lines, [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]], in works such as ''[[PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future]]'', has tried to speculate about futures after capitalism. He declares that "[a]s with the end of feudalism 500 years ago, capitalism’s replacement by postcapitalism will be accelerated by external shocks and shaped by the emergence of a new kind of human being. And it has started." He considers that the rise of collaborative production will eventually help capitalism to kill itself.

Focusing on how information technology infrastructures undermine modern political geographies, and proposing an open-ended "design brief",  [[Benjamin H. Bratton]]'s book ''The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty'' is associated with accelerationism. [[Tiziana Terranova]]'s "Red Stack Attack!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euronomade.info/?p=2268|title=Red Stack Attack! Algorithms, Capital and the Automation of the Common {{!}} EuroNomade|website=www.euronomade.info|language=it-IT|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; links Bratton's stack model and left accelerationism.

These [[Guideline|guidelines]] are ascertained for one, short exposure (with a maximum of eight hours) by the air. The AEGL consist of different levels of [[toxicology|toxicological]] effects. It subjects the 4 Ds: [[detection]], [[discomfort]], [[disability]] and [[death]]. The AEGL values gives the expected effects of exposure to certain [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. So the compound can provide from detection to discomfort, from discomfort to disability and from disability to death. There are three levels of AEGL-values: AEGL-1, AEGL-2 and AEGL-3. The values of AEGL are determined for varying times of exposure, such as ten minutes, thirty minutes, one hour, four hours and eight hours.
AEGLs are mainly used in case of [[calamities]] to estimate the exposure to certain compounds.

'''Animal roleplay''' is a form of [[Sexual roleplay|roleplay]] where at least one participant plays the part of a non-human [[animal]]. As with most forms of roleplay, its uses include [[play (BDSM)|play]] and [[psychodrama]].

Animal roleplay may also be found in [[BDSM]] contexts, where an individual may take part in a dominant/submissive relationship by being treated as an animal. The activity is often referred to as ''petplay''. However, not all types of animal roleplay within BDSM are petplay and not all petplay in BDSM involves roleplaying as an animal; some can be referred to as primal play and [[Furry fandom|furry]] play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.siriuspup.net/info/ |title=About Sirius Pups |work=SiriusPup|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{double image|right|Nude pet girl.jpg|150|Walking the dog (2603306717).jpg|141|A girl (left) and a man (right) crawling like pet animals at [[Folsom Street Fair]]. They are held using dog [[leash]].}}

The origins of animal [[roleplay]] and petplay are probably various and diverse, again depending upon the participants involved.  However, its origins are certainly influenced by [[Creature suit|costuming]], [[fiction]], [[mythology|myth]] and [[legend]], roleplay and [[psychodrama]] in their various aspects. Some of the earliest published images of animal play (especially pony play) are to be found in the work of [[John Willie]], primarily in ''[[John Willie#John Willie's Work and Bizarre|Bizarre]]'' magazine published from 1946 to 1959.

Some of the equipment that can be used in animal roleplay include [[leash]], [[chain]], [[Gag (BDSM)#Bit|bit gag]], [[collar (BDSM)|neck collar]], [[bondage harness]], [[catsuit]], [[bodystocking]], [[Butt plug#Fetish plugs|butt plug]], [[Muzzle (device)|muzzle]], [[ballet boot]]s, etc.&lt;ref name=Taormino2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taormino|first1=Tristan|title=The ultimate guide to kink : BDSM, role play, and the erotic edge|date=2012|publisher=Cleis Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9781573447829|chapter=Chapter 12. A romp on the wild side: erotic human animal roleplaying}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural and ritual use===
{{see also|Therianthropy|Skin-walker}}
Non-sexual animal roleplay was a common and integral part of [[ritual]] in many tribal cultures both in recent and likely prehistoric times, where a member (or members) of the tribe would take the role physically and often spiritually of an animal that was either revered or hunted. Examples of the former include many of the [[American Indian tribes]] and [[Inuit|Arctic native peoples]]. Examples of the latter are evidenced by [[cave painting]]s. In 1911, [[Julia Tuell]] photographed the last Animal Dance ("[[Massaum]]") performed by the Northern [[Cheyenne]] of [[Montana]].

It is also sometimes used in [[education]], especially [[physical education]], as a way to encourage people to [[exercise]] the body in unusual ways, by [[mimic]]king various animals.

==Other forms==
{{see also|Play (activity)}}
[[Image:Kittyplay.jpeg|thumb|Model in a kitten-play or cat-play outfit]]
In manga and anime, a relatively common character type is the "[[catgirl]]". A standard catgirl resembles a slim girl with cat ears, a tail, tiny fangs and a propensity for catlike [[affection]] or curiosity.  Examples include Cat Girl [[Nuku Nuku]], Pink from ''[[Dragon Pink]]'' and Ms. Furbottom's human form in [[Sgt. Frog]], among others. Real-life costume play, or ''[[cosplay]]'', of [[anime]] [[catgirls]] could be considered a form of pet play. That catgirls are humanoids with lesser attributes of felines means that the costume is an especially simple one, and therefore quite popular among convention-goers. Though kittenlike timidity and submissiveness are prominent elements of catgirl charm, the role does not include the "heavier", more overt kink that is usually synonymous with BDSM pet play.

Some [[superhero]]es, [[heroine]]s, and [[villain]]s also feature elements related to pet play; such as [[DC Comics]]'s [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], [[Catwoman]], [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Tigra]], [[Man-Wolf]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], or even [[Nastassja Kinski]]'s Irena Gallier in the 1982 film ''[[Cat People (1982 film)|Cat People]]'' (a remake of the [[Cat People (1942 film)|1942 Simone Simon film]]), and Miss Kitty from the [[Brendan Fraser]] movie ''[[Monkeybone]]''.  All involve animal qualities taken on by a human.  Some would even count the enactment or spiritual belief in therianthropy ([[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[werecat]]s, etc.) as falling under human animal roleplay or transformation play as well.

[[Peter Shaffer]]'s 1973 play ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'' tells the story of a young man who has a pathological religious fascination with horses, but this appears closer to zoophilia than pet play. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s 1981 musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' traces a tribe of urban cats, and in 2007 ''[[War Horse (play)|War Horse]]'' used full size puppets to play horses on stage.

==Erotic scenarios==

{{double image|right|Nude pet slave girl.jpg|140|Folsom Bondage (cropped).jpg|140|A submissive woman is [[erotic humiliation|publicly disgraced]] by being paraded nude at [[Folsom Street Fair]]. She is held in [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] using a dog [[leash]], one end of which is held by her [[Master/slave (BDSM)|master]]. This suggests she is [[sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] his pet animal.|A gagged woman with bound hands sits in a submissive position. Her master holds her with a dog chain tied around her neck at [[Folsom Street Fair|Folsom Fair]].}}

Like much of erotic play and roleplay, animal roleplay in an erotic or relational context is entirely defined by the people involved and by their mood and interests at the time of play. It ranges from the simple imitation of a vocal "whinnying" of a horse to the barking, panting or playful nudging of a puppy, or playful behaviour of a kitten, to crawling around on all fours and being fed, or petted, by hand. To the greater extremes of dressing up as a pony in modified horse tack, masks, [[prosthetic]]s and temporary bondage based body modification (such as binding the forearms to the upperarms and/or the calves to the thighs).

Public participation in human animal roleplay is varied. A couple could inconspicuously role-play a pet play scene in public, which would look to the casual observer like one partner is merely stroking the other's neck. In the case of some BDSM [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]ists, one partner may wear a [[Collar (BDSM)|dog collar]] with a [[leash]] attached.

The reasons for playing such a character or animal can vary as much as the physical manifestations and intensity of the play.  Some people enjoy being able to "cut loose" into a different, or more dynamic personality (e.g., were-creatures or [[catgirls]]; see [[#Other variations|other variations]]).  In some cases, pet play is seen as a loving, quiet cuddling time where there is no need for verbalizations and the simple act of stroking, rubbing and holding the other partner is satisfying or reassuring in and of itself for those involved.  For others, there may be a [[spirituality|spiritual]] side to it.  Some feel closer to their animal [[totem]], while others may identify with something akin to a deeper side or part of their own psyche (known as [[Therianthropy#Psychiatric aspects|therianthropy]]).  For still others, there is the experience of [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]] setup in a context or structure which they can accept.

Some cases could be considered a type of animal transformation fantasy. They can have strong elements of [[exhibitionism]], be totally enjoyed in the privacy of the home, or lie somewhere between either boundary. While not widespread, erotic human-animal roleplay is still enjoyed by a sizable number of people. However, it is still primarily identified with [[BDSM]] practice. Though commonly misinterpreted as being associated with [[Furry fandom#Sexual aspects|furry]] or other [[alternative lifestyle]] activities, that is generally not the case though some instances may exist.

For most participants, it has no connection whatsoever with [[Zoophilia|bestiality]], which is controversial and would usually be considered [[edgeplay]] in BDSM circles.

{{Anchor|Autozoophilia}}
'''Autozoophilia''' is sexual arousal that depends on acting out or imagining one's self as an animal. [[Paraphilia|Paraphilic interest]]s that involve being in another form have been referred to as [[erotic target location error]]s (ETLEs), and autozoophilia would represent an [[autoerotic]] form of [[zoophilia]].&lt;ref name="lawrence"&gt;Lawrence, A. A. (2009). Erotic target location errors: An underappreciated paraphilic dimension. ''Journal of Sex Research, 46,'' 194-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Autozoophilia is mostly practised by wearing an animal costume, such as a [[latex mask]], [[mascot|mascot costume]] or [[fursuit]].

===Other considerations===
Each type of play can focus on a certain "strength" of an animal character.  Pony play often involves the practice and training that a [[horse]] owner or [[horse trainer|trainer]] would put their horse through to learn how to walk, [[canter]], etc., as modified for human limbs.  Puppy and kitten play often can involve BDSM related discipline.  Cow Play often involves fantasies of [[lactation]] and [[impregnation]].  The usual limits of [[safe, sane and consensual]] apply to roleplay as much as any other activity between humans who accept and respect their partner's interests and limits. For most, this does not include bestiality.

Note: Just because one partner is playing the "pet" does not necessarily make them the passive or submissive play partner in the [[scene (BDSM)|scene]].  For example, if the form of pet play is for the meek and timid wife to "transform" into a [[werewolf]] or mischievous [[anime]] [[catgirl]], she may take the upper hand and dominate the partner.  Again, how the play is interpreted is entirely up to the people involved.

===BDSM scenarios===
Some people believe that they have certain animal '[[instinct]]s' and through animal roleplay can let them out. This is especially true in the BDSM communities, where some people 'live' as their chosen animal 24/7.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This type of mentality goes beyond roleplay and becomes a full lifestyle for the parties involved. There are also 'hybrids'. These are humans who live part-time as one type of animal, and part-time as another. This is usually determined by the situation.

There seems to be a growing trend among the BDSM scene in animal roleplay, especially pup and kitten play. Playing the role of a pup or kitten is one of giving over complete control over to another, while the 'master or handler' expects only unconditional love and obedience from his/her animal.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Pony play is where at least one of the participants dresses to resemble and assumes the mannerisms and character of an [[equine]] animal. People involved in pony-play ("ponies") generally divide themselves to three groups&lt;ref name=maxawesome/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2012}} although some will participate in more than one category:

*Cart ponies pull a [[sulky]] with their owner.
*Riding ponies are ridden, either on all fours or on two legs, with the "rider" on the shoulders of the "pony" (also known as ''Shoulder riding''). Note that a human back is generally not strong enough to take the weight of another adult without risk of injury, so four-legged "riding" is generally symbolic, with the "rider" taking most of their weight on their own legs.
*Show ponies show off their [[dressage]] skills and often wear elaborate harnesses, plumes and so on.

A documentary film ''Pony Passion'' was produced by British pony play club De Ferre in 2003 showing their club's activities and the 2005 [[documentary film]], ''Born in a Barn'', depicted the lives of several pony-play enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476963/|title=Born in a Barn|date=1 February 2005|accessdate=24 September 2017|website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pony play is sometimes referred to as "The Aristotelian Perversion", in reference to an apocryphal story where the philosopher [[Aristotle]] was persuaded to let a woman named Phyllis ride him like a horse, in promised exchange for sexual favors: an episode depicted in various woodcuts and other works of art.&lt;ref name=maxawesome&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maximumawesome.com/pervfriday/ponypeople.htm|title=Pony people, ponyboys and ponygirls|author=Malfouka|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}

====Puppy play====
{{double image|right|Submissivepup.jpg|183|Pup is looking amazing in her neoprene dog hood as part of human pup pride in Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras 2016.jpg|173|A submissive male "puppy" using bondage restraints to restrict movement and eating from a dog bowl. The cage in background and kneepads are for extended play.|A pup with a neoprene dog hood at [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras|Sydney Mardi Gras]]. Masks and hoods are frequently used to help a person feel less human and more connected to a "dog persona".}}

In puppy play, or pup play, at least one of the participants acts out [[dog|canine]] mannerisms and behaviors, which is sometimes associated with [[leather culture]]. If there is a dominant role it can be  taken by a "handler", "trainer", "master", or in the case of someone who also identifies as a pup, an "alpha". If there is a submissive this may be considered by a "pup" or a "dog". Unlike other forms of animal roleplay, it is not uncommon for two or more pups to play together as equals, fight for dominance, or play where one is clearly the "alpha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-an-alpha/|title=What is an Alpha?|website=SIRIUSPUP|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puppy play is often about being playful, mischievous, cheeky and instinctive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Dog_play/ Dog play in the BDSM Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511083559/http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Dog_play/ |date=May 11, 2008 }} accessed 4 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many human puppies like to simplify their desires and motivations as they embrace the side of themselves that acts solely on instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-human-pup-play/|title=What is human pup play?|website=SIRIUSPUP|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to other BDSM play, a "puppy" who is "unowned" or "[[Collar (BDSM)|uncollared]]" can be referred to as a "stray". Many pups use a headspace when getting into a roleplay scenario known as 'pup space' which allows them to take on their puppy persona more easily.{{clarify|date=February 2018}}{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Other elements rooted in BDSM play involve bondage and restriction with collars, leashes, kneepads, harnesses, rubber suits, hoods and mitts. Both sexual and non-sexual services are requested, and "training" may take place in order to teach commands or tricks.

There are groups across the world involved in puppy play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pupplay.info/ |title=Pup Play? |work=Puppy Play|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a number in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seapah.com/puppy-play-101/ |title=Information on puppy play |work=SEA-PAH|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pup Pride Australia has participated, since 2015, in the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mardigras.org.au/2017-parade-float-running-order/ |title=2017 parade float running order - Float 103 |date=2017|work=Mardi Gras|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has featured in an Australian TV documentary aired by the [[Special Broadcasting Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/726963267928/pup-play-men-who-live-as-dogs |title=Pup play men who live as dogs |date=18 July 2016|work=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kitten play====
In kitten play, a person dresses to resemble and assumes the mannerisms and character of a kitten or cat, a characteristic of which is that it keeps some independence and, as part of the fantasy, might retaliate against the partner trying to tame/train him or her. Some might be trained to do tricks such as bring toys back, to beg, or go on walks. Like in puppy play, a "kitten" or "cat" that is unowned or [[collaring (BDSM)|uncollared]] may be called a "stray".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kitten-play.com/what-is-kitten-play/  |title=What is kitten play? |work=Kitten-Play|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cupertino_City_Center.jpg|thumb|alt=Cupertino City Center buildings.|For years, Apple ATG offices were in ''[[Cupertino,_California|Cupertino]]'' City Center buildings.]]

The '''Advanced Technology Group''' (ATG) was a corporate research laboratory at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] from 1986 to 1997.&lt;ref name="Fast Company article June 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Diaz |first1=Jesus |title=The legendary Apple research group that shaped our world |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90176202/how-apples-advanced-technology-group-changed-our-world |website=Fast Company |accessdate=11 September 2018 |date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATG was an evolution of Apple's Education Research Group (ERG) and was started by [[Larry Tesler]] in October 1986 to study long term research into future technologies that were beyond the time frame or organizational scope of any individual product group. Over the next decade, it was led by [[David Nagel]], [[Richard LeFaivre]],&lt;ref name="pcmag lefaivre"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1869187,00.asp | title=Rick Lefaivre: Ran Apple's Advanced Technology Group | work=[[PC Magazine]] | date=October 12, 2005 | accessdate=February 27, 2012 | author=Metz, Cade}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Norman]].&lt;ref name="guardian apple"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/06/why-do-people-hate-apple | title=Why do some people really hate Apple? | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=October 6, 2011 | accessdate=February 27, 2012 | author=Arthur, Charles | quote=[Don] Norman, formerly vice-president of the Advanced Technology Group at Apple [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was known as Apple Research Labs during Norman's tenure as VP of the organization.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATG had research efforts in both hardware and software, with groups focused on such areas as Human-Computer Interaction, Speech Recognition, Educational Technology, Networking, Information Access, Distributed Operating systems, Collaborative Computing, Computer Graphics, and [[Language/action perspective]].  Many of these efforts are described in a special issue of the ACM [[SIGCHI Bulletin]] which provided a retrospective of the ATG work after the lab was shut down.  ATG was also home to four Apple Fellows: [[Al Alcorn]], object-oriented software pioneer; [[Alan Kay]]; [[Bill Atkinson]]; and laser printer inventor [[Gary Starkweather]].  Further, ATG funded university research and, starting in 1992, held an annual design competition for teams of students.

'''CIDOB''', acronym of the '''Barcelona Centre for International Affairs''', is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[think-tank]] based in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], dedicated to research and divulge contents of the different areas of international relations and development studies. The centre defines itself as an organisation that is «an independent, non partisan centre that contributes to ongoing international debates from the perspective of a major Mediterranean metropolis».&lt;ref name="plan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/en/cidob|title=Strategic vision 2010-2013|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally speaking, CIDOB is a '''public foundation''' with a Board of Trustees that includes among its members the main political institutions and universities of Catalonia and Barcelona, in addition to a number of ministries of the Spanish Government. CIDOB is currently the oldest think-tank in Spain, and one of the most influential in its field, so they claim.

== The acronym ''CIDOB'' and the centre’s name ==
The centre's original name was, from 1973 onwards, ''Centre d'Informació i Documentació Internacionals a Barcelona'' (translated into English, ''Barcelona Centre for International Information and Documentation''), thus giving rise to the acronym CIDOB. Later on, the centre was referred with other names, including ''Centro de Relaciones Internacionales y Cooperación Internacional'' (''Centre of International Relations and International Cooperation''), ''Centro de Investigación de Relaciones Internacionales y Desarrollo'' (''Research Centre on International Relations and Development'') and, particularly over the years and until 2013, ''Centro de Estudios y Documentación Internacionales de Barcelona'' (''Barcelona Centre for International Studies and Documentation''). These titles still appear in quotes and references from other media, thereby creating certain confusion. Since 2013 the official name, in all cases and without translations, uses the English form '''''Barcelona Centre for International Affairs'''''. All these names  no longer correspond to the historical acronym, though it has always been used exclusively to refer to the organisation.

== History ==
CIDOB was born in 1973 as a non-profit-making association of socio-cultural nature based on the personal experience of its founder, Josep Ribera i Pinyol, one of the promoters of the Catalan inter-diocesan movement ''Agermanament'' (''Brothering''), which was active in cooperation projects with countries in Africa and South America. This original CIDOB was known as ''CIDOB Tercer Mundo'' (''CIDOB Third World'') or ''CIDOB-TM''. In 1979, as a result of the political transformations succeeded in Catalonia and Spain, and upon a desire to «energise the democratic fabric with respect to international cooperation»,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/la_municipal/59/entrevista.htm |title=Josep Ribera, director de la Fundació CIDOB, reflexiona sobre la cooperació internacional|publisher=Revista La Municipal nº 59, Ayuntamiento de Barcelona|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIDOB was legally constituted as a private foundation with a Board of Trustees, whose members, public and private, were representatives of the political and cultural life of Catalonia and Spain. Currently, the foundation is public.

In the following years, CIDOB grew up to become a research and document center focused on international issues and global problems such as human development, and pursuing to become a major framework able to connect Catalan reality with that of the rest of the world. With this aim in mind, CIDOB has taken full advantage of Barcelona's prominence as a Euro-Mediterranean capital that also has special links with Latin America. Since the 1990s, the centre has strengthened its networking connections with European initiatives on issues concerning cooperation, international relations and security, as well as its academic activities, oriented toward the generation of ideas and specific political action.&lt;ref name="jordi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/noticias/cidob/nuevo_director_de_la_fundacion_cidob |title=Nuevo director de la Fundación CIDOB |date=December 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406221417/http://www.cidob.org/es/noticias/cidob/nuevo_director_de_la_fundacion_cidob |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josep Ribera continued to head CIDOB until December 2008, when he chose to step down after 35 years at the helm. His successor as director was, by decision of the Foundation's Board of Trustees, Jordi Vaquer i Fanés, an International Relations doctor and researcher at CIDOB to that moment.&lt;ref name="jordi" /&gt; [[Narcís Serra|Narcís Serra i Serra]], former mayor of Barcelona, former minister in the [[Spanish Government]] and one-time leader of the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|Catalan Socialists]], chaired the Foundation from 2000 to May 2012, when was succeeded by economist Carles A. Gasòliba i Böhm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/en/news/cidob/cidob_renews_its_board_of_trustees_and_appoints_carles_a_gasoliba_as_president |title=CIDOB renews its Board of Trustees and appoints Carles A.

In June 2013 the Board of Trustees selected a new director, Dr. Jordi Bacaria i Colom, currently co-director of the Institute of European Integration Studies (IEIE) in Mexico and editor of the journal ''Foreign Affairs Latinoamérica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/en/news/cidob/the_board_of_cidob_appoints_dr_jordi_bacaria_as_director |title=The Board of CIDOB appoints Dr. Jordi Bacaria as director |date=June 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024000835/http://www.cidob.org/en/news/cidob/the_board_of_cidob_appoints_dr_jordi_bacaria_as_director |archivedate=2013-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation and installations ==
[[image:CarlesGasoliba.jpg|thumb|Carles A. Gasòliba, current president of CIDOB.|right|200px]]

===Staff===
The Foundation is headed by its chairman, Carles A. Gasòliba. The centre itself consists of a management team made up of the director, Jordi Bacaria, an executive coordinator, Anna Estrada, a managing director and a coordinator for Research (Eduard Soler). The working staff is made up of researchers and specific staff responsible for the sections of information &amp; web services, publications, activities, press and administration. As of June 2013, 30 people work at CIDOB.

===Board of Trustees===
The  Foundation's Board is made up of the following institutional trustees, whose financial contributions represent most of the centre's annual budget:

* [[Generalitat of Catalonia]]
* Barcelona City Council
* Barcelona Provincial Council
* Barcelona Metropolitan Area.
* [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation]]
* [[Ministry of Defence (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Defence]]
* Interuniversity Council of Catalonia.

=== Installations ===
[[File:Capella dels Infants Orfes (I).jpg|Casa dels Infants Orfes|thumb|160px|right]]
CIDOB’s offices are divided between two historic buildings – nearby but not adjoining – on calle Elisabets in Barcelona's [[Raval]] district, very close to [[La Rambla, Barcelona|La Rambla]] and [[Plaça de Catalunya]]. They are Casa de la Misericòrdia (Elisabets, 12) and Casa dels Infants Orfes (Elisabets, 24).

The '''Casa de la Misericòrdia''' has, since 1988, housed the centre's main installations, including the official head office, the archives and library, as well as Sala Maragall, the hall used for events. Originally, the building (which includes the old church) formed part of the School of [[William X, Duke of Aquitaine|St William of Aquitaine]], founded by the [[Augustine Order]] in 1587, and later on it was used as a municipal primary school. During the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic invasion]] it served as clandestine headquarters of the citizen's movement against the French occupation. In more recent times, in 1910, it became the home of the Institute of Culture and People's Library for Women; later still, in 1940, the building became the head office of the Institute for Theatre, as well as being home to the Adrià Gual Chair.

The '''Casa dels Infants Orfes''' also dates back to the 16th century. It was built as the head office of the institution founded by Guillem dez Pou in 1370 to provide a home for orphans in the Diocese of Barcelona. It has an adjacent chapel, commissioned by Claudi Cosal in 1680 and redesigned in 1785. Among the building’s later uses, it was a school run by the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]] (1848) and a convent for the [[Carmelites|Carmelites of Charity]] (1875). The chapel lost all its religious furnishings and fittings during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

== Activities ==

=== Fields of specialisation and events ===
Over the past decade, CIDOB has systematised its areas of research, by maintaining its traditional subjects/regions of interest and adding other, more specific ones. Currently, CIDOB operates three major programmes: ''People and Frontiers''; ''A more secure life''; and ''Democratic Governance''. Under these generic premises, research works cover both thematic and geographical areas. In the first group major topics are: Development; Environment; Energy; Human Security; Intercultural Dynamics; Migrations; Conflicts; Local Government; State, Democracy and Foreign Policy; and Regionalism. CIDOB has a particular focus on «six fields of excellence»,&lt;ref name="plan" /&gt; namely: European Foreign Policy and Neighborhood Relations ; Security Sector Reform; Intercultural Dynamics; Migration Policy in Europe; International relations of cities and regions; and EU Enlargement.

As for geographical specialisation, CIDOB follows in particular political issues from Europe (including the [[USSR|post-Soviet realm]]), the Mediterranean and Middle East, Latin America and Asia ([[Central Asia]] in special). Four regional powers, one in each continent, receive priority: [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="plan" /&gt; The international political situation, the world human development indicators and the Spanish international cooperation and foreign relations are also monitored on an ongoing basis.

At structural level, eight «issues-regions» are defined at the moment: Asia; Development; Europe; Intercultural Dynamics; Latin America; Mediterranean and Middle East; Migrations; and Security. Each issue-region is directed by a researcher or senior research fellow who works with other analysts, assistants, associate or visiting specialists and external contributors. Some programmes also have a projects manager. Research teams work with interdisciplinary scholar networks and generate their own academic activities, publications and documentary collections.

CIDOB’s research work is conceived to be disseminated as widely as possible, and thus it's aimed not only at specialists and scholars, but also at public organisations, mass media, NGOs, businesses, university students and public in general. Direct dissemination requires seminars, conferences, debates and workshops. Also, CIDOB regularly announces calls for papers, issues policy papers and introduces new publications. In its own words, CIDOB's vision consists of «promoting good global governance based on democratic practices at the local, national and supranational level in order to ensure people’s basic needs for freedom and a life without fear». Meanwhile, the centre's mission is to «offer information and ideas that help to shape policies that promote a safer, freer and more just world for all».&lt;ref name="plan" /&gt;

Every year, CIDOB and the City Council of Barcelona jointly hold the international seminar '''''War and Peace in the 21st Century''''', a series of debates attended by leading personalities from public function, governments and international academia. Other important annual events include the '''''International Seminar on Security and Defence in the Mediterranean''''', organised jointly with the Spanish Institute for Strategic Studies (IEEE, which reports to the Spanish Ministry of Defence), and the '''''Seminar on the Ibero-American Development Agenda''''' (ADI), run with the [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC) and the [[Ibero-American General Secretariat]] (SEGIB). These three seminars have been held since 2002, 2002 and 2005 respectively at the [[Palau Reial de Pedralbes|Palace of Pedralbes]] in Barcelona.

* Master in International Studies.
* Master in Development Studies.

Currently, CIDOB's teaching activities take place within the academic programmes of the '''[[Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals]]''' (Barcelona Institute for Studies International, '''IBEI'''), a private foundation created by CIDOB in March 2004, whose members included the five Catalan universities (UB, UAB, UPC, UPF and UOC) sat in the Board of Trustees of CIDOB. This inter-university institute offers two postgraduate courses: Master in International Relations and the Erasmus Mundus Masters Programme in Public Policy (Mundus MAPP); the latter is provided in association with the [[Central European University]] (CEU) of [[Budapest]], the [[International Institute of Social Studies]] (ISS) of Rotterdam and the [[University of York]]. The IBEI also holds two summer courses: Barcelona Summer School in International Politics and the Summer School of the Mediterranean.
Furthermore, CIDOB was a member of the network of organising centres for the Master en Affaires Euro-Méditerranéennes/Master in Euro-Mediterranean Affairs (MAEM-MEMA).

=== Documentation, BIBA and information services ===
Since it was founded, one of CIDOB’s basic services has been the maintenance of an extensive documentary collection specializing mainly in international relations and development, which is open to the public. These documentary and bibliographical collections are collectively known as the '''Biblioteca Internacional de Barcelona''' (International Library of Barcelona, '''BIBA'''); the library was created to support the teaching and research activities done by CIDOB and IBEI, as well as to provide a service to the university and research community as a whole, to journalists and other professional people interested in the subject.
 
At present, CIDOB's documentation, library and information area is organised for users into four sections:

==== Documentation Centre and Library ====
The '''Library''' contains a documentary collection specialized in international relations and development, particularly in the geographical and subject areas deemed to be priorities for CIDOB. The documents are the following: the approximately 400 international periodical publications to which CIDOB is a subscriber; another 600 titles that are no longer received; more than 12,000 volumes and monographs; and a further 11,000 documents in other formats. The Library also contains all the publications published by the Foundation. The online catalogue for the documentary collection enables users to browse lists of all the items acquired since 1985.

The '''Documentation Centre''' analyses the periodical publications that it receives in accordance with a list of its own descriptors, as well as managing specific databases of periodical publications and acronyms. The Documentation Centre also helps to create documentary appendices for some of CIDOB's own publications.

==== Digital Library ====
Set up in 2011, this is an online database with a search engine that enables users to access all content produced by CIDOB: maps, chronologies, acronyms, biographies, news and activities, dossiers, articles and monographs on subjects under study.

==== Dossiers CIDOB ====
A non-periodical online publication focusing on international political current affairs. The Dossiers are monographic studies of specific events of a national or international scope, created by the centre's researchers and information specialists. They contain analytical articles produced by CIDOB, links to external articles and news items, and to official reference documents, as well as to support material produced ex profeso. This information tool has been available exclusively through the Web since 2009.

==== Biographies of Political Leaders ====
Biographical information service, online since 2001. Country leaders’ profiles are situated «in context», by presenting and explaining the historical, political, economic and social circumstances surrounding them. At present (2011), this Web service features more than 600 biographies of political leaders from around the world. As with the Dossiers, the texts are designed so that they can be updated at any time.

'''Bomboniere''' (Italian bomboniera, from the french bonbonnière,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/bonbonni%C3%A8re/10119&lt;/ref&gt; a box containing "bonbons" (candies)) also known as "favors", are gifts given by hosts to their guests on special occasions such as [[weddings]], [[baptism]], [[First Communion]] or [[Confirmation]]. They usually include [[Jordan Almonds]], known in Italian as [[Confectionary|Confetti]].
Five sugared almonds symbolize [[health]], [[wealth]], [[happiness]], [[fertility]] and [[Longevity|long life]].

Confetti can be made in many forms using several different ingredients.

Sugared almonds are put inside a bag made of tulle or satin and tied with ribbons in assorted colors. The colour of sugared almonds is white for a wedding, [[First Communion]] or [[Confirmation]]; pink or light-blue for birthday or Baptism of a baby girl or baby boy, respectively, red for a graduation, and silver or gold for 25 or 50 year anniversaries.

Often they are adorned with dried natural flowers or artificial flowers made of silk or paper. The bag is often given stored inside a small vessel made of silver, crystal or porcelain.

In [[Australia]] the word "bomboniere" is applied to any small gift or keepsake given by the hosts to guests at any function held to celebrate weddings, first holy communions and the like. Such gifts may take the form of a wine bottle stopper, glass vase or picture frame as well as the more traditional sugared almonds in decorative bags.&lt;ref name="website01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petitcadeau.com.au/bomboniere-handcrafted-gifts/about_us |title=About Bomboniere |last=  |first=  |work=Bomboniere |publisher= |accessdate=2015-11-26 |quote=bomboniere for your wedding, engagement, christening, baptism, holy communion, bridal shower, baby shower, kitchen tea, birthday party, anniversary or any other special occasion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Torta Bomboniera'''&lt;br&gt;
A different and new type of bomboniera is the Favor Cake or "Torta Bomboniera" as it is called in Italy.
They are made using little carton box forming one or more tier of a "cake".&lt;br&gt;Inside each box there are the sugared almonds and a card printed with the data of ceremony (names, date etc.).
On each box there are glued several types of fine objects made of many materials.

Some samples are below, for various ceremonies:

&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''Evolution of "Torta Bomboniera" to "Pasticceria Artigianale in Porcellana" (Porcelain Artisan Pastries)'''&lt;br&gt;
The following type of Italian Favor Cake is an evolution of above types.&lt;br&gt;
It is made using porcelain boxes shaped and hand decorated like very real edible "bignè" or cream puff.&lt;br&gt;
Inside each box there are five sugared almonds and a card printed with data of ceremony.&lt;br&gt;
For this reasons, the name that Italians give to this new idea is "Pasticceria Artigianale in Porcellana", that is '''Porcelain Artisan Pastries'''

Proposed by [[Roy John Britten]] and [[Eric H. Davidson]] in 1969, the model postulates four classes of [[DNA]] sequence: an integrator gene, a producer gene, a receptor site, and a sensor site. The sensor site regulates the integrator gene, responsible for synthesis of activator RNA. The integrator gene cannot synthesize activator RNA unless the sensor site is activated. Activation and deactivation of the sensor site is done by external stimuli, such as hormones. The activator RNA then binds with a nearby receptor site, which stimulates the synthesis of [[mRNA]] at the [[structural gene]].

This theory would explain how several different integrators could be synthesized at the same time. In addition, this theory would explain the pattern of [[repetitive DNA]] sequences followed by a unique [[DNA]] sequence that exists in [[gene]]s.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Genetics Classical to Modern| last=Gupta| first=P.K.| publisher=Rastogi Publications| year=2007| page=657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
"'''''[[Candidatus]]'' Brocadia anammoxidans"''' is a [[bacterial]] member of the order [[Planctomycetes]] and therefore lacks [[peptidoglycan]] in its [[cell wall]], and has a compartmentalized [[cytoplasm]].

"''Candidatus'' Brocadia anammoxidans" was the first discovered organism capable of the [[Anammox|anaerobic oxidation of ammonium]], and it is the only organism known to produce [[hydrazine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/1109_051109_rocketfuel.html&lt;/ref&gt; This process (dubbed the [[anammox]]-process) was discovered in the 1980s by the [[Gijs Kuenen]] lab in a [[List of waste water treatment technologies|waste water treatment]] plant in [[Delft]], [[Netherlands]]. Ammonium [[oxidation]] is coupled to [[nitrite]] reduction to form the harmless [[dinitrogen]] gas.

The key [[enzyme]] involved in this reaction, [[hydroxylamine oxidoreductase]], is located in an [[organelle]]-like structure called the [[anammoxosome]]. The ability to oxidize ammonium anaerobically makes "''Candidatus'' Brocadia anammoxidans" potentially useful for reducing&amp;mdash;or eliminating&amp;mdash;ammonium from waste water.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

== In waste treatment ==
Because of its ability to eliminate ammonium, a variety of uses have been found for this bacteria, particularly removal of [[nitrogen]] from waste streams.&lt;ref&gt;B. Kartal, G.J. Kuenen and M.C.M van Loosdrecht Sewage Treatment with Anammox, Science, 2010, vol 328 p 702-3&lt;/ref&gt; The first full scale experiment employing the anammox process in the world was built at the waste water treatment plant Dokhaven/Sluisjesdijk in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

Existing treatment plants use bacteria that convert ammonium into [[nitrate]]. The bacteria that do this need oxygen, which must be supplied by electric pumps. [[Denitrifying bacteria]] convert the nitrate into nitrogen gas. These require adding [[methanol]]. This process consumes an average of 44 [[watt-hour]]s per day per person served by the [[sewage]] system.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

Researchers estimate that a [[methanogenic]] digester coupled to a [[nitrification]]-anammox bioreactor could generate 24 watt-hours per person per day, a net swing of 70 watt-hours.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42598">'''Calcium looping''' (CaL), or the '''regenerative calcium cycle''' (RCC), is a second-generation [[Carbon capture and storage#Capture|carbon capture]] technology. It is the most developed form of carbonate looping, where a metal (M) is reversibly reacted between its carbonate form (MCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and its oxide form (MO) to separate carbon dioxide from other gases coming from either power generation or an industrial plant. In the calcium looping process, the two species are [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[calcium oxide]] (CaO). The captured carbon dioxide can then be [[Carbon capture and storage#Transport|transported]] to a [[Carbon sequestration|storage site]], used in [[enhanced oil recovery]] or used as a [[Carbon capture and utilization|chemical feedstock]]. Calcium oxide is often referred to as the ''sorbent''.

Calcium looping is being developed as it is a more efficient, less toxic alternative to current post-combustion capture processes such as [[amine scrubbing]].&lt;ref name="Ahn et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahn|first=Hyungwoong|author2=Luberti, Mauro |author3=Liu, Zhengyi |author4= Brandani, Stefano |title=Process configuration studies of the amine capture process for coal-fired power plants|journal=International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control|date=August 2013|volume=16|pages=29–40|doi=10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.03.002|url=http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/7478246/Final_published_paper_IJGGC2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has interesting potential for integration with the [[cement]] industry.&lt;ref name="Dean et al CaL for powergen, cem + H2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dean|first=C.C.|author2=Blamey, J. |author3=Florin, N.H. |author4=Al-Jeboori, M.J. |author5= Fennell, P.S. |title=The calcium looping cycle for CO2 capture from power generation, cement manufacture and hydrogen production|journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design|date=June 2011|volume=89|issue=6|pages=836–855|doi=10.1016/j.cherd.2010.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean et al 11 Potential Synergy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dean|first=Charles C.|author2=Dugwell, Denis |author3=Fennell, Paul S. |title=Investigation into potential synergy between power generation, cement manufacture and CO2 abatement using the calcium looping cycle|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|year=2011|volume=4|issue=6|pages=2050|doi=10.1039/C1EE01282G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic concept ==

:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{CaCO3 &lt;=&gt; {CaO} + CO2 \qquad\qquad \Delta H} = +178\ \ce{kJ/mol} &lt;/math&gt;

There are two main steps in CaL:&lt;ref name="Blamey review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blamey|first=J.|author2=Anthony, E.J. |author3=Wang, J. |author4= Fennell, P.S. |title=The calcium looping cycle for large-scale CO2 capture|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|date=April 2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=260–279|doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2009.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Calcination]]: Solid calcium carbonate is fed into a [[calciner]], where it is heated to 850-950&amp;nbsp;°C to cause it to thermally decompose into gaseous carbon dioxide and solid calcium oxide (CaO). The almost-pure stream of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is then removed and purified so that it is suitable for storage or use. This is the 'forward' reaction in the equation above.
* [[Carbonation]]: The solid CaO is removed from the calciner and fed into the ''carbonator''. It is cooled to approximately 650&amp;nbsp;°C and is brought into contact with a flue gas containing a low to medium concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The CaO and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; react to form CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, thus reducing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the flue gas to a level suitable for emission to the atmosphere. This is the 'backward' reaction in the equation above.

Note that carbonation is calcination in reverse.

Whilst the process can be theoretically performed an infinite amount of times, the calcium oxide sorbent degrades as it is cycled.&lt;ref name="Blamey review" /&gt; For this reason, it is necessary to remove (''purge'') some of the sorbent from the system and replace it with fresh sorbent (often in the carbonate form). The size of the purge stream compared with the amount of sorbent going round the cycle affects the process considerably.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez 08 Calciner heat requirements"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=N.|author2=Alonso, M. |author3=Grasa, G. |author4= Abanades, J. Carlos |title=Heat requirements in a calciner of CaCO3 integrated in a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Carbon capture and storage|capture system]] using CaO|journal=Chemical Engineering Journal|date=May 2008|volume=138|issue=1-3|pages=148–154|doi=10.1016/j.cej.2007.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In the Ca-looping process, a CaO-based sorbent, typically derived from limestone, reacts via the reversible reaction described in Equation (1) and is repeatedly cycled between 2 vessels.

{{NumBlk|:|ΔH {{=}} +178kJ/mol |{{EquationRef|1}}|LnSty=1px dashed }}

The forward, [[endothermic]] step is called [[calcination]] while the backward, [[exothermic]] step is [[carbonation]].

A typical Ca-looping process for post-combustion CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  capture is shown in Figure 1, followed by a more detailed description.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Figure 1 wiki.png|thumb|Figure 1: A potential post combustion process using the calcium looping cycle (Blamey et al., 2010)]] --&gt;

Flue gas containing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is fed to the first vessel (the carbonator), where [[carbonation]] occurs. The CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; formed is passed to another vessel (the calciner). [[Calcination]] occurs at this stage, and the regenerated CaO is quickly passed back to the carbonator, leaving a pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  stream behind. As this cycle continues, CaO sorbent is constantly replaced by fresh (reactive) sorbent.&lt;ref name="Blamey, J. 2010, p. 260-279"&gt;Blamey, J.; Anthony, E.J.; Wang, J.; Fennell, P.S. 2010, The Calcium Looping Cycle for large-scale CO2 capture. Progress in Energy and Combustion Science vol. 36 (2) p. 260-279&lt;/ref&gt; The highly concentrated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the calciner is suitable for [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]], and the spent CaO has potential uses elsewhere, most notably in the cement industry.  The heat necessary for calcination can be provided by [[oxy-combustion]] of coal below.

Oxy-combustion of coal: Pure oxygen rather than air is used for combustion, eliminating the large amount of nitrogen in the flue-gas stream. After particulate matter is removed, flue gas consists only of water vapor and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, plus smaller amounts of other pollutants. After compression of the flue gas to remove water vapor and additional removal of air pollutants, a nearly pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stream suitable for storage is produced.

The carbonator's operating temperature of 650-700 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C is chosen as a compromise between higher equilibrium (maximum) capture at lower temperatures due to the [[exothermic]] nature of the carbonation step, and a decreased reaction rate. Similarly, the temperature of &gt;850 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C in the calcinator strikes a balance between increased rate of calcination at higher temperatures and reduced rate of degradation of CaO sorbent at lower temperatures.

== Process description ==

CaL is usually designed using a [[Fluidised bed|dual fluidised bed system]] to ensure sufficient contact between the gas streams and the sorbent.&lt;ref name="Blamey review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodriguez 08 Hot lime"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodríguez|first=N.|author2=Alonso, M. |author3=Grasa, G. |author4= Abanades, J.

Calcination is an endothermic process and as such requires the application of heat to the calciner. The opposite reaction, carbonation, is exothermic and heat must be removed. Since the exothermic reaction happens at about 650&amp;nbsp;°C and the endothermic reaction at 850-950&amp;nbsp;°C, the heat from the carbonator cannot be directly used to heat the calciner.

The fluidisation of the solid bed in the carbonator is achieved by passing the flue gas through the bed. In the calciner, some of the recovered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is recycled through the system.&lt;ref name="Blamey review" /&gt; Some oxygen may also be passed through the reactor if fuel is being burned in the calciner to provide energy.

=== Provision of energy to the calciner ===

Heat can be provided for the endothermic calcination step either directly or indirectly.

Direct provision of heat involves the combustion of fuel in the calciner itself ([[Fluidized bed combustion|fluidised bed combustion]]). This is generally assumed to be done under [[Oxy-fuel combustion process|oxy-fuel]] conditions; i.e. oxygen rather than air is used to burn the fuel to prevent dilution of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with nitrogen. The provision of oxygen for the combustion uses lots of electricity; other [[Air separation#Cryogenic liquification process|air separation processes]] are being developed.&lt;ref name="CCS Update" /&gt;

Indirect provision of heat to the calciner involves either:
* Combustion of fuel outside the vessel and conduction of energy in to the vessel&lt;ref name=Calix&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalytic Flash Calcination (CFC) Technology|url=http://www.calix.com.au/catalytic_flash_calcination__cfc__technology.html|publisher=Calix Limited|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Combustion of fuel in another vessel and use of a heat transfer medium.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez 08 Hot lime" /&gt;

Indirect methods are generally less efficient but do not require the provision of oxygen for combustion within the calciner to prevent dilution. The flue gas from the combustion of fuel in the indirect method could be mixed with the flue gas from the process that the CaL plant is attached to and passed through the carbonator to capture the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Recovery of energy from the carbonator ==
Although the heat from the carbonator is not at a high enough temperature to be used in the calciner, the high temperatures involved (&gt;600&amp;nbsp;°C) mean that a relatively efficient [[Rankine cycle]] for generating electricity can be operated.&lt;ref name="Romeo 08 Efficiency and Cost"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romeo|first=Luis M.|author2=Abanades, J. Carlos |author3=Escosa, Jesús M. |author4=Paño, Jara |author5=Giménez, Antonio |author6=Sánchez-Biezma, Andrés |author7= Ballesteros, Juan C. |title=Oxyfuel carbonation/calcination cycle for low cost CO2 capture in existing power plants|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|date=October 2008|volume=49|issue=10|pages=2809–2814|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2008.03.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the waste heat from the market-leading [[Amine scrubbing|amine scrubbing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture process]] is emitted at a maximum of 150&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="CCS Update"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boot-Handford|first=Matthew E. |author2=Abanades, Juan C. |author3=Anthony, Edward J. |author4=Blunt, Martin J. |author5=Brandani, Stefano |author6=Mac Dowell, Niall |author7=Fernández, José R. |author8=Ferrari, Maria-Chiara |author9=Gross, Robert |author10=Hallett, Jason P. |author11=Haszeldine, R. Stuart |author12=Heptonstall, Philip |author13=Lyngfelt, Anders |author14=Makuch, Zen |author15=Mangano, Enzo |author16=Porter, Richard T. J. |author17=Pourkashanian, Mohamed |author18=Rochelle, Gary T. |author19=Shah, Nilay |author20=Yao, Joseph G. |author21=Fennell, Paul S. |title=Carbon capture and storage update|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|year=2014|volume=7|issue=1|pages=130–189|doi=10.1039/C3EE42350F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low temperature of this heat means that it contains much less [[exergy]] and can generate much less electricity through a Rankine or [[organic Rankine cycle]].

This electricity generation is one of the main benefits of CaL over lower-temperature post-combustion capture processes as the electricity is an extra revenue stream (or reduces costs).

== Sorbent degradation ==
It has been shown that the activity of the sorbent reduces quite markedly in laboratory, bench-scale and pilot plant tests. This degradation has been attributed to three main mechanisms, as shown below.&lt;ref name="Blamey review" /&gt;

=== Attrition ===
Calcium oxide is friable, that is, quite brittle. In fluidised beds, the calcium oxide particles can break apart upon collision with the other particles in the fluidised bed or the vessel containing it. [REF] The problem seems to be greater in pilot plant tests&lt;ref name="Lu et al 08 Pilot plant attrition"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lu|first=Dennis Y.|author2=Hughes, Robin W. |author3=Anthony, Edward J. |title=Ca-based sorbent looping combustion for CO2 capture in pilot-scale dual fluidized beds|journal=Fuel Processing Technology|date=December 2008|volume=89|issue=12|pages=1386–1395|doi=10.1016/j.fuproc.2008.06.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; than at a bench scale.


=== Sulfation ===
Sulfation is a relatively slow reaction (several hours) compared with carbonation (&lt;10 minutes); thus it is more likely that SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will come into contact with CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; than CaO. However, both reactions are possible, and are shown below.

:Indirect sulfation: &lt;chem&gt; CaO + SO2 + 1/2 O2 -&gt; CaSO4 &lt;/chem&gt;
:Direct sulfation: &lt;chem&gt; CaCO3 + SO2 + 1/2 O2 -&gt; CaSO4 + CO2 &lt;/chem&gt;

Because [[calcium sulfate]] has a greater molar volume than either CaO or CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; a sulfated layer will form on the outside of the particle, which can prevent the uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the CaO further inside the particle.&lt;ref name="Blamey review" /&gt; Furthermore, the temperature at which calcium sulfate dissociates to CaO and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is relatively high, precluding sulfation's reversibility at the conditions present in CaL.

== Technical implications ==
Calcium looping technology offers several technical advantages over [[amine scrubbing]] for carbon capture. Firstly, both carbonator and calciner can use [[fluidized bed]] technology, due to the good gas-solid contacting and uniform bed temperature. Fluidized bed technology has already been demonstrated at large scale: large (460MWe) atmospheric and pressurized systems exist, and there is not a need for intensive scaling up as there is for the solvent scrubbing towers used in [[amine scrubbing]].&lt;ref name="Blamey, J. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blamey | first1 = J. | last2 = Anthony | first2 = E.J. | last3 = Wang | first3 = J. | last4 = Fennell | first4 = P.S. | year = 2010 | title = The Calcium Looping Cycle for large-scale CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture | url = | journal = Progress in Energy and Combustion Science | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 260–279 | doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2009.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the calcium looping process is energy efficient.  The heat required for the endothermic calcination of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the heat required to raise the temperature of fresh limestone from ambient temperature, can be provided by in-situ oxy-fired combustion of fuel in the calciner.  Although additional energy is required to separate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the majority of the energy input can be recovered because the carbonator reaction is exothermic and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the calciner can be used to power a steam cycle. A solid purge heat exchanger can also be utilized to recover energy from the deactivated CaO and coal ashes from the calciner.&lt;ref&gt;Romeo LM, Abanades JC, Escosa JM, Pano J, Giminez A, Sanchez-Biezma A,et al.

''Energy Conversion and Management'' 2008;49(10):2809–14&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a relatively small efficiency penalty is imposed on the power process, where the efficiency penalty refers to the power losses for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compression, air separation and steam generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abanades | first1 = JC | last2 = Anthony | first2 = EJ | last3 = Wang | first3 = J | last4 = Oakey | first4 = JE | year = 2005 | title = Fluidized bed combustion systems integrating [[Carbon capture and storage|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture]] with CaO | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 39 | issue = 8| page = 2861 | doi=10.1021/es0496221}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated at 6-8 % points, compared to 9.5-12.5 % from post combustion amine capture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Blamey J., Anthony EJ, Wang J, Fennell PS, The calcium looping cycle for large-scale CO2 capture, ''Progress in Energy and Combustion Science'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The main shortcoming of Ca-looping technology is the decreased reactivity of CaO through multiple calcination-carbonation cycles. This can be attributed to sintering and the permanent closure of small pores during [[carbonation]].

Figure 2 Repeated calcination/carbonation cycles of limestone in a TGA (Blamey et al, 2010)

===Closure of small pores===
The [[carbonation]] step is characterized by a fast initial reaction rate abruptly followed by a slow reaction rate (Figure 2).  The carrying capacity of the sorbent is defined as the number of moles of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacted in the period of fast reaction rate with respect to that of the reaction stoichiometry for complete conversion of CaO to CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. As seen in Figure 2, while mass after calcination remains constant, the mass change upon carbonation- the carrying capacity- reduces with a large number of cycles. In calcination, porous CaO (molar volume =16.9cm3/g) is formed in place of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (36.9cm3/g.). On the other hand, in carbonation, the CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; formed on the surface of a CaO particle occupies a larger molar volume. As a result, once a layer of carbonate has formed on the surface (including on the large internal surface of porous CaO), it impedes further CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. This product layer grows over the pores and seals them off, forcing carbonation to follow a slower, [[diffusion]] dependent mechanism.

===Sintering===
CaO is also prone to [[sintering]], or change in pore shape, shrinkage and grain growth during heating.&lt;ref&gt;Blamey J., Anthony EJ, Wang J, Fennell PS, "The calcium looping cycle for large-scale CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture, ''Progress in Energy and Combustion Science'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Ionic compounds such as CaO mostly sinter because of volume diffusion or [[lattice diffusion]] mechanics. As described by sintering theory,&lt;ref&gt;German RM. Sintering Theory and Practice. New York: Wiley, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; vacancies generated by temperature sensitive defects direct void sites from smaller to larger ones, explaining the observed growth of large pores and the shrinkage of small pores in cycled limestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = P | last2 = Grace | first2 = JR | last3 = Lim | first3 = CJ | last4 = Anthony | first4 = EJ | year = 2007 | title = The effect of CaO sintering on cyclic CO2 capture in energy systems | url = | journal = AIChE Journal | volume = 53 | issue = 9| pages = 2432–42 | doi=10.1002/aic.11251}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that sintering of CaO increases at higher temperatures and longer calcination durations, whereas carbonation time has minimal effect on particle sintering. A sharp increase in sintering of particles is observed at temperatures above 1173 K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borgwardt | first1 = RH | year = 1989 | title = Sintering of nascent calcium oxide | url = | journal = Chemical Engineering Science | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 53–60 | doi=10.1016/0009-2509(89)85232-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing a reduction in reactive surface area and a corresponding decrease in reactivity.

Solutions: Several options to reduce sorbent deactivation are currently being researched. An ideal sorbent would be mechanically strong, maintain its reactive surface through repeated cycles, and be reasonably inexpensive. Using thermally pre-activated particles or reactivating spent sorbents through hydration are two promising options.  Thermally pre-activated particles have been found to retain activity for up to a thousand cycles. Similarly, particles reactivated by hydration show improved long term (after~20 cycles) conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manovic | first1 = V | last2 = Anthony | first2 = EJ | year = 2008 | title = Thermal activation of CaO-based sorbent and self reactivation during CO2 capture looping cycles | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 42 | issue = 11| pages = 4170–4 | doi=10.1021/es800152s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disposal of waste sorbent ==

=== Properties of waste sorbent ===
After cycling several times and being removed from the calcium loop, the waste sorbent will have attrited, sulfated and become mixed with the ash from any fuel used. The amount of ash in the waste sorbent will depend on the fraction of the sorbent being removed and the ash and calorific content of the fuel. The size fraction of the sorbent is dependent on the original size fraction but also the number of cycles used and the type of limestone used.&lt;ref name="Belen thesis"&gt;{{cite book|last=González|first=Belén|title=Comportiamento de CaO Como Sorbente Regenerable para la Captura de CO2 (in Spanish)|date=May 2010|publisher=Universidad de Oviedo|location=Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disposal routes ===
Proposed disposal routes of waste sorbent include:
* Landfill;
* Disposal at sea;
* Use in cement manufacture;
* Use in flue gas desulfurisation (FGD).

The lifecycle CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions for power generation with CaL and the first three disposal techniques have been calculated.&lt;ref name="Hurst LCA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hurst|first=Thomas F.|author2=Cockerill, Timothy T. |author3=Florin, Nicholas H. |title=Life cycle greenhouse gas assessment of a coal-fired power station with calcium looping CO2 capture and offshore geological storage|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|year=2012|volume=5|issue=5|pages=7132|doi=10.1039/C2EE21204H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before disposal of the CaO coal power with CaL has a similar level of lifecycle emissions as amine scrubbing but with the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-absorbing properties of CaO CaL becomes significantly less polluting. Ocean disposal was found to be the best, but [[London Convention (1972)|current laws relating to dumping waste at sea prevent this]]. Next best was use in cement manufacture, reducing emissions over an unabated coal plant by 93%.

==== Use in cement manufacture ====
[[Portland cement]] is approximately two-thirds calcium oxide by mass and its manufacture is responsible for approximately 8% of the world's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  emissions. 60% of this CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  comes from the calcination of calcium carbonate as shown earlier in this article, and the other 40% from fossil fuel combustion. By replacing some or all of the calcium carbonate entering the plant with waste calcium oxide, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  caused from calcination can be avoided, as well as some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  from fossil fuel combustion.

This calcium oxide could be sourced from other point sources of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  such as power stations, but most effort has been focussed on integrating calcium looping with Portland cement manufacture. By replacing the calciner in the cement plant with a calcium looping plant, it should be possible to capture 90% or more of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  relatively inexpensively. There are alternative set-ups such as placing the calcium looping plant in the preheater section so as to make the plant as efficient as possible.

Some work has been undertaken into whether calcium looping affects the quality of the Portland cement produced, but results so far seem to suggest that the production of strength-giving phases such as [[alite]] are similar for calcium looped and non-calcium looped cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Charles.|last2=Hills|first2=Thomas.|last3=Florin|first3=Nick.|last4=Dugwell|first4=Denis.|last5=Fennell|first5=Paul S.|title=Integrating Calcium Looping CO2 Capture with the Manufacture of Cement|journal=Energy Procedia|date=2013|volume=37|pages=7078–7090|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2013.06.644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic implications ==
Calcium looping has several economic advantages.

=== Cost per metric ton for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured ===
Firstly, Ca-looping offers greater cost advantage compared to conventional amine-scrubbing technologies. The cost/metric ton for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured through Ca-looping is ~$23.70 whereas that for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured through [[amine scrubbing]] is about $35–$96.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacKenzie | first1 = A | last2 = Granatstein | first2 = DL | last3 = Anthony | first3 = EJ | last4 = Abanades | first4 = JC | year = 2007 | title = Economics of CO2 capture using the calcium cycle with a pressurized fluidized bed combustion | url = | journal = Energy &amp; Fuels | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 920–6 | doi=10.1021/ef0603378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be attributed to the high availability and low cost of the CaO sorbent (derived from limestone) as compared to MEA. Also, as discussed in section 2, Ca-looping imposes a lower energy penalty than amine scrubbing, resulting in lower energy costs. The amine scrubbing process is energy intensive, with approximately 67% of the operating costs going into steam requirements for solvent regeneration. A more detailed comparison of Ca-looping and amine scrubbing is shown below.

===Cost of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions avoided through Ca-looping===

In addition, the cost of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions avoided through Ca-looping is lower than the cost of emissions avoided via an oxyfuel combustion process (~$23.8USD/t). This can be explained by the fact that, despite the capital costs incurred in constructing the carbonator for Ca-looping, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will not only be captured from the oxy-fired combustion, but also from the main combustor (before the carbonator). The oxygen required in the calciners is only 1/3 that required for an oxyfuel process, lowering air separation unit capital costs and operating costs.&lt;ref name="Blamey, J. 2010"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Figure 3 wiki.png|thumb|Figure 3: Project Sensitivity Analysis (Mackenzie, 2007)]] --&gt;
Sensitivity Analysis: Figure 3 shows how varying 8 separate parameters affects the cost/metric ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured through Ca-looping. It is evident that the dominant variables that affect cost are related to sorbent use, the Ca/C ratio and the CaO deactivation ratio. This is because the large sorbent quantities required dominate the economics of the capture process.

These variables should therefore be taken into account to achieve further cost reductions in the Ca-looping process. The cost of limestone is largely driven by market forces, and is outside the control of the plant. Currently, carbonators require a Ca/C ratio of 4 for effective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. However, if the Ca/C ratio or CaO deactivation is reduced (i.e. the sorbent can be made to work more efficiently), the reduction in material consumption and waste can lower feedstock demand and operating costs.

===Cement production===
Finally, favorable economics can be achieved by using the purged material from the calcium looping cycle in cement production. The raw feed for cement production includes ~ 85&amp;nbsp;wt% limestone with the remaining material consisting of clay and additives (e.g. SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Alsop, P. A., Chen, H., Tseng, H., 2007. The Cement Plant Operations Handbook, Fifth Edition, Tradeship Publications, Surrey, UK. Chapter 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in the process involves calcinating limestone to produce CaO, which is then mixed with other materials in a kiln to produce clinker.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Figure 4 Wiki.png|thumb|Figure 4: Process flow diagram of a cement production (Alsop et al., 2007)]] --&gt;

Using purged material from a Ca-looping system would reduce the raw material costs for cement production. Waste CaO and ash can be used in place of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (the main constituent cement feed). The ash could also fulfill the aluminosilicate requirements otherwise supplied by additives. Since over 60% of the energy used in cement production goes into heat input for the precalciner, this integration with Ca-looping and the consequent reduced need for a calcination step, could lead to substantial energy savings (EU, 2001). However, there are problems with using the waste CaO in cement manufacture. For example, adding Ca-looping to all coal-fired plants in the UK would generate enough waste for 33&amp;nbsp;Mtonnes/yr of cement production, whereas current cement production in the UK is only 12.5&amp;nbsp;Mtonnes/yr. Hence, if the technology is applied on a large scale, the purge rate of CaO should be optimized to minimize waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacKenzie | first1 = A | last2 = Granatstein | first2 = DL | last3 = Anthony | first3 = EJ | last4 = Abanades | first4 = JC | year = 2007 | title = Economics of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture using the calcium cycle with a pressurized fluidized bed combustor | url = | journal = Energy &amp; Fuels | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 920–6 | doi=10.1021/ef0603378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political and environmental implications ==
To fully gauge the viability of calcium looping as a capture process, it is necessary to consider the political, environmental, and health effects of the process as well.

===Political implications===
Though many recent scientific reports (e.g.: the seven-wedge stabilization plan by Pacala and Socolow) convey an urgent need to deploy CCS, this urgency has not spread to the political establishment,&lt;ref&gt;Pacala S., Socolow R. Stabilizations Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies. Science, 2004. 305(5686), 968-972&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to the high costs and energy penalty of CCS &lt;ref&gt;Haszeldine R. Carbon Capture and Storage: How Green Can Black Be? Science, 2009. 325(5948), 1647-1652&lt;/ref&gt; The economics of calcium looping are integral to its political viability.  One economic and political advantage is the ability for Ca-looping to be retrofitted onto existing power plants, rather than requiring new plants to be built. The IEA sees power plants as an important target for carbon capture, and has set the goal to have all fossil fuel based power plants deploy CCS systems by 2040.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;IEA. Technology Roadmap: Carbon Capture and Storage. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, power plants are expensive to build, and long lived. Retrofitting of post-combustion capture systems, such as Ca-looping, seems to be the only politically and economically viable way to achieve the IEA’s goal.

A further political advantage is the potential synergy between calcium looping and cement production.  An IEA report concludes that to meet emission reduction goals, there should be 450 CCS projects in India and China by 2050.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, this could be politically difficult, especially with these nations’ numerous other development goals. After all, for a politician to commit money to CCS might be less advantageous than to commit it to job schemes or agricultural subsidies. Here, the integration of calcium looping with the prosperous and (particularly with infrastructure expansion in the developing world) vital cement industry might prove compelling to the political establishment.

This potential synergy with the cement industry also provides environmental benefits by simultaneously reducing the waste output of the looping process and decarbonizing cement production.  Cement manufacture is energy and resource intensive, consuming 1.5 tonnes of material per tonne of cement produced.&lt;ref&gt;Jankovic, Alex. Walter Valery, Eugene Davis, "Cement grinding optimisation, ''Minerals Engineering'', Volume 17, Issues 11–12, November–December 2004, Pages 1075-1081&lt;/ref&gt; In the developing world, economic growth will drive infrastructure growth, increasing cement demand. Deploying a waste product for cement production could therefore have a large, positive environmental impact.

===Environmental implications===
The starting material for calcium looping is limestone, which is environmentally benign and widely available, accounting for over 10% (by volume) of all sedimentary rock. Limestone is already mined and cheaply obtainable. The mining process has no major known adverse environmental effects, beyond the unavoidable intrusiveness of any mining operation. However, as the following calculation shows, despite integration with cement industry, waste from Ca-looping can still be a problem.

From the environmental and health standpoint, Ca-looping compares favorably with amine scrubbing. Amine scrubbing is known to generate air pollutants, including amines and ammonia, which can react to form carcinogenic nitrosamines.&lt;ref&gt;Lag M., Lindeman B., Instanes C., Brunborg B., &amp; Schwarze P. Health effects of amines and derivatives associated with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. Norwegian Institute of Public Health: 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium looping, on the other hand, does not produce harmful pollutants. In addition, not only does it capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but it also removes the pollutant SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the flue gas.&lt;ref&gt;Coppola A., Montagnaro F., Salatino P., Scala F. Fluidized bed calcium looping: The effect of SO2 on sorbent attrition and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture capacity, Chemical Engineering Journal, Volumes 207–208, 1 October 2012, 445-449&lt;/ref&gt;  This is both an advantage and disadvantage, as the air quality improves, but the captured SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a detrimental effect on the cement that is generated from the calcium looping wastes.

== Advantages and drawbacks ==

=== Advantages of the process ===
Calcium looping is considered as potential promising solutions to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  capture energy penalty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aidic.it/cet/13/35/070.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are many advantages from the calcium looping methods. Firstly, the method has been proved to yield a low efficiency penalties (5-8% points) while other mature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   capture systems yield a higher efficiency penalties (8-12.5%).&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ee/c5ee02950c#!divAbstract&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the method is well suited for a wide range of flue gases. Calcium looping is applicable for new builds and retrofits to existing power stations or other stationary industrial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sources because the method can be implemented using large-scale circulating fluidized beds while other methods such as amine scrubbing is required a vastly upscale solvent scrubbing towers.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blamey | first1 = J. | last2 = Anthony | first2 = E.J. | last3 = Wang | first3 = J. | last4 = Fennell | first4 = P.S. | year = 2010 | title = The calcium looping cycle for large-scale CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture | url = | journal = Progress in Energy and Combustion Science | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 260–279 | doi = 10.1016/j.pecs.2009.10.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, crushed limestone used in calcium looping as the sorbent is a natural product, which is well distributed all over the world, non-hazardous and inexpensive. Many cement manufacturers or power plants located close to limestone sources could conceivably employ Calcium looping for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  capture. The waste sorbent can be used in cement manufacture.

=== Drawbacks ===
Apart from these advantages, there are several disadvantages needed to take into considerations.  The plant integrating Ca-Looping might require a high construction investment because of the high thermal power of the post-combustion calcium loop. The sorbent capacity decreases significantly with the number of cycles for every [[carbonation]]-[[calcination]] cycle so the calcium-looping unit will require a constant flow of limestone. In order to increase the long-term reactivity of the sorbent or to reactivate the sorbent, some methods are under investigation such as thermal pretreatment, [[chemical doping]] and the production of artificial sorbents.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; The method applying the concept of fluidized bed reactor, but there are some problems causing the uncertainty for the process. Attrition of the limestone can be a problem during repeated cycling.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Benefits of calcium looping compared with other post-combustion capture processes ==
Calcium looping compares favorably with several post-combustion [[Carbon capture and storage|capture technologies]]. [[Amine scrubbing]] is the capture technology closest to being market-ready, and calcium looping has several marked benefits over it. When modeled on a 580&amp;nbsp;MW coal-fired power plant, Calcium looping experienced not only a smaller efficiency penalty (6.7-7.9% points compared to 9.5% for [[monoethanolamine]] and 9% for chilled ammonia) but also a less complex retrofitting process. Both technologies would require the plant to be retrofitted for adoption, but the calcium looping retrofitting process would result in twice the net power output of the scrubbing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanak | first1 = D. | last2 = Biliyok | first2 = C | last3 = Anthony | first3 = E | last4 = Manovic | first4 = V. | year = | title = Modelling and comparison of calcium looping and chemical solvent scrubbing retrofits for CO2 capture from coal-fired power plant | url = | journal = International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control | volume = 2015 | issue = | pages = 226–236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this advantage can be compounded by introducing technology such as cryogenic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage systems. This ups the efficiency of the calcium looping technology by increasing the energy density by 57.4%, making the already low energy penalties even less of an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Hanak D., Biliyok C, Manovic V. Calcium looping with inherent energy storage for [[decarbonization]] of coal-fired power plant. Energy and Environmental Science 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium looping already has an energy advantage over [[amine scrubbing]], but the main problem is that amine scrubbing is the more ''market-ready technology''. However, the accompanying infrastructure for amine scrubbing include large solvent scrubbing towers, the likes of which have never been used on an industrial scale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The accompanying infrastructure for calcium looping capture technologies are circulating fluidized beds, which have already been implemented on an industrial scale. Although the individual technologies differ in terms of current technological viability, the fact that the infrastructure needed to properly implement an amine scrubbing system has yet to be developed keeps calcium looping competitive from a viability standpoint.

# Number of 500 MW power plants: 7.84&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; W / 5.00&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; W = 1568 power plants
# Amount of cement that can be produced from Ca-looping waste: 1568&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;6.11&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg cement/ year = 9.58&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg cement/year
# Production from Ca-looping waste as percent of total annual cement consumption = [(9.58&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg)/ (1.10470&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg)]&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;100 = 870%

Therefore, amount of cement production from Ca-looping waste of all fossil fuel based electric power plants in US will be far greater than net consumption. To make Ca-looping more viable, waste must be minimized (i.e. sorbent degradation reduced) to ideally about 1/10th of current levels.

The '''California Institute of the Arts''' ('''CalArts''') is a private university in [[Santa Clarita, California]]. It was incorporated in 1961 as the first degree-granting institution of higher learning in the United States created specifically for students of both the [[visual art|visual]] and [[performing art]]s. It offers [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], [[Master of Fine Arts]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees among six schools: Art; Critical Studies; Dance; Film/Video; Music; and Theater.&lt;ref&gt;https://calarts.edu/academics&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was first envisioned by many benefactors in the early 1960s, staffed by a diverse array of professionals (including [[Nelbert Chouinard|Nelbert Murphy Chouinard]], a founder of [[Chouinard Art Institute]], [[Walt Disney]], Lulu Von Hagen, Thornton Ladd and others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rushkoff | first = Douglas | title =Media Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture | publisher = [[Ballantine Books]] | year = 1995 | page = 102| isbn = 0-345-39774-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; CalArts students develop their own work, over which they retain control and copyright, in a workshop atmosphere.

As of 2017, the school has a 27.5% acceptance rate.&lt;ref&gt;https://calarts.edu/about/institute/facts-and-figures&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, [[US News &amp; World Report]] has CalArts ranked #9 of "Best Graduate Fine Arts Programs." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-fine-arts-schools/fine-arts-rankings&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CalArts was originally formed in 1961, as a merger of the [[Chouinard Art Institute]] (founded 1921) and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music (founded 1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://calarts.edu/about/history | title=CalArts: History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the formerly existing institutions were going through financial difficulties around the same time, and the founder of the Art Institute, Nelbert Chouinard, was mortally ill. The professional relationship between Madame Chouinard and Walt Disney began in 1929 when Disney had no money and Madame Chouinard agreed to train Disney's first animators on a pay-later basis. It was through the vision of Disney, who discovered and trained many of his studio artists at Chouinard (including [[Mary Blair]], [[Maurice Noble]] and some of the [[Nine Old Men]], among others), that the merger of the two institutions was coordinated; the process continued after his death in 1966.&lt;ref name="RootsLAT"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-29/entertainment/ca-100_1_robert-perine-calarts-herbert-blau |title=The Roots of CalArts | accessdate=18 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=April 29, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joining him were his brother [[Roy O. Disney]], Lulu Von Hagen and Thornton Ladd (Ladd &amp; Kelsey, Architects), of the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. The original board of trustess at CalArts included  [[Harrison Price]], [[Retlaw Enterprises| Royal Clark]], Robert W. Corrigan,  [[Roy E. Disney]], [[Roy O. Disney]], film producer Z. Wayne Griffin, [[H. R. Haldeman]], Ralph Hetzel (then vice-president of [[Motion Picture Association of America]]), [[Chuck Jones]], Ronald Miller, [[Millard Sheets]], attorney Maynard Toll, bank executive G. Robert Truex Jr. , [[Jerry Wexler]], [[Meredith Willson]], Peter McBean and Scott Newhall (descendants of [[Henry Newhall]]),  and the wives of [[Roswell Gilpatric]], J.L. Hurschler, Richard R. Von Hagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/tn6902b.htm| title=Program: CalArts Groundbreaking }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Alumni Association was founded as a nonprofit organization and was governed by a 12-member board of directors to serve the best interests of the institute and its programs. Members included leading professional artists and musicians, who contributed their knowledge, experience and skill to strengthen the institute. The 12 founding board of directors members were [[Mary Costa]], [[Edith Head]], [[Gale Storm]], [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]], [[Tony Duquette]], [[Harold Grieve]], [[John Hench]], [[Chuck Jones]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[Marty Paich]], [[Nelson Riddle]] and [[Millard Sheets]].

The ground-breaking for CalArts' current campus took place May 3, 1969. However, construction of the new campus was hampered by torrential rains, labor troubles and the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|earthquake in 1971]]. CalArts moved to its present campus in the [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]] section of the city of [[Santa Clarita, California]] in November 1971. From the beginning, CalArts was plagued by the tensions between its art and trade school functions as well as between the non-commercial aspirations of the students and faculty and the conservative interests of the Disney family and trustees. The founding board of trustees originally planned on creating CalArts as a school in an entertainment complex, a destination like Disneyland, and a feeder school for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://clancco.com/wp/2007/01/intervview_sergio-muoz-sarmiento_cal-arts_law/| title=Interview with Tom Lawson, Dean of CalArts School of Art, January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a model is exemplified in the 1941 Disney film [[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]. In an ironic turn of fate, they appointed Dr. Robert W. Corrigan as the first president of the Institute.

Corrigan, former dean of the School of Arts at [[New York University]] fired almost all the artists and teachers from Chouinard in his attempt to remake CalArts into his personal vision. [[Herbert Blau]] was hired as the Institute's provost and dean of the School of Theater and Dance. Subsequently, Blau was instrumental in hiring a number of professionals like [[Mel Powell]] (dean of the School of Music), [[Paul Brach]] (dean of the School of Art), [[Alexander Mackendrick]] (dean of the School of Film/Video), sociologist [[Maurice R. Stein]] (dean of Critical Studies), and [[Richard Farson]] (dean of the School of Design; now integrated in the Art school as the Graphic Design program), as well as other influential program heads and teachers such as Stephan von Huene, [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Bella Lewitzky]], [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[Jules Engel]], [[John Baldessari]], [[Judy Chicago]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Max Kozloff]], [[Miriam Shapiro]], [[Douglas Huebler]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Norman M. Klein]] and [[Nam June Paik]]  most of whom largely came from a [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and [[avant-garde]] side of the art world. The fundamental principles established at the Institute by Blau and the late Corrigan included ideas like “no technique in advance of need,” and that a curriculum should be cyclical rather than sequential, returning to root principles at regular intervals, and that “we’re a community of artists here, some of us called faculty and some called students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.robertbenedetti.com/AwardSpeech.htm | title=Robert Benedetti-Acceptance speech for athe career achievement award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan held his position until 1972, when he was replaced by William S. Lund, a Disney son-in-law. Within a month of Lund's tenure as president, 55 of CalArts' 325 faculty and staff were fired. Structured schedules were introduced. Classes were trimmed back and, within a year, the Institute was operating on budget. Some credit Lund with saving CalArts. Others see his tenure as the end of an idealistic experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-15/entertainment/ca-1889_1_walt-disney/2 |title=A Tradition of Tradition-Be-Damned  | accessdate=17 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=David | last=Wharton | date=April 15, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, [[Robert Fitzpatrick (art executive)|Robert J. Fitzpatrick]] was appointed new president of CalArts. Holding this position for 12 years, in 1987
Fitzpatrick resigned as president to head [[Euro Disney S.C.A|Euro Disney]] in Paris. Nicholas England, former dean of the School of Music, was appointed acting president. One year later, [[Steven Lavine]], associate director for arts and humanities at the Rockefeller Foundation, was named new president.

On June 24, 2015 Steven D. Lavine announced he would step down as President of the California Institute of the Arts in May 2017, after an unprecedented 29-year tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-calarts-column-20150624-story.html|title=CalArts President Steven D. Lavine to Step Down in Spring of 2017|last=|first=|date=2014-06-24|website=|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concluding a search with over 500 candidates, the CalArts Board of Directors announced on December 13, 2016 that Ravi S. Rajan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://president.calarts.edu|title=Introducing the next President at CalArts — Ravi Rajan|website=Introducing the next President at CalArts|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean of the School of the Arts at the [[State University of New York at Purchase]] was unanimously elected as President, to begin in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-ravi-rajan-calarts-20161213-story.html|title=CalArts names Ravi Rajan president, the first Asian American to be named to the post|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the summer of 1987, CalArts became the host of the state-funded [[California State Summer School for the Arts]] (CSSSA) program. It began as a program to nurture talented high school students in the fields of [[animation]], [[creative writing]], [[dance]], [[experimental film|film]] and [[video art|video]], [[music]], [[theatre arts]], and [[visual arts]]. CalArts expanded on the concept by creating the [[Community Arts Partnership]] in 1990. While CSSSA is open to qualifying California students, CAP, as it is commonly known, is a service provided to students living within underprivileged communities in the Los Angeles County school system. Many CalArts faculty and students mentor the high school students in both programs.

In 1994, [[Herb Alpert]], a professional musician and admirer of the Institute, established the [[Alpert Awards in the Arts]] in collaboration with CalArts and his nonprofit the Herb Alpert Foundation. While the foundation provides the award for winning recipients, the school's faculty in the fields film/new media, visual arts, theatre, dance, and music select artists in their field to nominate an individual artist who is recognized for their innovation in their given medium. Recipients of this award are required to stay for a week as visiting artists at CalArts and mentor students studying their metier. In 2008, CalArts renamed the School of Music in his name, courtesy of a $15 million donation.

Over the years, the school has also developed on-campus, interdisciplinary laboratories, such as the [[Center for Experiments in Art, Information, and Technology]], [[Center for Integrated Media]], [[Center for New Performance at CalArts]], and the Cotsen Center for Puppetry and the Arts.

==Academics==
CalArts offers degree programs in [[music]], [[art]], [[Contemporary dance|dance]], [[experimental film|film]] and [[video art|video]], [[animation]], [[Experimental theatre|theater]], [[puppetry]], and [[creative writing|writing]].  Students receive intensive professional training in the area of their career purpose without being cast into a rigid pattern. Its focus is in [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], [[contemporary art]], and the Institute's stated mission is to develop professional artists of tomorrow- artists who will change their field.  With these goals in place, the Institute encourages students to recognize the complexity of political, social and aesthetic questions and to respond to them with informed, independent judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alpertawards.org/about/calarts | title=CalArts Statement }} for {{cite web | url=http://www.alpertawards.org/ | title=The Alpert Award in the Arts }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admission===
Every school within the Institute requires that applicants send in an [[artist's statement]], along with a [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] or [[Audition (performing arts)|audition]] (depending on the Program) in order to be considered for admission. The school does not review an applicant's [[SAT]] scores without consent of the applicant, and does not consider an applicant's [[GPA]] as part of the admission process.

In a 2016 interview, design program faculty member Michael Worthington was asked "'''What kinds of students do best at CalArts?''', to which he responded, ''Energetic, enthusiastic, self-motivated, fast learners, idiosyncratic aesthetes, verbal and visual adventurers, risk takers, those who are smart and vocal with a critical eye for their own work and the work of others. Having technical, formal and typographical skills helps, but we can teach those things. Raw intelligence and criticality and an adventurous side matter more at the start. Above all, the students that do best are those that are committed to design and who are willing to put the time and energy into their own development and learning.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://motionographer.com/2016/02/18/school-profile-calarts/ |title=School Profile: CalArts | accessdate=21 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conception and foundation===
The initial concept behind CalArts' interdisciplinary approach came from [[Richard Wagner]]'s idea of [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] ("total artwork"), which Disney himself was fond of and explored in a variety of forms, beginning with his own studio, then later in the incorporation of CalArts. He began with the classic Disney film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), where animators, dancers, composers, and artists alike collaborated. In 1952, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] was founded, where Disney integrated artists from his animation studio and elsewhere, as well as formally trained engineers and achieved creative critical mass in the development of [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]. He believed that the same concept that developed WDI, could also be applied to a university setting, where art students of different mediums would be exposed to and explore a wide range of creative directions. Disney himself has stated of his memorial school:

{{cquote|If you keep busy, your work might lead you into paths you might not expect. I’ve always operated like the [[The Three Princes of Serendip|princes of Serendip]], who went on quests not knowing what they would find.  That happens in science; some of our most important discoveries have come from scientists who were searching for something else. What young artists need is a school where they can learn a variety of skills, a place where there is cross-pollination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calarts.edu/~alumni/reunion/Images/Current_Insert.pdf |title=CalArts 30th Anniversary speech |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarkable thing that’s taking place in almost every field of endeavor is an accelerating rate of dynamic growth and change. The arts, which have historically symbolized the advance of human progress, must match this growth if they are going to maintain their value in and influence on society.  The talents of musicians, the self-expression of the actor, and the techniques and applications of fine and commercial artist are being use more and more in today's business-not by themselves but rather, in close association with each other. What we must have, then, is a completely new approach to training in the arts-an entirely new educational concept which will properly prepare artists and give them the vital tools so necessary for working in, and drawing from, every field of creativity and performance. I like the workshop idea, with students being able to drop in and learn all kinds of arts. A school should offer a kind of cross-pollination that would develop the best in its students. That is the direction I would like CalArts to take. It shouldn’t be a school where studies are rigid and narrow. Students should be able to study the whole spectrum of the arts.  Perhaps a musician would find he is more talented in arts; and vice versa. There is an urgent need for a professional school which will not only give its students thorough training in a specific field, but will also allow the widest possible range of artistic growth and expression. To meet this need is exactly why California Institute of the Arts has been created, and why we all believe so strongly in its importance. Students will be able to take anything - art, drama, music, dance, writing. They'll graduate with a degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts, and if they want a Bachelor of Arts they can go to other colleges and acquire a few more credits. The student body of CalArts shouldn't be over two thousand, and as many as possible should reside on campus. There should be some allowance for those who are talented, yet are not students; they should be able to express themselves without worrying about grades. There will be a lot of scholarships at CalArts. Those who can pay will pay; those who can't will get scholarships. We don't want any dilettantes at CalArts. We want people with talent. That will be the one factor in getting into CalArts: talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.calarts.edu/newspaper/mar00/what.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030707181300/http://www.calarts.edu/newspaper/mar00/what.html | archivedate= 2003-07-07 | title="What about an Integrated School? What would Walt say?", CalArts Newspaper, March 2000. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It's the principal thing I hope to leave when I move on to greener pastures. If I can help provide a place to develop the talent of the future, I think I will have accomplished something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;article_no=2235&amp;page=3 | title=The Birth of Animation Training | accessdate=26 November 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028150852/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;article_no=2235&amp;page=3 | archivedate=28 October 2004 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Walt Disney Modular Theatre===
The Walt Disney Modular Theatre is an indoor performance space located within the California Institute of the Arts.

Funded by Lillian Disney, who lent support to Walt's venture into education, her gift to the school to remodel a campus theater and rename it the Walt Disney Modular Theatre in 1993. The modular theater is based on a concept suggested by [[Antonin Artaud]], who asserted that the ideal theater could be reconfigured for each and every new performance or play. When [[Walt Disney]] founded his Institute of the Arts, he requested suggestions from leaders in various artistic fields as to what would be the ideal tools for advancing the study and practice of their medium. One of the overwhelmingly popular suggestions from the theater community was a modular theater as suggested by Artaud. Disney had the Modular Theatre incorporated as the central performance space of his Institute. It was the first of its kind constructed, and remains one of only five in the world.

The chief feature of the theater is a segmented floor, divided into 348 4'x4' square platforms, each mounted on its own independent pneumatic pistons, allowing the floor to be reconfigured into whatever shape is desired. The theater is also composed of segmented pieces, so that walls can also be easily reconfigured, creating a virtually limitless number of possibilities in design. The theater is two stories tall from floor to ceiling—the [[pneumatic]] pistons reach another story down into the CalArts library, where they are a dominating architectural feature. There are doors on all sides of the theater so that the audience can be made to enter from whatever direction the artists choose. The theater can be divided into several playing spaces, the audience can be separated into several sections, and any combination of levels and directions can be used. The theater can also be configured into an environmental space, with the audience moving through multiple locations in the course of a show, or being presented with a virtual environment rather than one in which they are separate from the performance.

The Walt Disney Modular Theater is employed year-round by students and faculty at the CalArts, primarily those in the schools of Theater, Dance, and Music. Though the idea of modular theater has fallen out of fashion, in favor of environmental theater and the resurgence of [[proscenium]] spectacle theater, the theater remains in use, run by the Technical Direction Department, including both students and faculty.

It was designed by Fisher Dachs Associates, a collaboration between the Dean of the Theater School, [[Herbert Blau]], lighting designer [[Jules Fisher]], and Thornton Ladd (Ladd &amp; Kelsey, Architects).

===A113===
{{Main|A113}}

A113 is an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] that has been inserted into several animated television shows and feature films as a homage to a classroom at CalArts.

===Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater at Walt Disney Concert Hall===
{{main|REDCAT}}

In 2003, CalArts established a performance theater in downtown Los Angeles called REDCAT, the Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater at Walt Disney Concert Hall. The Center for New Performance, the professional producing arm of the CalArts Theater School, brings works to the space from both student and professional artists and musicians.

===Wild Beast===

In fall 2009, the Institute opened an on-campus music pavilion, known as the "Wild Beast". The {{convert|3200|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, free-standing structure serves as a space for classrooms and combined indoor-outdoor performance space. CalArts' President Steven Lavine has stated, “The core demand is that our Herb Alpert School of Music has doubled in size in the last decade; when we have guest artists, there is no place for them to perform&amp;mdash;And the second reason was to allow enough space for the general public to attend [...]”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/02/calarts-is-addi.html |title=CalArts is adding a Wild Beast to its menagerie | accessdate=19 March 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Baldessari Art Studio Building===
In 2013, CalArts opened its John Baldessari Art Studio Building, which cost $3.1 million to build and features approximately 7,000 square feet of space—much of it used as studio space for art students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;David Ng (November 29, 2013), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-calarts-john-baldessari-20131127,0,7368564.story#ixzz2mLsg6Nv6 CalArts names new art studio building after John Baldessari]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206093355/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-calarts-john-baldessari-20131127%2C0%2C7368564.story |date=February 6, 2014 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception and cultural influence==

In 2011, [[Newsweek]]/The Daily Beast listed CalArts as the top school for arts-minded students. The ranking was not aimed to assess the country's best art school, but rather to assess campuses that offer an exceptional artistic atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Ziemba |first=Christine N.|title=Newsweek/Daily Beast Ranks CalArts as Nation’s Most ‘Artistic’ College|url=http://blog.calarts.edu/2011/08/30/newsweekdaily-beast-ranks-calarts-as-nations-most-artistic-college/|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=CalArts 24700|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ng|first=David|title=CalArts named top school for arts-minded students|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/09/calarts-named-top-arts-school-in-new-ranking.html|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, during the groundbreaking ceremony of the Valencia campus, as [[Lillian Disney]] turned over the first shovel full of soil, director [[Bob Clampett]] stood behind her mugging for the flashing cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sito|first=Tom|title=Walt’s Jalopy: Animator Training through the Decades |url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/walt-s-jalopy-animator-training-through-decades|accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several students who attended CalArts' animation programs in the 1970s eventually found work at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], and several of those went on to successful careers at Disney, [[Pixar]], and other animation studios.  In March 2014, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine highlighted the success of CalArts' 1970s animation alumni and briefly profiled several (including [[Jerry Rees]], [[John Lasseter]], [[Tim Burton]], [[John Musker]], [[Brad Bird]], [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]], [[Henry Selick]] and [[Nancy Beiman]]) in an article illustrated with a group portrait taken by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] inside classroom [[A113]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kashner|first=Sam|title=The Class That Roared|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/calarts-animation-1970s-tim-burton|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighties, a group of CalArts animation students contacted animation director [[Ralph Bakshi]]. As he was in the process of moving to New York, they persuaded him to stay in Los Angeles to continue to produce [[adult animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wharton|first=David|title=Ralph Bakshi Works Still Getting People Animated  |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-27/entertainment/ca-6468_1_ralph-bakshi-works|accessdate=14 September 2014|newspaper=LA Times|date=July 27, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi then got the production rights to the cartoon character [[Mighty Mouse]]. By Bakshi's request, [[Tom Minton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]] then went to the CalArts campus to recruit the best talent from what was the recent group of graduates. They hired [[Jeff Pidgeon]], [[Rich Moore]], Carole Holiday, [[Andrew Stanton]] and Nate Kanfer to work on the then-new ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'' television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Scott|title=Q&amp;A: Toon Titan John Kricfalusi Hails Mighty Mouse Rebirth  |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/01/john-kricfalusi/ |newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Craig "Spike" Decker of [[Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation]] commented on the work of independent animator [[Don Hertzfeldt]] stating that Hertzfeldt demonstrated good instincts coupled with his lack of interest in the world of commerce. In making a comparison, Decker made a reference to CalArts stating: "A lot of animators come out of CalArts — they could be so prolific, but then they're owned by Disney or someone, and they're painting the fins on the Little Mermaid. You'll never see their full potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Timberg|first=Scott|title=Don Hertzfeldt is the most inventive underground animator in America. Will he ever make his peace with Hollywood? |url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/articles-e.html|accessdate=14 September 2014|newspaper=New Times L.A. |date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon, members of the band [[Sonic Youth]], remarked in an interview with [[VH1]] about the band [[Liars (band)|Liars]], of which Angus Andrew and Julian Gross are CalArts luminaries. Moore's initial remarks were: "There's this whole world of young people who [think] everything's allowed. What Liars are doing right now is completely crazy. I saw them the other night and it was really great. It's really out-there". Gordon then stated "I'm not so crazy about the way [the Liars' They Were Wrong, So We Drowned] sounds. It's like 'how lo-fi can we make it?' But I think the content is really good". In reference to CalArts and Gordon's statement, Moore lastly remarked "They're art kids. They came out of CalArts and that's the kind of sensibility you have when you come out of these sort of places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bottomley |first=C. |title=Sonic Youth: Medicine For Your Ear |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1486965/05122004/sonic_youth.jhtml |accessdate=9 March 2015 |newspaper=VH1.com |date=May 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508163128/http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1486965/05122004/sonic_youth.jhtml |archivedate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' op-ed piece "The Kids Aren’t All Right: Is over-education killing young artists?", published in 2005, curator [[Aaron Rose]] wrote about an observed trend he recognized in Los Angeles's most esteemed art schools and their MFA programs, including CalArts. He uses the example of Supersonic, "a large exhibition […] that features the work of MFA students from esteemed area programs like CalArts, Art Center, UCLA, etc." In his observation of the showcase he examined, "[...] the work left me mostly empty and with a few exceptions seemed like nothing more than a rehash of conceptual ideas that were mined years ago." He went on to state that "these institutions are staffed with amazing talents (Mike Kelley and John Baldessari among them). Legions of creative young people flock to our city [Los Angeles] every year to work alongside their heroes and develop their talents with hopes of making it as an artist." He goes on to further state "What happens too often in these situations, though, is that we find young artists simply emulating their instructors, rather than finding and honing their own aesthetics and points of view about the world, society, themselves. In the beginnings of an artist’s career, the power in his or her work should lie not in their technique or knowledge of art history or theory or business acumen, but in what one has to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Aaron|title=The Kids Aren’t All Right  |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2005-10-27/news/the-kids-aren-t-all-right/?showFullText=true |accessdate=3 September 2014|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=October 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artist Amanda Charchian was asked in an interview what she disliked about going to art school. In her response, she noted, "Most of my teachers came from the 1970′s CalArts conceptual art world, so they had us deconstruct everything we did in terms of the material being the message ([[Truth to materials]]). So if I used marble it had to be about social class, ancient sculpture, heaviness, etc. There was this idea that there’s nothing in the work that couldn’t relate to why you made it. Intuition was never enough of a reason."&lt;ref&gt;Kathan, Emma. [http://www.psychicgloss.com/articles/205 "Interview with Artist Amanda Charchian"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107183857/http://www.psychicgloss.com/articles/205 |date=January 7, 2015 }}, ''Psychic Gloss Magazine'' Retrieved on 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

CalArts graduates have joined or started successful pop bands, including: [[The Belle Brigade]], [[The Weirdos]], [[Bedroom Walls]], Beelzabubba, [[Dawn of Midi]], [[The Rippingtons]], [[Fitz and The Tantrums]], [[Fol Chen]], [[London After Midnight (band)|London After Midnight]], [[No Doubt]], [[Mission of Burma]], Radio Vago, [[Oingo Boingo]], Secret Circuit, [[Liars (band)|Liars]], [[The Mae Shi]], [[Ozomatli]], and Jack Ruby.

Today, CalArts is recognized alongside [[Black Mountain College]] and the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] as one of the truly successful experiments in American arts education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fv.calarts.edu/main/moma.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620044408/http://fv.calarts.edu/main/moma.html |archivedate=June 20, 2006 |title="CalArts @ Moma", CalArts F/V website |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pixar University===
'''Pixar University''' is an in-house professional-development program within Pixar that expands the concept of employee education by broadening its focus from skills training to a more general fine-arts education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hempel|first=Jessi|title=Pixar University: Thinking Outside The Mouse|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Pixar-University-Thinking-Outside-The-Mouse-2611923.php|accessdate=16 August 2014|newspaper=SF Gate|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the educational model of CalArts. The program offers more than 110 courses: a complete film-making curriculum, classes on painting, drawing, sculpting and creative writing, which usually last four to sixteen weeks. These classes are available not only for animators, but everyone, from the security guard to cafeteria chef.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=William C. |title=How Pixar Adds a New School of Thought to Disney |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/business/yourmoney/29pixar.html?ei=5090&amp;en=1579be4d45b9f9bb&amp;ex=1296190800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=16 August 2014|newspaper=NY Times|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this setting, employees are allowed to miss work for a full slate in classes (about 14 per week) to raise the level of the best, cross-train, and develop mastery in whatever subjects may interest them. The vision behind the university is for employees to try new things, work together better and test new ideas, but one of the most important benefits from the program is to build morale, spirit and communication among employees. The dean of Pixar University, Randy S. Nelson, explains: "We've made the leap from an idea-centered business to a people-centered business. Instead of developing ideas, we develop people. Instead of investing in ideas, we invest in people. We're trying to create a culture of learning, filled with lifelong learners. It's no trick for talented people to be interesting, but it's a gift to be interested. We want an organization filled with interested people.".&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

==Controversy==

===Title IX Complaint===
On August 29, 2014 a freshman student identified as Regina filed a Title IX complaint against CalArts, regarding CalArts' improper response to her reported rape by a classmate. According to [[Aljazeera]], the CalArts administration questioned the victim, "...ask[ing] her questions about her drinking habits, how often she partied, the length of her dress, how oral rape was even possible, whether she climaxed and whether climaxing was an issue when she'd been with her alleged rapist before."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was subjected to retaliation from friends of the perpetrator. The student filed a complaint against CalArts with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, which was dismissed. The perpetrator was suspended for a year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Claire|title=CalArts to alleged rape victim: How long was your dress?|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2014/10/14/calarts-sexual-assault.html|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Aljazeera America|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CalArts students walked out of their classes and protested in solidarity with the victim on October 23, later initiating a student-led meeting to discuss the issue of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Song|first=Jason|title=CalArts students protest school's handling of rape allegations |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-calarts-protest-rape-20141023-story.html|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jahad|first=Shirley|title=CalArts students protest handling of rape cases |url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/10/24/47627/calarts-students-protest-handling-of-rape-cases/|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=89.3 KPCC|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heddaya|first=Mostafa|title=After Walkout, CalArts Students Organize Against Administration |url=http://hyperallergic.com/158304/after-walkout-calarts-students-organize-against-administration/|accessdate=17 October 2016|newspaper=Hyperallergic|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The context-based model of the counterintuitiveness effect''' &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2010). "An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect", ''Journal of Cognitive Systems Research'', 11(2), 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; is a cognitive model of [[The Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect]] (or MCI-effect for short) i.e., the finding by many cognitive scientists of religion that minimally counterintuitive concepts are more memorable for people than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive concepts &lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''The Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' University of California Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P., &amp; Ramble, C. (2001). "Cognitive templates for religious concepts". ''Cognitive Science'', 25, 535–564.&lt;/ref&gt; The context-based model emphasizes the role played by the context in which a concept appears in making it counterintuitive. This is in contrast to the traditional (also called ''content-based'') accounts of the MCI-effect which underscore the role played by context.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L., &amp; Nyhof, M. (2001). "Spreading non-natural concepts: the role of intuitive conceptual structures in memory and transmission of cultural materials". Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, 69–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L. (2008) Coding and Quantifying Counterintuitiveness in religious concepts: Theoretical
and methodological reflections. Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, 20,308-338.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barrett &amp; Nyhoff (2001) claim that this is necessary in order to explain cross-cultural success of religious concepts.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although research on schemas and scripts suggests the possibility that incongruent concepts may be better remembered thus contributing to their transmission, these conceptual structures are culturally variable to a large extent and will not provide an explanation for cross-culturally prevalent classes of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L., &amp; Nyhof, M. (2001). "Spreading non-natural concepts: the role of intuitive conceptual structures in memory and transmission of cultural materials". Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, 69–100.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The context-based model was first proposed by cognitive scientist [[Afzal Upal]] in 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2005). Role of context in memorability of intuitive and counterintuitive concepts. In B. Bara, L.
Barsalou, &amp; M. Bucciarelli (Eds.). Proceedings of the 27th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 2224–2229). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been subsequently elaborated in a number of publications.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Upal, L. Gonce, R. Tweney, and J. Slone (2007) Contextualizing counterintuitiveness: How context affects comprehension and memorability of counterintuitive concepts, Cognitive Science, 31(3), 415-439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2011) From Individual to Social Counterintuitiveness: How layers of innovation weave together to form tapestries of human cultures, Mind and Society, 10(1), 79-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the context-based model, counterintuitiveness of a concept depends on the mental knowledge activated in the mind of a reader at the time at which the reader processes the concept in question.  Since this mental knowledge clearly varies from person to person, a concept that is counterintuitive to one person may not be so for another person.  Furthermore, a concept may be counterintuitive to a person at one time but not at another time.  In fact the context-based model predicts that since people learn, their conceptual representations change over time.  When people encounter a minimally counterintuitive concept for the first time, they are forced to make sense out of it (Upal (2005) labelled it as the ''postdiction'' process).  The postdiction process results in the formation of new knowledge structures and in strengthening of existing knowledge structures.  Because of these new knowledge structures, when the same concept is encountered again, it does not seem as counterintuitive as it did in the past.  The context-based model predicts that over time the counterintuitive concepts come to lose their very counterintuitiveness (and the memory advantages it confers upon the concept).

'''Data Favela''' is a research institute founded in November 2013 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, by Celso Athayde, founder of Central Única das Favelas (''[[Cufa]]''), and Renato Meirelles, President of Data Popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.novafavelabrasileira.com.br/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232635/http://www.novafavelabrasileira.com.br/# |archive-date=2013-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data Favela is the first research institute focused on the economic activity of Brazilian favelas, studying the behavior and consumption of its residents, and identifying business opportunities for external and internal parties who wish to develop operations in these territories. With its wide base of expertise and knowledge of Brazilian favelas and their markets, Data Favela trains the residents themselves to implement its research.

==Research==
There are 11.7 million people living in Brazilian favelas – the equivalent of the 5th largest state in Brazil, population wise. In 10 years alone, the proportion of middle class residents in the favelas has risen from 33 to 65% of their population. Indeed, the residents of favelas have a combined annual income of R$63.2 billion, the equivalent of the total consumption of countries such as Paraguay and Bolivia. Of this wealth, more than half is concentrated in the south-east of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2013/11/classe-media-na-favela-sobe-de-33-para-65-em-10-anos-diz-pesquisa.html|title=Classe média na favela sobe de 33% para 65% em 10 anos, diz pesquisa|date=4 November 2013|website=G1.globo.com|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orion 3008 huge (detail).jpg|thumb|250px|Several nebulae in the [[constellation]] [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] commonly called ''deep-sky objects'']]
'''Deep-sky object''' (abbreviated as '''DSO''') is a term designating any [[astronomical object]] that is not an individual star or [[Solar System]] object (such as [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[planet]], [[comet]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wcoRISdUnu4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=deep+sky+object++Houston&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=deep%20sky%20object%20%20Houston&amp;f=false Fred Schaaf, 40 nights to knowing the sky: a night-by-night skywatching primer, page 113]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IUTwSFOtY4C&amp;pg=PT263&amp;dq=popularity+deep+sky+object&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Ian Ridpath, The illustrated encyclopedia of the universe, page 273]&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is used for the most part by [[amateur astronomer]]s to denote visually observed faint naked eye and [[Optical telescope|telescopic]] objects such as [[star cluster]]s, [[nebula]]e and [[galaxy|galaxies]].  This distinction is practical and technical, implying a variety of instruments and techniques appropriate to observation, and does not distinguish the nature of the object itself.

==Origins and classification==
Classifying non-stellar astronomical objects began soon after the invention of the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t9HzRdUvHD8C&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Messier+called+nebula#v=onepage&amp;q=Messier%20called%20nebula&amp;f=false Rocky Kolb, Blind watchers of the sky, page 174]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest comprehensive lists was [[Charles Messier]]'s 1774 [[Messier catalog]], which included 103 "''nebulae''" and other faint fuzzy objects he considered a nuisance since they could be mistaken for comets, the objects he was actually searching for.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t9HzRdUvHD8C&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Messier+called+nebula#v=onepage&amp;q=Messier%20called%20nebula&amp;f=false Rocky Kolb, Blind watchers of the sky, page 174]&lt;/ref&gt; As telescopes improved these faint nebulae would be broken into more descriptive scientific classifications such as [[interstellar cloud]]s, star clusters, and galaxies.

"''Deep-sky object''", as an astronomical classification for these objects, has its origins in the modern field of amateur astronomy. The origin of the term is unknown but it was popularized by ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'' magazine's "Deep-Sky Wonders" column, which premiered in their first edition in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3rgOAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22deep+sky+wonders%22&amp;dq=%22deep+sky+wonders%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=1900&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=1943&amp;as_brr=0 Sky and telescope, Volumes 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[Leland S. Copeland]], written for the majority of its run by [[Walter Scott Houston]], and currently penned by [[Sue French]]. Houston's columns, and later book compilations of those columns, helped popularize the term,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wcoRISdUnu4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=deep+sky+object++Houston&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=deep%20sky%20object%20%20Houston&amp;f=false Fred Schaaf, 40 nights to knowing the sky: a night-by-night skywatching primer, page 13]&lt;/ref&gt; each month giving the reader a guided tour of a small part of the sky highlighting well known and lesser known objects for binoculars and small telescopes.

==Observations and activities==
[[File:CygnusOBmap.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of the constellation [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] marking the location of bright and more challenging deep-sky objects]]
There are many amateur astronomical techniques and activities associated with deep-sky objects. Some of these objects are bright enough to find and see in binoculars and small telescopes. But the faintest objects need the [[Optical telescope#Light-gathering power|light-gathering power]] of telescopes with large [[Objective (optics)|objectives]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wWdvYeDbf8gC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=observing+deep+sky+large+telescope#v=onepage&amp;q=observing%20deep%20sky%20large%20telescope&amp;f=false Grant Privett, Paul Parsons, The deep-sky observer's year, page 11]&lt;/ref&gt; and since they are invisible to the naked eye, can be hard to find. This has led to increased popularity in [[GoTo (telescopes)|GoTo telescopes]] that can find DSOs automatically, and large [[reflecting telescope]]s, such as [[Dobsonian]] style telescopes, with wide fields of view well suited for such observing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=HKMKjfKNzE4C&amp;dq=popularity+deep+sky+object&amp;q=popularity+#search_anchor Rajiv Gupta, Observer's Handbook 2005, page 73]&lt;/ref&gt; Observing faint objects needs dark skies, so these relatively portable types of telescopes also lend themselves to the majority of amateurs who need to travel outside [[light pollution|light polluted]] urban locations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer's Handbook'', Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; To cut down light pollution and enhance contrast observers employ "''[[Astronomical filter#Nebular filters|nebular filters]]''" designed to admit certain wavelength and block others.

There are organized activities associated with DSOs such as the [[Messier marathon]] which occurs at a specific time each year and involve observers trying to spot all 110 Messier objects in one night. Since the Messier catalog objects were discovered with relatively small 18th century telescopes it is a popular list with observers, being well within the grasp of most modern amateur telescopes. A much more demanding test known as the [[Herschel 400 Catalogue|Herschel 400]] is designed to tax larger [[telescopes]] and experienced amateur astronomers.

==List of deep-sky object types==
There are many astronomical object types that come under the description of ''deep-sky objects''. Since the definition is objects that are non-Solar System and non-stellar the list includes:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JMDiXFE39HQC&amp;pg=PT10&amp;dq=deep+sky+object#v=onepage&amp;q=deep%20sky%20object&amp;f=false W.

'''Depyrogenation''' refers to the removal of pyrogens from solution, most commonly from injectable pharmaceuticals.

A [[wikt:pyrogen|pyrogen]] is defined as any substance that can cause a fever. Bacterial pyrogens include [[endotoxins]] and [[exotoxins]], although many pyrogens are endogenous to the host. Endotoxins include [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS) molecules found as part of the cell wall of [[Gram-negative]] bacteria, and are released upon bacterial cell [[lysis]]. Endotoxins may become pyrogenic when released into the bloodstream or other tissue where they are not usually found. Although the colon contains Gram-negative bacteria in abundance, they do not cause a pyrogenic effect as the bacteria are not undergoing gross lysis, and the immune system is not exposed to free endotoxin while the colonic wall is intact.

When LPS is released upon bacterial cell lysis, the lipid A component is first bound by serum LPS-Binding Protein (LBP) and then transferred to CD14 (either free CD14 in the serum or bound to the cell surface of macrophages or monocytes). This monomerises the aggregated LPS, as the LPS receptor Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) cannot recognise LPS while aggregated. Monomeric LPS is then transferred to MD-2 pre-complexed with TLR4 on [[macrophages]] and [[monocytes]]. This leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, which may lead ultimately to septic shock depending on the strength of response. Vascular [[endothelial]] cells also express TLR4 and MD-2 and so respond to LPS directly, as well as via cytokines and nitric oxide. Bronchial epithelial cells and colonic epithelial cells also express TLR4, but as they do not express MD-2 they rely on LPS precomplexed with serum MD-2 in order to signal to LPS.

== Maximum acceptable endotoxin level ==
Because endotoxin molecular weight may vary a great deal (10,000 to 1,000,000 Da), endotoxin levels are measured in "endotoxin units" (EU). One EU is approximately equivalent to 100 pg of E. coli lipopolysaccharide—the amount present in around 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria. Humans can develop symptoms when exposed to as little as 5 EU/kg body weight. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, fever, low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and low urine output; and even small doses of endotoxin in the blood stream are often fatal.

The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] has set the following maximum permissible endotoxin levels for drugs distributed in the United States:
* Drug (injectable, [[intrathecal]]) - 0.2 EU/kg body weight
* Drug (injectable, non-intrathecal) - 5 EU/kg body weight
* Sterile water - 0.25-0.5 EU/ml (depends on intended use)

== Pyrogen detection ==

=== Rabbit Test ===
Early endotoxin detection was accomplished by injecting rabbits with the sample and observing the response in their body temperature. Rabbits have similar endotoxin tolerance to humans, and were thus an ideal choice. However, this method was costly, time consuming, and prompted protests from animals rights advocates. But perhaps the biggest drawback of this test was its inability to quantify the endotoxin level.

=== [[Limulus Amebocyte Lysate|LAL test]] ===
Currently, one common method for endotoxin detection is the [[Limulus Amebocyte Lysate]] (LAL) test. This test is based on Dr. Frederik Bang's [https://web.archive.org/web/20061010205452/http://commprojects.jhsph.edu/sphheros/default.cfm?detail=17] observation that horseshoe crab blood forms clots when exposed to endotoxins. Amoebocyte extract from horseshoe crab blood is mixed with a sample suspected of endotoxin contamination, and a reaction is observed if endotoxins are present. The FDA has approved four variations of the LAL test: gel-clot, turbidimetric, colorimetric, and chromogenic assay. The differences in these variations refer to the characteristics of the amoebocyte/endtoxin reaction (e.g. gel-clot produces a precipitate and colorimetric changes color). This test is fast (approx. 30 minutes) and highly sensitive (up to 0.001 EU/ml sensitivity). However, because it only detects LPS endotoxins, some pyrogenic materials can be missed. Also, certain conditions (sub-optimal pH conditions or unsuitable [[cation]] concentration) can lead to false negatives. [[Glucans]] from carbohydrate chromatography matrices can also lead to false positives.

Since 2003, a synthetic substitute for the LAL test has been commercially available. It is based on the [[Limulus clotting factor C]] protein, produced by genetically modified insect gut cells. The adoption of this test was slow, which began to change in 2016 when the [[European Pharmacopoeia|European Pharmacopeia]] listed this test as an accepted bacterial-toxin test.

=== Monocyte Activation Test ===
The [[Monocyte Activation Test]] (MAT) uses the [[monocyte]]s in human blood ''[[in vitro]]'' to detect pyrogens. It was added to the European Pharmacopeia in 2010 and accepted by the FDA in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/guidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM310098.pdf Guidance for Industry Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing: Questions and Answers], FDA, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pyrogen removal (depyrogenation) ==
Pyrogens can often be difficult to remove from solution due to the high variability of their molecular weight. Pyrogens are also relatively thermally stable and insensitive to pH changes. However, several removal techniques exist [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282704534_A_Practical_Approach_to_Depyrogenation_Studies_Using_Bacterial_Endotoxin].

'''[[Ion exchange chromatography]]'''

Endotoxins are negatively charged, and will bind to an ''[[anion exchanger]]''. If the target substance is not also negatively charged, it will pass through the column before the endotoxin, and an effective separation can be achieved. This method is sometimes used in the purification of [[albumins]] (details follow). [[Ligands]] of known affinity to endotoxins can be coupled to an anion exchange system to increase its endotoxin binding strength and further improve the purity of the final product. Typical examples of endotoxin binding ligands include [[histamine]], nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, and [[polymyxin B]]. However, [[polymyxin B]] is known to induce production of interleukin-1, an exogenous pyrogen, and thus must be shown to be absent in the final product if used.

Example of using [[anion exchange chromatography]] to purify albumin (Uppsala):
* 2% of the endotoxin ''does not'' bind to the column. However, this 2% washes out before the albumin peak, and can thus be removed simply by starting collection after this 2% has washed out.
* 10% of the endotoxin that ''does'' bind to the column (9.8% of the original total) will eventually wash out after the albumin peak. This can be prevented from entering the final product by stopping collection before this happens.
* The remaining 90% of the bound endotoxin (88.2% of the original total) must be cleaned off the column using NaOH

An alternative to anion exchange is ''[[cation exchange]] chromatography'', in which positively charged solutes bind to the solid chromatographic media. In this method, the target binds to the column instead of the endotoxin. The endotoxin then washes through the column, and a pure target is later eluted off the column. Cation exchange chromatography has been shown to effectively purify β-interferon. (Dembinski, et al.)

'''[[Ultrafiltration]]'''

Because the molecular weight of endotoxins is usually over 10 kD, ultrafiltration can sometimes be used to perform as a size based separation. Due to the high variability of endotoxin size, it can be difficult to select the correct membrane, hence this method is best used only when all endotoxins present are larger than 300,000 Da. Commercially available ultra filters have been shown to remove pyrogens to a level below 0.001 EU/ml.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''[[Distillation]]'''

This method is also based on the large molecular weight and heat stability of endotoxins. Low molecular-weight solvents can be easily purified by boiling and collecting the condensed vapor in an endotoxin free vessel (see "heating" below). The large LPS molecules do not easily vaporize, and are thus left behind in the heating vessel. This is the method of choice for the purification of water.

== Inactivation/destruction ==
Because pyrogens are often difficult to remove, inactivation or destruction of the LPS molecule can sometimes be preferable.

'''Acid-base [[hydrolysis]]''' 
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Endo3.jpeg|right]] --&gt;
This method has been shown to cleave Lipid A from the polysaccharide in the LPS molecule (see right). The [[lipid]] moiety alone is not soluble in water. Thus unable to bind to [[endothelial]] cells, it is rendered inactive. However, acid-base hydrolysis can denature a target protein, and is thus unsuitable when purifying a protein.

'''[[Oxidation]]'''

Oxidation using hydrogen peroxide is often used as a low cost pyrogen destroying solution. The mechanism for this destruction is unknown, but hydrogen peroxide can easily be removed further downstream in the purification process, and is therefore a useful method of pyrogen removal. However, like acid-base hydrolysis, it is not suitable when purifying proteins.

'''Heating'''

Heating methods are often used to ensure that glass and other lab equipment are free of pyrogenic material. Heat is applied by baking in a dry heat oven that is designed specifically for the depyrogenation process. Although endotoxins are relatively thermally stable, sufficient heating (250&amp;nbsp;°C for 30 min) results in a [[Log reduction|3-log reduction]] of endotoxin levels. Due to the high temperature levels, this method is also not suitable when purifying proteins.

'''Sodium Hydroxide'''

When purifying proteins, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) can be used safely and effectively. It is also widely used for depyrogenation of non-autoclavable equipment (e.g. plastics) and chromatography columns. In fact, when using an anion exchanger to remove pyrogens, it is necessary to clean the column with NaOH after each batch.

== Preventive methods ==
Because virtually all raw materials involved in a production process, including factory employees, can be potential sources of pyrogen contamination, raw material screening and depyrogenation can often go a long way to ensuring the final product is free of pyrogens and does not require costly removal or inactivation methods. Ultrafiltration of chemicals and buffer solutions, applying appropriate hygienic practices, and performing regular tests can all be helpful.

'''Document mosaicing''' is a process that stitches multiple, overlapping [[wikt:snaphot|snapshot]] images of a document together in order to produce one large, high resolution composite. The document is slid under a stationary, over-the-desk camera by hand until all parts of the document are snapshotted by the camera’s field of view. As the document slid under the camera, all motion of the document is coarsely tracked by the vision system. The document is periodically snapshotted such that the successive snapshots are overlap by about 50%. The system then finds the overlapped pairs and stitches them together repeatedly until all pairs are stitched together as one piece of document.&lt;ref name="MyRef2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anthony | first=Zappalá |author2=Andrew Gee|author3=Michael Taylor

The document mosaicing can be divided into four main processes.
*Tracking
*Feature detecting
*Correspondences establishing
*Images mosaicing.

== Tracking (simple correlation process) ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Document tracking.png|thumb|'''Figure 1''' : The correlation pattern mirrors the text rows. The template is continuously updated so that an incorrect correlation peak results in mild tracking inaccuracy and not total failure.&lt;ref name="MyRef2" /&gt;]] --&gt;
In this process, the motion of the document slid under the camera is coarsely tracked by the system. Tracking is performed by a process called simple [[correlation]] process. In the first frame of snapshots, a small patch is extracted from the center of the image 
as a correlation template as shown in Figure 1. The correlation process is performed in the four times size of the patch area of the next frame. The motion of the paper is indicated by the peak in the correlation function. The peak in the correlation function indicates the motion of the paper. The template is resampled from this frame and the tracking continues until the template reaches the edge of the document. After the template reaches the edge of the document, another snapshot is taken and the tracking process performs repeatedly until the whole document is imaged. The snapshots are stored in an ordered list in order to pair the overlapped images in later processes.s

== Feature detecting for efficient matching ==
Feature detection is the process of finding the transformation which aligns one image with another. There are two main approaches for feature detection.&lt;ref name="MyRef3"&gt;{{cite journal | last=S. | first=Mann |author2=R.W. Picard

 }}
* '''Feature-based approach''' : Motion parameters are estimated from point correspondences. This approach is suitable for the case that there is plenty supply of stable and detectable features.
* '''Featureless approach''' : When the motion between the two images is small, the motion parameters are estimated using [[optical flow]]. On the other hand, when the motion between the two images is large, the motion parameters are estimated using generalised [[cross-correlation]]. However, this approach requires a computationally expensive resources.

Each image is segmented into a hierarchy of columns, lines and words in order to match with the organised sets of features across images. Skew angle estimation and columns, lines and words finding are the examples of feature detection operations.

=== Skew angle estimation ===

Firstly, the angle that the rows of text make with the image [[Raster graphics|raster]] lines (skew angle) is estimated. It is assumed to lie in the range of ±20°. A small patch of text in the image is selected randomly and then rotated in the range of ±20° until the variance of the pixel intensities of the patch summed along the raster lines is maximised.&lt;ref name="MyRef5"&gt;{{cite journal | last=D.S. | first=Bloomberg |author2=G.E. Kopec |author3=L. Dasari
| title =  Measuring document image skew and orientation | journal = SPIE
| url=http://www.leptonica.com/papers/skew-measurement.pdf|year= 1995 | volume=2422 | issue=Document Recognition II | pages=302–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 2.

In order to ensure that the found skew angle is accurate, the document mosaic system performs calculation at many image patches and derive the final estimation by finding the average of the individual angles weighted by the variance of the pixel intensities of each patch.

=== Columns, lines and words finding ===

In this operation, the de-skewed document is intuitively segmented into a hierarchy of columns, lines and words. The sensitivity to illumination and page coloration of the de-skewed document can be removed by applying a [[Sobel operator]] to the de-skewed image and thresholding the output to obtain the binary gradient, de-skewed image.&lt;ref name="MyRef6"&gt;{{cite journal | last=M.J. | first=Taylor|author2=J. Lee
| title =  Interactive text segmentation of greyscale images of documents | journal = Technical Report EPC, Rank Xerox Research Centre
| year= 1997 | volume=104 | issue=Document Recognition II | pages=302–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 3.

The operation can be roughly separated into 3 steps : column segmentation, line segmentation and word segmentation.

# Columns are easily segmented from the binary [[gradient]], de-skewed images by summing pixels vertically as shown in Figure 4.
# Baselines of each row are segmented in the same way as the column segmentation process but horizontally.
# Finally, individual words are segmented by applying the vertical process at each segmented row.

These segmentations are important because the document mosaic will be created by matching the lower right corners of words in overlapping images pair. Moreover, the segmentation operation can organize the list of images in the context of a hierarchy of rows and column reliably.

The segmentation operation involves a considerable amount of summing in the binary [[gradient]], de-skewed images, which done by construct a matrix of partial sums&lt;ref name="MyRef7"&gt;{{cite book | last= F.P.| first=Preparata|author2=M.I. Shamos
| title =  Computational Geometry: An Introduction | publisher = Springer–Verlag | series = Monographs in Computer Science
| url=https://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-0-387-96131-6|year= 1985| isbn=9780387961316}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose elements are given by

&lt;math&gt;p_{iy}=\sum_{u=1}^{i}\sum_{v=1}^{j}b_{uv}&lt;/math&gt;
 
The matrix of partial sums is calculated in one pass through the binary [[gradient]], de-skewed image.&lt;ref name="MyRef7" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{u=u_{1}}^{u_{2}}\sum_{v=v_{1}}^{v_{2}}b_{uv}=p_{u_{2}v_{2}}+p_{u_{1}v_{1}}-p_{u_{1}v_{2}}-p_{u_{2}v_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Correspondences establishing ==
The two images are now organized in hierarchy of linked lists in following structure :
* image   = list of columns
* row       = list of words
* column = list of row
* word     = length (in pixels)

At the bottom of the structure, the length of each word is recorded for establishing correspondence between two images in order to reduce to search only the corresponding structures for the groups of words with the matching lengths.

=== Seed match finding ===

A seed match finding is done by comparing each row in image1 with each row in image2. The two rows are then compared to each other by every word. If the length (in pixel) of the two words (one from image1 and one from image2) and their immediate neighbours agree with each other within a predefined tolerance threshold (5 pixels, for example), then they are assumed to be matched. The row of each image is assumed to be matched if there are three or more word matches between the two rows. The seed match finding operation is terminated when two pairs of consecutive row match are found.

=== Match list building ===

After finishing a seed match finding operation, the next process is to build the match list to generate the correspondences points of the two images. The process is done by searching the matching pairs of rows away from the seed row.

== Images mosaicing ==
[[File:Mosaicing.png|thumb|'''Figure 5''' : Mosaicing of two document images. Blurring is evident in the affine mosaic (b), but not in the mosaic constructed using a plane-to-plane projectivity (a). Close-ups of typical seams of (a) and (b) are shown in (c) and (d) respectively.&lt;ref name="MyRef2" /&gt;]]

Given the list of corresponding points of the two images, finding the transformation of the overlapping portion of the images is next process to be performed. Assuming a [[pinhole camera]] model, the transformation between pixels (u,v) of image 1 and pixels (u0, v0) of image 2 is demonstrated by a plane-to-plane projectivity.&lt;ref name="MyRef8"&gt;{{cite book | last=J.L. | first=Mundy|author2=A.

&lt;/math&gt;

The parameters of the projectivity is found from four pairs of matching points. RANSAC regression&lt;ref name="MyRef9"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Martin A. Fischler | author2=Robert C. Bolles | last-author-amp=yes

| year= 1981 | doi=10.1145/358669.358692}}&lt;/ref&gt; technique is used to reject outlying matches and estimate the projectivity from the remaining good matches.

The projectivity is fine-tuned using correlation at the corners of the overlapping portion in order to obtain four correspondences to sub-pixel accuracy. Therefore, image1 is then transformed into image2’s coordinate system using Eq.1. The typical result of the process is shown in Figure 5.

=== Many images coping ===

Finally, the whole page composition is built up by mapping all the images into the coordinate system of an “anchor” image, which is normally the one nearest the page center. The transformations to the anchor frame are calculated by concatenating the pair-wise transformations which found earlier. The raw document mosaic is shown in Figure 6.

However, there might be a problem of non-consecutive images that are overlap. This problem can be solved by performing Hierarchical sub-mosaics. As shown in Figure 7, image1 and image2 are registered, as are image3 and image4, creating two sub-mosaics. These two sub-mosaics are later stitched together in another mosaicing process.

The '''Elgin Marbles''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|ɡ|ɪ|n}}), also known as the '''Parthenon Marbles''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γλυπτά του Παρθενώνα), are a collection of [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[marble sculpture]]s made under the supervision of the architect and sculptor [[Phidias]] and his assistants. They were originally part of the [[Parthenon|temple of the Parthenon]] and other buildings on the [[Acropolis of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/w/what_are_the_elgin_marbles.aspx|title=What are the 'Elgin Marbles'?|publisher=britishmuseum.org|accessdate=2009-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420232511/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/w/what_are_the_elgin_marbles.aspx|archive-date=20 April 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Elgin-Marbles|title=Elgin Marbles&amp;nbsp;– Greek sculpture |work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate = 2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Greek War of Independence|gaining its independence]] from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, the newly found Greek state began a series of projects to restore its monuments and retrieve looted art.

The [[Greek government]] itself continues to urge the return of the marbles to [[Athens]] so as to be unified with the remaining marbles and for the complete [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze sequence]] to be restored, through diplomatic, political and legal means.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-greece-marbles/greece-wants-parthenon-marbles-back-tsipras-tells-may-idUSKBN1JM2T6&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1798 the Earl of Elgin was appointed as "Ambassador Extraordinary and [[Plenipotentiary|Minister Plenipotentiary]] of His Britannic Majesty to the Sublime Porte of [[Selim III]], Sultan of Turkey" (Greece was then [[Ottoman Greece|part of the Ottoman Empire]]). Before his departure to take up the post he had approached officials of the British government to inquire if they would be interested in employing artists to take casts and drawings of the sculptured portions of the Parthenon. According to Lord Elgin, "the answer of the Government&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;was entirely negative."&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt;

Lord Elgin decided to carry out the work himself, and employed artists to take casts and drawings under the supervision of the [[Parthenopaean Republic|Neapolitan]] court painter, [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri|Giovani Lusieri]].&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt; According to a Turkish local, [[marble]] sculptures that fell were being burned to obtain [[lime (material)|lime]] for building.&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt; Although his original intention was only to document the sculptures, in 1801 Lord Elgin began to remove material from the Parthenon and its surrounding structures&lt;ref name="guardian faq"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jul/21/highereducation.parthenon |title=Elgin Marbles: fact or fiction? |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2004-07-21|accessdate=2009-06-25 | location=London | first=Dorothy | last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of Lusieri. Pieces were also removed from the [[Erechtheion]], the [[Propylaia]], and the [[Temple of Athena Nike]], all inside the [[Acropolis]].

The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost to Elgin of around £70,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184554/Elgin-Marbles |title=Elgin Marbles |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elgin intended to use the marbles to decorate [[Broomhall House]], his private home near [[Dunfermline]] in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/19/books/books-of-the-times-refueling-the-elgin-marbles-debate.html&lt;/ref&gt; but a costly divorce suit forced him to sell them to settle his debts.&lt;ref&gt;As reported by John E.

==Description==
{{Main article|Parthenon Frieze|Metopes of the Parthenon}}
The Parthenon Marbles acquired by Elgin include some 21 figures from the statuary from the east and west [[pediment]]s, 15 of an original 92 [[Metope (architecture)|metope]] panels depicting battles between the [[Lapiths]] and the [[Centaur]]s, as well as 75 meters of the [[Parthenon Frieze]] which decorated the horizontal course set above the interior architrave of the temple. As such, they represent more than half of what now remains of the surviving sculptural decoration of the Parthenon.

Elgin's acquisitions also included objects from other buildings on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Athenian Acropolis]]: a [[Caryatid]] from [[Erechtheum]]; four slabs from the parapet frieze of the [[Temple of Athena Nike]]; and a number of other [[Architecture|architectural]] fragments of the Parthenon, Propylaia, Erechtheum, the Temple of Athene Nike, and the [[Treasury of Atreus]].

==Legality of the removal from Athens==
The Acropolis was at that time an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] military fort, so Elgin required special permission to enter the site, the Parthenon, and the surrounding buildings. He stated that he had obtained a [[firman (decree)|firman]] from the [[Sultan]] which allowed his artists to access the site, but he was unable to produce the original documentation. However, Elgin presented a document claimed to be an English translation of an [[Italian language|Italian]] copy made at the time. This document is now kept in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;St Clair, William: Lord Elgin and the Marbles. Oxford University Press, USA, 3 edition (17 July 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Its authenticity has been questioned, as it lacked the formalities characterising edicts from the sultan. Vassilis Demetriades, Professor of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete, has argued that "any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman".&lt;ref name=firman/&gt; The document was recorded in an appendix of an 1816 parliamentary committee report. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NwUFAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PR1&amp;ots=GiMElOqrbf&amp;dq=lord%20elgin%20testified%201816%20british%20parliamentary%20committee&amp;hl=el&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=lord%20elgin%20testified%201816%20british%20parliamentary%20committee&amp;f=false  'The committee permission'] had convened to examine a request by Elgin asking the British government to purchase the Marbles. The report said that the document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parthenon.newmentor.net/firman.htm|title=firman|work=newmentor.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the appendix was an accurate translation, in English, of an Ottoman firman dated July 1801. In Elgin's view it amounted to an Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles. The committee was told that the original document was given to Ottoman officials in Athens in 1801. Researchers have so far failed to locate it despite the fact that the Ottoman archives in Istanbul still hold a number of similar documents dating from the same period.&lt;ref name=Nation/&gt;

The parliamentary record shows that the Italian copy of the firman was not presented to the committee by Elgin himself but by one of his associates, the clergyman Rev. [[Philip Hunt (priest)|Philip Hunt]]. Hunt, who at the time resided in Bedford, was the last witness to appear before the committee and stated that he had in his possession an Italian translation of the Ottoman original. He went on to explain that he had not brought the document, because, upon leaving Bedford, he was not aware that he was to testify as a witness. The English document in the parliamentary report was filed by Hunt, but the committee was not presented with the Italian translation in Hunt's possession. William St. Clair, a contemporary biographer of Lord Elgin, said he possessed Hunt's Italian document and "vouches for the accuracy of the English translation". The committee report states on page 69 "(Signed with a signet.) Seged Abdullah Kaimacan" - however, the document presented to the committee was "an English translation of this purported translation into Italian of the original ''firman''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kate Fitz |last=Gibbon |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |pages=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had neither signet nor signature on it, a fact corroborated by St. Clair.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Rudenstine |title=Did Elgin cheat the Marbles? |journal=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, ''Lord Elgin and the Marbles,'' stated the sultan did not allow the removal of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon. The study judged a clause authorizing the British to take stones “with old inscriptions and figures” probably meant items in the excavations the site, not the art decorating the temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2017/03-04/parthenon-sculptures-british-museum-controversy/?sf72336468=1|title=How the Parthenon Lost Its Marbles|date=2017-03-28|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document allowed Elgin and his team to erect scaffolding so as to make drawings and mouldings in [[chalk]] or [[gypsum]], as well as to measure the remains of the ruined buildings and excavate the foundations which may have become covered in the [''ghiaja'' (meaning gravel, debris)]; and "...that when they wish to take away [''qualche'' (meaning 'some' or 'a few')] pieces of stone with old inscriptions or figures thereon, that no opposition be made thereto". The interpretation of these lines has been questioned even by non-restitutionalists,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |title=Thinking about the Elgin Marbles |journal=[[Michigan Law Review]] |volume=83 |issue=8 |year=1985 |pages=1898–1899 |doi=10.2307/1288954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English translation of the firman {{cite web|url=http://www.greece.org/parthenon/marbles/firman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510201851/http://www.greece.org/parthenon/marbles/firman.htm |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the word ''qualche'', which in modern language should be translated as ''a few'' but can also mean ''any''. According to non-restitutionalists, further evidence that the removal of the sculptures by Elgin was approved by the Ottoman authorities is shown by a second firman which was required for the shipping of the marbles from the Piraeus.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite book |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |chapter=Whither the Elgin Marbles? |title=Imperialism, Art And Restitution |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have questioned the legality of Elgin's actions, including the legitimacy of the documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor [[David Rudenstine]] of the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, "is certainly not established and may well be false".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudenstine |first=David |title=The Legality of Elgin's Taking: A Review Essay of Four Books on the Parthenon Marbles |journal=International Journal of Cultural Property |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=356–376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads "We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador" but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is "We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of "Mr. Philip Hunt" with the initials "N.N." can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorisation for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, "Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had "retained none of them." Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was "Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted to [Lord Elgin] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?" to which Hunt answered "yes", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;

English travel writer [[Edward Daniel Clarke]], an eyewitness, wrote that the [[Dizdar]], the Ottoman fortress commander on the scene, attempted to stop the removal of the metopes but was bribed to allow it to continue.&lt;ref name="Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Edward Daniel Clarke |title= Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa Part the Second Greece Egypt and the Holy Land Section the Second Fourth Edition Volume the Sixth |publisher=T. Cadell |location=London |year=1818 |page= 223ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In contrast, John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford Law School]] and also Professor of Art at [[Stanford University]], putting aside the discrepancy presented by Rudenstine, argues that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable. The Ottoman [[sultan]] was grateful to the British for repelling [[Napoleon]]ic expansion, and the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; Further, that written permission exists in the form of the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalises his (and therefore the British Museum's) claim to the Marbles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles "is at best ambiguous", adding that the document "provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The reference to 'taking away any pieces of stone' seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin's party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal. It is certainly arguable that Elgin exceeded the authority granted in the firman in both respects".&lt;ref name="NafzigerPaterson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James A. R. Nafziger|author2=Robert Kirkwood Paterson|author3=Alison Dundes Renteln|title=Cultural Law: International, Comparative, and Indigenous|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmx6YHCNM78C&amp;pg=PA397|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86550-0|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of firmans of this nature, along with universally required bribes, was not unusual at this time: In 1801 for example, [[Edward Daniel Clarke|Edward Clarke]] and his assistant Cripps, obtained an authorisation from the governor of Athens for the removal of a statue of the goddess [[Demeter]] which was at [[Eleusis]], with the intervention of Italian artist [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri]] who was Lord Elgin's assistant at the time.&lt;ref name="Fagan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Fagan|title=From Stonehenge to Samarkand: An Anthology of Archaeological Travel Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-f-24-8negC&amp;pg=PA54|date=20 July 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516091-8|page=54|quote=Clarke and Cripps greatly admired the statue, which weighed over 2 tons (1.8 tonnes) and decided to take it to England.

When the marbles were shipped to England, they were "an instant success among many"&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; who admired the sculptures and supported their arrival, but both the sculptures and Elgin also received criticism from detractors. Lord Elgin began negotiations for the sale of the collection to the British Museum in 1811, but negotiations failed despite the support of British artists&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; after the government showed little interest. Many Britons opposed purchase of the statues because they were in bad condition and therefore did not display the "ideal beauty" found in other sculpture collections.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;  The following years marked an increased interest in classical Greece, and in June 1816, after parliamentary hearings, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] offered £35,000 in exchange for the sculptures. Even at the time the acquisition inspired much debate, although it was supported by "many persuasive calls" for the purchase.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

[[Lord Byron]] strongly objected to the removal of the marbles from [[Greece]], denouncing Elgin as a vandal.&lt;ref name=BritA/&gt; His point of view about the removal of the Marbles from Athens is also mentioned in his narrative poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', published in 1812, which itself was largely inspired by Byron's travels around the Mediterranean and the [[Aegean Sea]] between 1809 and 1811:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elginism.com/20040720/90/ |title=The story of the Elgin Marbles
|publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2004-07-14 |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Dull is the eye that will not weep to see
:Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed
:By British hands, which it had best behoved
:To guard those relics ne'er to be restored.
:Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,
:And once again thy hapless bosom gored,
:And snatch'd thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred!

Byron was not the only one to protest against the removal at the time:
:"The Honourable Lord has taken advantage of the most unjustifiable means and has committed the most flagrant pillages. It was, it seems, fatal that a representative of our country loot those objects that the Turks and other barbarians had considered sacred," said [[Sir John Newport, 1st Baronet|Sir John Newport]].&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/200852 |title=Romancing the Stones |publisher=Newsweek |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Daniel Clarke]] witnessed the removal of the metopes and called the action a "spoliation", writing that "thus the form of the temple has sustained a greater injury than it had already experienced from the Venetian artillery," and that "neither was there a workman employed in the undertaking ... who did not express his concern that such havoc should be deemed necessary, after moulds and casts had been already made of all the sculpture which it was designed to remove."&lt;ref name="Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff"/&gt; When Sir [[Francis Ronalds]] visited Athens and [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri]] in 1820, he wrote that "If Lord Elgin had possessed real taste in lieu of a covetous spirit he would have done just the reverse of what he has, he would have removed the rubbish and left the antiquities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sirfrancisronalds.co.uk/athens.html|title=Sir Francis Ronalds' Travel Journal: Athens|website=Sir Francis Ronalds and his Family|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parliamentary committee investigating the situation concluded that the monuments were best given "asylum" under a "free government" such as the British one.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; In 1810, Elgin published a defence of his actions,&lt;ref name=BritB/&gt; but the subject remained controversial.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!-- Obviously they're controversial now, but citation needed that they remained controversial in Britain at that time.--&gt; [[John Keats]] viewed them in 1817 when they were exhibited in the British Museum, hence his famous [[sonnet]] about the marbles titled "On Seeing the Elgin Marbles". Notable supporters of Elgin included the painter [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]].&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

A public debate in Parliament followed Elgin's publication, and Parliament again exonerated Elgin's actions. Parliament decided to purchase the marbles for the "British nation" in 1816 by a vote of 82–30 for £35,000.&lt;ref name=BritA/&gt; They were deposited in the British Museum, where they were displayed in the Elgin Saloon (constructed in 1832), until the [[Duveen Gallery]] was completed in 1939. Crowds packed the British Museum to view the sculptures, setting attendance records for the museum.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; [[William Wordsworth]] viewed the marbles at the museum and commented favourably on their aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=William Wordsworth |title=The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth |publisher=W.

==Damage==

===Morosini===
[[File:Elgin Marbles east pediment.jpg|thumb|East Pediment]]
Prior damage to the marbles was sustained during successive wars, and it was during such conflicts that the Parthenon and its artwork sustained, by far, the most extensive damage. In particular, an explosion ignited by [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]] gun and cannon-fire bombardment in 1687, whilst the Parthenon was used as a munitions store during the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman rule]], destroyed or damaged many pieces of Parthenon art, including some of that later taken by Lord Elgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/198 |title=Stanford Archaeopedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314025855/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/198 |archivedate=14 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this explosion that sent the marble roof, most of the [[cella]] walls, 14 columns from the north and south [[peristyle]]s, and carved metopes and frieze blocks flying and crashing to the ground, destroying much of the artwork. Further damage to the Parthenon's artwork occurred when the Venetian general [[Francesco Morosini]] looted the site of its larger sculptures. The tackle he was using to remove the sculptures proved to be faulty and snapped, dropping an over-life-sized sculpture of [[Poseidon]] and the horses of [[Athena]]'s chariot from the west pediment on to the rock of the Acropolis {{convert|40|ft}} below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521820936&amp;ss=exc|title=The Parthenon|work=cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Erechtheion]] was used as a munitions store by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] during the [[Greek War of Independence]]&lt;ref name=Erechtheion&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 |title=History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203021650/http://www.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1821–1833) which ended the 355-year Ottoman rule of Athens. The Acropolis was besieged twice during the war, first [[Siege of the Acropolis (1821–22)|by the Greeks]] in 1821–22 and then [[Siege of the Acropolis (1826–27)|by the Ottoman forces]] in 1826–27. During the first siege the besieged Ottoman forces attempted to melt the lead in the columns to cast bullets, even prompting the Greeks to offer their own bullets to the Ottomans in order to minimize damage.&lt;ref name=Hitchens&gt;Hitchens Christopher, ''The Elgin Marbles: Should They Be Returned to Greece?'', 1998, p.viii, {{ISBN|1-85984-220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elgin===
Elgin consulted with Italian sculptor [[Antonio Canova]] in 1803 about how best to restore the marbles. Canova was considered by some to be the world's best sculptural restorer of the time; Elgin wrote that Canova declined to work on the marbles for fear of damaging them further.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

To facilitate transport by Elgin, the columns' capitals and many metopes and frieze slabs were either hacked off the main structure or sawn and sliced into smaller sections, causing irreparable damage to the Parthenon itself.&lt;ref name="Greek Ministry of Culture: Memorandum on the Parthenon Marbles"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yppo.gr/4/marm/memorandum-gr.pdf |title=Greek Government's Memorandum |publisher=Greek Ministry of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/arts/design/28ouro.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin Where Gods Yearn for Long-Lost Treasures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016235933/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/arts/design/28ouro.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin |date=16 October 2015 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; One shipload of marbles on board the British brig ''Mentor'' &lt;ref name="The Wreck of the Mentor on the Coast of the Island of Kythera and the Operation to Retrieve, Salvage, and Transport the Parthenon Sculptures to London"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/376886/_The_Wreck_of_the_Mentor_on_the_Coast_of_the_Island_of_Kythera_and_the_Operation_to_Retrieve_Salvage_and_Transport_the_Parthenon_Sculptures_to_London_1802-1805_ |title=The Wreck of the Mentor on the Coast of the Island of Kythera and the Operation to Retrieve, Salvage, and Transport the Parthenon Sculptures to London (1802-1805) |publisher=Arts Books, Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt; was caught in a storm off [[Cape Matapan]] in southern Greece and sank near [[Kythera]], but was salvaged at the Earl's personal expense;&lt;ref name="British Museum releases"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/parthenon_sculptures/parthenon_-_facts_and_figures.aspx |title=The Parthenon Sculptures |publisher=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; it took two years to bring them to the surface.

The artefacts held in London suffered from 19th-century pollution which persisted until the mid-20th century and have suffered irreparable damage by previous cleaning methods employed by British Museum staff.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.145–146, Quote: "However, for a short time in the late 1930s copper scrapers were used to remove areas of discolouration from the surface of the Elgin Marbles. New information is presented about this lamentable episode."&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1838, scientist [[Michael Faraday]] was asked to provide a solution to the problem of the deteriorating surface of the marbles. The outcome is described in the following excerpt from the letter he sent to Henry Milman, a commissioner for the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, I., '"Sir, they are scrubbing the Elgin Marbles!"&amp;nbsp;– some controversial cleanings of the Parthenon Sculptures', ''Minerva'' 10(6) (1999) 43-45.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The marbles generally were very dirty&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;from a deposit of dust and soot.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;I found the body of the marble beneath the surface white.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much embedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalies, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The examination has made me despair of the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and whiteness which they originally possessed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further effort to clean the marbles ensued in 1858. [[Richard Westmacott]], who was appointed superintendent of the "moving and cleaning the sculptures" in 1857, in a letter approved by the British Museum Standing Committee on 13 March 1858 concluded&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.148&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think it my duty to say that some of the works are much damaged by ignorant or careless moulding&amp;nbsp;– with oil and lard&amp;nbsp;– and by restorations in wax and resin. These mistakes have caused discolouration. I shall endeavour to remedy this without, however, having recourse to any composition that can injure the surface of the marble.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yet another effort to clean the marbles occurred in 1937–38. This time the incentive was provided by the construction of a new Gallery to house the collection. The Pentelic marble mined from [[Mount Pentelicus]] north of Athens, from which the sculptures are made, naturally acquires a tan colour similar to honey when exposed to air; this colouring is often known as the marble's "patina"&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Ernest Arthur: A Handbook of Greek Sculpture.

The British Museum has responded with the statement that "mistakes were made at that time."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/parthenon/article/0,,195563,00.html mistakes were made at that time]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605154549/http://www.guardian.co.uk/parthenon/article/0%2C%2C195563%2C00.html |date=5 June 2008 }}, ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion it was said that "the damage had been exaggerated for political reasons" and that "the Greeks were guilty of excessive cleaning of the marbles before they were brought to Britain."&lt;ref name=BMScandal/&gt; During the international symposium on the cleaning of the marbles, organised by the British Museum in 1999, curator [[Ian Jenkins (curator)|Ian Jenkins]], deputy keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities, remarked that "The British Museum is not infallible, it is not the Pope. Its history has been a series of good intentions marred by the occasional cock-up, and the 1930s cleaning was such a cock-up". Nonetheless, he claimed that the prime cause for the damage inflicted upon the marbles was the 2000-year-long weathering on the Acropolis.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/01/maevkennedy |title=Mutual attacks mar Elgin Marbles debate | work=[[The Guardian]]

American archeologist [[Dorothy King]], in a newspaper article, wrote that techniques similar to the ones used in 1937–38 were applied by Greeks as well in more recent decades than the British, and maintained that Italians still find them acceptable.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; The British Museum said that a similar cleaning of the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Athenian Agora]] was carried out by the conservation team of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;J. M. Cook and John Boardman, "Archaeology in Greece, 1953", The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 74, (1954), pp. 147&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953 using steel chisels and brass wire.&lt;ref name="British Museum releases"/&gt; According to the Greek ministry of Culture, the cleaning was carefully limited to surface salt crusts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; The 1953 American report concluded that the techniques applied were aimed at removing the black deposit formed by rain-water and "brought out the high technical quality of the carving" revealing at the same time "a few surviving particles of colour".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

Documents released by the British Museum under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] revealed that a series of minor accidents, thefts and acts of [[vandalism]] by visitors have inflicted further damage to the sculptures.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Hastings, Chris.

===Rationale for returning to Athens===

Those arguing for the Marbles' return claim legal, moral and artistic grounds. Their arguments include:

* The main stated aim of the Greek campaign is to reunite the Parthenon sculptures around the world in order to restore "organic elements" which "at present remain without cohesion, homogeneity and historicity of the monument to which they belong" and allow visitors to better appreciate them as a whole;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ea121.html |title=Hellenic Ministry of Culture, Special Issues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017204203/http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ea121.html |archivedate=17 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicoletta Divari-Valakou 2008"&gt;Nicoletta Divari-Valakou, (Director of the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Athens), "Revisiting the Parthenon: National Heritage in the Age of Globalism" in Mille Gabriel &amp; Jens Dahl, (eds.)

* Returning the Parthenon sculptures (it should be noted that Greece is requesting only the return of sculptures from this particular building) would not set a precedent for other restitution claims because of the distinctively "universal value" of the Parthenon;&lt;ref&gt;Nicoletta Divari-Valakou, (Director of the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Athens), "Revisiting the Parthenon: National Heritage in the Age of Globalism" in Mille Gabriel &amp; Jens Dahl, (eds.)

* Safekeeping of the marbles would be ensured at the New [[Acropolis Museum]], situated to the south of the Acropolis hill. It was built to hold the Parthenon sculpture in natural sunlight that characterises the Athenian climate, arranged in the same way as they would have been on the Parthenon.

* The friezes are part of a single work of art, thus it was unintended that fragments of this piece be scattered across different locations;
* Casts of the marbles would be just as able to demonstrate the cultural influences which Greek sculptures have had upon European art as would the original marbles, whereas the context with which the marbles belong cannot be replicated within the British museum;
* A poll suggested that more British people (37%) supported  the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/10/18/british-people-tend-want-elgin-marbles-returned/|title=British people tend to want Elgin marbles returned|newspaper=Yougov.co.uk|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationale for retaining in London===
A range of different arguments have been presented by scholars,&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"/&gt; British political leaders and British Museum spokespersons over the years in defence of retention of the Elgin Marbles by the British Museum. The main points include:
* the assertion that fulfilling all restitution claims would empty most of the world's great museums&amp;nbsp;– this has also caused concerns among other European and American museums, with one potential target being the [[Nefertiti Bust|famous bust of Nefertiti]] in [[Berlin]]'s [[Neues Museum]]; in addition, portions of Parthenon marbles are kept by many other European museums.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; Advocates of the British Museum's position also point out that the Marbles in Britain receive about 6 million visitors per year as opposed to 1.5 million visitors to the Acropolis Museum. The removal of the Marbles to Greece would therefore, they argue, significantly reduce the number of people who have the opportunity to visit the Marbles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/why-returning-the-elgin-marbles-would-be-madness/&lt;/ref&gt; The English Romantic poet John Keats, and the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, are notable examples of visitors to the Elgin Marbles after their removal to England who subsequently produced famous work inspired by them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/elgin-marbles-british-museum-rodin-exhibition-uk-return-parthenon-greece-a8339661.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52305/on-seeing-the-elgin-marbles&lt;/ref&gt;
* the assertion that Greece could mount no court case, because Elgin claims to have been granted permission by what was then Greece's ruling government and [[Statute of limitations|a legal principle of limitation]] would apply, i.e., the ability to pursue claims expires after a period of time prescribed by law;&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"/&gt;
The last was tested in the English High Court in May 2005 in relation to Nazi-looted Old Master artworks held at the British Museum, which the Museum's Trustees wished to return to the family of the original owner; the Court found that due to the [[British Museum Act 1963]] these works could not be returned without further legislation. The judge, [[Andrew Morritt|Mr Justice Morritt]], found that the Act, which protects the collections for posterity, could not be overridden by a "moral obligation" to return works, even if they are believed to have been plundered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/may/27/arts.parthenon Ruling tightens grip on Parthenon marbles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103042358/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/may/27/arts.parthenon |date=3 January 2012 }}, ''The Guardian'', 27 May 2005. Retrieved 5 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Her Majesty's Attorney General v The Trustees of the British Museum, [2005] EWHC (Ch) 1089&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued, however, that the case was not directly relevant to the Elgin Marbles, as it was about a transfer of ownership, and not the loan of artefacts for public exhibition overseas, which is provided for in the 1963 Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elginism.com/20050603/126/|title=Article on the relevance of the Feldmann paintings judgment to the Elgin Marbles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another argument for keeping the Elgin Marbles within the UK has been made by J. H. Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford University]] and co-operating professor in the Stanford Art Department. He has argued that
the Marbles are now established as a significant element of Britain's own cultural history, as "the Elgin Marbles have been in England since 1821 and in that time have become a part of the British cultural heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Merryman paper|
url=https://law.wustl.edu/harris/Conferences/imperialism/Merryman_PAPER_FINALelgin2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has also argued that if the Parthenon were actually being restored, there would be a moral argument for returning the Marbles to the temple whence they came, and thus restoring its integrity. ''The Guardian'' has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens. These arguments are perhaps complicated a little by the completion of the new [[Acropolis Museum]] in 2009, where the
half not removed by Elgin is now displayed, aligned in orientation and within sight of the [[Parthenon]], 
with the position of the missing elements clearly marked and space left should they be returned to [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="acrop museum"/&gt;

==Public perception of the issue==

===Popular support for restitution===
Outside Greece a campaign for the Return of the Marbles began in 1981 with the formation of the ''[https://iocarpm.wordpress.com/ International Organising Committee - Australia - for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles], and in 1983 with the formation of the ''[http://www.parthenonuk.com/ ''British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles'']. International organisations such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]], as well as campaign groups such as, [[Marbles Reunited]], and stars of Hollywood, such as [[George Clooney]] and [[Matt Damon]], as well as Human Rights activists, lawyers, and the people of the arts, voiced their strong support for the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece.

American actor George Clooney voiced his support for the return by the United Kingdom and reunification of the Parthenon Marbles in Greece, during his promotional campaign for his 2014 film ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' which retells the story of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] efforts to save important masterpieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by [[Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] during [[World War II]]. His remarks regarding the Marbles reignited the debate in the United Kingdom about their return to their home country. Public polls were also carried out by newspapers in response to Clooney's stance on this matter.

An internet campaign site,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bringthemback.org |title=Bring Them Back |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part sponsored by [[Metaxa]], aims to consolidate support for the return of the Elgin Marbles to the New Acropolis Museum in Athens.

Noted public intellectual [[Christopher Hitchens]] had, at numerous times, argued for their repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2009/07/hitchens200907 |title=The Lovely Stones |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In BBC TV Series ''[[QI]]'' (S12E07XL), host [[Stephen Fry]] provided his support for the return of the Elgin Marbles while recounting the story of the Greeks giving lead shot to their [[Ottoman Empire]] enemies, as the Ottomans were running out of ammunition, in order to prevent damage to the Acropolis. Fry had previously written a blog post along much the same lines in December 2011 entitled "A Modest Proposal", signing off with "It's time we lost our marbles"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stephenfry.com/2011/12/19/a-modest-proposal/ |title=A Modest Proposal |accessdate=2014-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Opinion polls===
A [[YouGov]] poll in 2014 suggested that more British people (37%) supported  the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/10/18/british-people-tend-want-elgin-marbles-returned/|title=British people tend to want Elgin marbles returned|newspaper=Yougov.co.uk|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In older polls, [[Ipsos MORI]] asked in 1998, "If there were a referendum on whether or not the Elgin Marbles should be returned to Greece, how would you vote?" This  returned these values from the British general adult population:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2001|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126092318/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2001|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-26|title=
Public and MPs would return the Elgin Marbles!|work=ipsos-mori.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*40% in favour of returning the marbles to Greece
*15% in favour of keeping them at the British Museum
*18% would not vote
*27% had no opinion

Another opinion poll in 2002 (again carried out by MORI) showed similar results, with 40% of the British public in favour of returning the marbles to Greece, 16% in favour of keeping them within Britain and the remainder either having no opinion or would not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=1053|title=Return Of The Parthenon Marbles|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=18 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409021725/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=1053|archivedate=9 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how they would vote if a number of conditions were met (including, but not limited to, a long-term loan whereby the British maintained ownership and joint control over maintenance) the number responding in favour of return increased to 56% and those in favour of keeping them dropped to 7%.

Both MORI poll results have been characterised by proponents of the return of the Marbles to Greece as representing a groundswell of public opinion supporting return, since the proportion explicitly supporting return to Greece significantly exceeds the number who are explicitly in favour of keeping the Marbles at the British Museum.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stosacucine.pk/ |title=Opinion poll: Majority of Britons favor return of Parthenon Marbles |work=stosacucine.pk |date= |accessdate=2009-01-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615202701/http://stosacucine.pk/ |archivedate=15 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other displaced Parthenon art==
[[File:Dionysos pediment Parthenon BM.jpg|210px|thumb|Sculpture of Dionysos from the Parthenon's East Pediment&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;{{cite web | title =Sculpture from the Parthenon's East Pediment | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html | accessdate =18 March 2013 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130304063318/http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html | archive-date =4 March 2013 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The remainder of the surviving sculptures that are not in museums or storerooms in Athens are held in museums in various locations across Europe. The British Museum also holds additional fragments from the Parthenon sculptures acquired from various collections that have no connection with Lord Elgin.

The collection held in the British Museum includes the following material from the Acropolis:
*Parthenon: {{convert|247|ft|m|abbr=on}} of the original {{convert|524|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[frieze]]
**15 of the 92 metopes
**17 pedimental figures, including a figure of a river-god, possibly the river [[Ilissos]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/f/figure_of_a_river-god.aspx |title=Figure of a river-god from the west pediment of the Parthenon |publisher=britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**various pieces of architecture
*Erechtheion: a [[Caryatid]], a column and other architectural members
*Propylaia: Architectural members
*Temple of Athena Nike: 4 slabs of the frieze and architectural members

==British Museum loan==

The British Museum lent the figure of a river-god, possibly the river [[Ilissos]],
to the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] to celebrate its 250th
anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/12/05/loan-of-a-parthenon-sculpture-to-the-hermitage-a-marble-ambassador-of-a-european-ideal/ |title=Loan to the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg |publisher=britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231192906/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/12/05/loan-of-a-parthenon-sculpture-to-the-hermitage-a-marble-ambassador-of-a-european-ideal/ |archivedate=31 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on display there from Saturday 6 December 2014 until Sunday 18 January 2015.
This was the first time the British Museum had lent part of its Elgin Marbles collection and it caused considerable
controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/world/europe/elgin-marbles-lent-to-hermitage-museum.html?_r=0 
|title=Greek Statue Travels Again, but Not to Greece |publisher=www.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labour party leader stance and new dimensions to the dispute caused by Brexit==
In a 2018 interview to the Athens newspaper [[Ta Nea]], quoted later in [[The Independent]], the British [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] vowed to return the Marbles to Greece, stating
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As with anything stolen or taken from occupied or colonial possession – including artefacts looted from other countries in the past – we should be engaged in constructive talks with the Greek government about returning the sculptures."&lt;ref name="Corbyn vows to return the Marbles to Greece"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Following the 2016 [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], it has been suggested that the United Kingdom may be forced to return the marbles to Greece as a precondition for an agreement on [[Brexit]], as any agreement between the [[European Union]] and the United Kingdom has to be approved by European Union member Greece.&lt;ref name="Elgin Marbles part of Brexit negotiations"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/04/greek-mep-demands-elgin-marbles-become-part-brexit-negotiations/ |title=Greek MEP demands Elgin Marbles become part of Brexit negotiations |publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greece to recover stolen Parthenon art"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/greece-could-use-brexit-to-recover-stolen-parthenon-art/a-40038439 |title=Greece could use Brexit to recover stolen Parthenon art |publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8878">'''Environmental informatics''' is the science of information applied to [[environmental science]]. As such, it provides the [[information processing]] and communication infrastructure to the interdisciplinary field of environmental sciences&lt;ref&gt;L.M. Hilty, B. Page, F.J. Radermacher and W.-F. Riekert. Environmental Informatics as a new discipline of applied computer science. N.M. Avouris and B. Page (eds.), Environmental Informatics (1995), pp. 1-11. Kluwer Academic Publishers. The Netherlands. {{ISBN|0-7923-3445-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming at data, information and [[knowledge integration]], the application of [[computational intelligence]] to [[environmental data]] as well as the identification of [[Environmental degradation|environmental impacts]] of [[information technology]]. The UK [[Natural Environment Research Council]] defines environmental informatics as the "research and system development focusing on the environmental sciences relating to the creation, collection, storage, processing, modelling, interpretation, display and dissemination of data and information."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/application/topics.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Kostas Karatzas defined environmental informatics as the "creation of a new 'knowledge-paradigm' towards serving environmental management needs."&lt;ref&gt;K. Karatzas. Environmental Informatics: Concepts and Definitions. In: A. Gnauck and R. Heinrich (eds.), Proceedings of "The Information Society and Enlargement of the European Union"-17th International Conference Informatics for Environmental Protection, Part 1: Concepts and Methods. Metropolis publishers, pp. 146-151, {{ISBN|3-89518-440-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Karatzas argued further that environmental informatics "is an integrator of [[science]], methods and techniques and not just the result of using [[information]] and software technology methods and tools for serving [[environmental engineering]] needs."

Environmental informatics emerged in early 1990 in [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Page, V. Wohlgemuth. Advances in Environmental Informatics: Integration of Discrete Event Simulation Methodology with ecological Material Flow Analysis for Modelling eco-efficient Systems, Procedia Environmental Sciences, Volume 2, International Conference on Ecological Informatics and Ecosystem Conservation (ISEIS 2010), 2010, Pages 696-705, ISSN 1878-0296, {{doi|10.1016/j.proenv.2010.10.079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse environmental and ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of fields like environmental informatics and [[ecoinformatics]] to develop the foundations for effectively managing ecological information. Examples of these initiatives are  [[National Science Foundation]] [[Datanet]] projects, [[DataONE]] and Data Conservancy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">An '''excitable medium''' is a [[nonlinear dynamical system]] which has the capacity to propagate a wave of some description, and which cannot support the passing of another wave until a certain amount of time has passed (known as the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory time]]).

A forest is an example of an excitable medium: if a [[wildfire]] burns through the forest, no fire can return to a burnt spot until the vegetation has gone through its refractory period and regrown.  In chemistry, [[oscillating reaction]]s are excitable media, for example the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] and the [[Briggs–Rauscher reaction]].  Pathological activities in the heart and brain can be modelled as excitable media.  A group of spectators at a sporting event are an excitable medium, as can be observed in a [[Audience wave|Mexican wave]] (so-called from its initial appearance in the 1986 [[Football World Cup|World Cup]] in [[Mexico]]).

==Modelling excitable media==

Excitable media can be modelled using both [[partial differential equation]]s and [[cellular automata]].

===With cellular automata===

Cellular automata provide a simple model to aid in the understanding of excitable media. Perhaps the simplest such model is in.&lt;ref name="Greenberg1978"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics|volume=54|year=1978|pages=515–523|title=Spatial Patterns for Discrete Models of Diffusion in Excitable Media|author=J. M. Greenberg |author2=S. P. Hastings|doi=10.1137/0134040|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton]] for this model. 
 
Each cell of the automaton is made to represent some section of the medium being modelled (for example, a patch of trees in a forest, or a segment of heart tissue).  Each cell can be in one of the three following states:

[[File:ExcitableCellularAutomaton.gif|thumb|right|220px|Traveling waves in a model of an excitable medium (White – Quiescent, Green – Excited, Yellow – Refractory)]]

* Quiescent or excitable — the cell is unexcited, but can be excited.  In the forest fire example, this corresponds to the trees being unburnt.
* Excited — the cell is excited.  The trees are on fire.
* Refractory — the cell has recently been excited and is temporarily not excitable.  This corresponds to a patch of land where the trees have burnt and the vegetation has yet to regrow.

As in all cellular automata, the state of a particular cell in the next time step depends on the state of the cells around it—its neighbours—at the current time.  In the forest fire example the simple rules given in [[Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton]] &lt;ref name="Greenberg1978" /&gt; might be modified as follows:

* If a cell is quiescent, then it remains quiescent unless one or more of its neighbours is excited.  In the forest fire example, this means a patch of land only burns if a neighbouring patch is on fire.
* If a cell is excited, it becomes refractory at the next iteration. After trees have finished burning, the patch of land is left barren.
* If a cell is refractory, then its remaining refractory period is lessened at the next period, until it reaches the end of the refractory period and becomes excitable once more. The trees regrow.

This function can be refined according to the particular medium.  For example, the effect of wind can be added to the model of the forest fire.

==Geometries of waves==

===One-dimensional waves===

It is most common for a one-dimensional medium to form a closed circuit, i.e. a ring.  For example, the [[Mexican wave]] can be modeled as a ring going around the stadium.  If the wave moves in one direction it will eventually return to where it started.  If, upon a wave's return to the origin, the original spot has gone through its refractory period, then the wave will propagate along the ring again (and will do so indefinitely).  If, however, the origin is still refractory upon the wave's return, the wave will be stopped.

In the Mexican wave, for example, if for some reason, the originators of the wave are still standing upon its return it will not continue.  If the originators have sat back down then the wave can, in theory, continue.

===Two-dimensional waves===

Several forms of waves can be observed in a two-dimensional medium.

A ''spreading wave'' will originate at a single point in the medium and spread outwards.  For example, a forest fire could start from a lightning strike at the centre of a forest and spread outwards.

A ''spiral wave'' will again originate at a single point, but will spread in a spiral circuit.  Spiral waves are believed to underlie phenomena such as [[tachycardia]] and [[fibrillation]].

Spiral waves constitute one of the mechanisms of fibrillation when they organize in long-lasting reentrant activities named rotors.

A '''goniometer''' is often included in [[analog circuit|analog]] [[sound|audio]] equipment to display a [[Lissajous figure]] which shows the amount of [[stereo]] (that is, [[Phase (waves)#Phase difference|phase differences]]) in a dual-channel signal. It allows the sound technician to adjust for optimal stereo and determine the makeup of errors such as an inverted signal. Many goniometers also provide a [[VU meter|VU]] or [[Peak programme meter|PPM]] as a secondary function. A goniometer adapted for surround metering is called a 'jellyfish display'. This term was coined by DK-Technologies A/S from Denmark.

==Function==
Its function is to plot a signal on a two-dimensional area so that the correlation between the two axes (audio channels, or [[phase (waves)|phases]]) becomes apparent.

The channels are plotted on diagonal axes; a left-channel-only signal would form a diagonal line running top-left to bottom-right and a right-channel-only signal would form the opposite diagonal running top-right to bottom-left. A signal on both channels would provide components on both axes and thus expand the plot into two dimensions: a [[Monophonic sound|mono]] signal would produce a straight line angled according to balance; whereas a stereo signal, being asymmetrical, would produce a jittery and fluffy-looking ball (see image).

An audio technician would typically begin a session by adjusting the equipment (usually with a 1 [[kHz]] [[Monophonic sound|mono]] [[Musical tone|tone]]) so that the output produces a vertical plot line. If one channel were phase-inverted, it would result in the plot line being a horizontal instead of vertical, a sure sign of problems. As for mono signals, a half-inverted signal would be reduced to (near) silence.

The persistence of a CRT display is a desired effect on goniometers because the signal display is very dynamic, and the overall shape or envelope of the signal is the object of interest. In fact, good digital and software goniometers provide artificial and even user-adjustable persistence.

The goniometer proves useful because it provides very dense information in an analog and surprisingly intuitive form. From the display, one can get a good feel for the audio levels for each channel, the amount of stereo and its compatibility as a mono signal, even to some degree what [[frequencies]] are contained in the signal. Experts may even be able to determine the probable arrangement of microphones when the signal was recorded.

}}The '''Hertie School of Governance''' is a German private independent [[graduate school]] located in [[Berlin]]'s [[Friedrichstraße]]. It has a right to confer doctoral degrees. Half of the students in the Hertie School come from abroad, and the [[working language]] is [[English language|English]].

Predominantly, Hertie's students have backgrounds in law, economics, political science and international relations and pursue a Master of Public Policy or Master of International Affairs degree. The school offers its students the opportunity to complete a "professional year" at a [[multinational corporation]], government ministry or an international organization. In addition to this possibility, research collaboration with faculty is encouraged. The Hertie School also offers an Executive Masters of Public Administration.
[[File:Hsog-exterior.jpg|thumb|South West Wing of Hertie School of Governance]]
Hertie students who are also admitted at a partner university, such as [[Sciences Po]] or [[Syracuse University]] can spend their second year in these institutions and earn an additional master's degree. Or students can pursue study abroad opportunities at one of the Hertie School's nearly 30 academic partners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hertie-school.org/en/studyabroad/|title=Hertie School {{!}} Study abroad|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; worldwide.

The research focus of the Hertie School, which has existed since its founding, lies in the analysis of the conditions, structures and dynamics of governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/download/archiv/hginfo_3017_Hertie.pdf|title=Hertie School of Governance {{!}} Hintergrundinformation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Hertie School of Governance was founded by the [http://www.ghst.de Hertie Foundation], located in [[Frankfurt]]. The school was established in 2003 as one of the first European professional schools for public policy.

In February 2005, the Hertie School was awarded state recognition as college of higher education by the Berlin Ministry of Science, Research, and Culture (Senatsverwaltung für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur). The work of the Hertie School is based on four pillars: Research, Degree Programmes (Master of Public Policy, Master of International Affairs, Executive Master of Public Administration, and the Berlin School for Transnational Studies), Executive Education, and Knowledge Transfer.

In October 2017, the Hertie School once again received full accreditation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/download/archiv/6648-17.pdf|title=Stellungnahme zur Reakkreditierung (Promotionsrecht) der Hertie School of Governance, Berlin|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to confer doctoral degrees for another ten years.[[Image:Hsog-name.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hertie School of Governance]]

==Enrollment==
In September 2017, a total of 586 students were enrolled in the school. This includes 460 master’s students, 68 Executive MPA participants and 58 doctoral students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hertie-school.org/en/who-we-are/facts/|title=Who we are {{!}} Facts and figures|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hertie School of Governance has a highly selective application process.

==Academic programmes==
The [[Master of Public Policy]] (MPP) programme offers teaching on corporate relations &amp; government affairs in the public, civil society and private sectors. The programme is intended for students pursuing a future career dealing professionally with problems of modern governance, international relations, advanced economics and politics. Upon completion of the two-year programme, students receive the Master of Public Policy (MPP). Prospective students have typically studied economics, law or political science, but candidates from every field of study apply for admission.

The Master of International Affairs (MIA) programme, a new programme added in fall 2015, focuses on [[international relations]]. It prepares for positions requiring a profound understanding of today’s global policy challenges.

The Executive Master of [[Public Administration]] (EMPA) programme is aimed at experienced professionals for whom cooperation between government, business and civil society is an important part of their work. Participants in the Executive MPA programme choose an individual area of concentration and can either study full-time over a period of one year or complete the programme over a period of two years if they wish to study part-time while working.

[[File:Digital home ap.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A mid-priced Panasonic Home Theatre in a Box package, which consists of the DVD player, which contains an integrated multi-channel [[power amplifier]], and a set of speakers. The consumer must buy the [[television]] and stand separately.]]
A "'''home theater in a box'''" (HTIB) is an integrated [[home cinema|home theater]] package which "bundles" together a combination  [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray]] player, a multi-channel amplifier (which includes a [[surround sound]] decoder, a [[radio tuner]], and other features), speaker wires, connection cables, a [[remote control]], a set of five or more surround sound speakers (or more rarely, just left and right speakers, a lower-price option known as "2.1") and a low-frequency [[subwoofer]] cabinet.
In 2016,
they are manufactured by most makers of [[consumer electronics]]. Budget HTIB's with generic or lower-price "house" brands (e.g., [[Best Buy]]'s ''Insignia'' line) may be a "2.1" system. Many, however, are a full "[[5.1]]" system and some higher-end packages even have a [[7.1]] system. Some popular manufacturers of HTIB's are [[RCA]], [[Philips]], [[Panasonic]], [[Sony]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[LG Corp|LG]] and [[Samsung]], all of which make a variety of mid-price range packages. [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] and [[Onkyo]] make higher-end, higher-priced HTIB packages.

==Market positioning==
HTIBs are marketed as an "all-in-one" way for consumers to enjoy the [[surround sound]] experience of home cinema, even if they do not want to-or do not have the electronics "know-how" to pick out all of the components one-by-one and connect the cables. If a consumer were to buy all of the items individually, they would have to have a basic knowledge of electronics, so they could, for example, ensure that the speakers were of compatible [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and power-handling for the amplifier. As well, the consumer would have to ensure that they purchased all of the different connection cables, which could include [[HDMI cable]]s, optical connectors, speaker wire, and RCA connectors.

On the downside, most HTIBs lack the features and "tweakability" of [[home cinema|home theater]] components which are sold separately. For example, while a standalone home theater amplifier may offer extensive [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] options, a HTIB amplifier may simply provide a few factory-set EQ presets. As well, while a standalone home theatre subwoofer may contain a range of sound-shaping circuitry, such as a [[Audio crossover|crossover]] control, a phase inversion switch, and a [[parametric equalizer]], a HTIB subwoofer system usually has its crossover point set at the factory, which means that the user cannot change it. In some cases, the factory preset crossover point on an HTIB subwoofer may cause it to sound too "boomy" in a room.

==Features==
A typical HTIB generally consists of a central receiver unit which usually contains a DVD player (some systems separate the DVD player into a separate unit), a multi-channel [[power amplifier]] and a series of speakers for surround sound use, generally including a [[subwoofer]]. Some HTIB systems also have a [[radio tuner]] or an Internet-based streaming audio platform (e.g. [[Spotify]]). The least expensive systems usually have a passive subwoofer, which is amplified by the receiver unit. HTIB systems do not include a [[television set]] or [[video monitor|monitor]] with which to display the visual material or a stand to place the receiver unit on. Beside auxiliary inputs, many of them are equipped today with [[HDMI]] with ARC, optical and [[SPDIF]] inputs. Some HTIB systems are also equipped with a phono input, to allow the connection of a turntable with magnetic cartridge. However such systems are not suitable for vinyl playing as they are mainly focussed on movies and rarely for high fidelity. Some home theaters are just stereo or 2.1, but even so, they are not intended as hi fi, this is just a marketing strategy.

There are systems in this class that are sold without a [[DVD Video|DVD]] player and are designed to integrate with existing video setups where there is already one, such as a DVD recorder or a DVD/VCR combo unit. The speaker cabinets supplied with most systems in this class are generally fairly small compared to typical stereo speakers, and are meant for wall- or shelf-mounting in tight spaces. There are some systems in this class that are supplied with slim freestanding speakers that stand on the floor. This may be typical of higher-priced systems that are equipped with more powerful amplifiers or most of the "receiver-only" packages that do not come with a DVD player.

Some HTIBs use [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] connectors between components, sometimes even combining several different wires into one connector, to reduce cable clutter and increase the ease of installation.  However, this can impede interoperability between different audio/visual devices and makes upgrading certain parts impossible. This may also be used by [[manufacturer]]s to limit what a consumer can do with a low-end model and encourage them to upgrade should they want more autonomy.

A few manufacturers, notably Sony and Panasonic, have implemented wireless connection technology for the [[surround speakers]] in this class of equipment. This technology may be available as standard with some of the high-priced models or may be supplied as an aftermarket kit that only works with selected models in the manufacturer's range. It usually uses a line-level feed over a proprietary wireless link to a separate power amplifier used for the surround-sound channels. This link-receiver and power amplifier can be built into one of the surround speakers or housed in a black box that the surround speakers are connected to. Some higher-end HTIB models offer additional features such as 1080i or 4K ( mainly versions with Blu-ray) video resolution upscaling, a 5-disc platter, HDMI inputs, USB connectivity, Bluetooth support, Wi-fi support, Internet apps, DAB and DAB+, mirroring possibility, iPod dock and a hard disk for recording TV shows.

Some older HTIBs from the 1990s had a built-in VCR, besides a DVD, along with a TV tuner, and a [[hard disk]] for recording TV shows.

{{About|the sketch revue |the book|Settling Accounts: In at the Death}}

'''''In At The Death''''' was a sketch revue performed at The Bush Theatre, London in 1978, most notable for being the first time that future colleagues [[Victoria Wood]] and [[Julie Walters]] would work together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The show is described in Neil Brandwood's biography of Wood as an "alternative theatre company's sketch show about mortality."

After being impressed by Wood's songwriting skills, director Dusty Hughes invited her to be part of a six strong writing team. The topicality of the review was also deemed suitable for her, as she'd just finished writing weekly topical songs on the [[BBC1]] consumer show ''[[That's Life!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers included were [[Ken Campbell]], [[Snoo Wilson]], Ken Hutchinson and Nigel Baldwin. They were asked to write short items based on the weeks newspapers around the theme of death. Campbell took stories from the ''Malaysian New Strait Times'', Baldwin the ''Holyhead and Anglesey Chronicle'', but to be more accessible, Wood drew her inspiration strictly from the tabloids.

Wood wrote six items in the first half of the show, including a requiem for [[Guy the Gorilla]], a song about 'battered wives' (inspired by an article in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' about domestic violence). A song called 'Road Blocks' about a motorcycle accident, and a melancholy number titled '[http://www2.prestel.co.uk/cello/LoveSong.htm Love Song]'. The second half featured a sketch by Wood called 'Dear Mum', about a middle classed woman who refuses to visit her mother in hospital, and also a harrowing song titled 'Abortion.'&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cast was Julie Walters. Having only met Wood briefly eight years before, the two hit it off immediately. Wood also performed in the show, but said later "There was a sketch set in Belfast and I couldn’t do the accent, so they made me a deaf mute." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.prestel.co.uk/cello/LoveSong.htm Love Song/Victoria_Wood.asp|title=Love Song introduction by Victoria Wood|publisher=Robert England|date=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood received much critical acclaim for her work on the show though. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said her songs "successfully blend a gallows humour with an unexpected touch of humanity", and [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] wrote "Victoria Wood's musical epigrams brilliantly embroider the action".

The revue was initially too short, and making up the shortfall, Wood discovered a new talent, writing comedy sketches. The sketch 'Sex' was set in a [[Manchester]] library and starred Walters as a teenage girl who thinks she's pregnant asking Alison Fiske (as the librarian) advice. As almost the only comedy in the show, it came as a welcome relief to the audience and went down extremely well. During the writing process, Wood said she discovered her true voice. "It was the first thing I'd written with proper jokes and I thought "aha!" I'd suddenly found something I could do. It was a blinding flash, like learning a new language." ''[[The Times]]'' said of the sketch that she was a "great discovery" who "got more poetry out of Manchester speech than I had heard for years".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast also included Godfrey Jackman, [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]] and [[Clive Merrison]]. The production ran from 13 July to 6 August 1978.

Due to Wood's acclaim, then theatre director [[David Leland]] commissioned her first play ''[[Talent (1978 play)|Talent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Jeffrey Skolnick''' is an American [[Computational biology|computational biologist]]. He is currently a [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] School of Biology Professor, the Director of the [[Center for the Study of Systems Biology]], the Mary and Maisie Gibson Chair, the [[Georgia Research Alliance]] Eminent Scholar in Computational Systems Biology, the Director of the [[Integrative BioSystems Institute]], and Scientific Advisor at Intellimedix.&lt;ref name=SURA&gt;{{cite news|title=SURA Honors Georgia Tech Biologist as Distinguished Scientist|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-362981673.html|accessdate=3 August 2014|work=Proteomics Weekly|publisher=NewsRX|date=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has focused on the development of computational algorithms and their application to proteomes for the prediction of protein structure and function, the prediction of small molecule ligand-protein interactions with applications to drug discovery,  the prediction of off-target uses of existing drugs, and the exploration of the interplay between protein physics and evolution in determining protein structure and function.

Skolnick is most known for demonstrating that the number of [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor/ligand binding affinity|ligand]] [[Protein#Cell signaling and ligand binding|binding pockets]] in proteins is quite small, thereby justifying the likelihood that large scale drug repurposing will work. This combined with the ability to use predicted as well as experimental structures in virtual ligand screening at higher accuracy and precision than existing approaches will enable FDA approved drugs with novel mechanisms of action to be identified computationally with a high likelihood of experimental success.&lt;ref name=completeness1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Y.|last2=Hubner|first2=I.

== Major Discoveries ==

=== Completeness of the library of protein structures and interactions ===

Skolnick was first to demonstrate that the library of single domain protein structures is likely complete and that the observed folds in nature arise from the confinement of dense polymer chains. He further demonstrated that the confinement of these dense polymer chains plus hydrodynamic interactions were the dominant contributor to diffusive processes in cells. Moreover, that the hydrodynamic interactions introduced large scale temporal and spatial correlations that may have important functional consequences.&lt;ref name=completeness1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=completeness2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Yang|title=Protein structure prediction: when is it useful?|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–155|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2009.02.005|pmc=2673339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saltsman|first1=Kirstie|title=Modeling How Molecules Move Inside Cells|url=http://publications.nigms.nih.gov/computinglife/molecules_move.htm|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ligand homology modeling ===
He also pioneered the field of ligand homology modeling with his threading based, FINDSITE approach for protein function inference, binding site prediction and virtual ligand screening. The research showed that remotely related proteins identified by threading often share a common ligand binding site occupied by chemically similar ligands that contain strongly conserved anchor functional groups as well as a variable region that accounts for their binding specificity. These insights enable low-resolution predicted structures to be used for ligand screening/binding pose prediction, with comparable accuracy as with high-resolution experimental structures. In virtual ligand screening, the latest version, FINDSITEcomb, was shown to work far better than more traditional virtual screening approaches on both predicted and high resolution experimental structures.&lt;ref name=findsite&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brylinski|first1=M.|last2=Skolnick|first2=J.|title=A threading-based method (FINDSITE) for ligand-binding site prediction and functional annotation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=28 December 2007|volume=105|issue=1|pages=129–134|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707684105|pmid=18165317|pmc=2224172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karypis|first1=George|last2=Rangwala|first2=Huzefa|title=Introduction to Protein Structure Prediction: Methods and Algorithms|date=March 16, 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons,|isbn=1-118-09946-X|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TASSER protein structure prediction ===
He also developed the TASSER protein structure prediction approach, whose variants are the top performers in [[CASP]] and the basis for the [[I-TASSER]] service.

Skolnick's Ph.D. thesis " “Investigations on a Rod Like Polyelectrolyte Model", along with Fixman and Odijk, developed a theory for the electrostatic persistence length in polyelectrolytes now known as the [[Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman electrostatic persistence length]] which is still considered the classical benchmark.&lt;ref name=thesis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skolnick|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Fixman|first2=Marshall|title=Electrostatic Persistence Length of a Wormlike Polyelectrolyte|journal=Macromolecules|volume=10|issue=5|pages=944–948|doi=10.1021/ma60059a011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dias|first1=Rita|last2=Lindman|first2=Bjorn|title=DNA Interactions with Polymers and Surfactants|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons,|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Skolnick graduated Summa Cum Laude from Washington University in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry. After Washington University, he moved on to Yale where he graduated with a Master of Philosophy in Chemistry in 1977 and a Ph.D. in Chemistry just one year later in 1978.

His Ph.D. thesis, “Investigations on a Rod Like Polyelectrolyte Model”, focused on polymer statistical mechanics with Dr. Marshall Fixman. The methods described by Skolnick and Fixman and independently developed by Theo Odijk are still used as the basis for the electrostatic persistence length of polyelectrolytes.&lt;ref name=thesis /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1665">A '''leaf scar''' is the mark left by a [[leaf]] after it falls off the twig. It marks the site where the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] attached to the [[Plant stem|stem]]. A leaf scar is typically found below a branch as branches come from [[axillary bud]]s located above leaf scars.[[File:20150228Ailanthus altissima1.jpg|thumb|The leaf scar on [[Ailanthus altissima]]]]

==Formation==
Leaf scars are formed naturally, often at the end of the growing season for [[deciduous]] plants when a layer of cells called the abscissa layer forms between the petiole and stem.  The [[abscission]] layer acts as a point of cleavage and the leaf breaks off leaving a cleanly shaped wound that is quickly healed over with protective cork. [[Stipule]]s may also leave their own scars if they are present.&lt;ref name=osu&gt;{{cite web|title=Winter twigs|url=http://osupress.oregonstate.edu/book/winter-twigs/intro|website=Oregon state university|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bundle scars==
Bundle scars are circular or barred regions within the leaf scar where bundles of vascular tissue that had connected the leaf and the stem broke off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dirr|first1=Michael Illustrations by Bonnie Dirr|title=Manual of woody landscape plants.|date=1990|location=[S.l.|isbn=0-87563-344-7|edition=4. ed., rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bundle scars in a leaf scar is sometimes used as an identifying mark as they are often consistent across a species.

(born 22 September 1944) is a [[Roman catholic priest]] and [[Franciscan]] [[Old Testament]] scholar with a focus on [[Deuteronomy]] and Deuteronomic literature and is an expert in [[biblical studies]]. He is Carroll Stuhlmueller Distinguished Professor of Old Testament Studies at [[Catholic Theological Union]]&lt;ref name=CTUprofile&gt;{{cite web |title=Leslie J. Hoppe, OFM |url=https://ctu.edu/faculty/leslie-hoppe/ |website=Catholic Theological Union |publisher=Catholic Theological Union Faculty |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Chicago and the general editor of the refereed theological journal [[Catholic Biblical Quarterly]].

Between 2015-2016, he served as President of the [[Catholic Biblical Association]] and has also served as the President of the [[Chicago Society of Biblical Research]] and was visting professor at [[Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary]], [[Studium Biblicum Franciscanum]], and [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]]. He has served on the editorial board of [[The Bible Today]] and [[Old Testament Abstracts]], previously being the general editor of the former.

==Education==

Hoppe first received his M.A. in Theology from the [[Aquinas Institute of Theology]] and then went on to receive a Ph.D. in Religion from [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref name=CTUprofile /&gt;

== Career ==

Hoppe joined and has been on the faculty of Catholic Theological Union (CTU) since 1981. Since then, he has authored many books on the Old Testament and [[biblical archaeology]] and has served in many archaeological projects in [[Upper Galilee]] as well as being the director of the fall study program of CTU in [[Jerusalem]] and lead its first Holy Land Pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Registration deadline for Holy Land pilgrimage extended to Oct. 6, ''US Catholic Magazine''. Retrieved 21 August 2018. [https://www.uscatholic.org/HolyLand2015 Link]&lt;/ref&gt; He has written a number of scholarly articles and books, including ''The Holy City: Jerusalem in the Theology of the Old Testament'' (2000) and was one of the archaeologists to work on the hypothesis of a [[House of Peter]] at [[Capernaum]].&lt;ref&gt;Meier, John P. A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, Volume V: Probing the Authenticity of the Parables. Yale University Press, 2009: pg. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; He has written for [[America (magazine)|America Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/culture/gospel-truth/ The Gospel Truth]. Retrieved 21 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and has outlined his views on the Bible in an interview with US Catholic magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uscatholic.org/HoppeInterview/ A primer on the Old Testament]. Retrieved 21 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been noted by the [[National Catholic Register]] for his support of the [[Dei verbum]] to Catholic life and scripture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/dei-verbum-moved-the-bible-to-the-center-of-catholic-life/ ‘Dei Verbum’ ‘Moved the Bible to the Center of Catholic Life’]&lt;/ref&gt; and believes the question of archaeology is separate from belief in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiensy, David A.

'''Minatec''' (initially called the '''Mi'''cro and '''Na'''no'''tec'''hnology Innovation Centre) is a vast complex specializing in [[Nanotechnology|micro-nano technologies]] in [[Grenoble]], [[France]]. 

The centre was launched in June 2006 as a partnership between '''[[CEA-Leti: Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information|LETI]]''' (the Electronics and Information Technologies Laboratory of [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|CEA]], the French Atomic Energy Commission) and by [[Grenoble Institute of Technology]]. The site was already home to LETI, Europe's top centre for applied research in microelectronics and nanotechnology. Minatec combines a physical research campus with a network of companies, researchers and engineering schools. It was launched to foster technology transfer, with real-life applications in energy and communications, among others.
 
The complex is home to 3,000 researchers, 1,200 students, and 600 technology transfer experts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minatec.com/en/minatec&lt;/ref&gt;  on a state-of-the-art 20-hectare campus offering 10,000 square metres for [[cleanroom]] space.

The Minatec campus has dedicated special-events facilities (900 m²), ranging from 20-person conference rooms to a 400-seat amphitheater. These spaces are available to researchers for their scientific events such as the international conference Nanosafe held every two years since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.materials.cea.fr/Phocea/Vie_des_labos/Seminaires/index.php?id=36 Fifth Nanosafe International Conference - Nanosafe 2016 - MINATEC, Grenoble, France.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''N,N&amp;prime;''-Diisopropylcarbodiimide''' is a [[carbodiimide]] used in [[peptide synthesis]]. As a liquid, it is easier to handle than the commonly used [[Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|''N,N&amp;prime;''-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide]], a waxy solid. In addition, [[Urea#Related_compounds | N,N'-diisopropylurea]], the byproduct of its use in many chemical reactions, is soluble in most [[organic solvents]], a property that facilitates [[Work-up (chemistry)|work-up]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1105">'''Natural lines of drift''' are those paths across terrain that are the most likely to be used when going from one place to another.  These paths are [[Path of least resistance|paths of least resistance]]: those that offer the greatest ease while taking into account obstacles (e.g. rivers, cliffs, dense unbroken woodland, etc.) and modes of transit (e.g. pedestrian, automobile, horses.).  Common endpoints or fixed points may include water sources, food sources, and obstacle passages such as fords or bridges.

Local paths may be derived from game trails or from artificial paths created by utility lines or political boundaries.  Property ownership and land use may also be factors in determining local variation.

Improved paths may also be partially defined by the logistics necessary to build roads or railways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5111">'''Nestedness''' is a measure of structure in an [[ecosystem|ecological system]], usually applied to species-sites systems (describing the distribution of species across locations), or species-species interaction networks (describing the interactions between species, usually as bipartite networks such as hosts-parasites, plants-pollinators, etc.).

A system (usually represented as a matrix) is said to be nested when the elements that have a few items in them (locations with few species, species with few interactions) have a subset of the items of elements with more items. Imagine a series of islands that are ordered by their distance from the mainland. If the mainland has all species, the first island has a subset of mainland's species, the second island has a subset of the first island's species, and so forth, then this system is perfectly nested.

==Measures of nestedness==
One measurement unit for nestedness is a system's '[[temperature]]' offered by Atmar and Patterson in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patterson and Atmar |year=1993 |title=The measure of order and disorder in the distribution of species in fragmented habitat |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=96 |pages=373–382 |doi=10.1007/BF00317508 |last2=Patterson |first2=Bruce D. |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measures the order in which species' extinctions would occur in the system (or from the other side - the order of colonizing a system). The 'colder' the system is, the more fixed the order of extinction would be. In a warmer system, extinctions will take a more random order. Temperatures go from 0°, coldest and absolutely fixed, to 100° absolutely random.

For various reasons, the Nestedness Temperature Calculator is not mathematically satisfying (no unique solution, not conservative enough).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rodríguez-Gironés MA, Santamaría L |year=2006 |title=A new algorithm to calculate the nestedness temperature of presence–absence matrices |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=33|pages=924–935 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01444.x|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Guimarães, P. R. , P. Guimarães |year=2006 |title=Improving the analyses of nestedness for large sets of matrices |journal=Environmental Modelling and Software |volume=21|pages=1512–1513 |doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.04.002|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A software (BINMATNEST) is available from the authors on request and from the Journal of Biogeography to correct these deficits &lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01444.x#suppl.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ANINHADO solves problems of large matrix size and processing of a large number of randomized matrices; in addition it implements several null models to estimate the significance of nestedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.04.002 | volume=21 | title=Improving the analyses of nestedness for large sets of matrices | journal=Environmental Modelling | pages=1512–1513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iemss.org/shortcom/software/software.php?aid=201&lt;/ref&gt;

Bastolla ''et al.'' introduced a simple measure of nestedness based on the number of common neighbours for each pair of nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bastolla U, Fortuna MA, Pascual-García A, Ferrera A, Luque B, Bascompte J |year=2009 |title=The architecture of mutualistic networks minimizes competition and increases biodiversity |journal=Nature |volume=458 |pages=1018–1020 |doi=10.1038/nature07950 |pmid=19396144}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that this can help reduce the effective competition between nodes in certain situations. For instance, two insect species might "help" each other by pollinating the same subset of plants, thereby reducing the extent to which they are harmful to each other. The authors suggest that this effect is behind a correlation between nestedness and diversity in plant-pollinator ecosystems. However, Johnson ''et al.'' have shown that this measure does not, in fact, properly account for the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Domínguez-García V, Muñoz MA |year=2013 |title=Factors Determining Nestedness in Complex Networks |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |pages=e74025 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0074025}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors propose a refined version of the measure, and go on to show how certain network properties affect nestedness.

[[Image:Serous carcinoma 2a - cytology.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[micrograph]] showing cells with marked nuclear shape and size variation, a component of nuclear '''pleomorphism'''.]]

'''Pleomorphism''' is a term used in [[histology]] and [[cytopathology]] to describe variability in the size, shape and [[staining]] of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and/or their [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]. 

It is a feature characteristic of [[malignant neoplasms]], and dysplasia. Certain [[benign]] cell types may have pleomorphism, e.g. [[neuroendocrine cell]]s, [[Arias-Stella reaction]].

In [[Buddhist studies]], particularly East Asian Buddhist studies, '''post-canonical Buddhist texts''', '''Buddhist apocrypha''' or '''Spurious Sutras and Sastras''' designate texts that are not accepted as canonical by some historical Buddhist schools or communities who referred to a [[Tripitaka|canon]]. The term is principally applied to texts that purport to represent Buddhist teaching translated from Indian texts, but were written in East Asia.{{sfn|Muller|1998|p=63}}&lt;ref name="李学竹"&gt;李学竹.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4991">[[File:Real-Time Control Systems Library 2.png|thumb|320px|Real-Time Control Systems Software.]]The '''Real-time Control System''' ('''RCS''') is a [[software system]] developed by [[NIST]] based on the [[Real-time Control System]] Reference Model Architecture, that implements a generic [[Hierarchical control system]]. The RCS Software Library is an archive of free C++, Java and Ada code, scripts, tools, makefiles, and documentation developed to aid programmers of software to be used in [[Embedded system|real-time control system]]s (especially those using the Reference Model Architecture for Intelligent Systems Design).&lt;ref name="NIST09"&gt;[http://www.isd.mel.nist.gov/projects/rcslib/index.html Real-Time Control Systems Library –– Software and Documentation] at nist.gov. Accessed Aug 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
RCS has been used in automated manufacturing, robotics, and automated vehicle research at NIST.  The software consists of a C++ library and GUI and configuration tools written a variety of software languages. The Software Library is offering the following RCS tools:&lt;ref name="NIST09"/&gt;
* ''RCS Java-based Diagnostics Tool'' : A tool written as a java applet that allows programmers to see the status and send commands to any RCS module.
* ''RCS Java-based Diagnostics Tool Instructions'' : Instructions on how to build applications for use with the diagnostics tool.
* ''RCS-Design Tool'' : A tool written as a java applet that allows programmers to create RCS applications graphically and generates source code.
* ''RCS-Design Tool Instructions'' : Instructions on how to build applications with the RCS-Design tool.
* ''RCS Data Plotter'' : A Java applet which plots data on a cartesian or polar graph, read either in real-time or from a text file.
* ''Socket Interface to NML'' : ''Describes how to connect to an NML server using sockets directly. This information should also be useful for other languages where the C++ NML client interface is not available.''
* ''RCS Posemath Library'' : A library of classes for representing positions, rotations, and translations in a variety of coordinate systems and the functions to add/subtract/multiply/divide/convert them. For more info on posemath you may also want to check out: Karl Murphy's Posemath Examples
* ''RCS Library Lower Level Utilities'' : Describes many of the lower level utilities used to create the NODE, CMS, and NML components of the RCS Library but which may be useful on their own. Includes timers, semaphores, linked-lists, printing, and windows functions.
* ''RCS Library Installation Instructions'' : Provides instructions for getting and making the RCS Library.
* ''RCS Library Version Functions'' : Documentation for some functions for determining at run-time which version of the RCS library your using.

== RCS applications ==
* [[Robocrane]] - RCS controlled a [[crane (machine)|crane]] having six [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. It incorporated tactile, proximity and vision [[sensors]].
* Next Generation Inspection System - RCS controlled a [[Coordinate Measuring Machine]], with sensors including analog touch probes, video camera, and [[laser rangefinder]].
*Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles - RCS controlled a group of [[autonomous vehicle]]s, at a high level coordinating their movements, and a low level controlling their steering, throttle and brakes.  Sensors included an [[Inertial navigation system]] and [[differential GPS]].
* [[The Enhanced Machine Controller|Enhanced Machine Controller]], or EMC - an NIST research project in [[CNC]] software that uses RCS.

'''''Religion''''' is a peer-reviewed [[academic journal]] in the field of [[Religious studies|Religious Studies]]. It was founded in 1971, with close ties to the Religious Studies program at the [[Lancaster University|University of Lancaster]]. That program was founded and chaired by [[Ninian Smart]], and he served as the Chairman of the first editorial board. Four companies have published the journal over the years: Oriel Press (1971–72), [[Routledge|Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul]] (1973–80), [[Academic Press]] (1981–2000), [[Elsevier]] (2001–2010), and currently [[Routledge]].

''Religion'' publishes academic work on all issues of Religious Studies, including the history, literature, thought, practise, material culture, and institutions of particular religious traditions from a variety of perspectives such as social scientific, humanistic, cognitive, economical, geographical, etc. (but excluding work that falls purely within the areas of theology or philosophy of religion). The journal has European and North-American editors (currently [[Michael Stausberg]] and [[Steven Engler]]) and a multi-national Editorial Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=rrel20 Publisher site]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;|width=390|caption=The [[A minor]] melodic minor scale, ascending and descending}}In [[music theory]], a '''scale''' is any set of musical [[note (music)|notes]] ordered by [[fundamental frequency]] or [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a  descending scale. Some scales contain different pitches when ascending than when descending, for example, the [[melodic minor scale]].

Often, especially in the context of the [[common practice period]], most or all of the [[melody]] and [[harmony]] of a [[musical work]] is built using the notes of a single scale, which can be conveniently represented on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] with a standard [[key signature]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward, Bruce and Saker, Marilyn Nadine (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', seventh edition: vol. 1, p. 25. Boston: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the principle of [[octave]] equivalence, scales are generally considered to span a single octave, with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern. A musical scale represents a division of the octave space into a certain number of scale steps, a scale step being the recognizable distance (or [[interval (music)|interval]]) between two successive notes of the scale.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Michael (2013). ''Musical Scales of the World'', pp. 2–3. The Note Tree. {{ISBN|978-0-9575470-0-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no need for scale steps to be equal within any scale and, particularly as demonstrated by [[microtonal music]], there is no limit to how many notes can be injected within any given musical interval.

A measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales. For instance, in a chromatic scale each scale step represents a [[semitone]] interval, while a [[major scale]] is defined by the interval pattern T–T–S–T–T–T–S, where T stands for [[whole tone]] (an interval spanning two semitones), and S stands for semitone. Based on their interval patterns, scales are put into categories including [[diatonic scale|diatonic]], [[chromatic scale|chromatic]], [[major scale|major]], [[minor scale|minor]], and others.

A specific scale is defined by its characteristic interval pattern and by a special note, known as its first [[Degree (music)|degree]] (or [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]). The tonic of a scale is the note selected as the beginning of the octave, and therefore as the beginning of the adopted interval pattern. Typically, the name of the scale specifies both its tonic and its interval pattern. For example, [[C major]] indicates a major scale with a C tonic.

==Background==

===Scales, steps, and intervals===
[[File:Major scale in the chromatic circle.png|thumb|Diatonic scale in the [[chromatic circle]]]]

Scales are typically listed from low to high pitch. Most scales are ''[[octave]]-repeating'', meaning their pattern of notes is the same in every octave (the [[Bohlen–Pierce scale]] is one exception). An octave-repeating scale can be represented as a circular arrangement of pitch classes, ordered by increasing (or decreasing) pitch class. For instance, the increasing C major scale is C–D–E–F–G–A–B–[C], with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note, and the decreasing C major scale is C–B–A–G–F–E–D–[C], with the bracket indicating an octave lower than the first note in the scale.

The distance between two successive notes in a scale is called a [[Degree (music)|scale step]].

The notes of a scale are numbered by their steps from the root of the scale. For example, in a C major scale the first note is C, the second D, the third E and so on. Two notes can also be numbered in relation to each other: C and E create an interval of a third (in this case a major third); D and F also create a third (in this case a minor third).

===Pitch===
A single scale can be manifested at many different pitch levels. For example, a C major scale can be started at C4 (middle C; see [[scientific pitch notation]]) and ascending an octave to C5; or it could be started at C6, ascending an octave to C7. As long as all the notes can be played, the [[octave]] they take on can be altered.

===Types of scale===
{{Image frame|content=&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {

  \clef treble \time 12/4

  }
}
&lt;/score&gt;|width=350|caption=The [[chromatic scale]], ascending}}Scales may be described according to the number of different pitch classes they contain:

* [[chromatic scale|Chromatic]], or dodecatonic (12 notes per octave)
* [[octatonic scale|Octatonic]] (8 notes per octave): used in [[jazz]] and [[modernism (music)|modern classical music]]
* [[heptatonic scale|Heptatonic]] (7 notes per octave): the most common modern Western scale
* [[hexatonic scale|Hexatonic]] (6 notes per octave): common in Western folk music
* [[pentatonic scale|Pentatonic]] (5 notes per octave): the anhemitonic form (lacking semitones) is common in folk music, especially in Asian music; also known as the "black note" scale
* [[tetratonic scale|Tetratonic]] (4 notes), [[tritonic scale|tritonic]] (3 notes), and [[ditonic scale|ditonic]] (2 notes): generally limited to [[prehistoric music|prehistoric]] ("primitive") music
* [[monotonic scale|Monotonic]] (1 note): limited use in liturgy, and for effect in modern art music{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;!--Monotonicity is not controversial, but who claims there is such a thing as a "monotonic scale"?--&gt;

Scales may also be described by their constituent intervals, such as being [[hemitonia|hemitonic]], [[cohemitonia|cohemitonic]], or having imperfections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthescales.org/intro.html#Perfection|title=All The Scales|author=|date=|website=www.allthescales.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015071228/http://allthescales.org/intro.html#Perfection|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many music theorists concur that the constituent intervals of a scale have a large role in the cognitive perception of its sonority, or tonal character.

"The number of the notes that make up a scale as well as the quality of the intervals between successive notes of the scale help to give the music of a culture area its peculiar sound quality."&lt;ref&gt;Nzewi, Meki, and Odyke Nzewi (2007), ''A Contemporary Study of Musical Arts''. Pretoria: Centre for Indigenous Instrumental African Music and Dance. Volume 1 p. 34 {{ISBN|978-1-920051-62-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The pitch distances or intervals among the notes of a scale tell us more about the sound of the music than does the mere number of tones."&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno, and Helen Myers (1976). ''Folk Music in the United States'', p.39. {{ISBN|978-0-8143-1557-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scales may also be described by their symmetry, such as being [[palindrome|palindromic]], [[Chirality|chiral]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/#chirality {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330211555/https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |date=30 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, or having rotational symmetry as in Messaien's [[modes of limited transposition]]. 

Scales can also be described by their distribution patterns and possibilities for notation. For example, a [[heliotonic]] scale is one that can be notated with one note head on each line and space, using only single and double alterations (flats, double-flats, sharps, and double-sharps). Thus all heliotonic scales are [[heptatonic scale|heptatonic]], but not all heptatonic scales are heliotonic. Since heliotonia is a metric of a scale's tone distribution pattern, is related to evenness, coherence, spectra variation, and the [[Generic_and_specific_intervals|Myhill Property]].

===Harmonic content===
The notes of a scale form intervals with each of the other notes of the chord in [[combination]].  A 5-note scale has 10 of these [[Harmony|harmonic]] intervals, a 6-note scale has 15, a 7-note scale has 21, an 8-note scale has 28.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', pp.7ff. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the scale is not a [[Chord (music)|chord]], and might never be heard more than one note at a time, still the absence, presence, and placement of certain [[key (music)|key]] intervals plays a large part in the sound of the scale, the natural movement of melody within the scale, and the selection of [[Chord (music)|chords]] taken naturally from the scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A musical scale that contains [[tritone]]s is called tritonic (though the expression is also used for any scale with just three notes per octave, whether or not it includes a tritone), and one without tritones is ''atritonic''.  A scale or [[Chord (music)|chord]] that contains semitones is called hemitonic, and without semitones is [[Anhemitonic scale|anhemitonic]].

===Scales in composition===
Scales can be abstracted from [[performance]] or [[musical composition|composition]]. They are also often used [[precompositional]]ly to guide or limit a composition. Explicit instruction in scales has been part of compositional training for many centuries. One or more scales may be used in a composition, such as in [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[L'Isle Joyeuse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Western music==
{{See also|Musical mode}}
Scales in [[European classical music|traditional Western music]] generally consist of seven notes and repeat at the octave. Notes in the commonly used scales (see just below) are separated by [[Music Terminology|whole and half step]] [[interval (music)|intervals]] of ''tones'' and ''semitones.'' The harmonic minor scale includes a three-semitone step; the anhemitonic pentatonic includes two of those and no semitones.

Western music in the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] periods (1100–1600) tends to use the white-note [[diatonic scale]] C–D–E–F–G–A–B. [[Accidental (music)|Accidentals]] are rare, and somewhat unsystematically used, often to avoid the [[tritone]].

Music of the common practice periods (1600–1900) uses three types of scale:
* The [[diatonic scale]] (seven notes)—this includes the major scale and the natural minor
* The melodic and harmonic [[minor scale]]s (seven notes)

These scales are used in all of their transpositions. The music of this period introduces ''modulation,'' which involves systematic changes from one scale to another. Modulation occurs in relatively conventionalized ways. For example, major-mode pieces typically begin in a "tonic" diatonic scale and modulate to the "dominant" scale a fifth above.{{Image frame|content=&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {

\relative c' {

} }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=The [[whole tone scale]] starting on F, ascending}}In the 19th century (to a certain extent), but more in the 20th century, additional types of scales were explored:

* The [[chromatic scale]] (twelve notes)
* The [[whole tone scale|whole-tone scale]] (six notes)
* The [[pentatonic scale]] (five notes)
* The octatonic or [[diminished scale]]s (eight notes)

  \clef treble \time 7/4
  c4 d es fis g aes b c2
} }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=The [[Hungarian minor scale]] starting on C, ascending}}A large variety of other scales exists, some of the more common being:

* The [[Phrygian dominant scale]] (a mode of the harmonic minor scale)
* The [[Arabic maqam|Arabic scales]]
* The [[Hungarian minor scale]]
* The [[Byzantine music]] scales (called echoi)
* The [[Persian scale]]
Scales such as the pentatonic scale may be considered ''gapped'' relative to the diatonic scale. An ''auxiliary scale'' is a scale other than the primary or original scale. See: [[modulation (music)]] and [[Petrushka chord|Auxiliary diminished scale]].

==Note names==
In many musical circumstances, a specific note of the scale is chosen as the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]—the central and most stable note of the scale. In Western tonal music, simple songs or pieces typically start and end on the tonic note. Relative to a choice of a certain tonic, the notes of a scale are often labeled with numbers recording how many scale steps above the tonic they are. For example, the notes of the C [[major scale]] (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) can be labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, reflecting the choice of C as tonic. The expression [[scale degree]] refers to these numerical labels. Such labeling requires the choice of a "first" note; hence scale-degree labels are not intrinsic to the scale itself, but rather to its modes. For example, if we choose A as tonic, then we can label the notes of the C major scale using A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, and so on. When we do so, we create a new scale called the A [[minor scale]]. See the [[musical note]] article for how the notes are customarily named in different countries.

The scale degrees of a heptatonic (7-note) scale can also be named using the terms [[tonic (music)|tonic]], [[supertonic]], [[mediant]], [[subdominant]], [[Dominant (music)|dominant]], [[submediant]], [[subtonic]]. If the subtonic is a semitone away from the tonic, then it is usually called the [[leading-tone]] (or leading-note); otherwise the leading-tone refers to the raised subtonic. Also commonly used is the (movable do) [[Solfège#Movable do solfège|solfège]] naming convention in which each scale degree is denoted by a syllable. In the major scale, the solfège syllables are: do, re, mi, fa, so (or sol), la, ti (or si), do (or ut).

In naming the notes of a scale, it is customary that each scale degree be assigned its own letter name: for example, the A major scale is written A–B–C{{music|sharp}}–D–E–F{{music|sharp}}–G{{music|sharp}} rather than A–B–D{{music|flat}}–D–E–E{{music|doublesharp}}–G{{music|sharp}}. However, it is impossible to do this in scales that contain more than seven notes, at least in the English-language nomenclature system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;!--Who says it is not possible to name notes with letters of the alphabet following G? German nomenclature, at least, uses eight letters, A through H.--&gt;

Scales may also be identified by using a binary system of twelve zeros or ones to represent each of the twelve notes of a [[chromatic scale]]. It is assumed that the scale is tuned using [[12-tone equal temperament]] (so that, for instance, C{{Music|sharp}} is the same as D{{Music|flat}}), and that the tonic is in the leftmost position. For example, the [[binary number]] 101011010101, equivalent to the [[decimal number]] 2773, would represent any major scale (such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B). This system includes scales from 100000000000 (2048) to 111111111111 (4095), providing a total of 2048 possible [[Combinatorial species|species]], but only 351 unique scales containing from 1 to 12 notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A more mathematically flexible schema for binary representation, espoused by theorist Ian Ring in his study of musical scales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ring |first=Ian |title=A Study of Scales |url=http://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |publisher=Ian Ring |access-date=18 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106060403/https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |archivedate=6 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; has bits representing ascending tones, with the smaller bits representing lower pitches and higher bits representing higher pitches. This causes the bits to appear reversed compared with Duncan's system. Under this schema, a major scale is 101010110101 = (2741), a single root tone is 1, and a chromatic scale is still 111111111111 (4095). All the tone possibilities that begin with a root tone, and are thus scale-like, are odd-numbered.

Scales may also be shown as [[semitones]] from the tonic. For instance, 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 denotes any major scale such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B, in which the first degree is, obviously, 0 semitones from the tonic (and therefore coincides with it), the second is 2 semitones from the tonic, the third is 4 semitones from the tonic, and so on. Again, this implies that the notes are drawn from a chromatic scale tuned with 12-tone equal temperament. For some fretted string instruments, such as the guitar and the [[bass guitar]], scales can be notated in [[tabulature]], an approach which indicates the fret number and string upon which each scale degree is played.

==Transposition and modulation==
{{confusing section|reason=transposition and modulation are different; first sentence introduces yet another term 'transform'; explanation then confuses all these|date=August 2018}}
Composers transform musical patterns by moving every note in the pattern by a constant number of scale steps: thus, in the [[C major]] scale, the pattern C–D–E might be shifted up, or [[transposition (music)|transposed]], a single scale step to become D–E–F. This process is called "scalar transposition" or "shifting to a new key" and can often be found in [[sequence (music)|musical sequences]] and patterns. (It is D-E-F# in Chromatic transposition). Since the steps of a scale can have various sizes, this process introduces subtle melodic and harmonic variation into the music. In Western tonal music, the simplest and most common type of modulation (or changing keys) is to shift from one major key to another key built on the first key's fifth (or dominant) scale degree. In the key of C major, this would involve moving to the key of G major (which uses an F#). Composers also often modulate to other related keys. In some [[Romantic music era]] pieces and contemporary music, composers modulate to "remote keys" that are not related to or close to the tonic. An example of a remote modulation would be taking a song that begins in C major and modulating (changing keys) to F# major.

==Jazz and blues==
{{See also|Jazz scales}}{{Image frame|content=&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c' { 
  \clef treble \time 6/4
  c4 es f fis g bes c2
} }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=A hexatonic [[blues scale]] on C, ascending}}Through the introduction of [[blue note]]s, jazz and [[blues]] employ scale intervals smaller than a semitone. The blue note is an [[interval (music)|interval]] that is technically neither [[major and minor|major nor minor]] but "in the middle", giving it a characteristic flavour. A regular [[piano]] cannot play blue notes, but with [[electric guitar]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]] and [[trumpet]], performers can "bend" notes a fraction of a tone sharp or flat to create blue notes For instance, in the key of E, the blue note would be either a note between G and G{{music|sharp}} or a note moving between both. 

In blues, a [[pentatonic scale]] is often used. In jazz, many different [[musical mode|modes]] and scales are used, often within the same piece of music. Chromatic scales are common, especially in modern jazz.

==Non-Western scales==
===Equally tempered===
In Western music, scale notes are often separated by [[Equal temperament]] tones or semitones, creating 12 intervals per octave each separating two tones where the higher tone has a oscillation frequency of a fixed ratio (by a factor equal to the twelfth root of two, or approximately 1.059463) higher than the frequency of the lower one. A scale uses a subset consisting typically of 7 of these 12 as scale steps. Other traditional tempered scale systems divide the octave to equal intervals by numbers other than 12. Examples are 53 in the [[Middle East]], and 72 in southern [[India]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Other===
Many other musical traditions use scales that include other intervals. These scales originate within the derivation of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. [[Interval (music)|Musical intervals]] are complementary values of the [[harmonic]] [[overtone]]s series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furious.com/perfect/experimentalstringinstruments.html Explanation of the origin of musical scales clarified by a string division method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824020439/http://www.furious.com/perfect/experimentalstringinstruments.html |date=24 August 2012 }} by [[Yuri Landman]] on furious.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many musical scales in the world are based on this system, except most of the musical scales from [[Indonesia]] and the [[Indochina]] Peninsulae, which are based on inharmonic resonance of the dominant metalophone and xylophone instruments.

===Intra-scale intervals===
Some scales use a different number of pitches. A common scale in Eastern music is the pentatonic scale, which consists of five notes that span an octave.

Some scales span part of an octave; Several such short scales are typically combined to form a scale spanning a full octave or more, and usually called with a third name of its own. The Middle Eastern music has around a dozen such basic short scales that are combined to form hundreds of full-octave spanning scales. Among these middle eastern scales [[Hejaz scale]] has one scale step spanning 14 intervals (of the middle eastern type found 53 in an octave) roughly similar to 3 semitones (of the western type found 12 in an octave), while [[Saba scale]], another of these middle eastern scales, has 3 consecutive scale steps within 14 commas, i.e. separated by roughly one western semitone either side of the middle tone.

[[Gamelan]] music uses a small variety of scales including [[Pélog]] and [[Sléndro]], none including equally tempered nor harmonic intervals. [[Indian classical music]] uses a moveable [[swara|seven-note scale]]. Indian [[Rāga]]s often use intervals smaller than a semitone.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Edwaard M. 1998. "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning.", p.247. In ''The Psychology of Music'', second edition, edited by Diana Deutsch, 215–64. New York: Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-213564-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic music]] [[Arabic maqam|maqamat]] may use [[quarter tone]] intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Zonis [Mahler], Ella. 1973. ''Classical Persian Music: An Introduction''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2014}} In both rāgas and maqamat, the distance between a note and an inflection (e.g., [[Śruti (music)|śruti]]) of that same note may be less than a semitone.

The '''Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center''' (SEAFDEC) is an autonomous [[Intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental]] body established as a regional treaty organisation in 1967 to promote [[fisheries]] development in Southeast Asia. SEAFDEC aims specifically to develop the fishery potentials in the region through training, research and information services to improve the food supply by rational utilisation and development of the fisheries resources. Its services cover the broad areas of fishing gear technology, marine engineering, fishing ground surveys and stock assessment, post-harvest technology as well as development and improvement of aquaculture techniques. SEAFDEC is currently made up of 11 Member Countries, namely [[Brunei]] Darussalam, [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Laos|Lao]] PDR, [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]], and has the Council of Directors, composed of nominees from Member Countries, as policy-making body to provide directives and guidance on activities of the Center.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Secbuild.jpg]] --&gt;
The Center has a Secretariat as its administrative arm, and four technical Departments, namely the Training Department (TD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafdec.or.th SEAFDEC training]&lt;/ref&gt; in Thailand, the Marine Fisheries Research Department (MFRD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishsafetyinfo.com SEAFDEC network]&lt;/ref&gt; in Singapore, the Aquaculture Department (AQD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafdec.org.ph SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Philippines, and the Marine Fishery Resources Development and Management Department (MFRDMD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafdec.org.my SEAFDEC in Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt; in Malaysia, Inland Fishery Resources Development and Management Department (IFRDMD) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafdec.or.id SEAFDEC in Indonesian]&lt;/ref&gt; in Indonesian

The chief administrator of SEAFDEC is the Secretary-General (Dr.Chumnarn Pongsri) whose various responsibilities are directed towards the unification of the activities of the four Departments. In ensuring effective implementation of SEAFDEC program of activities in close co-ordination with the Member Countries, each country also nominates a National Coordinator to co-ordinate issues and activities with SEAFDEC and within the country as well.

(2008) Satellite imaging and vector-borne diseases: the approach of the French National Space Agency (CNES). Geospatial Health 3(1), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Internet-based applications of tele-epidemiology include sourcing of epidemiological data in generating internet reports and [[Real-time data|real-time]] [[Spatial epidemiology|disease mapping]]. This entails gathering and [[structuring]] epidemiological data from news and [[social media]] outlets, and [[Cartography|mapping]] or reporting this data for application with research or public health organizations. Examples of such applications include [[HealthMap]] and [[ProMED-mail]], two [[Web service|web-based services]] that map and e-mail global cases of disease outbreak, respectively.&lt;ref name="keller"&gt;Keller, M., Blench, M., Tolentino, H., Freifeld, C.C., Mandl, K.D., Mawudeku, A., Eysenbach, G., Brownstein, J.S. (2009) Use of unstructured event-based reports for global infectious disease. Emerging Infectious Diseases 15(5), 689-695.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] often refers generally to [[telehealth]] for applications linking communication and information technologies such as [[telesurgery]] and [[telenursing]], to [[healthcare administration]].

== Clinical applications==
*Provides real-time information about disease prevalence across populations to public health, physicians and citizens, globally.&lt;ref name="marechael" /&gt;
*Diminishes [[communicable disease]] risk by mobilizing local medical efforts to respond to disease outbreaks, especially in vulnerable populations.&lt;ref name="marechael" /&gt;
*Enhances the ability of managing the  proliferation of communicable [[pathogens]].&lt;ref name="marechael" /&gt;
*Can be used as a management tool in public health to discover, assess, and act on [[epidemiological]] data. For example, gathering and identifying disease relevant risk factors helps to identify treatment interventions and implement the prevention strategies that could lessen the effects of the outbreak on the general population and improve clinical outcomes at the individual, patient-leve&lt;ref&gt;Wiemeken, T.L., Peyrani, P., Ramirez, J.A. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Could prove useful to commerce, travelers, public health agencies and federal governments, and diplomatic efforts.&lt;ref name="keller" /&gt;
*Public health agencies and federal governments might take advantage of Tele-epidemiology for predicting the propagation of communicable diseases.&lt;ref name="marechael" /&gt;
*Provides users and governments with information for [[early warning systems]].

==Non-clinical applications==
*Applications of tele-epidemiology are not being used frequently in clinical settings
*The use of space-based systems are important for research and public health efforts, though these activities are driven largely by secondary or tertiary organizations, not the public health agencies themselves.
*Relevant data can be used for research and is widely accessible through existing internet outlets. 
*Data can be disseminated through internet reports of disease outbreak for real-time disease mapping for public use.&lt;ref name="keller" /&gt; The application of HealthMap and ProMED-mail demonstrate considerable [[global health]] utility and accessibility for users from both the public and private domains.
*Internet-based platforms can be used by the general public to determine local and international disease outbreaks. Consumers can also contribute their own epidemiologically-relevant data to these services.

==Advantages==
Space-based tele-epidemiological initiatives, using satellites, are able to gather environmental information relevant to tracking disease outbreaks. S2E, a French multidisciplinary consortium on spatial surveillance of epidemics, has used satellites to garner relevant information on [[vegetation]],  [[meteorology]] and [[hydrology]]. This information, in concert with clinical data from humans and animals, can be used to construct predictive mathematical models that may allow for the forecasting of disease outbreaks.&lt;ref name="marechael" /&gt; 

Web-based tele-epidemiological services are able to aggregate information from several disparate sources to provide information on disease surveillance and potential disease outbreaks. Both ProMED-mail and Healthmap collect information in several different languages to gather worldwide epidemiological information.&lt;ref name="HealthMap"&gt;HealthMap (2012) [http://www.healthmap.org/about/ About HealthMap] Last accessed December 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These services are both free and allow both health care professionals and laypeople to access reliable disease outbreak information from around the world and in real-time.

==Disadvantages==
Space-based methodologies require investment of resources for the collection and management of epidemiological information; as such, these systems may not be affordable or technologically feasible for developing countries that need assistance tracking disease outbreaks. Further, the success of space-based methodologies is predicated on the collection of accurate ground-based data by qualified public health professionals. This may not be possible in developing countries because they lack basic laboratory and epidemiological resources&lt;ref&gt;Butler, D. (2006) Disease surveillance needs a revolution. Nature 440, 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Web-based tele-epidemiological initiatives have a unique set of challenges that are different from those experienced by space-based methodologies. HealthMap, in an effort to provide comprehensive worldwide information, contains information from a variety of sources including eyewitness accounts, online news and validated official reports.&lt;ref name="HealthMap" /&gt; As a result, the site necessarily relies upon third party information, the veracity of which they are not liable.

'''The Technical Cooperation Program''' ('''TTCP''') is a long-standing international organisation concerned with cooperation on defence science and technology matters, including national security and civil defence. Its membership comprises [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and the [[United States]] (US).

==History==

===Declaration Of Common Purpose===

TTCP commenced in 1957 as a bilateral activity between the United Kingdom and the United States when the US President and the UK Prime Minister made the following Declaration of Common Purpose:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/ttcp/|title=TTCP website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The arrangements which the nations of the free world have made for collective defense and mutual help are based on the recognition that the concept of national self sufficiency is now out of date. The countries of the free world are interdependent and only in genuine partnership, by combining their resources and sharing tasks in many fields, can progress and safety be found. For our part we have agreed that our two countries will henceforth act in accordance with this principle.}}

===Tripartite Technical Cooperation Program===

Immediately following the Declaration of Common Purpose, the Canadian government subscribed to the principle of interdependence and was admitted by the UK and the US. The resulting arrangement was known as the Tripartite Technical Cooperation Program (or TTCP for short).

===Australia and New Zealand===

Australia joined TTCP in 1965; the organisation's name was changed from '''''Tripartite''' Technical Cooperation Program'' to '''''The''' Technical Cooperation Program'', which allowed the abbreviation for the organisation to be kept as '''TTCP'''. New Zealand joined TTCP in 1969.

==Organisation==

===Top level===

The organisation of TTCP is headed up by a senior official from each of the five participating nations, known collectively as the Principals. Supporting the Principals are their TTCP Deputies, based in Washington, and a secretariat.

===Technical organisation===

Reporting to the Principals are a number of multilateral&lt;!-- What is a "multilateral" group?? --&gt; "TTCP Groups", each comprising Technical Panels and time limited Action Groups. In April 2009 there were 11 TTCP Groups:
*Aerospace Systems Group
*Chemical, Biological &amp; Radiological Defence Group (CBR)
*Conventional Weapons Technology Group
*Command, Control, Communications &amp; Information Systems Group (C3I)&lt;ref&gt;Note that although C3I is more commonly used as an abbreviation for Command, Control, Communications &amp; Intelligence, in the case of TTCP, the I abbreviates "Information". Two reasons for this are that there is a separate group of Five Eyes organisations that address cooperation in the Intelligence domains, and Intelligence is NOT part of the TTCP domain.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Electronic Warfare Systems Group (EW)
*Human Resources &amp; Performance Group (HUM)
*Joint Systems &amp; Analysis Group (JSA)
*Land Systems Group
*Maritime Systems Group
*Materials &amp; Processing Technology Group
*Sensors Group

Each Technical Panel is expected to establish and monitor major collaborative projects in priority areas of defined mutual national interest. An Action Group is more limited in scope than a Technical Panel and has clearly stated objectives and preset milestones. It is formed by a "TTCP Group" to address a specific high priority problem and is terminated on completion of its assignment.

With the cutbacks in US and Australian defense/defence spending at the start of the 2010s, international [[face-to-face interaction]] in TTCP has been severely reduced.

==The "Five Eyes" and other international organisations==

Three TTCP nations (Canada, UK and the US) are also members of the [[NATO Research and Technology Organisation]]. Four of the nations (Australia, Canada, UK and US) are also members of the twenty seven nation [[Multilateral Interoperability Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mip-site.org/010_Public_Home_News.htm Multilateral Interoperability Programme website]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the five TTCP nations, only the UK is a member of the [[European Defence Agency]].

Collectively the five nations comprising TTCP are often referred to as the "[[Five Eyes]]" community for intelligence and also participate in the following related activities:

[[File:Dichroic filters.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dichroic filter]]s are created using optically transparent materials.]]

In the field of [[optics]], '''transparency''' (also called '''pellucidity''' or '''diaphaneity''') is the [[physical property]] of allowing light to pass through the material without being scattered. On a macroscopic scale (one where the dimensions investigated are much larger than the wavelength of the [[photon]]s in question), the photons can be said to follow [[Snell's Law]]. '''Translucency''' (also called '''translucence''' or '''translucidity''') is a superset of transparency: it allows light to pass through, but does not necessarily (again, on the macroscopic scale) follow Snell's law; the photons can be scattered at either of the two interfaces, or internally, where there is a change in index of [[refraction]]. In other words, a translucent medium allows the transport of light while a transparent medium not only allows the transport of light but allows for image formation. Transparent materials appear clear, with the overall appearance of one color, or any combination leading up to a brilliant [[spectrum]] of every color. The opposite property of translucency is [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]].

When light encounters a material, it can interact with it in several different ways. These interactions depend on the [[wavelength]] of the light and the nature of the material. Photons interact with an object by some combination of reflection, absorption and transmission.
Some materials, such as [[plate glass]] and clean [[water]], transmit much of the light that falls on them and reflect little of it; such materials are called optically transparent. Many liquids and aqueous solutions are highly transparent. Absence of structural defects (voids, cracks, etc.) and molecular structure of most liquids are mostly responsible for excellent optical transmission.

Materials which do not [[Transmittance|transmit]] light are called [[opacity (optics)|opaque]]. Many such substances have a [[chemical composition]] which includes what are referred to as [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] centers. Many substances are selective in their absorption of [[Solar Light|white light]] [[frequencies]]. They absorb certain portions of the [[visible spectrum]] while reflecting others. The frequencies of the spectrum which are not absorbed are either reflected or transmitted for our physical observation. This is what gives rise to [[color]]. The attenuation of light of all frequencies and wavelengths is due to the combined mechanisms of absorption and [[Light scattering in liquids and solids|scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fox, M.|title=Optical Properties of Solids|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency can provide almost perfect [[camouflage]] for animals &lt;!--or possibly military equipment?--&gt; able to achieve it. This is easier in dimly-lit or turbid [[sea]]water than in good illumination. Many [[marine biology|marine animals]] such as [[jellyfish]] are highly transparent.

==  Introduction ==

With regard to the absorption of light, primary material considerations include:
*At the electronic level, absorption in the [[ultraviolet]] and visible (UV-Vis) portions of the spectrum depends on whether the [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] are spaced (or "quantized") such that they can absorb a [[quantum]] of light (or [[photon]]) of a specific [[frequency]], and does not violate [[selection rules]]. For example, in most glasses, electrons have no available energy levels above them in range of that associated with visible light, or if they do, they violate selection rules, meaning there is no appreciable absorption in pure (undoped) glasses, making them ideal transparent materials for windows in buildings.
*At the atomic or molecular level, physical absorption in the infrared portion of the spectrum depends on the [[frequencies]] of atomic or [[molecular vibrations]] or [[chemical bonds]], and on [[selection rule]]s. Nitrogen and oxygen are not greenhouse gases because there is no absorption because there is no [[molecular dipole moment]].

With regard to the [[light scattering in liquids and solids|scattering of light]], the most critical factor is the length scale of any or all of these structural features relative to the wavelength of the light being scattered. Primary material considerations include:

*Crystalline structure: whether or not the atoms or molecules exhibit the 'long-range order' evidenced in crystalline solids.
*Glassy structure: scattering centers include fluctuations in density or composition.
*Microstructure: scattering centers include internal surfaces such as grain boundaries, [[crystallographic defect]]s and microscopic pores.
*Organic materials: scattering centers include fiber and cell structures and boundaries.

== Light scattering in solids ==

{{Main article|Light scattering}}

[[File:Diffuse refl.gif|thumb|right|250px|General mechanism of '''diffuse reflection''']]

[[Diffuse reflection]] - Generally, when light strikes the surface of a (non-metallic and non-glassy) solid material, it bounces off in all directions due to multiple reflections by the microscopic irregularities ''inside'' the material (e.g., the [[grain boundaries]] of a [[polycrystalline]] material, or the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or [[fiber]] boundaries of an organic material), and by its surface, if it is rough. Diffuse reflection is typically characterized by omni-directional reflection angles. Most of the objects visible to the naked eye are identified via diffuse reflection. Another term commonly used for this type of reflection is "light scattering". Light scattering from the surfaces of objects is our primary mechanism of physical observation.&lt;ref name="z"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kerker, M.|title=The Scattering of Light|publisher=Academic, New York|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y"&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Mandelstam, L.I.|title=Light Scattering by Inhomogeneous Media
|journal=Zh. Russ. Fiz-Khim. Ova.
|volume=58 |page=381
|year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Light scattering in liquids and solids depends on the wavelength of the light being scattered. Limits to spatial scales of visibility (using white light) therefore arise, depending on the frequency of the light wave and the physical [[dimension]] (or spatial scale) of the scattering center. Visible light has a wavelength scale on the order of a half a [[micrometer]] (one millionth of a meter). Scattering centers (or particles) as small as one micrometer have been observed directly in the light [[microscope]] (e.g., [[Brownian motion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=van de Hulst, H.C.|title=Light scattering by small particles|location=New York|publisher= Dover|year= 1981|isbn=0-486-64228-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bohren, C.F.  |author2=Huffmann, D.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Absorption and scattering of light by small particles|location=New York|publisher= Wiley|year= 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparent ceramics===
Optical transparency in polycrystalline materials is limited by the amount of light which is scattered by their microstructural features. Light scattering depends on the wavelength of the light. Limits to spatial scales of visibility (using white light) therefore arise, depending on the frequency of the light wave and the physical dimension of the scattering center. For example, since visible light has a wavelength scale on the order of a micrometer, scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale. Primary scattering centers in polycrystalline materials include microstructural defects such as pores and grain boundaries. In addition to pores, most of the interfaces in a typical metal or ceramic object are in the form of [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] which separate tiny regions of crystalline order. When the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent.

In the formation of polycrystalline materials (metals and ceramics) the size of the crystalline grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline particles present in the raw material during formation (or pressing) of the object. Moreover, the size of the grain boundaries scales directly with particle size. Thus a reduction of the original particle size well below the wavelength of visible light (about 1/15 of the light wavelength or roughly 600/15 = 40&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer]]s) eliminates much of light scattering, resulting in a translucent or even transparent material.

Computer modeling of light transmission through translucent ceramic alumina has shown that microscopic pores trapped near grain boundaries act as primary scattering centers. The volume fraction of porosity had to be reduced below 1% for high-quality optical transmission (99.99 percent of theoretical density). This goal has been readily accomplished and amply demonstrated in laboratories and research facilities worldwide using the emerging chemical processing methods encompassed by the methods of [[sol-gel]] chemistry and [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yamashita, I.|title=Transparent Ceramics|journal=J. Am. Ceram. Soc.|volume=91|issue=3|page=813|year=2008|doi=10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.02202.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Backlit mushroom.jpg|thumb|Translucency of a material being used to highlight the structure of a photographic subject]]
[[Transparent ceramic]]s have created interest in their applications for high energy lasers, transparent armor windows, nose cones for heat seeking missiles, radiation detectors for non-destructive testing, high energy physics, space exploration, security and medical imaging applications. Large [[laser]] elements made from transparent ceramics can be produced at a relatively low cost. These components are free of internal [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] or intrinsic [[birefringence]], and allow relatively large doping levels or optimized custom-designed doping profiles. This makes ceramic laser elements particularly important for high-energy lasers.

The development of transparent panel products will have other potential advanced applications including high strength, impact-resistant materials that can be used for domestic windows and skylights. Perhaps more important is that walls and other applications will have improved overall strength, especially for high-shear conditions found in high seismic and wind exposures. If the expected improvements in mechanical properties bear out, the traditional limits seen on glazing areas in today's building codes could quickly become outdated if the window area actually contributes to the shear resistance of the wall.

Currently available infrared transparent materials typically exhibit a trade-off between optical performance, mechanical strength and price. For example, [[sapphire]] (crystalline [[alumina]]) is very strong, but it is expensive and lacks full transparency throughout the 3–5 micrometer mid-infrared range. [[Yttria]] is fully transparent from 3–5 micrometers, but lacks sufficient strength, hardness, and thermal shock resistance for high-performance aerospace applications. Not surprisingly, a combination of these two materials in the form of the [[yttrium aluminium garnet]] (YAG) is one of the top performers in the field.

==Absorption of light in solids==
When light strikes an object, it usually has not just a single frequency (or wavelength) but many. Objects have a tendency to selectively absorb, reflect or transmit light of certain frequencies. That is, one object might reflect green light while absorbing all other frequencies of visible light. Another object might selectively transmit blue light while absorbing all other frequencies of visible light. The manner in which visible light interacts with an object is dependent upon the frequency of the light, the nature of the atoms in the object, and often the nature of the [[electron]]s in the [[atom]]s of the object.

Some materials allow much of the light that falls on them to be transmitted through the material without being reflected. Materials that allow the transmission of light waves through them are called optically transparent. Chemically pure (undoped) window glass and clean river or spring water are prime examples of this.

Materials which do not allow the transmission of any light wave frequencies are called [[opacity (optics)|opaque]]. Such substances may have a chemical composition which includes what are referred to as absorption centers. Most materials are composed of materials which are selective in their absorption of light frequencies. Thus they absorb only certain portions of the visible spectrum. The frequencies of the spectrum which are not absorbed are either reflected back or transmitted for our physical observation. In the visible portion of the spectrum, this is what gives rise to color.&lt;ref name="bbbb"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simmons, J.  |author2=Potter, K.S. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Optical Materials|publisher=Academic Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaaa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Uhlmann, D.R.|title=Optical Properties of Glass|publisher=Amer. Ceram. Soc.|year=1991|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absorption centers are largely responsible for the appearance of specific wavelengths of visible light all around us. Moving from longer (0.7 micrometer) to shorter (0.4 micrometer) wavelengths: red, orange, yellow, green and blue (ROYGB) can all be identified by our senses in the appearance of color by the selective absorption of specific light wave frequencies (or wavelengths). Mechanisms of selective light wave absorption include:

*Electronic: Transitions in electron [[energy levels]] within the atom (e.g., [[pigments]]). These transitions are typically in the ultraviolet (UV) and/or visible portions of the spectrum.
*Vibrational: [[Resonance]] in atomic/molecular [[vibrational modes]]. These transitions are typically in the infrared portion of the spectrum.

===UV-Vis: Electronic transitions===
In electronic absorption, the frequency of the incoming light wave is at or near the energy levels of the electrons within the atoms which compose the substance. In this case, the electrons will absorb the energy of the light wave and increase their energy state, often moving outward from the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of the atom into an outer shell or [[Atomic orbital|orbital]].

The atoms that bind together to make the molecules of any particular substance contain a number of electrons (given by the [[atomic number]] Z in the [[periodic chart]]). Recall that all light waves are electromagnetic in origin. Thus they are affected strongly when coming into contact with [[negatively charged]] electrons in matter. When [[photons]] (individual packets of light energy) come in contact with the [[valence electrons]] of atom, one of several things can and will occur:

*A molecule absorbs the photon, some of the energy may be lost via [[luminescence]], [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]].
*A molecule absorbs the photon which results in reflection or scattering.
*A molecule cannot absorb the energy of the photon and the photon continues on its path. This results in transmission (provided no other absorption mechanisms are active).

Most of the time, it is a combination of the above that happens to the light that hits an object. The states in different materials vary in the range of energy that they can absorb. Most glasses, for example, block ultraviolet (UV) light. What happens is the electrons in the glass absorb the energy of the photons in the UV range while ignoring the weaker energy of photons in the visible light spectrum. But there are also existing special [[glass]] types, like special types of [[borosilicate glass]] or quartz that are UV-permeable and thus allow a high transmission of ultra violet light.

Thus, when a material is illuminated, individual photons of light can make the [[valence electrons]] of an atom transition to a higher electronic [[energy level]]. The photon is destroyed in the process and the absorbed radiant energy is transformed to electric potential energy. Several things can happen then to the absorbed energy: it may be re-emitted by the electron as [[radiant energy]] (in this case the overall effect is in fact a scattering of light), dissipated to the rest of the material (i.e. transformed into [[heat]]), or the electron can be freed from the atom (as in the [[photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] and [[Compton effect|Compton]] effects).

===Infrared: Bond stretching===
[[Image:1D normal modes (280 kB).gif|thumb|250px|Normal modes of vibration in a crystalline solid]]
The primary physical mechanism for storing mechanical energy of motion in condensed matter is through [[heat]], or [[thermal energy]]. Thermal energy manifests itself as energy of motion. Thus, heat is motion at the atomic and molecular levels. The primary mode of motion in [[crystalline]] substances is [[vibration]]. Any given atom will vibrate around some [[mean]] or average [[position (vector)|position]] within a crystalline structure, surrounded by its nearest neighbors. This vibration in two dimensions is equivalent to the [[oscillation]] of a clock’s pendulum. It swings back and forth [[symmetrical]]ly about some mean or average (vertical) position. Atomic and molecular vibrational frequencies may average on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[cycles per second]] ([[Terahertz radiation#Natural|Terahertz radiation]]).

When a light wave of a given frequency strikes a material with particles having the same or (resonant) vibrational frequencies, then those particles will absorb the energy of the light wave and transform it into thermal energy of vibrational motion. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared light. Reflection and transmission of light waves occur because the frequencies of the light waves do not match the natural resonant frequencies of vibration of the objects. When infrared light of these frequencies strikes an object, the energy is reflected or transmitted.

If the object is transparent, then the light waves are passed on to neighboring atoms through the bulk of the material and re-emitted on the opposite side of the object. Such frequencies of light waves are said to be [[transmit]]ted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gunzler, H.  |author2=Gremlich, H. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=IR Spectroscopy: An Introduction|publisher=Wiley|year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart, B.|title=Infrared Spectroscopy: Fundamentals and Applications|publisher=Wiley|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency in insulators===
An object may be not transparent either because it reflects the incoming light or because it absorbs the incoming light. Almost all solids reflect a part and absorb a part of the incoming light.

When light falls onto a block of [[metal]], it encounters atoms that are tightly packed in a regular [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice]] and a "[[sea of electrons]]" moving randomly between the atoms.&lt;ref name="X"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mott, N.F.  |author2=Jones, H.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Theory of the Properties of Metals and Alloys |publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford (1936) Dover Publications (1958)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In metals, most of these are non-bonding electrons (or free electrons) as opposed to the bonding electrons typically found in covalently bonded or ionically bonded non-metallic (insulating) solids. In a metallic bond, any potential bonding electrons can easily be lost by the atoms in a crystalline structure. The effect of this delocalization is simply to exaggerate the effect of the "sea of electrons". As a result of these electrons, most of the incoming light in metals is reflected back, which is why we see a [[Reflection (physics)|shiny]] metal surface.

Most [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] (or [[dielectric]] materials) are held together by [[ionic bond]]s. Thus, these materials do not have free [[conduction electrons]], and the bonding electrons reflect only a small fraction of the incident wave. The remaining frequencies (or wavelengths) are free to propagate (or be transmitted). This class of materials includes all [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] and [[glass]]es.

If a dielectric material does not include light-absorbent additive molecules (pigments, dyes, colorants), it is usually transparent to the spectrum of visible light. [[Colour centre (disambiguation)|Color center]]s (or dye molecules, or "dopants") in a dielectric absorb a portion of the incoming light. The remaining frequencies (or wavelengths) are free to be reflected or transmitted. This is how colored glass is produced.

Most liquids and aqueous solutions are highly transparent. For example, water, cooking oil, rubbing alcohol, air, and natural gas are all clear. Absence of structural defects (voids, cracks, etc.) and molecular structure of most liquids are chiefly responsible for their excellent optical transmission. The ability of liquids to "heal" internal defects via viscous flow is one of the reasons why some fibrous materials (e.g., paper or fabric) increase their apparent transparency when wetted. The liquid fills up numerous voids making the material more structurally homogeneous.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Light scattering in an ideal defect-free [[crystalline]] (non-metallic) solid which provides ''no scattering centers'' for incoming light will be due primarily to any effects of anharmonicity within the ordered lattice. Light [[transmission coefficient#Optics|transmission]] will be highly [[direction (geometry)|directional]] due to the typical [[anisotropy]] of crystalline substances, which includes their [[symmetry group]] and [[Bravais lattice]]. For example, the seven different [[crystalline]] forms of [[quartz]] silica ([[silicon dioxide]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are all clear, [[transparent materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Griffin, A.|title=Brillouin Light Scattering from Crystals in the Hydrodynamic Region|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.40.167|journal=Rev. Mod. Phys.|volume= 40|issue=1|page=167|year=1968|bibcode=1968RvMP...40..167G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical waveguides==
[[Image:Optical-fibre.svg|thumb|right|Propagation of light through a multi-mode optical fiber]]
[[Image:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|right|A laser beam bouncing down an [[Acrylic glass|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multimode optical fiber]]

Optically transparent materials focus on the response of a material to incoming light waves of a range of wavelengths. Guided light wave transmission via frequency selective waveguides involves the emerging field of [[fiber optics]] and the ability of certain glassy compositions to act as a [[optical medium|transmission medium]] for a range of frequencies simultaneously ([[multi-mode optical fiber]]) with little or no [[Adjacent-channel interference|interference]] between competing wavelengths or frequencies. This resonant mode of energy and data transmission via electromagnetic (light) wave propagation is relatively lossless.

An optical fiber is a [[cylindrical]] dielectric waveguide that transmits light along its axis by the process of [[total internal reflection]]. The fiber consists of a [[core (optical fiber)|core]] surrounded by a [[Cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]] layer. To confine the optical signal in the core, the [[refractive index]] of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The refractive index is the parameter reflecting the [[speed of light]] in a material. (Refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in a given medium. The refractive index of vacuum is therefore 1.) The larger the refractive index, the more slowly light travels in that medium. Typical values for core and cladding of an optical fiber are 1.48 and 1.46, respectively.

When light traveling in a dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle, the light will be completely reflected. This effect, called [[total internal reflection]], is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels along the fiber bouncing back and forth off of the boundary. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the [[total internal reflection|critical angle]], only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles will be propagated. This range of angles is called the [[acceptance cone]] of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone is a function of the refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding. [[Optical]] [[waveguides]] are used as components in integrated optical circuits (e.g. combined with lasers or [[light-emitting diodes]], LEDs) or as the transmission medium in local and long haul [[optical communication]] systems.

===Mechanisms of attenuation===
{{See also|Light scattering}}
[[Image:Zblan transmit.jpg|thumb|Light attenuation by ZBLAN and silica fibers]]

[[Attenuation]] in [[Optical fiber|fiber optics]], also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) with respect to distance traveled through a transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the very high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a signal across large distances. In optical fibers the main attenuation source is scattering from molecular level irregularities ([[Rayleigh scattering]])&lt;ref&gt;I. P. Kaminow, T. Li (2002), Optical fiber telecommunications IV, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlxnCiQlNwEC&amp;q&amp;f=false&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vol.1, p. 223] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527231335/http://books.google.com/books?id=GlxnCiQlNwEC&amp;q&amp;f=false&amp;pg=PA223 |date=2013-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to structural disorder and compositional fluctuations of the [[Amorphous solid|glass structure]]. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of infrared missile domes{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Further attenuation is caused by light absorbed by residual materials, such as metals or water ions, within the fiber core and inner cladding. Light leakage due to bending, splices, connectors, or other outside forces are other factors resulting in attenuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, R.G.|title=Optical power handling capacity of low loss optical fibers as determined by stimulated Raman and Brillouin scattering|journal=Appl. Opt.|volume=11|issue=11|pages=2489–94|year=1972|doi=10.1364/AO.11.002489|pmid=20119362|bibcode=1972ApOpt..11.2489S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Archibald, P.S.  |author2=Bennett, H.E. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Scattering from infrared missile domes|bibcode=1978SPIE..133...71A|journal=Opt.

==As camouflage==

[[File:Expl0469 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|upright|Many animals of the open sea, like this ''[[Aurelia labiata]]'' jellyfish, are largely transparent.]]

{{further information|List of camouflage methods}}

Many [[Sea|marine]] animals that float near the surface are highly transparent, giving them almost perfect [[camouflage]].&lt;ref name=HerringTransparency&gt;Herring, Peter (2002). ''The Biology of the Deep Ocean''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-854956-7}}. pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; However, transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different [[refractive index|refractive indices]] from seawater. Some marine animals such as [[jellyfish]] have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick [[Mesoglea|mesogloea]] is acellular and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them [[buoyancy|buoyant]], but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast, making this form of camouflage a costly trade-off with mobility.&lt;ref name=HerringTransparency/&gt; Gelatinous [[plankton]]ic animals are between 50 and 90 percent transparent. A transparency of 50 percent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as [[cod]] at a depth of {{convert|650|m|ft}}; better transparency is required for [[invisibility]] in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 percent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, sufficient transparency for camouflage is more easily achieved in deeper waters.&lt;ref name=HerringTransparency/&gt; For the same reason, transparency in air is even harder to achieve, but a partial example is found in the 
[[glass frog]]s of the South American rain forest, which have translucent skin and pale greenish limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naish|first=D.|title=Green-boned glass frogs, monkey frogs, toothless toads|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2007/11/09/green-boned-glass-frogs/|work=Tetrapod zoology|publisher=scienceblogs.com|accessdate=14 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111125205/http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2007/11/09/green-boned-glass-frogs/|archivedate=11 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Central American species of clearwing ([[Ithomiini|ithomiine]]) butterflies and many [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] and allied [[insect]]s also have wings which are mostly transparent, a form of [[crypsis]] that provides some protection from predators.

'''Urban acupuncture''' is a [[environmentalism|socio-environmental]] theory that combines contemporary [[urban design]] with [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese]] [[acupuncture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://adamparsonsdesignthesis.blogspot.com/2010/12/urban-acupuncture-marco-casagrande.html Parsons, Adam.

Casagrande views cities as complex energy organisms in which different overlapping layers of energy flows are determining the actions of the citizens as well as the development of the city. By mixing environmentalism and urban design Casagrande is developing methods of punctual manipulation of the urban energy flows in order to create an ecologically sustainable urban development towards the so-called 3rd Generation City (postindustrial city). The theory is developed in the [[Tamkang University]] of [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbandevelopmentbergen.blogspot.com/2010/04/interview-witm-m-casagrande-on-urban.html INTERVIEW WITH M.

Casagrande describes urban acupuncture as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[a] cross-over architectural manipulation of the collective sensuous intellect of a city. City is viewed as multi-dimensional sensitive energy-organism, a living environment. Urban acupuncture aims into a touch with this nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ "Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal,"] – Kyle Miller, MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sensitivity to understand the energy flows of the collective [[Qi|chi]] beneath the visual city and reacting on the hot-spots of this chi. Architecture is in the position to produce the acupuncture needles for the urban chi.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epifanio.eu/nr14/eng/ruin_academy.html "Ruin Academy,"] – Marco Casagrande, Epifanio 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''A weed will root into the smallest crack in the asphalt and eventually break the city.  Urban acupuncture is the weed and the acupuncture point is the crack. The possibility of the impact is total, connecting human nature as part of nature.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Casagrande utilized the tenets of acupuncture: treat the points of blockage and let relief ripple throughout the body. More immediate and sensitive to community needs than traditional institutional forms of large scale urban renewal interventions would not only respond to localized needs, but do so with a knowledge of how citywide systems operated and converged at that single node. Release pressure at strategic points, release pressure for the whole city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Urban Applications'' 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participatory planning==

In theory, urban acupuncture opens the door for uncontrolled creativity and freedom.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Citizens are enabled to join the creative [[participatory planning]] process, feel free to use city space for any purpose and develop their environment according to their will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadsbyggnad.lth.se/fileadmin/stadsbyggnad/images/_1_Sudes_Book/_1_B5_webversion1.pdf Compost City] – Guoda Bardauskaite'' p. 30-31, Sustainable Urban Design Journal 1 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This "new" post-industrialized city Casagrande, dubbed the Third Generation City, is driven by people who are concerned about the destruction that the modern machine is causing to nature including human nature. They want sustainable co-operation with the rest of the nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbaninteraction.net/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Raune Frankjær, Rethink: Urban Interaction'' 10/2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a larger context, a site of urban acupuncture can be viewed as communicating to the city outside like a natural sign of life in a city programmed to subsume it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/37444/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Kelly Chan, Architizer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban acupuncture bears some similarities to the [[New Urbanism|new urbanist]] concept of Tactical Urbanism. The idea focuses on local resources rather than capital-intensive municipal programs and promotes the idea of citizens installing and caring for interventions. These small changes, proponents claim, will boost community morale and catalyze revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newurbannetwork.com/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities 'Urban acupuncture' touted for cash-strapped cities] – ''David West, New Urban Network'' 7/2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016}} Boiled down to a simple statement, "urban acupuncture" means focusing on small, subtle, bottom-up interventions that harness and direct community energy in positive ways to heal urban blight and improve the cityscape.

This approach can provide a more realistic and less costly method for city planners and citizens as an effective way to make minor improvements in the communities in order to achieve a greater good in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fluxtrends.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=111&amp;limitstart=5 Urban Acupuncture] – ''  Mariam Mahomed, Urban Spaces

"I believe that some medicinal "magic" can and should be applied to cities, as many are sick and some nearly terminal. As with the medicine needed in the interaction between doctor and patient, in urban planning it is also necessary to make the city react; to poke an area in such a way that it is able to help heal, improve, and create positive chain reactions.

Taiwanese architect and academic Ti-Nan Chi is looking with micro urbanism at the vulnerable and insignificant side of contemporary cities around the world identified as micro-zones, points for recovery in which micro-projects have been carefully proposed to involve the public on different levels, aiming to resolve conflicts among property owners, villagers, and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=16364 Chi Ti-Nan develops a project to preserve Hong Kong coastline Tai Long Sai Wan] – '' World Architecture News'' 4/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A loosely affiliated team of architects [[Wang Shu]], Marco Casagrande, [[Hsieh Ying-chun]] and [[Roan Ching-yueh]] (sometimes called WEAK! Architecture) are describing the unofficial Instant City, or Instant Taipei, as architecture that uses the Official City as a ''growing platform and energy source, where to attach itself like a parasite and from where to leach the electricity and water… [The Instant City's] illegal urban farms or night markets is so widespread and deep rooted in the Taiwanese culture and cityscape that we could almost speak of another city on top of the "official" Taipei, a parallel city – or a para-city.'' WEAK! is calling urban acupuncture depending on the context as Illegal Architecture, Orchid Architecture, the People's Architecture, or Weak Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/18012/peoples-architecture-in-taipei/ Illegal Architecture in Taipei] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120526043446/http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/18012/peoples-architecture-in-taipei/ |date=26 May 2012 }} – Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan'' Architizer 3/2011&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of urban acupuncture suggests that scores of small-scale, less costly and localized projects is what cities need in order to recover and renew themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/marco-casagrande-cicada-installation-taipei.html Could Cities Benefit from Small-Scale, Local "Urban Acupuncture" Projects Like This?] – Kimberly Mok'' Treehugger 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award==
The winner of the Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award (DBUAA) Cape Town 2012 is the neighbourhood project "Mothers Unite" demonstrating the power of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mothersunite.org.za/2012/04/deutsche-bank-urban-age-award-19-april-2012/ Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award – 19 April 2012] – '' Mothers Unite'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers Unite was founded in 2007 and provides a safe haven from the gangsterism, drugs and violence that are part and parcel of street and home life in the area. Built with donated shipping containers, the village is made up of a library, kitchen, office, sheltered area, playground and food garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.db.com/csr/en/social_investments/deutsche_bank_urban_age_award_2012_winner_announced.html Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award 2012 – winner announced] – '' Deutsche Bank Corporate Social Responsibility'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Edgar Pieterse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Durable urban change is often about carefully targeted micro interventions that can change the energies and dynamics of a surrounding neighbourhood. When one engages with the physical manifestations that the tenacity, blood, sweat, and tears of the protagonists of Mothers Unite and Masiphumelele Library (another of the eight finalists) have created, the power of urban acupuncture is apparent. These projects serve as reminders that through vision, commitment over the long haul, and principle-based partnerships, just about any problem can be confronted and addressed.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capetown2014.co.za/2012/04/mothers-unite-urban-acupuncture-for-an-urban-age/ Mothers Unite: Urban acupuncture for an urban age] – '' Cape Town 2014 Live Design.

==Urban ecological restoration==
In ecological restoration of industrial cities Urban Acupuncture can take form as spontaneous and often illegal urban farms and [[Community gardening|community gardens]] punctuating the more mechanical city and tuning it towards a more sustainable co-existence with the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-community-gardens-of-taipei/2010/12/04 Taipei Organic Acupuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, P2P Foundation'' 12/2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
Urban Acupuncture areas can receive, treat and [[recycle]] the waste from the surrounding city acting as eco-valleys within the urban fabric. In River Urbanism the Urban Acupuncture areas can include underground [[stormwater]] reservoirs and act as [[flood]] relief for the surrounding city as a [[sponge]] and they can act as [[Biofilter|biological filters]] purifying water originated from polluted rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecture.org/internal/content/download.asp?wdoc=urbanecopuncture-marcocasagrande.doc Urban Ecopuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, World Architecture'' 10/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Urban acupuncture is a point by point manipulation of the urban energy to create a sustainable town or city, which Marco Casagrande has dubbed '3rd Generation Cities'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainablecities.dk/en/city-projects/cases/amsterdam-urban-acupuncture-creates-new-life-in-the-suburbs Amsterdam: Urban Acupuncture creates new life in the suburbs] – ''Danish Architecture Centre, Sustainable Cities'' 6/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban acupuncture in art==

American artist [[Gordon Matta-Clark]] is credited with developing a system for identifying pockets of disrepair in the built environment—the first step in the framework of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
Artist [[Miru Kim]] explores industrial [[ruin]]s and structures making her look at the city as one living organism. She claims to feel not only the skin of the city, but also to penetrate the inner layers of its intestines and veins, which swarm with minuscule life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/zh-tw/miru_kim_s_underground_art.html Miru Kim] – ''TED Talks'' 2/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to a public [[environmental art]] work, Cicada, Casagrande explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Cicada is urban acupuncture for Taipei city penetrating the hard surfaces of industrial laziness in order to reach the original ground and get in touch with the collective Chi, the local knowledge that binds the people of [[Taipei basin]] with nature. The [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of Cicada is an accidental mediator between the modern man and reality. There is no other reality than nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/marco-casagrande-cicada-installation-taipei.html Could Cities Benefit from Small-Scale, Local "Urban Acupuncture" Projects Like This?] – Kimberley Mok ''Treehugeer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Environmental art as urban acupuncture is an artistic way of injecting a healthy dose of natural elements and human scale into the mechanized urban grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archetcetera.blogspot.com/2012/01/signs-of-life.html Signs of Life] – Phyllis Richardson ''Archetcetera'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Washington College''' is a private, independent [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Chestertown, Maryland]]. Maryland granted Washington College its charter in 1782. [[George Washington]] supported the founding of the college by consenting to have the "College at Chester" named in his honor, through generous financial support, and through service on the college's Board of Visitors and Governors. Washington College is the [[Colonial Colleges|10th-oldest college]] in the [[United States]] and was the first college chartered after American independence. The school became [[coeducational]] in 1891.

==History==
[[File:Bronze GW Statue.jpg|thumb|left|A bronze George Washington statue overlooks the campus green.]]
Washington College evolved from the Kent County Free School, an institution of more than 60 years' standing in "Chester Town," which by the college's founding date of 1782 had reached considerable strength and importance as a port city. [[George Washington]] consented to the fledgling college's use of his name, pledged the sum of 50 guineas to its establishment, and extended his warm wishes for the "lasting and extensive usefulness" of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Washington]] to William Smith, August 18, 1782. George Washington Papers, Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; He later served on Washington College's Board of Visitors and Governors — his only such involvement with an institution of higher learning.

The college's first president, the Reverend [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|William Smith]], was a prominent figure in colonial affairs of letters and church, and he had a wide acquaintance among the great men of colonial days, including [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Joining General Washington on the Board of Visitors and Governors of the new college were such distinguished figures as U.S. Senator [[John Henry (Maryland)|John Henry]], Congressman [[Joshua Seney]] and his Excellency [[William Paca]], Governor of Maryland. The Maryland legislature granted its first college charter upon Washington College in May 1782.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revcollege.washcoll.edu/firstcollege/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519054204/http://revcollege.washcoll.edu/firstcollege/index.html |date=May 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following spring, on May 14, 1783, the college held its first commencement.

President Smith had envisaged Washington College as the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] Campus of a public University of Maryland with [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] as its [[Western Shore]] counterpart, a proposal incorporated into the later institution's 1784 state charter, but the [[Maryland General Assembly|Maryland General Assembly's]] reluctance to provide funding meant this was never more than a paper institution and the relationship ended with Smith's return to Philadelphia in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tilghman|first1=Tench Francis|title=The Early History of St. John's College in Annapolis|date=1984|publisher=St. John's College Press|location=Annapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his election as first President of the United States, General Washington retired from the Board of Visitors and Governors and accepted the honorary degree of doctor of laws, which a delegation from Chestertown presented to him on June 24, 1789, in New York, then the seat of Congress. Since Washington's last visit to campus, Washington College has hosted five U.S. presidents: [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], [[Harry S Truman]], [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].

The original college building cornerstone was laid in May 1783, it opened in 1788 after selling off acreage and starting a lottery to fund the project. The hall was still incomplete by 1794 and was destroyed by a basement fire January 11, 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maryland History in Prints 1743-1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest existing building, Middle Hall, was erected in 1844 on the site of the original college building. By 1860, Middle Hall was joined by East and West Halls. All three structures, known as the Hill Dorms, are on the Maryland Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register Listings in Maryland|url={{MHT url|id=557}}|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==

===Student body and admissions===
[[File:WC aerial.jpg|thumb|250px|Washington College campus]]

[[File:ChestertownMD Rivershot.jpg|thumb|250px|Chestertown's historic waterfront]]
For the 2011-2012 academic year, 56.6% of applicants were accepted to the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington College, Applying|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/washington-college|publisher=The College Board|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,400 [[undergraduate]]s and 100 [[graduate student]]s attend Washington College, 47 percent from Maryland and the balance from 35 [[U.S. state|other states]] and forty foreign nations. Approximately 8 percent of the American undergraduates are [[minority group|minority]] students and approximately 8 percent are international citizens. Approximately 5 percent of the college's student body is "non-traditional" (25 years old or older).  Approximately 80 percent of all students live in college residence halls; the rest commute either from off-campus housing or from home.

[[Tuition]] for the 2012-2013 year is $39,208 and total expenses per annum (including room, board, and fees) are $48,768.  Approximately 85 percent of the student body receives some form of need-based financial aid or merit-based [[scholarship]] award. The cost of attendance has been rising in recent years, with the overall costs (including room and board) increasing by roughly $2,000 per year.

===Rankings===
In 2015, Washington College was ranked by ''The Princeton Review'' as 16th in the United States among "Colleges With The Happiest Students In 2015-16".&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colleges-with-the-happiest-students_55bfe207e4b06f8bedb5b584 |title=Colleges With The Happiest Students In 2015-16, According To Princeton Review |publisher=Huffington Post |date= |accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 edition of ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' Best Colleges, Washington College rose 19 positions to 93rd in the nation in the National Liberal Arts Colleges category.&lt;ref name="colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/chestertown-md/washington-college-maryland-2108 |title=colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |publisher=colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary prizes==
Each year, Washington College awards the nation's largest undergraduate literary prize. Since 1968, the Sophie Kerr Prize has been presented to one graduating senior who demonstrates the greatest literary promise. The endowment created by [[Sophie Kerr]], a writer who published 23 novels and dozens of short stories, has provided more than $1.4 million in prize money to young writers.  At a ceremony held at the [[Poets House]] in New York City on May 17, 2011, Lisa Jones was selected as the winner of the $61,000 Sophie Kerr Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Childs Walker|work= The Baltimore Sun |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-05-17/news/bs-md-sophie-kerr-prize-20110517_1_sophie-kerr-prize-literary-prize-volunteer-work |title=articles.baltimoresun.com |publisher=articles.baltimoresun.com |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Washington College inaugurated another literary prize, the [[George Washington Book Prize]], administered by the college's [[C.V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience]] and awarded in partnership with the [[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]] and George Washington's Mount Vernon. The prize is awarded annually to the most significant new book about the founding era. At $50,000, the prize is one of the most generous book awards in the United States. [[Richard Beeman]] won the 2010 George Washington Book Prize for his work, ''Plain, Honest Men: The Making of the American Constitution.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/penn-professor-richard-beeman-s-plain-honest-men-wins-2010-george-washington-book-prize |title=upenn.edu |publisher=upenn.edu |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Rose O’Neill Literary House, Washington College's center for literature and the literary arts, established the [[Douglass Wallop]] Fellowship as a nationwide competition, with the first fellowship going to playwright [[Sheri Wilner]].   The award will be granted biennially to a playwright.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washcoll.edu/live/news/5422-sheri-wilner-awarded-2015-douglass-wallop Sheri Wilner awarded 2015 Douglass Wallop Fellowship] Washington College, May 01, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
The school has over 90 student clubs.

Freshmen, unless local, are required to live on-campus.  On-campus housing is available for approximately 900 students. Most students (70-75 percent) stay on-campus over the weekend to participate in various social and recreational activities.

Approximately 30 percent of students attend graduate school in the first year following graduation and approximately 45 percent do so within five years.

The student to faculty ratio is 12:1. The average class size is 17.

The school confers the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], and [[Master of Arts]] (in English, psychology and history).

Washington College has joined American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment with a [[Campus carbon neutrality]] goal. The Center for Environment and Society oversees the Chesapeake Semester program, four interdisciplinary courses that use the College's location in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to explore environmental issues and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chesapeake-semester.washcoll.edu |title=Washington College &amp;#124; Chesapeake Semester |publisher=Chesapeake-semester.washcoll.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington College is host to the Harwood Series, which includes speeches by national politicians and media pundits. Because of its reputation as a liberal arts school with creative writing being a strength, writers such as [[John Barth]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], [[Colum McCann]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Tim O'Brien (author)|Tim O'Brien]], [[Junot Diaz]], and [[Robert Pinsky]] have given readings at the campus.

===Greek life===

Greek life at Washington College comprises four men's fraternities and three women's sororities. Fraternities are mainly housed on the "quad", and sororities line the Western Shore housing.

Men's fraternities:
*[[Theta Chi]] Beta Eta
*[[Kappa Alpha Order]] Beta Omega
*[[Phi Delta Theta]] MD Gamma
*[[Kappa Sigma]] Omicron-Phi

Sororities:

===Traditions===

'''George Washington Birthday Ball''': A college-wide dance where students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends of the college come together to celebrate George Washington's birthday. The event usually takes place on, or around, the actual date of George Washington's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birthdayball.washcoll.edu/ |title=Washington College &amp;#124; News and Events |publisher=Birthdayball.washcoll.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War on the Shore''': The annual men's lacrosse game, held in late spring between Washington College and [[Salisbury University]], two of Maryland's Eastern Shore's undergraduate schools.  Beginning in 2004, the winner of the game has been awarded the Charles B. Clark Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtoncollegesports.com/mlacrosse/releases/04cup.html |title=Washington College Men's Lacrosse |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[May Day (Washington College)|May Day]]''': Started in 1968 by Professor Bennett Lamond of the English Department, who retired in 2004. He brought a class out onto the green, where they read poetry and drank wine. Later that night some of the students returned, and Washington College's May Day celebration was born. Since then, May Day has become a two-day festival on April 30 and May 1, often involving public nudity by some of the student body. The event draws many students as spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjjBgtvrQNY |title=Video Interview with Bennett Lamond |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==

===Varsity sports===
[[File:WashingtonCollegeWar.On.The.Shore.jpg|thumb|The annual lacrosse rivalry between Washington College and [[Salisbury University]] is known as '''The War on the Shore'''.]]

Washington College has competed in intercollegiate athletics since the 19th century.  Its oldest current varsity sports are the baseball team, which dates back to at least the early 1870s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtoncollegesports.com/sports/bsb/history/alltime_records |title=washingtoncollegesports.com |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the men's basketball team, which plays its 100th season in 2011-12.&lt;ref name="washingtoncollegesports.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtoncollegesports.com/sports/mbkb/history/alltime_records |title=washingtoncollegesports.com |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men's teams are known as the Shoremen; women's teams are known as the Shorewomen.

While men have been playing varsity sports at Washington College for well over a century, varsity opportunities for women have been a more recent development. The first varsity sports for women&amp;nbsp;– rowing, tennis, and volleyball&amp;nbsp;– were added in the mid-1970s and were followed by the additions of softball, lacrosse, field hockey, and swimming by the mid-1980s. Varsity women's basketball began play during the 1993-94 season, while co-ed sailing was elevated to varsity status four years later. The women's soccer team is the college's newest varsity sport; it began play during the fall of 1998.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Washington College fielded a varsity football team through 1950, a men's track and field team through 1982, and a men's cross country team through 1989. The college previously sponsored varsity men's golf and varsity wrestling.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

14 of Washington College's 17 varsity teams compete in the [[Centennial Conference]]. The men's and women's rowing teams compete in the [[College rowing (United States)#Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference|Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference]] (MARC), while the sailing team competes in the [[Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association]] (MAISA), a part of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The rowing and sailing teams host regattas on the Chester River and call the college's Truslow Boat House and Lelia Hynson Boating Park home.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The college's 17 varsity teams are:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Middle, East and West Halls''' stand on the crest of a low hill (the terrace) at the center of campus. Middle Hall (built 1844) and East and West Halls (built 1854) hold a special place in the history of Washington College, as they are the oldest surviving campus buildings.  They serve as monuments to the original Common Building (completed in 1789), whose site they occupy.  They are all three-story buildings constructed of brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{MHT url|id=557}}|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-05|work= National Register of Historic Places: Middle, East and West Halls|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="nris" /&gt;

They now function as follows:
*East Hall&amp;nbsp;– The International House is a three-floor coed building that serves as a home for students interested in international relation and foreign language study. This theme house has a faculty advisor.
*Middle Hall&amp;nbsp;– The Creative Arts House is a coed building for students interested in drama, music, visual art, literature, and the creative arts in general.
*West Hall&amp;nbsp;– The Science House is a three-floor coed building that serves as a home for students interested in the natural sciences. This theme house has a faculty advisor.

'''''What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?''''' &lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, MI, US/Cambridge, UK, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by biblical scholar and archaeologist [[William G. Dever]] detailing his response to the claims of [[biblical minimalism|minimalists]] to the historicity and value of the [[Hebrew Bible]].

== Summary ==

Dever's book is a response to recent trends in biblical scholarship and [[biblical archaeology]] which question whether the bible can be used as a reliable tool for interpreting history.

The book begins with Dever's explanation of the "minimalist" position, which holds that the bible is a product of the [[Yehud Medinata|Persian]] or even [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic periods]], composed at the very earliest after c. 500 BC, and therefore unreliable as a record of earlier periods. The minimalists do not deny that the biblical books are based on genuinely old material, but they view the task of extracting that material from layers of revision and accretion is virtually unachievable. At the other extreme are the "maximalists" who take the bible at, or almost entirely at, face value. In his first two chapters Dever reviews and rejects both minimalism and maximalism. Dever nevertheless evidently regards the minimalist position as more dangerous than the maximalist, because it tends to eliminate altogether any study of [[First Temple (Judaism)|ancient Israel prior to the Persian period]].

Dever then turns to Syrio-Palestinian archaeology, as the former discipline of [[biblical archaeology]] is now known, and reviews material discoveries to demonstrate that they can in fact be linked to the biblical narrative. The central chapters therefore offer a detailed discussion of the major archaeological discoveries of the twentieth century and relate them to the [[Deuteronomistic History]] (Joshua-2 Kings), "correlat[ing] text and artifact to demonstrate that significant material in the narrative plausibly derives from [[Iron Age]] II (ca. 1000-600 BCE) and not from later periods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[Review |author=John Barclay Brown |journal=[[Biblical Theology Bulletin]]|date=May 2002 |volume=32 |pages=107–108 |doi=10.1177/014610790203200210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dever makes clear that he positions himself in the middle ground between minimalists such as [[Thomas L. Thompson]] (with whom Dever has had a long running and acrimonious public dispute) on the one hand, and maximalists on the other. "While the Hebrew Bible in its present, heavily edited form cannot be taken at face value as history in the modern sense, it nevertheless ''contains'' much history." For Dever, this historical core is concentrated in the period from [[David]] onwards; the [[Torah]] and the period of the [[conquest of Canaan]] he regards as essentially mythical. The final chapter sums up the argument of the book, stating that there was an [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|ancient Israel]], that the bible was written from a genuine historical core, and that archaeology can identify this core and prevent Israel from being "written out of history".&lt;ref name="Dever2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=William G. Dever|title=What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?: What Archeology Can Tell Us About the Reality of Ancient Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-VxwC5rQtwC&amp;pg=PA298|date=10 May 2001|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2126-3|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and reviews ==

The book received mixed reviews. Conservative scholars commended Dever for his critique on minimalism but were disappointed by his failure to defend the historicity of the bible prior to the age of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. Others chided his inability to distance himself from his obsessions: 
{{quote|"[Dever's] agendas are that (a) a coordinated team of 'minimalists'/'revisionist' biblical historians are conspiring to deny the existence of ancient Israel (and even of historical 'facts' at all!); (b) Dever has been, and remains, the guardian of truth in matters archaeological; and (c) archaeology can confirm the reliability of Biblical history. The first two of these issues obscure the central thesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0882-8539| volume = 21| issue = 1| pages = 158–160| last = Davies| first = Philip R.| title = What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?

{{quote|"If Dever’s attempts to link narrative biblical history and archaeology represent mainstream thinking (as he claims), then the field is indeed in deep trouble. It is the kind of blind acceptance of traditional (unsubstantiated) 'synchronisms' espoused by Dever that has provided the very fuel for the minimalists’ criticisms. In short, Dever may prove to be his own worst enemy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centuries.co.uk/dever-review.pdf Review by Peter James, ''Palestine Exploration Quarterly'', 134, 2 (2002)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Work system''' has been used loosely in many areas. This article concerns its use in understanding IT-reliant systems in organizations. A notable use of the term occurred in 1977 in the first volume of MIS Quarterly in two articles by Bostrom and Heinen (1977). Later Sumner and Ryan (1994) used it to explain problems in the adoption of CASE ([[computer-aided software engineering]]). A number of [[socio-technical systems]] researchers such as Trist and Mumford also used the term occasionally, but seemed not to define it in detail. In contrast, the work system approach defines work system carefully and uses it as a basic analytical concept.

A work system is a system in which human participants and/or machines perform work (processes and activities) using information, technology, and other resources to produce products/services for internal or external customers. Typical business organizations contain work systems that procure materials from suppliers, produce products, deliver products to customers, find customers, create financial reports, hire employees, coordinate work across depa */ ERROR ERROR ERROR \* ed to processing information.
* A [[service system]] is a work system that produces services for its customers.
* A [[project]] is a work system designed to produce a product and then go out of existence.
* A [[supply chain]] is an interorganizational work system devoted to procuring materials and other inputs required to produce a firm’s products.
* An [[ecommerce]] web site can be viewed as a work system in which a buyer uses a seller’s web site to obtain product information and perform purchase transactions.
The relationship between work systems in general and the special cases implies that the same basic concepts apply to all of the special cases, which also have their own specialized vocabulary. In turn, this implies that much of the body of knowledge for the current information systems discipline can be organized around a work system core.

Specific information systems exist to support (other) work systems. Many different degrees of overlap are possible between an information system and a work system that it supports. For example, an information system might provide information for a non-overlapping work system, as happens when a commercial marketing survey provides information to a firm’s marketing managers In other cases, an information system may be an integral part of a work system, as happens in highly automated manufacturing and in ecommerce web sites. In these situations, participants in the work system are also participants in the information system, the work system cannot operate properly without the information system, and the information system has little significance outside of the work system.

== Work system framework ==

The work system approach for understanding systems includes both a static view of a current (or proposed) system in operation and a dynamic view of how a system evolves over time through planned change and unplanned adaptations. The static view is summarized by the work system framework, which identifies the basic elements for understanding and evaluating a work system. An easily recognized triangular representation of the work system framework has appeared in Alter (2002, 2003, 2008, 2013) and elsewhere. The work system itself consists of four elements: the processes and activities, participants, information, and technologies. Five other elements must be included in even a rudimentary understanding of a work system’s operation, context, and significance. Those elements are the products/services produced, customers, environment, infrastructure, and strategies. Customers may also be participants in a work system, as happens when a doctor examines a patient. This framework is prescriptive enough to be useful in describing the system being studied, identifying problems and opportunities, describing possible changes, and tracing how those changes might affect other parts of the work system.

The definitions of the 9 elements of the work system framework are as follows:

'''Processes and activities''' include everything that happens within the work system. The term processes and activities is used instead of the term business process because many work systems do not contain highly structured business processes involving a prescribed sequence of steps, each of which is triggered in a pre-defined manner. Such processes are sometimes described as “artful processes” whose sequence and content “depend on the skills, experience, and judgment of the primary actors.” (Hill et al., 2006)  In effect, business process is but one of a number of different perspectives for analyzing the activities within a work system. Other perspectives with their own valuable concepts and terminology include decision-making, communication, coordination, control, and information processing.

'''Participants''' are people who perform the work. Some may use computers and IT extensively, whereas others may use little or no technology. When analyzing a work system the more encompassing role of work system participant is more important than the more limited role of technology user (whether or not particular participants happen to be technology users). In work systems that are viewed as service systems, it is especially important to identify activities in which customers are participants.

'''Information''' includes codified and non-codified information used and created as participants perform their work. Information may or may not be computerized. Data not related to the work system is not directly relevant, making the distinction between data and information secondary when describing or analyzing a work system.  Knowledge can be viewed as a special case of information.

'''Technologies''' include tools (such as cell phones, projectors, spreadsheet software, and automobiles) and techniques (such as management by objectives, optimization, and remote tracking) that work system participants use while doing their work. 

'''Products/services''' are the combination of physical things, information, and services that the work system produces for its customers' benefit and use. This may include physical products, information products, services, intangibles such as enjoyment and peace of mind, and social products such as arrangements, agreements, and organizations. The term "products/services” is used because the distinction between products and services in marketing and service science (Chesbrough and Spohrer, 2006) is not important for understanding work systems even though product-like vs. service-like is the basis of a series of design dimensions for characterizing and designing the things that a work system produces (Alter, 2012).

'''Customers''' are people who receive direct benefit from products/services the work system produces. Since work systems exist to produce products/services for their customers, an analysis of a work system should consider who the customers are, what they want, and how they use whatever the work system produces. Customers may include external customers who receive an enterprise's products/services and internal customers who are employed by the enterprise, such as customers of a payroll work system. Customers of a work system often are  participants in the work system (e.g., patients in a medical exam, students in an educational setting, and clients in a consulting engagement).

'''Environment''' includes the organizational, cultural, competitive, technical, and regulatory environment within which the work system operates. These factors affect system performance even though the system does not rely on them directly in order to operate. The organization’s general norms of behavior are part of its culture, whereas more specific behavioral norms and expectations about specific activities within the work system are considered part of its processes and activities.

'''Infrastructure''' includes human, informational, and technical resources that the work system relies on even though these resources exist and are managed outside of it and are shared with other work systems. Technical infrastructure includes computer networks, programming languages, and other technologies shared by other work systems and often hidden or invisible to work system participants. From an organizational viewpoint such as that expressed in Star and Bowker (2002) rather than a purely technical viewpoint, infrastructure includes human infrastructure, informational infrastructure, and technical infrastructure, all of which can be essential to a work system’s operation and therefore should be considered in any analysis of a work system.

'''Strategies''' include the strategies of the work system and of the department(s) and enterprise(s) within which the work system exists. Strategies at the department and enterprise level may help in explaining why the work system operates as it does and whether it is operating properly.

== Work system life cycle model ==

The dynamic view of a work system starts with the work system life cycle (WSLC) model, which shows how a work system may evolve through multiple iterations of four phases: operation and maintenance, initiation, development, and implementation. The names of the phases were chosen to describe both computerized and non-computerized systems, and to apply regardless of whether application software is acquired, built from scratch, or not used at all. The terms development and implementation have business-oriented meanings that are consistent with Markus and Mao’s (2004) distinction between system development and system implementation.

This model encompasses both planned and unplanned change. Planned change occurs through a full iteration encompassing the four phases, i.e., starting with an operation and maintenance phase, flowing through initiation, development, and implementation, and arriving at a new operation and maintenance phase. Unplanned change occurs through fixes, adaptations, and experimentation that can occur within any phase. The phases include the following activities:

=== Operation and maintenance ===
* Operation of the work system and monitoring of its performance
* Maintenance of the work system (which often includes at least part of information systems that support it) by identifying small flaws and eliminating or minimizing them through fixes, adaptations, or workarounds.
* On-going improvement of processes and activities through analysis, experimentation, and adaptation

=== Initiation ===
* Vision for the new or revised work system
* Operational goals
* Allocation of resources and clarification of time frames
* Economic, organizational, and technical feasibility of planned changes

=== Development ===
* Detailed requirements for the new or revised work system (including requirements for information systems that support it)
* As necessary, creation, acquisition, configuration, and modification of procedures, documentation, training material, software and hardware
* Debugging and testing of hardware, software, and documentation

=== Implementation ===
* Implementation approach and plan (pilot? phased? big bang?)
* Change management efforts about rationale and positive or negative impacts of changes
* Training on details of the new or revised information system and work system
* Conversion to the new or revised work system
* Acceptance testing

As an example of the iterative nature of a work system’s life cycle, consider the sales system in a software start-up. The first sales system is the CEO selling directly. At some point the CEO can’t do it alone, several salespeople are hired and trained, and marketing materials are produced that can be used by someone less expert than the CEO. As the firm grows, the sales system becomes regionalized and an initial version of sales tracking software is developed and used. Later, the firm changes its sales system again to accommodate needs to track and control a larger salesforce and predict sales several quarters in advance. A subsequent iteration might involve the acquisition and configuration of CRM software. The first version of the work system starts with an initiation phase. Each subsequent iteration involves deciding that the current sales system is insufficient; initiating a project that may or may not involve significant changes in software; developing the resources such as procedures, training materials, and software that are needed to support the new version of the work system; and finally, implementing the new work system.

The pictorial representation of the work system life cycle model places the four phases at the vertices of rectangle. Forward and backward arrows between each successive pair of phases indicate the planned sequence of the phases and allow the possibility of returning to a previous phase if necessary. To encompass both planned and unplanned change, each phase has an inward facing arrow to denote unanticipated opportunities and unanticipated adaptations, thereby recognizing the importance of diffusion of innovation, experimentation, adaptation, emergent change, and path dependence.

The work system life cycle model is iterative and includes both planned and unplanned change. It is fundamentally different from the frequently cited [[Systems Development Life Cycle]] (SDLC), which actually describes projects that attempt to produce software or produce changes in a work system. Current versions of the SDLC may contain iterations but they are basically iterations within a project. More important, the system in the SDLC is a basically a technical artifact that is being programmed. In contrast, the system in the WSLC is a work system that evolves over time through multiple iterations. That evolution occurs through a combination of defined projects and incremental changes resulting from small adaptations and experimentation. In contrast with control-oriented versions of the SDLC, the WSLC treats unplanned changes as part of a work system’s natural evolution.

== Work system method ==

The work system method (Alter, 2002; 2006; 2013) is a method that business professionals (and/or IT professionals) can use for understanding and analyzing a work system at whatever level of depth is appropriate for their particular concerns. It has evolved iteratively starting in around 1997. At each stage, the then current version was tested by evaluating the areas of success and the difficulties experienced by MBA and EMBA students trying to use it for a practical purpose. A version called “work-centered analysis” that was presented in a textbook has been used by a number of universities as part of the basic explanation of systems in organizations, to help students focus on business issues, and to help student teams communicate. Ramiller (2002) reports on using a version of the work system framework within a method for “animating” the idea of business process within an undergraduate class. In a research setting, Petrie (2004) used the work system framework as a basic analytical tool in a Ph.D. thesis examining 13 ecommerce web sites. Petkov and Petkova (2006) demonstrated the usefulness of the work system framework by comparing grades of students who did and did not learn about the framework before trying to interpret the same ERP case study. More recent evidence of the practical value of a work system approach is from Truex et al. (2010, 2011), which summarized results from 75 and later 300 management briefings produced by employed MBA students based on a work system analysis template. These briefings contained the kind of analysis that would be discussed in the initiation phase of the WSLC, as decisions were being made about which projects to pursue and how to proceed.

Results from analyses of real world systems by typical employed MBA and EMBA students indicate that a systems analysis method for business professionals must be much more prescriptive than [[soft systems methodology]] (Checkland, 1999).  While not a straitjacket, it must be at least somewhat procedural and must provide vocabulary and analysis concepts while at the same time encouraging the user to perform the analysis at whatever level of detail is appropriate for the task at hand. The latest version of the work system method is organized around a general problem-solving outline that includes:

* Identify the problem or opportunity
* Identify the work system that has that problem or opportunity (plus relevant constraints and other considerations)
* Use the work system framework to summarize the work system
* Gather relevant data.
* Analyze using design characteristics, measures of performance, and work system principles.
* Identify possibilities for improvement.
* Decide what to recommend
* Justify the recommendation using relevant metrics and work system principles.

In contrast to systems analysis and design methods for IT professionals who need to produce a rigorous, totally consistent definition of a computerized system, the work system method:

* encourages the user to decide how deep to go
* makes explicit use of the work system framework and work system life cycle model
* makes explicit use of work system principles.
* makes explicit use of characteristics and metrics for the work system and its elements.
* includes work system participants as part of the system (not just users of the software)
* includes codified and non-codified information
* includes IT and non-IT technologies.
* suggests that recommendations specify which work system improvements rely on IS changes, which recommended work system changes don’t rely on IS changes, and which recommended IS changes won’t affect the work system’s operational form.

'''''Zero Punctuation''''' is a [[Web series|series]] of video game reviews created by English comedy writer and [[Video game journalism|video game journalist]] [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]]. Since the series began in 2007, over 500 episodes have been created, which have been published weekly by internet magazine ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''. Episodes typically range from 5 to 6 minutes in length. Videos provide [[caustic humour]], rapid-fire delivery, [[visual gag]]s and critical insight into recently released video games, with occasional reviews of older games.

== History ==
Prior to Zero Punctuation, Croshaw primarily authored content for his blog, ''Fully Ramblomatic'', and would occasionally review video games, often with an emphasis on humor and criticism.&lt;ref name="fullyramblomatic-reviews"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/reviews/ |title=Reviews on FullyRamblomatic |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |year=2008 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, Croshaw uploaded two game reviews in video format to [[YouTube]] in the same style that would eventually be used for Zero Punctuation: one of the [[Game demo|demo]] of ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]], and the other of ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable: The Lost Chapters]]'' for the [[Personal computer|PC]]. Both were well-received and ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' was one of several publishers to offer Croshaw a contract.&lt;ref name="gamespotinterview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6235040/pressspotting-ramblin-with-ben-yahtzee-croshaw |title=PressSpotting: Ramblin' with Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw |first=Kyle |last=Orland |date=March 22, 2008 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Zero Punctuation" refers to the speed of Croshaw's narration. Since its creation, the series has become popular in the gaming community.&lt;ref name="gamespotinterview" /&gt; Video game developers and publishers have occasionally acknowledged Croshaw's reviews of their games, and at least one [[internet meme]] has resulted from Zero Punctuation.&lt;ref name="kotakumeme"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5307391/infamous-defeats-prototype-in-cross+dressing-playoff |title=inFamous Defeats Prototype in Cross-Dressing Playoff |first=Owen |last=Good |date=July 4, 2009 |work=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamerinterview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/08/05/community-heroes-yahtzee-of-zero-punctuation/ |title=Community heroes: Yahtzee, for Zero Punctuation |first=Tom |last=Francis |date=August 5, 2010 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of every year, Croshaw creates special episodes of Zero Punctuation discussing what he believes were the best and worst games of the year; a practice that started at the end of 2008. He has occasionally dedicated episodes to new technologies or milestones in video gaming rather than games, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] and the coming of the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation of consoles]].&lt;ref name="zpkinect"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/4863-Kinect |title=Zero Punctuation - Kinect |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=October 26, 2011 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/7417-Next-Gen-Buyers-Guide |title=Zero Punctuation - Next Gen Buyer's Guide |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=June 5, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, Yahtzee has released a sub-series of Zero Punctuation, titled "Zero Punctuation’s occasional guide to &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through;"&gt;retarded&lt;/span&gt; special moments in gaming history", where he looks back upon events or periods in gaming that garnered widespread, often infamous, attention; these include the video game ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which helped contribute to the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game industry crash of 1983]], and the controversial ''[[Hot Coffee mod|Hot Coffee]]'' mod for ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E.T. - "The Worst Game Ever"|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/9625-E-T-The-Worst-Game-Ever|website=The Escapist|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Coffee|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/117180-Zero-Punctuation-hot-coffee|website=The Escapist|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2009, Croshaw has also been writing a column on The Escapist known as ''Extra Punctuation''. These articles were originally published every Tuesday and often supplement the previous week's review by discussing a certain topic or trend exhibited by that game. However, after several years writing the column on a weekly basis, Croshaw began to produce entries less frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation|title=Extra Punctuation|publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
[[File:Zero Punctuation fuel screenshot.png|thumb|200px|left|Typical Zero Punctuation imagery, describing Croshaw's confusion with obtaining spaceship fuel in ''[[Starbound]]'']]

In Zero Punctuation, Croshaw usually reviews a game or games in a highly critical manner using rapid-fire speech delivery accompanied by minimalistic cartoon imagery and animation on a distinctive yellow background, which illustrates what is being said or provides an [[irony|ironic]] counterpoint to it. Subtle references or jokes may be inserted to the visuals for comic effect or to add additional context to the narration. His reviews are intended to be humorous with constant usage of puns, analogies, metaphors, and [[Black comedy|dark humour]] accompanied by liberal use of [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/interview-zero-punctuations-ben-yahtzee-croshaw-reveals-all/|title=Interview: Zero Punctuation's Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw reveals all|first=Nate|last=Lanxon|date=November 4, 2009|website=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/05/zero-punctuation-yahtzee-crys-about-dmc4/|title=Zero Punctuation: Yahtzee cries about DMC4|first=Terrence|last=StasseMarch 5, 2008|website=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|title=Zero Punctuation Review Terrorizes EA Game Development|magazine=[[GameAxis Unwired]]|date=April 2008|issue=55|issn=0219-872X|publisher=[[SPH Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croshaw usually substitutes the main character or himself with his own [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]], a cartoon man distinguished by a [[trilby]]. Another character used often is an [[imp]]-like creature (originally meant to resemble a "darkling" from ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'') which represents antagonists, animals, or less important characters from a video game. Video games, developers, countries, and other entities are often [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] as box arts, logos, or flags with arms and legs when they are being addressed directly, or when an action by that entity is being explained.

Zero Punctuation opens and closes with a [[Theme music|theme song]], a rock track composed and performed by Ian Dorsch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/content/music |title=The Escapist : Sound and Music |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ending credits usually feature humorous notes or other information relating to the review, as well as imagery of characters from the review engaging in [[slapstick]], however in 2014, the videos posted on YouTube omit the credit sequences. Prior to mid-2008, Zero Punctuation featured commercial songs at the beginning and end of each episode, which were usually related to the context of, or at odds with the game in question, such as [[Ramones|The Ramones]]' "[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]" and [[Eric Johnson]]'s "[[Cliffs of Dover (composition)|Cliffs of Dover]]" at the beginning and end, respectively, of his review of ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''.

The series' format has proved inspirational for several other web series, such as the critical and educational series [[Extra Credits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Floyd|first=Daniel|title=Video Games and Storytelling|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jdG2LHair0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CGP Grey]].&lt;ref name="H.I. #13: Nobody Owns the Facts"&gt;{{cite podcast|last2=Grey|first2=CGP|last1=Haran|first1=Brady|title=Nobody Owns the Facts|url=http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/13|work=Hello Internet|number=13|publisher=Hellointernet.fm|accessdate=2014-06-17|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://www.relay.fm/cortex/10 |title=Cortex #10: Zero Artistic Skills |website=Cortex |publisher=Relay FM |host=Grey, C. G. P.; Hurley, Myke |date=August 14, 2015 |accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical style==
Croshaw, more often than not, provides highly critical reviews of games, usually pointing out the faults that he implies other professional reviewers ignore in high-profile releases.&lt;ref name="pcgamerinterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mailbag"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/37-Mailbag-Showdown |title=Zero Punctuation - Mailbag Showdown |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=May 7, 2008 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tends to disdain certain overused tropes and conventions in video games, such as [[quick time event]]s, highly common uses of [[Motion controller|motion controls]], [[cover system|cover-based shooting]] and unbalanced emphasis on [[Video game graphics|graphics]] over story or [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="zpkinect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zpuncharted"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/27-Uncharted-Drakes-Fortune |title = ZeroPunctuation - Uncharted: Drake's Fortune |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=February 27, 2008 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zptlou"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/7638-The-Last-of-Us |title=Zero Punctuation - The Last of Us |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=July 3, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also disapproves of game franchises that release sequels in rapid succession, such as ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'', and ''[[Call of Duty]]''.&lt;ref name="zptop5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/8642-Top-5-Games-of-2013 |title=Zero Punctuation - Top 5 Games of 2013 |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 1, 2014 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croshaw generally does not review certain genres of games, and has openly admitted to not liking most [[Japanese role-playing game|JRPG]]s, [[real-time strategy]] games, [[fighting game]]s, or [[Simulation video game|simulation games]]. More recently{{When|date=August 2018}}, he has begun disliking military-themed [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[Medal of Honor (video game series)|Medal of Honor]]'', and ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'' for being what he believes to be extremely similar in gameplay, poor in ethics, and contrived in story, while using the moniker "spunkgargleweewee" to differentiate them from other styles of first-person shooter game.&lt;ref name="zp2012"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6677-Top-5-of-2012 |title=Zero Punctuation - Top 5 of 2012 |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 2, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/2486-Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops |title=Zero Punctuation - Call of Duty: Black Ops |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=September 5, 2007 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Croshaw|first1=Ben|date=November 7, 2012|title=Zero Punctuation - Medal of Honor Warfighter &amp; Doom 3 BFG Edition|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6492-Medal-of-Honor-Warfighter-Doom-3-BFG-Edition|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often criticizes publishers or developers with practices that he believes are in some way damaging to [[video games industry]] or otherwise unacceptable, such as [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="destructoid"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-ben-yahtzee-croshaw-69631.phtml |title=Destructoid interview: Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw |date=February 11, 2008 |work=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Zero Punctuation episodes are usually intended to highlight Croshaw's criticisms of video games, his general opinions are not universally negative, and any positive feelings towards the aspects of a game will usually be explicitly stated.&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt; A number of video games have received favorable ''Zero Punctuation'' reviews, which include some of his all-time favorite games such as ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'', ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', and ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reddit AMAA |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/glt5k/iam_yahtzee_croshaw_off_of_the_escapists_zero/c1ojct7 |title=IAM Yahtzee Croshaw off of the Escapist's Zero Punctuation, AMAA |publisher=[[Reddit.com]] |date= |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Silent Hill 2|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/878-Silent-Hill-2|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Prince of Persia Retrospective|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/183-Prince-of-Persia-Retrospective|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Shadow of the Colossus|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/1924-Shadow-of-the-Colossus|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croshaw had no criticisms for another favorite, the video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Puncation - The Orange Box|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/10-The-Orange-Box|website=The Escapist|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although by the time ''[[Portal 2 (video game)|Portal 2]]'' was released approximately 4 years later, he stated that the only flaw of the first ''Portal'' was its fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Puncation - Portal 2|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/3153-Portal-2|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened his review of ''[[BioShock]]'' by saying "nobody likes it when I'm being nice to a game," referring to the negative reception of his favorable review of ''[[Psychonauts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/4-BioShock |title=Zero Punctuation - BioShock |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=November 24, 2010 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croshaw cites the work of British television critic and PC Zone journalist [[Charlie Brooker]] as the "main inspiration" for his own reviewing style, as well as the writings of [[Douglas Adams]], Sean "[[Seanbaby]]" Riley, [[Victor Lewis-Smith]], and [[Old Man Murray]]'s [[Chet Faliszek]] and [[Erik Wolpaw]].&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/games/interview-zero-punctuations-yahtzee-572875/ |title=Interview: Zero Punctuation’s Yahtzee |first=James |last=Schneider |date=February 14, 2008 |work=[[Geek.com]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/videos/zeropunctuation/2655-Yahtzee-Visits-Valve-a-Travelogue.2 |title=Yahtzee Visits Valve, a Travelogue |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=November 21, 2007 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed respect towards the late [[Roger Ebert]], noting that he "might one day aspire to being his videogaming equivalent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/7473-Videogames-as-Art |title=Extra Punctuation - Videogames as Art |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=April 27, 2010 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games of the Year==
At the end of each year since 2008, Croshaw has created episodes of Zero Punctuation showcasing his favorite and most disliked games reviewed in that year. These episodes systematically alternate between his selections for the five best and five worst of the year in ascending order. In 2008 and 2009, however, these were done in a mock awards format. In 2015, he added a new category concerning the blandest and least innovative games of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFGU79rX34 |title=Top 5 Games of 2015 (Zero Punctuation) |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 13, 2016 |work=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2013 lists, he also awarded the "Lifetime Achievement Award for Total Abhorrence" to ''[[Ride to Hell: Retribution]]'', expressing that it was so poor in quality that he hardly considered it a game but rather saw it as "congealed failure". He also stated that the game would indefinitely hold the award until a worse game came along, which he claims "should roughly be around the time [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|apes have retaken the earth.]]"&lt;ref name="zptop5" /&gt;

In 2015 he created a category where he gave his top five blandest games of 2015, which he felt had not added anything new or fresh to the franchise they were a part of. He rated [[Halo 5: Guardians]] as the year's blandest game. [[Undertale]] was awarded his Game of the Year but which had not been given its own Zero Punctuation episode beforehand. Having stated before the awards began that all games mentioned must have already been reviewed by him, he promptly gave his own last-minute opinion by merely stating "Undertale is a good game".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Zero Punctuation : Top 5 Games of 2015|url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/116617-Top-5-Best-and-Worst-Games-of-2015|website = The Escapist|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
