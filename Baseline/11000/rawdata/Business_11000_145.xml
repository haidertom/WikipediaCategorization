The [[Coca-Cola]] sign in [[Punto Obelisco]] is an animated [[LED]] sign in front of the [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires]]. It consists of two large screens located over the facade of a building in Diagonal Norte and Carlos Pellegrini streets. The first screen is 21 x 21 meters and the second one is 6 x 21 meters. There has been a Coca-Cola sign in the location for fifty years, but this is the first one that uses LED technology.

'''Binondo''' is a district in [[Manila]] and is referred to as the city's [[Chinatown]] and is the world's oldest Chinatown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/388446/lifestyle/food/binondo-new-discoveries-in-the-world-s-oldest-chinatown New discoveries in the world's oldest Chinatown GMA news]&lt;/ref&gt; Its influence extends beyond to the places of [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]], [[San Nicolas, Manila|San Nicolas]].

Binondo is the center of commerce and trade of [[Manila]], where all types of business run by Filipino-Chinese thrive.

Noted residents include [[St. Lorenzo Ruiz]], the Filipino [[protomartyr]], and [[Venerable]] [[Mother Ignacia del Espiritu Santo]], founder of the Congregation of the [[Religious of the Virgin Mary]].

== Etymology ==
Numerous theories on the origin of the name "Binondo", and that of "Tondo", its neighboring district, have been put forward.  Philippine National Artist [[Nick Joaquin]] suggested that the names might have been derived from the archaic spelling of the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] term "''binondoc''" (modern orthography: ''binundók''), or mountainous, referring to Binondo's originally hilly terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Joaqiun  | first = Nick  | authorlink = Nick Joaqiun  | coauthors =   | title =Manila, My Manila: A History for the Young  | publisher = Anvil Publishing, Inc.  | date = 1990  | location = City of Manila  | pages =   | volume =  | edition =   | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 978-9715693134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  French linguist Jean-Paul Potet, however, has suggested that the river mangrove ([[Aegiceras corniculatum]]), which at the time was called "tundok" ("tinduk-tindukan" today), is the most likely origin of the term, with the 'Bi-" prefix in "Binondo" indicating Binondo's location relative to tondo.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book

Founded in 1594, Binondo was created by Spanish Governor [[Luis Pérez Dasmariñas]] as a permanent settlement for Chinese immigrants (the Spanish called the Chinese ''[[sangley]]s'') who [[religious conversion|convert]]ed to [[Catholicism]]. It was across the river from the walled city of [[Intramuros]], where the Spaniards resided. Originally it was intended to replace the [[Parian (Manila)|Parian]] near Intramuros, where the Chinese were first confined. The Spanish gave a land grant for Binondo to a group of Chinese merchants and artisans in perpetuity, tax-free and with limited self-governing privileges.

The Spanish [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] fathers made Binondo their parish and succeeded in converting many of the residents to Catholicism. Binondo soon became the place where Chinese immigrants converted to Catholicism, intermarried with [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Filipino women and had children, who became the Chinese ''[[mestizo]]'' community. Over the years, the Chinese mestizo population of Binondo grew rapidly. This was caused mainly because the lack of Chinese immigrant females and the Spanish officials' policy of expelling or killing (in conflicts) Chinese immigrants who refused to convert. 

In 1603 a Chinese revolt took place led by Juan Suntay, a wealthy Catholic Chinese. It was put down by joint Spanish and Filipino forces led by [[Luis Pérez Dasmariñas]]. In the aftermath most of the 20,000 Chinese that composed the colony were killed. The revolt took place right after a visit to Manila by three official Chinese representatives who disclosed they were searching for "a mountain of gold". This strange claim prompted the Spanish to conclude that there was an imminent invasion from China in the making. At the time the local Chinese outnumbered the Spaniards by twenty to one, and Spanish authorities feared that they would join the invading forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Hua-ch’iao tui-yu Fei-lu-pin (The Overseas Chinese in the Philippines) | author=Chi Tien, Liu | year=1955 | location=Manila | pages=37–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese afterward played down those events in an attempt to preserve their commercial interests. In 1605 a Fukien official issued a letter claiming that the Chinese who had participated in the revolt were unworthy of China's protection, describing them as "deserters of the tombs of their ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Relation of China to her Nationals Abroad | author=MacNair, H.F. | year=1923 | pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the brief [[British occupation of Manila]], between 1762 and 1764, Binondo was bombarded on several occasions and some of its structures destroyed. Many Spanish, Mestizos, Chinese and Filipinos were killed and brought into prisons indiscriminately.&lt;ref name="Backhouse"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Secretary at War to Mr. Secretary Conway | author=Backhouse, Thomas | authorlink=Calendar of Home Office Papers, War Office | year=1765 | publisher=British Library | location=London | pages=v. 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Old Binondo Church.jpg|thumb|330x330px|Binondo Church]]
Binondo became the main center for business and finance in Manila for the ethnic Chinese, Chinese mestizos and Spanish Filipinos. During the Spanish colonial period, many ''esteros'' (canals) were constructed in the Binondo area, from where they entered the [[Pasig River]]. Among the many who married at the historic Binondo Church was [[Andres Bonifacio]] in 1895, who became a hero of the [[Philippine Revolution]]. 

Before [[World War II]], Binondo was the centre of a banking and financial community which included insurance companies, commercial banks and other financial institutions from Britain and the United States. These banks were located mostly along ''[[Escólta]]'', which used to be called the "Wall Street of the Philippines". 

After the war and new development, most businesses began to relocate to the newer area of [[Makati]]. During the financial crisis of the early 1980s, it had the moniker "Binondo Central Bank", as the local Chinese businessmen engaged in massive [[black market]] trading of US dollars, which often determined the national peso-dollar exchange rate. Given its rich historical and financial significance, Binondo is said to have one of the highest land values nationwide.

'''Chooks-to-Go''' is a chain of stores owned by Bounty Agro Ventures, Inc.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} (BAVI), a privately owned company operating in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="PS"/&gt; It offers [[Roasting|roast]] [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] and [[processed meat]]s for [[take-out|off-premises consumption]] and is the largest roasted chicken retail business in the country.&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.philstar.com/business-life/2012-08-20/839973/hidden-champions-philippine-business | title=The hidden champions of Philippine business | publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]'' | date=August 20, 2012 | accessdate=13 February 2014 | author=Lee Flores, Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chooks-to-Go currently has close to a thousand outlets. The majority are in suburban areas and small towns, enabling access to a larger part of the population. The product mix is adjusted to suit local preferences.

[[File:Chooks-to-Go Outlet Facade.jpg|thumb|A Chooks-to-Go outlet]]

The company has 23 processing plants across the country, allowing logistical and processing flexibility to match daily orders. A cold-chain system delivers fresh products every day. Food safety is constantly monitored, with [[HACCP]] compliance underway.

Chooks-to-Go is an official partner of the [[Gilas Pilipinas program]] for the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippine men's basketball team]] since 2016.

==History==
Chooks-to-Go was launched by Bounty Agro Ventures, Inc. in 2009. Its name combines "[[chooks]]" (the Australian casual term for chicken) with "to-go" to indicate its [[take-out]]-only format. To differentiate its products from those of competitors, it is marketed as the only roast chicken that can be enjoyed without the use of sauce (''masarap kahit walang sauce''). This caters both to the Filipinos' love for family gatherings, and the growing market segment of busy consumers with limited time for food preparation.

Since its launch, sales have stabilized to near industry-level average volume per store. To reach out to more customers, the company opened more outlets. By the end of 2011, Chooks-to-Go had more stores than the next five most-numerous roast chicken chains combined. In 2012, it was recognized as the top chicken-focused restaurant chain in the country.&lt;ref&gt;(2012, July. The Poultry Perspective. Entrepreneur Magazine, 43)&lt;/ref&gt;

To keep up with the growth, the brand expanded its broiler and breeder operations. Currently, around 200,000 birds are processed daily, with about half of this set aside for Chooks-to-Go outlets. The company targets an annual production of around 100 million birds by the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldpoultry.net/Home/General/2013/3/Philippines-Chooks-to-Go-is-a-Bounty-success-story-1195658W/ | title=Philippines’ Chooks to Go is a Bounty success story | publisher=World Poultry | date=March 14, 2013 | accessdate=13 February 2014 | author=Buranakanonda, Apisit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an awarding ceremony held  last December 11, 2013 entitled “Volume VIII Second Certificate Superbrands Accreditation and Awarding of Certificate," Chooks-to-Go was the singular roasted chicken brand selected to carry the Superbrands Awards Seal for 2013 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;"Superbranding and Marketing Success." The Manila Times. N.p., 26 Jan. 2014. Web. &lt;http://manilatimes.net/superbranding-and-marketing-success/70847/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh Chicken, Chicken Cut-Ups and Marinado are available under the Chooksie's brand.

A full service outlet carries 11 SKUs, including chilled dressed chicken and marinated products.

==Operations==
Store personnel are trained and constantly evaluated to maintain high standards of operation and quality of service. Recent results from a UAI study by Consumer Vibe Asia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumer-vibe.com/ Consumer Vibe Asia Incorporated | Full-Service Boutique Market Research Company in the Philippines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (2012 Project Seneca) showed  a best-in-class satisfaction score of 7.5 out of 10, for Chooks-To-Go in the food services arena. To keep quality at the desired level, the brand established the BAVI Academy, which provides in-house training for outlet personnel, and other areas of operations.

Chooks-to-Go has a delivery service for certain areas for a minimal fixed delivery fee of PHP30. Customer Service Associates take telephone orders and relay these to hubs, with software automatically determining the best hub based on customer location.

For marketing, Chooks-to-Go periodically conducts promotions, which may be on a national or local level. Site selection guidelines are strictly observed, while pre-opening campaigns for new stores are held and in-store merchandising is standardized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.inquirer.net/3930/a-big-success-that-has-gone-unnoticed | title=A big success that has gone unnoticed | publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' | date=June 11, 2011 | accessdate=13 February 2014 | author=Arceo-Dumlao, Tina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chose''' (pronounced: {{IPAc-en|ʃ|əʊ|z}}, French for "thing") is a term used in [[common law]] tradition to refer to rights in property, specifically a combined bundle of rights.&lt;ref&gt;Gullifer and Payne ''Corporate Finance Law'' Chapters 7.1-7.6, Hart Publishing, Second Edition 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A chose describes the enforcement right which a party possesses in an object. The use of ''Chose'' extends from the English use of French within the courts.&lt;ref&gt;WS Holdsworth 'The History of the Treatment of Choses in Action by the Common Law' (1920) 33 Harvard LR 967, cf Goode and Gullifer Legal Problems of Credit and Security, 6th Edition, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In English and commonwealth law, all [[personal property|personal things]] fall into one of two categories, either '''choses in action''' and '''choses in possession'''.&lt;ref&gt;Re BCCI (No 8)[1998] AC 214 also Cf sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=271&lt;/ref&gt; English law uses a ''chose'' to refer to a bundle of rights, traditionally relating to property which may be utilised in certain circumstances. Thus, a ''Chose in action'' refers to a bundle of personal rights which can only be enforced or claimed by a chose-holder bringing an action through the court to enforce the action. In English law, this category is enormously wide.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1920"&gt;WS Holdsworth 'The History of the Treatment of Choses in Action by the Common Law' (1920) 33 Harvard LR 96&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted with a ''Chose in Possession'' which represents rights which can be enforced or acquired by taking physical possession of the chose. This may be, for example a legal mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;The Aliakmon [1986] AC 786&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''choses in possession'' and 'choses in action'' create separate proprietary interests. What differs between each is the method in which each ''chose'' may be enforced. This is dependent on the possessory nature of the reference object.&lt;ref&gt;Quest 'Taking Security over bitcoins and other virtual currency' (2015) 7 JIBFL&lt;/ref&gt;''

Alternative, historical uses includes a '''chose local''', a thing annexed to a place, such as a mill; a '''chose transitory''', something movable that can be carried from place to place.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Chose in action==
A '''chose in action''' or ''thing in action''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080419024654/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/bj/harm/not42.html Canadian Department of Justice. Bijural Terminology Records]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/things_in_action/|title=Things in action|last=Litvin|first=Michael|date=2009-10-08|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2016-07-13}} Also known as a Chose in suspense&lt;/ref&gt; is a right to sue. It has been made trite law, since ''[[Torkington v Magee]]'', that a ''chose in action'' is a legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action. It is therefore a categorisation of interests in assets, the enforcement of which cannot be secured without the use of a court.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1920"/&gt; It is an [[intangible asset|intangible]] [[personal property|property]] right recognised and protected by the law, that has no existence apart from the recognition given by the law, and that confers no present possession of a [[tangible property|tangible]] object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8)]] [1998] AC 214&lt;/ref&gt; Since incorporeal assets such as claims for repayment of debts, or assigned rights in contracts cannot be subject to possession, they cannot be categorised as ''choses in possession''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8)]] [1998] AC 214, Brice v Bannister (1878) 3 QBD 569 at 573, (Lord Coleridge)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In certain circumstances, the ''chose in action'' creates a separate proprietary right, independent from the property in which it may reference.&lt;ref&gt;Re BCCI (No 8), Re Adams [2004] EWHC 2379&lt;/ref&gt; This new property can be subject to charges or can be assigned. For example, a right to enforce and receive payment for a [[debt]], obtain money by way of [[damages]] for breach of [[contract]], or receive recompense for a wrong is a chose in action. Two consequences result from this, firstly, they are claims which cannot be executed by the chose-holder without the enforcement of legal proceedings. Second, these examples may be themselves [[Assignment (law)|assigned]], [[novation|novated]], or otherwise used by the chose-holder.&lt;ref&gt;M A Clarke, R J A Hooley, R J C Munday, L S Sealy, A M Tettenborn, P G Turner ''Commercial Law: Text, Cases and Materials' "Chapter 22: Assignment of Choses in Action", 5th Edition (2017) OUP, 859&lt;/ref&gt; If the economic value of the asset is the right to sue. Historically, documents which represented a title to a ''chose in action'' of a particular kind, such as [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s or other [[intangible property|documentary intangibles]] were themselves ''chose in possession'' because, similar to [[promissory notes]] they were [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable]] and thus could be physically seised. That is to say, they were transferred solely by delivery of the document themselves. Today, most bonds and other financial instruments have been [[Dematerialization (securities)|dematerialised]] and are issued as a single [[Central securities depository|global note]]. The consequence of this is that most financial instruments are now ''choses in action''held by the beneficial party against the broker holding assets in a securities depository such [[CREST (securities depository)|CREST]], where investors own interlocking interests in trusts, rather than the actual issued note.&lt;ref&gt;Goode and Gullifer Legal Problems of Credit and Security, 6th Edition, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The development of dematerialised securities brings some objects which are termed as ''chose in action'' today full circle, such as bonds or bill of lading which the court first developed as ''choses in action'', and which, without the use of a negotiable instrument no longer operate as ''choses in possession''. Currently, claims which are treated as being "locked up" inside the paper includes [[pledge (law)|pledge]], [[Negotiable instrument|negotiables]], and custodial [[bailment]].
 
''Choses in Action'' are particularly crucial to the assignment of interests in law, and thus play a crucial role in the operation and coordination of the financial markets. Certain rights, such as a claim to rescission of a mortgage is a right of action, but ''not'' a ''chose in action'' or part of one that can be assigned.&lt;ref&gt;Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 ALL ER 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the category is often broadly construed, there have been numerous attempts to expand the category to allow new intangible assets to fall within the chose in action.

===Effect of Fusing of Chancery and Common Law===
The chose can either be legal or equitable. Prior to the [[Judicature Acts]], which fused the courts of Equity and the Common law into a single jurisdiction, where the chose could be recovered only by an action at law, as a debt (whether arising from contract or [[tort]]), it was termed a legal chose in action; where the chose was recoverable only by a suit in equity, as a legacy or money held upon a trust, it was termed an equitable chose in action. Before the Judicature Acts, a legal chose in action was not assignable, i.e., the [[assignee]] could not [[lawsuit|sue]] at law in his own name. To this rule there were two exceptions:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=271}}
# the crown had always been able to assign choses in action that are certain, such as an ascertained debt, but not those that are uncertain; and
# assignments valid by operation of law, e.g., on [[marriage]], [[death]], or [[bankruptcy]]. On the other hand, however, by the [[law merchant]], which is part of the law of England, and which disregards the rules of [[common law]], [[bills of exchange]] were freely assignable.
Prior to this point, the courts of equity could not enforce a legal chose in action and vice versa. The consequence was that, with these and certain [[statutory]] exceptions (e.g., actions on policies of insurance), an action on an assigned chose in action must have been brought at law in the name of the [[assignor]], though the sum recovered belonged in equity to the assignee. All choses in action being in equity assignable, except those altogether incapable of being assigned, in equity the assignee might have sued in his own name, making the assignor a party as co-[[plaintiff]] or as [[defendant]]. The Judicature Acts made the distinction between legal and equitable choses in action of no importance. The [[Judicature Act of 1873]], s. 25 (6), enacted that the legal right to a debt or other legal ''chose in action'' could be passed by absolute assignment in writing under the hand of the assignor.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=271}}  This was later updated by the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] s136 which outlined that assignment must be&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/136&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In writing
* Is absolute, and not by charge only 
* and written notice has been given to the obligor. 
These requirements are significant because without notice, it prevents the assignee from suing on the debt. Until the debtor has given notice, [[set-off (law)|set-off]]s continue to arise between the assignor and the debtor, the debtor does not know to pay anyone other than the debtor; and the assignee may lose priority to subsequent assignees who do provide notice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dearle v Hall]] (1828) 3 Russ 1&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between present and future choses in action has been likened to the difference between a tree and its fruit.

==Chose in possession==
A ''chose in possession''' is a phrase referring to a bundle of rights and remedies, (which in England are inextricably linked),&lt;ref&gt;See Browne-Wilkinson VC in Spain v Christie, Manson, &amp; Woods [1986] 3 All ER 28 at 35&lt;/ref&gt; of an object of [[tangible]] [[personal property]] that can be physically possessed by the owner and can be transferred by delivery. Relation, or rather, capacity of control and apparent dominion is required as the foundation of the alleged ''chose in possession''. This is impossible with incorporeal rights. Possession and possession-based techniques are of little relevance to modern financial markets, but still play a substantial role in commercial and retail lending.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;D Wines International (in liquidation) [2014] EWCA Civ 215&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore a ''chose in possession'' denotes not only the right to enjoy or possess a thing, but also the actual or constructive enjoyment of it. The possession may be absolute or qualified. It is absolute when the person is fully and completely the [[proprietor]] or owner of the thing; it is qualified when he "has not an exclusive right, or not a permanent right, but a right that may sometimes subsist and at other times not subsist", as in the case of animals ''[[ferae naturae]]'' ("of a [[feral]] nature", or wild). A chose in possession is freely transferable by delivery. Previous to the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882|Married Women's Property Act]] of 1882, a wife's choses in possession became vested in her husband immediately upon her marriage, while her choses in action did not belong to her husband until he had converted them to possession. However, this difference is now practically obsolete.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=271}}

In practice, there is little difference between the utility of a chose in possession and a chose in action, outside of [[insolvency]]. However, a Chose in possession is particularly important in view of [[insolvency]] as the possessory right of the asset allows for enforcement of security irrespective of the solvency of the company. Where an asset is (1) unique and cannot be replicated, such as shares in a company amounting to board control; (2) a proprietary interest wherein account of profits of the original owed item; or (3) procedural remedies; exist, a chose in possession will be crucial in enforcement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11777">The '''Common Final Examination (CFE)''' is the last [[Test (assessment)|examination]] [[Chartered Professional Accountant|CPA Students]] took in pursuit of the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation in Canada. The 3-day CFE is also reputed to be among the world's most challenging professional exams where students are required to use an integrative business thinking model to obtain the designation. Previously known as the Uniform Evaluation (UFE), the UFE has been discontinued following the unification of the three accounting designations (CA, CMA, CGA) in [[Canada]] and [[Bermuda]] in June 2015.

Administered nationally by [[CPA Canada]], and conducted regionally by the provincial/regional orders, the CFE is written over the course of three sequential days and is the culmination of years of study in [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[corporate finance]], [[performance management]], [[taxation]] and other business-related university courses. Writing the CFE requires successful completion of preliminary education requirements including CPA preparatory courses and Professional Education Program (PEP). Upon passing the CFE and 30 months of approved practical experiences, the candidate will become a [[Chartered Professional Accountant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The new Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) certification program: Overview |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/why-become-a-cpa/the-cpa-certification-program/the-cpa-certification-program-overview |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Common Final Exam is typically offered once per year in September (Fall). Sometimes, it may be offered twice a year in Spring and Fall (such as May and September 2016). The upcoming CFE dates are: September 11 - September 13, 2019. Two CFEs are scheduled for 2020, between May 26 - May 29 and September 9 - September 11, 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/cpa-certification-program-evaluation/cpa-certification-capstone-1-cfe-cases |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Exam Structure ==

Students must demonstrate the depth and breadth of their abilities according to the CPA Competency Map. Students answer questions which are presented in the form of business cases that include a combination of both explicit and implicit requirements for each case's "users", followed by a list of exhibits that provide case facts from which observations, suggestions and conclusions are derived. Common scenarios include providing advice on how to conduct an audit, advising a client on the pros and cons of investing funds in a given business venture, and providing support to an organization as an internal accountant or auditor. 

All students must demonstrate "depth" in financial reporting or management accounting for the CFE, and one of the elective areas. Students should also demonstrate "breadth" in all 6 competency areas.

The 3-day exam consisted of case based simulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How each day of the CFE works |url=http://www.cfeblog.ca/2016/01/22/how-each-day-of-the-cfe-works/ |website=CFE Blog |publisher=CFE Blog |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* Day 1: candidates will have 4 hours to write a case in relation to the Capstone 1 group project. Candidates will be assessed on enabling competencies such as communications skills and professionalism, as well as some technical competencies.

* Day 2: students would choose an elective "depth" area from 4 competency areas - Performance Management, Finance, Assurance or Taxation. Day 2 will last 5 hours in length and students must be "Competent" in the chosen elective area as well as either Financial Reporting or Management Accounting. Note that students wishing to pursue a Public Accounting Licence must have passed Assurance and Taxation from their prior PEP modules and show depth in both Financial Reporting and Assurance on the CFE &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elective Depth Role |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/complete-your-designation/cpa-pep-cfe |website=CPA Ontario |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Become a Licensed Public Accountant (LPA) |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/why-cpa/program-info/public-accountant-licence |website=Public Accountant Licence |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Day 3: multiple (usually 3) multi-competency cases would be provided within a time frame of 4 hours aimed to evaluate the student's "breadth" in the competency map. A minimum "Reaching Competent (RC)" grade must be achieved for every single competency (all 6 areas). 

===Evaluation Criteria===
All CPA cases are evaluated based on "Competency Ratings". They are:
* '''Not Addressed (NA)''': Candidate has not addressed the Assessment Opportunity.
* '''Not Competent (NC)''': Candidate has addressed the Assessment Opportunity, but the analysis is incorrect or not related to the issue.
* '''Reaching Competent (RC)''': RCs and Cs are both counted towards "Breadth" test for day 3. RC candidates demonstrate more proficiency and understanding than NC, but not at the Competent level.
* '''Competent (C)''': the amount of Cs are used for the "depth" test on day 2. Competent candidates demonstrate the required competency levels as expected by a CPA.
* '''Competent with Distinction (CD)''': Candidates are not expected to achieve this high level of competency. CDs are essentially Cs in terms of exam grading.

===Pass and Fail Decision===
The evaluation decision is separate into day 1 and day 2 with day 3. A student must pass all 3 days in order to "pass the CFE". However, Day 1 is marked separately and Day 2 &amp; 3 are marked together. Therefore, a candidate can pass Day 1 and fail Day 2 &amp; 3 and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination (CFE) Enrolment FAQs |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/complete-your-designation/cpa-pep-cfe/cpa-common-final-examination/common-final-examination-enrolment-faq |website=CPA Ontario |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If a student passes Day 1 and fails Days 2 &amp; 3, the student has to write Days 2 &amp; 3 on their next attempt.
*If a student fails Day 1 and passes Days 2 &amp; 3, the student has to write Day 1 on their next attempt (the Capstone 1 case may be different and the student will need to ensure they are comfortable with the new Capstone 1 case).
*If the student fails all three days, they must rewrite all three days.

A candidate may attempt the Common Final Examination 3 times maximum. A student will be deregistered after their third unsuccessful attempt at either Core 1, Core 2, Capstone 1, Capstone 2 or the CFE. A student may not be admitted back to CPA or re-registered except in extraordinary circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination - Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.cpaontario.ca/become-a-cpa/complete-your-designation/cpa-pep-cfe/cfe-results-faqs |website=CFE Results FAQs |publisher=CPA Ontario |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pass Rates==

The exam is administered once per year during September and approximately 5,500 students attempt the exam each year.  National pass rates for 2003 to 2008 have been 65.5%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2003", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 74.5%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2004", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 74.0%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2005", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 79.3%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2006", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 74.6%,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Chartered Accountants in Canada and Bermuda: "Uniform Evaluation Report 2007", page 12. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and 71.7%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casb.com/index.php?catid=65|title=CA School of Business UFE Statistics|accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Exam results are released in late November following each September sitting of the UFE.

Beginning with the September 2009 UFE, the Board of Evaluators no longer releases statistics on pass rates.

The CFE Board of Evaluators began releasing statistics on pass rates along with Board Reports on candidate performance. The following are the first attempts of CFE Pass Rates for CFE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CPA certification program: Examination performance rates |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/cpa-certification-program-evaluation/cpa-examination-performance-rates |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* 2017 September CFE 77.6%
* 2016 September CFE 76.8%
* 2016 May CFE 68.7%
* 2015 September CFE 82.9%

== Exam Entry Method ==

Since 2005, students have been able to type in their responses on laptop computers secured with Securexam (CA) lockdown software in all regions of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cica.ca/becoming-a-ca/the-ufe/computers-in-the-ufe/index.aspx|title=Computers in the UFE|accessdate=2008-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of computer is no longer voluntary. It became a requirement to use a computer starting with the 2009 UFE.

== CFE Honour Roll &amp; Gold Medal ==
Every CFE, the Board would release the Honour Roll recipients along with the CFE results. The CFE honour roll members consists of the nation's top 1% performers on the exam and recognizes performance in the exam that demonstrated academic excellence and exceptional abilities. The Honour Roll of 68 candidates is determined as the top 1% of the first-time writers that wrote all three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common Final Examination (CFE) honour roll |url=https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/become-a-cpa/cpa-certification-program-evaluation/common-final-examination-honour-roll |website=CPA Canada |publisher=CPA Canada |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the honour roll members, a national Gold Medal (highest standing in Canada) is selected, along with 3 provincial gold medalists (top performers in their respective CPA representations). The CPA Governor General's Gold Medal (National Gold Medal) is awarded to 1 individual for a cash prize of $5,000. While each regional Gold Medalist receives a cash price of $2,500 each.

}}The '''Counter Fraud Centre ''' is the UK’s national centre of excellence on counter fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Audit Commission to be scrapped, Public Finance, 20 March 2014 http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2014/03/audit-commissions-counter-fraud-work-to-transfer-to-cipfa/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre has taken on the lead for the national counter fraud and anti-corruption strategy for local government 'Fighting Fraud Locally' and will develop new tools and services for the public sector on counter fraud and anti-corruption as well as providing thought leadership and horizon scanning. With the impending  closure of the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)]] the Centre will take responsibility for the Audit Commission’s counter fraud tools.

The Centre has taken responsibility for research, training and generating codes of practice for public sector professionals tasked with addressing the estimated £20.6 billion of public sector fraud and error in the UK. The Centre will provide services within the UK and Internationally.

The Centre is due to launch in July 2014, and is hosted by the '''[[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy]]''' ('''CIPFA''') the professional institute for [[accountant]]s working in the [[public services]]. The Centre is headed by Rachael Tiffen, former Deputy Director of the [[National Fraud Authority]].

A '''debit note''' or '''debit memorandum (memo)''' is a commercial [[document]] issued by a [[buyer]] to a [[seller]] as a means of formally requesting a [[credit note]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debit-note.asp|title=Debit Note|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2011-06-07|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debit note acts as the       [[Source document]] to the Purchase returns journal. In other words it is an evidence for the occurrence of a reduction in expenses. The [[seller]] might also issue a debit note instead of an [[invoice]] in order to adjust upwards the amount of an [[invoice]] already issued (as if the invoice is recorded in wrong value).
Debit notes are generally used in business-to-business [[Financial transactions|transactions]]. Such transactions often involve an extension of [[credit (finance)|credit]], meaning that a vendor would send a shipment of goods to a company before the goods have been paid for. Although real goods are changing hands, until an actual [[invoice]] is issued, real [[money]] is not. Rather, [[debits and credits]] are being logged in an accounting system to keep track of inventories shipped and payments ¿te gusto este articulo? Consulta más sobre el tema

'''''Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster''''' is a 2007 book by Paris-based American journalist [[Dana Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penguinspeakersbureau.com/speaker/181|title=Penguin Books Group|accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times bestseller]].

==Content==
The book examines the corporate consolidation of small family-run luxury businesses into [[luxury good]]s [[holding companies]], and their process of "democratizing" luxury by making it available for sale to the masses in the forms of handbags, clothing, and accessories. These new luxury [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s—principally [[Kering]], which owns [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]], [[Balenciaga]], [[Brioni (brand)|Brioni]], and [[Gucci]]; [[Richemont]], which owns [[Dunhill (luxury goods)|Dunhill]], [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]], [[Jaeger-LeCoultre]], [[Montblanc (company)|Montblanc]], and [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]], and [[LVMH]], which owns [[Bulgari]], [[Dior]], [[DKNY]], [[Fendi]], [[Givenchy]], [[Marc Jacobs]], [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Thomas Pink]], as well as [[De Beers]], [[TAG Heuer]], and [[Sephora]]—have achieved success with [[fashion show]]s, provocative [[Advertisement|commercials]], dressing celebrities for [[red carpet]] events, and through licensing, franchising, outlet malls, and online retailing.

According to Thomas, this trend has led to inferior quality, rampant [[outsourcing]] to developing nations, and a massive surge in both [[counterfeiting]] and the illicit activities it funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/21/books/21kaku.html|title=The Devil Wears Hermès (He Bought It at the Caesars Palace Mall in Las Vegas) |date=August 21, 2007 | work=New York Times| first=Michiko| last=Kakutani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Publishers Weekly]] wrote: "Despite her grasp of business machinations, her argument that conglomerates have stolen luxury's soul doesn't entirely wash. As her tales of quotidian vs. ultra luxury make clear, the rich and chic can still distinguish themselves, even when Las Vegas hosts the world's ritziest brands."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Deluxe-How-Luxury-Lost-Luster/dp/0143113704/ref=la_B001JP2W74_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494084856&amp;sr=1-1 Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster] amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Encompass''', the '''Enterprise Computing Association''', was the original [[computer user group]] for business customers of [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Encompass's history begins with [[DECUS]], founded in 1961, for customers of the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], which was acquired in 1998 by [[Compaq]].
The [[United States|U.S.]] Chapter incorporated as the user group Encompass U.S.

[[Hewlett-Packard]] acquired [[Compaq]] in 2002. Encompass continued as an HP user group, aimed at business customers of all of HP's hardware, software, and services.

The Encompass mission was to promote technical information exchange among its members and between the members and [[Hewlett-Packard]].

The Connect User Group Community, formed from the consolidation in May 2008 of Encompass, [[HP-Interex|Interex EMEA]], and [[ITUG]] is [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s largest user community representing more than 50,000 participants. See [[Connect (users group)]] for more information.

The Encompass Board at the time of the consolidation consisted of Nina Buik, Kristi Browder, Glen Kuykendall, Anthony Ioele, Steve Davidek, Dena Wright, John Maynen, Clyde Poole, and Bill Johnson.  Two former directors were credited with being instrumental in facilitating the consolidation, Chris Koppe and Jim Becker.

==Mission==
Encompass partnered with first [[Compaq]] and then [[Hewlett-Packard]] on national technical conferences (in the U.S.):
* CETS 2001 (Compaq Enterprise Technical Symposium): September 10–14, 2001, [[Anaheim, California]]
* HP-ETS 2002 (HP Enterprise Technical Symposium): October 7–11, [[St. Louis, Missouri]]
* HP World 2003: August 11–15, 2003, [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in partnership with [[HP-Interex|Interex]] as well as HP
* HP World 2004: August 16–20, 2004, [[Chicago, Illinois]], in partnership with Interex and HP
* HP Technology Forum 2005: October 17–20, 2005, [[Orlando, Florida]], in partnership with the user group [[OpenView Forum International]] as well as HP
* HP Technology Forum 2006: September 17–21, 2006, [[Houston, Texas]], in partnership with HP, [[ITUG]], and [[OpenView Forum International]]
* HP Technology Forum &amp; Expo 2007: June 17–21, 2007, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], in partnership with HP and ITUG

Encompass also had a number of Local User Groups (LUGs) throughout the U.S., and [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs) on various topics.

Encompass also ran [[webcast]]s, local seminars, and other programs.

Encompass manages the pre-conference seminar program and trade show at the HP Technology Forum &amp; Expo.

Non-U.S. Encompass organizations include:
*Encompass [[Canada]]
*Encompass [[New Zealand]]
*Encompass [[Australia]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18754">[[File:Macaroni closeup.jpg|thumb|[[Macaroni]] is an extruded hollow pasta]]
'''Food extrusion''' is a form of [[extrusion]] used in [[food processing]]. It is a process by which a set of mixed ingredients are forced through an opening in a perforated plate or [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] with a design specific to the food, and is then cut to a specified size by blades. The machine which forces the mix through the die is an '''extruder''', and the mix is known as the '''extrudate'''. The extruder consists of a large, rotating screw tightly fitting within a stationary barrel, at the end of which is the die.

Extrusion enables [[mass production]] of food via a continuous, efficient system that ensures uniformity of the final product. Food products manufactured using extrusion usually have a high starch content. These include some [[pasta]], [[bread]]s ([[crouton]]s, [[bread stick]]s, and [[flat bread]]s), many [[breakfast cereal]]s and ready-to-eat [[snack]]s, [[confectionery]], pre-made [[cookie dough]], some [[baby food]]s, [[Soy protein#Flours|full-fat soy]], [[textured vegetable protein]], some [[beverage]]s, and dry and semi-moist [[pet food]]s.

==Process==
[[File:DEMACO 1,000 lbs-hr Short Goods Pasta Press, 1958.jpg|thumb|right|A non-vacuum short goods pasta extruder from 1958]]
In the extrusion process, raw materials are first ground to the correct particle size, usually the consistency of coarse flour. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients are added depending on the target product; these may be liquid [[sugar]], [[fat]]s, [[dye]]s, [[meat]]s or water. [[Steam]] is injected to start the cooking process, and the preconditioned mix (extrudate) is then passed through an extruder. The extruder consists of a large, rotating screw tightly fitting within a stationary barrel, at the end of which is the die.&lt;ref name="harper"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|last=Harper|first=J.M.|title=Food extrusion|year=1978|volume=11|issue=2|pages=155–215|pmid=378548|doi=10.1080/10408397909527262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extruder's rotating screw forces the extrudate toward the die, through which it then passes. The amount of time the extrudate is in the extruder is the '''residence time'''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The extruded product usually puffs and changes texture as it is extruded because of the reduction of forces and release of moisture and heat.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt; The extent to which it does so is known as the '''expansion ratio'''. The extrudate is cut to the desired length by blades at the output of the extruder, which rotate about the die openings at a specific speed. The product is then cooled and dried, becoming rigid while maintaining porosity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the [[pressure]] generated (10–20&amp;nbsp;bar). The process can induce both [[protein denaturation]] and [[starch gelatinization]] under some conditions.

Many food extrusion processes involve a high temperature over a short time.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt; Important factors of the extrusion process are the composition of the extrudate, screw length and rotating speed, barrel temperature and moisture, die shape, and rotating speed of the blades. These are controlled based on the desired product to ensure uniformity of the output.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Moisture is the most important of these factors, and affects the mix [[viscosity]], acting to plasticize the extrudate. Increasing moisture will decrease viscosity, torque, and product temperature, and increase bulk density. This will also reduce the pressure at the die. Most extrusion processes for food processing maintain a moisture level below 40%, that is low to intermediate moisture. High-moisture extrusion is known as '''wet extrusion''', but it was not used much before the introduction of twin screw extruders (TSE), which have a more efficient conveying capability. The most important [[rheometry|rheological]] factor in the wet extrusion of high-starch extrudate is temperature.&lt;ref name="akdogan"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|last=Akdogan|first=Hülya|title=High moisture food extrusion|date=June 1999|volume=34|issue=3|pages=195–207|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2621.1999.00256.x|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1236532|type = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of salt in the extrudate may determine the colour and texture of some extruded products. The expansion ratio and airiness of the product depend on the salt [[concentration]] in the extrudate, possibly as a result of a chemical reaction between the salt and the starches in the extrudate. Colour changes as a result of salt concentration may be caused by "the ability of salt to change the water activity of the extrudate and thus change the rate of browning reactions". Salt is also used to distribute minor ingredients, such as [[food colouring|food colours]] and [[Seasoning|flavours]], after extrusion; these are more evenly distributed over the product's surface after being mixed with salt.&lt;ref name="strategies"&gt;{{cite book|title=Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States|editor1=Jane E Henney |editor2=Christine L Taylor |editor3=Caitlin S Boon |publisher=National Academies Press, National Academy of Sciences|year=2010|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|isbn=978-0-309-14805-4|pmid=21210559|author1=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake |last2=Henney |first2=J. E. |last3=Taylor |first3=C. L. |last4=Boon |first4=C. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first extruder was designed to manufacture [[sausage]]s in the 1870s.&lt;ref name="karwe"&gt;{{cite book|title=Food Engineering|volume=3|chapter=Food extrusion|last=Karwe|first=Mukund V.|publisher=Oxford Eolss Publishers Co Ltd.|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84826-946-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packaged dry pasta and [[breakfast cereal]]s have been produced via extrusion since the 1930s,&lt;ref name="akdogan"/&gt; and the method was applied to pet food production since the 1950s (first extruded dog food in 1957 - Purina Dog Chow and first extruded cat food - Purina Friskies in 1962).&lt;ref name="karwe" /&gt; It has also been incorporated into [[kitchen appliance]]s, such as [[meat grinder]]s, [[herb grinder]]s, [[coffee grinder]]s, and some types of pasta makers. A similar functional process occurs when using [[pastry bag]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Effects==
Extrusion enables mass production of food via a continuous, efficient system that ensures uniformity of the final product. This is achieved by controlling various aspects of the extrusion process. It has also enabled the production of new processed food products and "revolutionized many conventional snack manufacturing processes".&lt;ref name="riaz"/&gt;
The extrusion process results in "chemical reactions that occur within the extruder barrel and at the die".&lt;ref name="camire"&gt;{{Cite book|journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|last=Camire|first=M.E.|title=Chemical changes during extrusion cooking.

* Destruction of certain naturally occurring [[toxin]]s
* Reduction of [[microorganism]]s in the final product
* Slight increase of [[Human iron metabolism|iron]]-[[bioavailability]]
* Creation of [[Insulin resistance|insulin-desensitizing]] starches (a potential risk-factor for developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]])&lt;ref name="PMID 707920"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guy"/&gt;
* Loss of [[lysine]], an [[essential amino acid]] necessary for developmental growth and nitrogen management
* Simplification of complex [[starch]]es, increasing rates of [[tooth decay]]
* Increase of [[glycemic index]] of the [[processed food]], as the "extrusion process significantly increased the availability of carbohydrates for digestion"&lt;ref name="brenner2" /&gt;
* Destruction of [[Vitamin A]] ([[beta-carotene]])
* [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|Denaturation]]&lt;!-- this does not refer to [[denaturation (food)]] --&gt; of [[protein]]s.

The material of which an extrusion die is made can affect the final product. Compared to [[stainless steel]] dies, a pasta machine with [[bronze]] dies produces a rougher surface. This is considered to give an improved taste, as it better retains pasta sauces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.food-info.net/uk/products/pasta/production.htm |title=The industrial production of pasta |work=Food-Info.Net |publisher=Wageningen University }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Bronze die" pasta is labelled as such on retail packages, to indicate a premium product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napolina.com/text_only/ingredients.html |publisher=Napolina Ltd. |title=Ingredients |quote=Napolina's pasta range also includes a premium bronze die pasta which is extruded through bronze dies to create a rough, porous surface. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623130220/http://www.napolina.com/text_only/ingredients.html |archivedate=June 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of "extrusion cooking on nutritional quality are ambiguous",&lt;ref name="singh"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|title=Nutritional aspects of food extrusion: a review|authors=Shivendra Singh, Shirani Gamlath, Lara Wakeling|date=10 May 2007|volume=12|issue = 8|pages=916–929|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2006.01309.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as extrusion may change carbohydrates, dietary fibre, the protein and amino acid profile, vitamins, and mineral content of the extrudate in a manner that is beneficial or harmful.&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt;

High-temperature extrusion for a short duration "minimizes losses in vitamins and amino acids".&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt; Extrusion enables mass production of some food, and will "denature antinutritional factors",&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt; such as destroying [[toxin]]s or killing [[microorganism]]s. It may also improve "protein quality and digestibility",&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt; and affects the product's shape, texture, colour, and flavour.&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt;

It may also cause the fragmentation of proteins, [[starch]]es, and [[non-starch polysaccharide]]s to create "reactive molecules that may form new linkages not found in nature".&lt;ref name="camire" /&gt; This includes [[Maillard reaction]]s which reduce the nutritional value of the proteins.&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt; Vitamins with heat [[lability]] may be destroyed.&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt; {{As of|1998}}, little is known about the stability or bioavailability of [[phytochemical]]s involved in extrusion.&lt;ref name="camire" /&gt;&lt;!-- is this still the case? --&gt; Nutritional quality has been found to improve with moderate conditions (short duration, high moisture, low temperature), whereas a negative effect on nutritional quality of the extrudate occurs with a high temperature (at least 200&amp;nbsp;°C), low moisture (less than 15%), or improper components in the mix.&lt;ref name="singh" /&gt;

A 2012 research paper indicates that use of non-traditional cereal flours, such as [[amaranth]], [[buckwheat]] or [[millet]], may be used to reduce the [[glycemic index]] of breakfast cereals produced by extrusion.&lt;ref name="brenner"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Starch - Stärke|title=Amaranth, millet and buckwheat flours affect the physical properties of extruded breakfast cereals and modulates their potential glycaemic impact|last=Brennan|first=Margaret A.|last2=Menard|first2=Carine|last3=Roudaut|first3=Gaëlle|last4=Brennan|first4=Charles S.|date=19 January 2012|volume=64|issue=5|pages=392–398|doi=10.1002/star.201100150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extrudate using these cereal flours exhibits a higher bulk and product density, had a similar expansion ratio, and had "a significant reduction in readily digestible carbohydrates and slowly digestible carbohydrates".&lt;ref name="brenner" /&gt; A 2008 paper states that replacing 5% to 15% of the [[wheat flour]] and white flour with [[dietary fibre]] in the extrudate breakfast cereal mix significantly reduces "the rate and extent of carbohydrate [[hydrolysis]] of the extruded products",&lt;ref name="brenner2"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|title=Effect of inclusion of soluble and insoluble fibres into extruded breakfast cereal products made with reverse screw configuration|last=Brennan|first=Margaret A.|last2=Monro|first2=John A.|last3=Brennan|first3=Charles S.|date=December 2008|volume=43|issue=12|pages=2278–2288|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2008.01867.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; which increased the level of slowly digested carbohydrates and reduced the level of quickly digested carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="brenner2" /&gt;

==Products==
Extrusion has enabled the production of new processed food products and "revolutionized many conventional snack manufacturing processes".&lt;ref name="riaz"&gt;{{cite book|title=Extruders in Food Applications|last=Riaz|first=Mian N.|year=2000|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566767798 |page= 193 |quote=Extrusion has provided a means of manufacturing new and novel products and has revolutionized many conventional snack manufacturing processes. Extrusion equipment offers many basic design advantages that result in minimizing time, energy, and cost while at the same time increasing the degree of versatility and flexibility that was not previously available.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cheese puffs.jpg|thumb|Cheese curls made using an extruder]]
The various types of food products manufactured by extrusion typically have a high starch content.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt;  ''Directly expanded'' types include [[breakfast cereal]]s and corn curls, and are made in high temperature, low moisture conditions under [[Shear rate|high shear]]. ''Unexpanded'' products include [[pasta]], which is produced at intermediate moisture (about 40%) and low temperature. ''Texturized'' products include [[meat analogue]]s, which are made using plant proteins ("textured vegetable protein") and a long die to "impart a fibrous, meat-like structure to the extrudate",&lt;ref name="karwe" /&gt; and [[fish paste]].&lt;ref name="HandH"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Food Processing|last1=Heldman|first1=Dennis R.|last2=Hartel|first2=Richard W.|publisher=Springer|year=1997|isbn=9780834212695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- pg 255 --&gt; Confectionery made via extrusion includes [[chewing gum]], [[liquorice]], and [[toffee]].&lt;ref name="HandH" /&gt;

Some [[processed cheese]]s and cheese analogues are also made by extrusion. Processed cheeses extruded with low moisture and temperature "might be better suited for manufacturing using extrusion technology" than those at high moisture or temperature. Lower moisture cheeses are firmer and chewier, and [[cheddar cheese]] with low moisture and an extrusion temperature of 80&amp;nbsp;°C was preferred by subjects in a study to other extruded cheddar cheese produced under different conditions.&lt;ref name="jsfa"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|title=Physical and sensory characteristics of processed cheeses manufactured by extrusion technology|authors=Koushik Adhikari1, Andrea Cole, Ingolf Grün, Hildegarde Heymann, Fu-Hung Hsieh, and Harold Huff|date=June 2009|volume=89|issue=9|pages=1428–1433|doi=10.1002/jsfa.3608}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extrudate mean residence time of about 100 seconds can produce "processed cheeses or cheese analogues of varying texture (spreadable to sliceable)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|title=Continuous emulsification and gelation of dairy ingredients by HTST extrusion cooking: production of processed cheeses|last=Zuber|first=F.|last2=Mégard|first2=D.|last3=Cheftel|first3=J.C.|date=December 1987|volume=22|issue=6|pages=607–626|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1987.tb00529.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other food products often produced by extrusion include some [[bread]]s ([[crouton]]s, [[bread stick]]s, and [[flat bread]]s), various ready-to-eat [[snack]]s, pre-made [[cookie dough]], some [[baby food]]s, some [[beverage]]s, and dry and semi-moist [[pet food]]s. Specific examples include cheese curls, [[macaroni]], [[Fig Newtons]], [[jelly bean]]s, [[sevai]], and some [[french fries]].

[[Image:US-IL-Chicagoland-GoldenCorridor.PNG|200px|thumb|right|The Golden Corridor in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]]]]
The '''Golden Corridor''' is the area around the [[Jane Addams Memorial Tollway]] ([[Interstate 90 (Illinois)|Interstate 90]]), formerly known as the Northwest Tollway, in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanoverparkillinois.org/EconomicDevelopment/Demographics.htm Demographics, Hanover Park, Illinois (IL)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401065948/http://www.hanoverparkillinois.org/EconomicDevelopment/Demographics.htm |date=April 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is coined as such since the corridor generates a "gold" mine of economic profit for communities in the area.  Several [[Fortune 500]] company headquarters, [[office park]]s, [[industrial park]]s, exhibition and entertainment centers, medical facilities, hotels, shopping centers, and restaurants are located along the Golden Corridor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1724">'''GuideWorks, LLC''' is the joint venture of '''[[Comcast]]''' and '''[[Gemstar-TV Guide International]]''' that was formed in April 2004 for the purpose of creating navigation software (also known as Interactive Program Guides) for digital cable television. Comcast owns a majority stake in the venture.

The software developed by GuideWorks is widely deployed in Comcast digital cable systems throughout the USA, and delivers both [[Video On Demand]] and [[Digital Video Recorder]] features to consumers. Gemstar TV Guide markets the GuideWorks software to other cable companies.

Prior to the formation of the joint venture, Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc developed and marketed the navigation software to Comcast and other cable operators. During this period, the name [[i-Guide]] became associated with the products, which gained a reputation for strong promotion of advertising similar to the ads that appear on web pages today. This advertising aspect underwent significant deemphasis after the formation of the GuideWorks joint venture in 2004.

In 2010, Rovi, the corporate descendent of Gemstar-TV Guide, pulled out of the venture. GuideWorks is now wholly owned by Comcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Rovi|date=March 1, 2010|url=http://www.rovicorp.com/company/newscenter/pressreleases/1434_13248.htm |title=Rovi Announces Expanded Data and Patent License Agreement with Comcast|accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Aguiar was born on May 31, 1977&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flpd.org/Home/ShowDocument?id=2568&lt;/ref&gt; in Rio de Janeiro. He was one of four children&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2014-05-16/news/fl-guma-aguiar-estate-trial-openings-20140516_1_ellen-aguiar-guma-aguiar-jamie-aguiar|title=Missing Fort Lauderdale millionaire's mother, wife face off in Broward courtroom|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Ellen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/187806#.V22XnqKhNow|title='Vanished' Millionaire Guma Aguiar's Estate Divided among Heirs|website=Arutz Sheva|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{née}} Kaplan), a Jewish mother,&lt;ref name="SunSentinelTurmoil"&gt;[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-06-30/news/fl-guma-aguiar-troubled-life-20120630_1_ellen-aguiar-rocky-seas-guma-aguiar Florida Sun Sentinel: "Turmoil and depression haunted missing Fort Lauderdale millionaire Aguiar" By Linda Trischitta and Robert Nolin] June 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and Otto de Souza Aguiar,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a Christian father.

His family moved to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] when Aguiar was one year old.&lt;ref name="SunSentinelTurmoil" /&gt; He graduated from the [[Westminster Academy (Florida)|Westminster Academy Christian School]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="SunSentinelTurmoil" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Trischitta |first=Linda |url=http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/state/guma-aguiar-video-interview-captures-missing-multimillionaire-in-happier-moments |title=Guma Aguiar video: Interview captures missing multimillionaire in happier moments |publisher=Wptv.com |date=2012-04-23 |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131030095704/http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/state/guma-aguiar-video-interview-captures-missing-multimillionaire-in-happier-moments |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aguiar enrolled at [[Clemson University]] in [[Clemson, South Carolina]] but dropped out after one year.&lt;ref name="SunSentinelTurmoil" /&gt;

==Career==
Aguiar was the vice chairman and [[chief executive officer]] of [[Leor Energy]]. Aguiar began his career as a clerk on the floor of the [[New York Mercantile Exchange|NYMEX]] in 1999 where he focused on the energy markets, with particular emphasis on [[natural gas]]. Transitioning from daily trading activity to the long-term physical markets, Aguiar joined with his uncle, [[Thomas Kaplan]], in 2001 to manage a portfolio of family investments ranging from [[venture capital]] to [[private equity]] and debt. During this time, he served as a director of several public and private companies and was given responsibility for creating a U.S.-based energy company focused on aggressive early-stage oil and gas exploration. After assembling a diversified portfolio of energy properties in Louisiana and Texas, ranging from unconventional natural gas to shallow oil, Aguiar identified and executed Leor's acquisition of its flagship property in the [[Deep Bossier]] of [[East Texas]] in 2003.

In 2005, under Aguiar's executive management, Leor Energy engineered financings which fully capitalized the projects in Leor Energy LP. Included in these transactions were Leor Energy Lp industrial alliance with Encana, a natural gas producer in North America and the Leor Energy Lp joint-venture partner in the Deep Bossier. 
Under Aguiar, a [[Mezzanine capital|mezzanine financing]] with hedge-fund Amaranth Capital LLC{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} was achieved.&lt;ref name="businessweek1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=4288364&amp;privcapId=27143526&amp;previousCapId=27143526&amp;previousTitle=Leor%20Energy%20L.P |title=Guma Aguiar: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Businessweek |publisher=Investing.businessweek.com |date=2003-06-30 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leor Energy has a financial alliance with its first strategic equity partner, [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman Sachs &amp; Co]].

Aguiar joined Cadence Resources in July 2002 and served as a Member of the Board of Directors of Corporate Development until June 30, 2003.&lt;ref name="businessweek1"/&gt;

==Philanthropic activities==
Aguiar was the director of the Lillian Jean Kaplan Foundation and was involved in numerous philanthropic activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-01-25/news/0901240172_1_messiah-guma-aguiar-nephew|title=Multimillion-dollar family feud in court|work=tribunedigital-sunsentinel|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He donated more than US$8 million to fund the activities of [[Nefesh B'Nefesh]], a [[Zionist]] organization which promotes [[Aliyah]] (Jewish immigration) from North America and the United Kingdom to Israel. He was a supporter of the [[March of the Living]], which organizes educational programming in Poland and Israel to enable students to better understand the [[Holocaust]] and the rebirth of [[Zionism]] and the creation of the modern Jewish state of Israel.

For his philanthropic activities, in April 2009, [[The Jewish Week]] recognized Aguiar as one of the "36 under 36″ (one of 36 of the most influential Jewish leaders under the age of 36).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/special_sections/36_under_36/36_under_36_2009_guma_aguiar_33|title=36 Under 36 2009: Guma Aguiar, 33 - The Jewish Week|work=The Jewish Week|accessdate=14 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172755/http://www.thejewishweek.com/special_sections/36_under_36/36_under_36_2009_guma_aguiar_33|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Aguiar founded the "Defender of Jerusalem Award" which recognizes public figures who have taken uniquely strong stances in support of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Perry-in-Israel-to-Receive--53135252.html|title=Perry in Israel to Receive Defender of Jerusalem Award|work=NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Aguiar and his wife Jamie served as the co-chairs of the "Facing Tomorrow" Conference in Jerusalem organized by Israel's President [[Shimon Peres]]. During the conference, Aguiar was featured on a panel with the President and offered his vision of Israeli society and culture from the perspective of one of the country's most recognized entrepreneurs.

==Jerusalem sports==
On July 21, 2009, Aguiar announced an investment of over US$4 million to support the [[Beitar Jerusalem]] [[Football team|Football Team]] which, despite a massive fan following, had grown into [[financial distress]] and was on the brink of collapse prior to Aguiar's financial contributions. Aguiar was motivated to purchase the team out of his love for the sport combined with a passion for Jerusalem and Israel.

In September 2009, Aguiar took his commitment to Jerusalem sports to the next level when he invested over $1.5 million in the city's leading basketball franchise, [[Hapoel Jerusalem B.C.|Hapoel Jerusalem]].

Since these investments, Aguiar became a fixture in Israeli social circles and regularly met with members of Knesset and local political and business leaders.

Aguiar managed the teams and was in contact with the general managers of both Betar ([[Itzik Kornfein]]) and Hapoel (Dani Klein). In November 2009, Aguiar travelled with Kornfein to Brazil with the goal of scouting out players for the Betar team. He made an effort to be at team practices and met with the players and staff of both teams.

Beitar fans attribute Beitar's winning the [[Toto Cup]] on 26 January 2010 to Aguiar's financial backing, although it was won while Aguiar was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility. About a half an hour after winning, Itzik Kornfein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport5.co.il/articles.aspx?FolderID=282&amp;docID=72728&amp;lang=HE |title=קורנפיין נסע עם גביע הטוטו לאגיאר |publisher=Sport5.co.il |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130108072905/http://www.sport5.co.il/articles.aspx?FolderID=282&amp;docID=72728&amp;lang=HE |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; took the Toto Cup to the psychiatric hospital but was not permitted to enter. He asked the security staff to take in the trophy to the hospitalized Aguiar.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Aguiar married his [[Westminster Academy (Florida)|Westminster Academy]] high school sweetheart, Jamie Elizabeth Black.&lt;ref name=SunSentinelTurmoil /&gt; Jamie graduated from the [[University of Florida]] with a degree in Public Relations.&lt;ref name="sun-sentinel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-06-30/news/fl-guma-aguiar-troubled-life-20120630_1_ellen-aguiar-rocky-seas-guma-aguiar |title=Guma Aguiar: Missing Fort Lauderdale millionaire's life was in turmoil - Sun Sentinel |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had four children,&lt;ref name=SunSentinelTurmoil /&gt; Jacob, Lilly, Jonathan, and Leo&lt;ref name="justia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2011mc00290/383539/3/3.html|title=Document 3 :: Ellen Aguiar v.

In 2011, due to his mental illness, his wife Jamie and mother Ellen petitioned a [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] judge for guardianship over Aguiar. The court agreed, and appointed an emergency guardianship over Aguiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/troubled-florida-millionaire-guma-aguiar-missing-empty-yacht/story?id=16619645&amp;page=2 |title=Page 2: Troubled Florida Millionaire Guma Aguiar Missing After Empty Yacht Washes Ashore - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after his disappearance in June 2012, Aguiar's mother filed documents in Broward County, Florida court to become [[Conservatorship|conservator]] of his nearly $100 million fortune. In Ellen Aguiar's petition, she wrote that Guma "disappeared as the result of mental derangement or other mental cause" or disappeared "under circumstances indicating that he may have died, either naturally, or accidentally." It further stated that he suffered from "severe bipolar disorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-06-22/news/fl-guma-aguiar-missing-folo-20120621_1_fishing-boat-search-ends-petition |title=Missing millionaire Guma Aguiar - Sun Sentinel |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aguiar was sued by his uncle [[Thomas Kaplan]]. As part of that lawsuit, the judge presiding over the case, John O'Sullivan, found that Aguiar's psychosis "manifested itself in both grandiose and paranoid delusions," for example, Aguiar's belief that he (Aguiar) was being followed by snipers.&lt;ref name="forbes1"/&gt; On the day Aguiar disappeared, a federal judge in Florida issued an order appointing an independent medical examiner to see if Aguiar was psychologically sound enough for a deposition in the case.&lt;ref name="forbes1"/&gt;

[[File:Fritz Haber.png|thumb|[[Fritz Haber]], 1918]]
The '''Haber process''', also called the '''Haber–Bosch process''', is an artificial [[nitrogen fixation]] process and is the main industrial procedure for the [[ammonia production|production of ammonia]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Appl |first=M. |chapter=The Haber–Bosch Process and the Development of Chemical Engineering |title=A Century of Chemical Engineering |location=New York |publisher=Plenum Press |year=1982 |pages=29–54 |isbn=978-0-306-40895-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Appl&gt;{{Ullmann|first=Max|last=Appl|title=Ammonia|doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_143.pub2|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after its inventors, the German chemists [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]], who developed it in the first decade of the 20th century. The process converts atmospheric [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by a reaction with [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) using a metal catalyst under high temperatures and pressures:

Before the development of the Haber process, ammonia had been difficult to produce on an industrial scale,&lt;ref name=Smil_2004_Enriching&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smil|first1=Vaclav|title=Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production|date=2004|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780262693134|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hager&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hager|first1=Thomas|title=The Alchemy of Air: A Jewish genius, a doomed tycoon, and the scientific discovery that fed the world but fueled the rise of Hitler|date=2008|publisher=Harmony Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-307-35178-4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sittig|first1=Marshall|title=Fertilizer Industry: Processes, Pollution Control, and Energy Conservation|date=1979|publisher=Noyes Data Corp.|location=Park Ridge, NJ|isbn=978-0-8155-0734-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with early methods such as the [[Birkeland–Eyde process]] and [[Frank–Caro process]] all being highly inefficient.

Although the Haber process is mainly used to produce [[fertilizer]] today, during [[World War I]] it provided [[German Empire|Germany]] with a source of ammonia for the production of [[explosive]]s, compensating for the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]]' trade blockade on [[Nitratine|Chilean saltpeter]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Haber process}}

Throughout the 19th century the demand for nitrates and ammonia for use as fertilizers and industrial feedstocks had been steadily increasing. The main source was mining [[niter]] deposits. At the beginning of the 20th century it was being predicted that these reserves could not satisfy future demands &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Laylin K.|title=Nobel Laureates in Chemistry 1901–1992|date=1993|publisher=American Chemical Society|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-8412-2690-6|page=118|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and research into new potential sources of ammonia became more important. The obvious source was atmospheric nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), comprising nearly 80% of the air, however N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is exceptionally stable and will not readily react with other chemicals. Converting N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into ammonia posed a challenge for chemists globally.

Haber, with his assistant [[Robert Le Rossignol]], developed the high-pressure devices and [[catalysts]] needed to demonstrate the Haber process at laboratory scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haber|first1=Fritz|title=Thermodynamik technischer Gasreaktionen|date=1905|publisher=Salzwasser Verlag|location=Paderborn|isbn=9783864448423|edition=1st|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Robert Le Rossignol, 1884–1976: Professional Chemist |year=2009 |journal=ChemUCL Newsletter |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemistry/alumni/documents/A5booklet_020909.pdf |page=8 |doi= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113022251/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemistry/alumni/documents/A5booklet_020909.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They demonstrated their process in the summer of 1909 by producing ammonia from air, drop by drop, at the rate of about {{convert|125|ml|USoz|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} per hour&lt;!--a cup every two hours--&gt;. The process was purchased by the German chemical company [[BASF]], which assigned [[Carl Bosch]] the task of scaling up Haber's tabletop machine to industrial-level production.&lt;ref name="hager"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, Carl (2 March 1908) "Process of producing ammonia". {{US Patent|990191}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded in 1910. Haber and Bosch were later awarded [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prizes]], in 1918 and 1931 respectively, for their work in overcoming the chemical and engineering problems of large-scale, continuous-flow, high-pressure technology.&lt;ref name="hager"/&gt;

Ammonia was first manufactured using the Haber process on an industrial scale in 1913 in BASF's [[Ludwigshafen#Oppau|Oppau]] plant in Germany, reaching 20 tonnes per day the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Philip, Phylis Morrison (2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120702093415/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/from-fertile-minds "From Fertile Minds" (review)]. ''American Scientist''.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], the production of [[munitions]] required large amounts of nitrate. The Allies had access to large [[sodium nitrate]] deposits in [[Chile]] (Chile saltpetre) controlled by British companies. Germany had no such resources, so the Haber process proved essential to the German war effort.&lt;ref name="hager"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ny times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nobel Award to Haber|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/02/03/118255924.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 February 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic ammonia from the Haber process was used for the production of [[nitric acid]], a precursor to the nitrates used in explosives.

== Process ==
[[File:Ammoniak Reaktor BASF.jpg|thumb|upright|A historical (1921) high-pressure steel reactor for production of ammonia via the Haber process is displayed at the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], Germany.]]
[[File:Ammoniakreaktor MS.svg|thumb|upright|scheme of ammoniac reactor]]
This conversion is typically conducted at {{convert|15|–|25|MPa|abbr=on|lk=on|atm psi}} and between {{convert|400|–|500|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, as the gases (nitrogen and hydrogen) are passed over four beds of [[catalyst]], with cooling between each pass so as to maintain a reasonable [[equilibrium constant]]. On each pass only about 15% conversion occurs, but any unreacted gases are recycled, and eventually an overall conversion of 97% is achieved.&lt;ref name=Appl/&gt;

The steam reforming, shift conversion, carbon dioxide removal, and methanation steps each operate at pressures of about {{convert|2.5|–|3.5|MPa|abbr=on|bar psi}}, and the ammonia synthesis loop operates at pressures ranging from {{convert|6|–|18|MPa|abbr=on|bar psi}}, depending upon which proprietary process is used.&lt;ref name=Appl/&gt;

===Sources of hydrogen===
The major source of hydrogen is [[methane]] from [[natural gas]]. The conversion, [[steam reforming]], is conducted with steam in a high temperature and pressure tube inside a reformer with a nickel catalyst, separating the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the natural gas.

===Reaction rate and equilibrium===
Nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is very unreactive because the [[molecules]] are held together by strong [[Chemical bond|triple bonds]]. The Haber process relies on catalysts that accelerate the scission of this triple bond.

Two opposing considerations are relevant to this synthesis: the position of the equilibrium and the [[reaction rate|rate of reaction]]. At room temperature, the equilibrium is strongly in favor of ammonia, but the reaction doesn't proceed at a detectable rate. The obvious solution is to raise the temperature, but because the reaction is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], the equilibrium constant (using bar or [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]] units) becomes 1 around {{convert|150|–|200|°C|F|abbr=on}}. (See [[Le Châtelier's principle]].)

Above this temperature, the equilibrium quickly becomes quite unfavorable at atmospheric pressure, according to the [[Van 't Hoff equation]]. Thus one might suppose that a low temperature is to be used and some other means to increase rate. However, the catalyst itself requires a temperature of at least 400&amp;nbsp;°C to be efficient.

[[Pressure]] is the obvious choice to favor the forward reaction because there are 4&amp;nbsp;moles of reactant for every 2&amp;nbsp;moles of product (see [[entropy]]), and the pressure used ({{convert|15|–|25|MPa|abbr=on|bar psi}}) alters the equilibrium concentrations to give a profitable yield.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Economically, pressure is an expensive commodity. Pipes, valves, and reaction vessels need to be strengthened, and there are safety considerations of working at 20&amp;nbsp;MPa. In addition, running pumps and compressors takes considerable energy. Thus the compromise used gives a single pass yield of around 15%.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Another way to increase the yield of the reaction would be to remove the product (i.e. ammonia gas) from the system. In practice, gaseous ammonia is not removed from the reactor itself, since the temperature is too high; it is removed from the equilibrium mixture of gases leaving the reaction vessel. The hot gases are cooled enough, whilst maintaining a high pressure, for the ammonia to condense and be removed as liquid. Unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen gases are then returned to the reaction vessel to undergo further reaction.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Catalysts===
The most popular catalysts are based on iron promoted with K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CaO, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The original Haber–Bosch reaction chambers used [[osmium]] as the catalyst, but it was available in extremely small quantities. Haber noted [[uranium]] was almost as effective and easier to obtain than osmium. Under Bosch's direction in 1909, the BASF researcher [[Alwin Mittasch]] discovered a much less expensive [[iron]]-based catalyst, which is still used today. Some ammonia production utilizes [[ruthenium]]-based catalysts (the KAAP process). Ruthenium forms more active catalysts that allows milder operating pressures. Such catalysts are prepared by decomposition of [[triruthenium dodecacarbonyl]] on [[graphite]].&lt;ref name=Appl/&gt;

In industrial practice, the iron catalyst is obtained from finely ground iron powder, which is usually obtained by reduction of high purity [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The pulverized iron metal is burnt (oxidized) to give magnetite of a defined particle size. The magnetite particles are then partially reduced, removing some of the [[oxygen]] in the process. The resulting catalyst particles consist of a core of magnetite, encased in a shell of [[wüstite]] (FeO, ferrous oxide), which in turn is surrounded by an outer shell of iron metal. The catalyst maintains most of its bulk volume during the reduction, resulting in a highly porous high surface area material, which enhances its effectiveness as a catalyst. Other minor components of the catalyst include [[Calcium oxide|calcium]] and [[aluminium oxide]]s, which support the iron catalyst and help it maintain its surface area. These oxides of Ca, Al, K, and Si are unreactive to reduction by the hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Appl/&gt;

The [[reaction mechanism]], involving the heterogeneous catalyst, is believed to involve the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wennerström |first1=Håkan |last2=Lidin |first2=Sven |title=Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2007 Chemical Processes on Solid Surfaces |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2007/advanced-chemistryprize2007.pdf |website=NobelPrize.org |publisher=Swedish Academy of Sciences |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed)
# N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed) → 2&amp;nbsp;N (adsorbed)
# H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed)
# H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed) → 2&amp;nbsp;H (adsorbed)
# N (adsorbed) + 3&amp;nbsp;H(adsorbed)→ NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed)
# NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed) → NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Reaction 5 occurs in three steps, forming NH, NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and then NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Experimental evidence points to reaction 2 as being the slow, [[rate-determining step]]. This is not unexpected since the bond broken, the nitrogen triple bond, is the strongest of the bonds that must be broken.

==Economic and environmental aspects==

[[File:Severnside fertilizer works - geograph.org.uk - 189990.jpg|thumbnail|right|Industrial fertilizer plant]]
When it was first invented, the Haber process needed to compete against another industrial process, the [[Frank–Caro process|Cyanamide process]]. However, the Cyanamide process consumed large amounts of electrical power and was more labor-intensive than the Haber process.&lt;ref name="hager"/&gt;{{rp|137–143}}

The Haber process now produces 450 million tonnes of nitrogen [[fertilizers|fertilizer]] per year, mostly in the form of anhydrous [[ammonia]], [[ammonium nitrate]], and [[urea]]. Three to five percent of the world's natural gas production is consumed in the Haber process (around 1–2% of the world's energy supply).&lt;ref name=Smil_2004_Enriching/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/nat_gas.html |title=International Energy Outlook 2007|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fertilizer statistics. {{cite web|url=http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/statistics/indicators/ind_reserves.asp|title=Raw material reserves|publisher=International Fertilizer Industry Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424083111/http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/statistics/indicators/ind_reserves.asp|archivedate=24 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1076659 |date=September 2002 |last= Smith |first= Barry E. |title = Structure.

Due to its dramatic impact on the human ability to grow food, the Haber process served as the "detonator of the population explosion", enabling the global population to increase from 1.6 billion in 1900 to today's 7 billion.&lt;ref name="Smil 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smil |first1=Vaclav |year=1999 |title=Detonator of the population explosion |url=http://www.vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/smil-article-1999-nature7.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Nature |volume=400 |issue= 6743|page=415 |doi=10.1038/22672|bibcode=1999Natur.400..415S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 50% of the nitrogen found in human tissues originated from the Haber-Bosch process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erisman|first=Jan Willem|last2=Sutton|first2=Mark A.|last3=Galloway|first3=James|last4=Klimont|first4=Zbigniew|last5=Winiwarter|first5=Wilfried|date=28 September 2008|title=How a century of ammonia synthesis changed the world|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=1|issue=10|pages=636–639|doi=10.1038/ngeo325|bibcode=2008NatGe...1..636E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since nitrogen use efficiency is typically less than 50%,&lt;ref name="Oenema 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oenema |first1=O. |last2=Witzke |first2= H.P. |last3=Klimont |first3=Z. |last4=Lesschen |first4=J.P. |last5=Velthof |first5=G.L. |year=2009 |title=Integrated assessment of promising measures to decrease nitrogen losses in agriculture in EU-27 |url = |journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment |volume=133 |issue= 3–4|pages=280–288 |doi=10.1016/j.agee.2009.04.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; farm runoff from heavy use of fixed industrial nitrogen disrupts biological habitats.&lt;ref name=Smil_2004_Enriching/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howarth 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howarth|first1=R.

'''Horst Brandstätter''' (June 27, 1933 – June 3, 2015) was the owner of the [[Netherlands|German]] company [[Brandstätter Group]].  The company was founded by Andreas Brandstätter in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/playmobil-firmenpatriarch-horst-brandstaetter-ist-tot-a-1037674.html|title=Horst Brandstätter: Playmobil-Patriarch ist tot|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=8 June 2015|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Horst Brandstätter was born on June 27, 1933 in Zirndorf, Germany.

==Career==
Brandstätter joined the family firm in 1952.&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Life in plastic, it's fantastic: Playmobil supremo dies at 81|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/06/09/rip_horst_brandstatter_obit/|accessdate = 2016-01-02|first = Lester|last = Haines|date = 2015-06-09|website = [[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His support of the inventor [[Hans Beck]] allowed the company to begin production on what became the popular toy [[Playmobil]], prototypes of which had been developed by Beck at the company.  The [[1973 oil crisis]] necessitated the creation of a toy whose production required little solid [[plastic]]; he had asked Beck for "the maximum amount of play value for the minimum amount of plastic".&lt;ref name="register" /&gt;

==Death==
He died on June 3, 2015 in Fürth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/ges/wrt/en1198396.htm Cheerful Plastic Figures from Franconia – Playmobil Conquers the Playroom], ''Goethe-Institut''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{eastern name order|Kóka János}}
'''János Kóka''' (born 5 July 1972) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] businessman, private investor, IT entrepreneur and manager of various enterprises, who served as Minister of Economy and Transport between 2004 and 2007. He was a member of the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ) and functioned as its chairman from 2007 to 2008. He also served as leader of the liberal party's parliamentary group until [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010]], when SZDSZ failed to win any seats after 20 years. Kóka left the party that year. In 2010 he returned to business life and presently works as Chairman and CEO of Cellum Global Zrt. and Chairman of the Board of Cellum Bulgaria. He is married to Edit Varga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.origo.hu/teve/20160503-varga-edit-interju-2016-virtuozok-jatek-hatarok-nelkul-hirado-mtv-duna-tv.html|title=Varga Edit: Otthon és a képernyőn is van értelmes feladatom|work=[[Origo (website)|Origo]]|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
He graduated from Temesvári Pelbárt Franciscan Grammar School in [[Esztergom]].  He continued his studies at [[Semmelweis University]] of Medicine, where he received his degree in 1996.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Business career==
Kóka got involved in the emerging Hungarian IT industry while still at university, working as Project Manager and later Sales Director at one of Hungary's first [[Internet Service Provider|ISPs]], Elender LLC from 1994 and 1996. From 1996 he served as Managing Director of Elender Computer LLC, then from 1998, following the company's transformation into a private limited company, as CEO of Elender IT, Inc. In 1999 Elender was acquired by [[PSINet|PSINet, Inc.]] and Kóka became Country Manager, then from 2000 European Vice President of Business Development. He also became Chairman of the Board of Webigen Inc. in July 2000. He returned to his former company in October 2002, serving as CEO of Elender Business Communications. In 2004 he was appointed President of Euroweb Internet Service Provider Inc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

He was a board member of the ICT Association of Hungary (IVSZ) from 2000, and President from March 2003 until October 2004. From 2003 prior to his ministerial appointment he served as Member of the Board of EICTA (European ICT Association) based in Brussels, and Chairman of the Hungarian-Indonesian Joint Business Council. In 2000 he received the ’IT Manager of the Year’ award founded by the ICT Association of Hungary.

==Political career==
In October 2004, Kóka was appointed Minister of Economy and Transport, supported by [[Alliance of Free Democrats|SZDSZ]], which he later became a member of in 2006. During this period his main tasks included the development of a business-friendly environment, stimulating the growth of the corporate sector, promoting a knowledge-based economy and increasing the international presence of domestic businesses. In June 2006 he was reappointed Minister of Economy and Transport. Between 2007-2008 he served as President of the Liberal Party, and until 2010 as parliamentary group leader, member of the Budget Committee, and Chairman of the Nabucco Committee aiming to reduce the country's reliance on Russian gas.

His popularity began to drop in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szondaipsos.hu/hu/polvelkut/politikusok Politikusok népszerűsége] – A Szonda Ipsos honlapján&lt;/ref&gt; following the announcement of his Ministry's intention to shut down 14 regional lines of [[Hungarian State Railways]] on a total length of {{convert|474|km|abbr=on}}. The government, referring to obligation under the constitution, ensured access to public transit in all settlements by installing bus routes and buses from Volán, which, in cases of single railway stations for multiple villages, meant stations in the centers or ends of every settlement. It was expected that this and an increased service frequency could theoretically be achieved while reducing spending on fuel (diesel or electricity) and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://index.hu/gazdasag/magyar/szemsz060705/ | title = Hív a vasút, zár a MÁV | work = Index | date = 2006-07-05 | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers the most important achievements of his ministerial activities to be the construction of 500&amp;nbsp;km of motorway, the influx of EUR 4-5 billion of operating capital annually into the country and the commencement of the construction of Megyeri Bridge.

On March 31, 2008, various reform-related disagreements between the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] (MSZP) and SZDSZ led SZDSZ leader Kóka to announce that his party would quit the coalition by May 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080331/wl_nm/hungary_politics_dc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414164602/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080331/wl_nm/hungary_politics_dc |archivedate=April 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also meant that MSZP would have to form the first [[minority government]] in [[Hungary]] since the political transition in 1990. However, the legitimacy of Kóka's position as party president became questioned when it was discovered that some signatures of the delegates to the assembly electing him had been forged. Since he had won his position by a very small margin over [[Gábor Fodor (politician)|Gábor Fodor]], these votes might have changed the outcome. Consequently, a new leadership election was held in June &lt;ref&gt;[http://nol.hu/cikk/488203/]&lt;/ref&gt; and Gábor Fodor was returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/politika/belfold/szdszpp08070/ Fodor nyerte az elnökválasztást] Index, 2008. június 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the parliamentary group he led ensured the majority of votes to elect [[Gordon Bajnai]] Prime Minister and facilitate the measures taken by the Bajnai Government. He did not run during the parliamentary elections in 2010 and he did not renew his party membership either.

==Post-political career==
After leaving politics in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://hvg.hu/itthon.partonbelul/20100627_szdsz_szabadai_ujratervezes Az ősbölények leléptek – SZDSZ küldöttgyűlés], hvg.hu, 2010. június 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Kóka returned to the business world. First he was involved in the reorganization of Cellum Group as a consultant, then in 2011 he was appointed Chairman and CEO of Cellum Global Inc., established with the aim of international expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nol.hu/lap/gazdasag/20110910-koka_janos_visszatert Kóka János visszatér] – Népszabadság 2011. szeptember 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirszerzo.hu/profit/20110915_bulgaria_koka_cellum] – MTI 2011. szeptember 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origo.hu/techbazis/hightech/20111025-mastercard-mobilba-koltozik-a-bankkartya.html Az sms mellett pénzt is küldhetünk a mobillal] – Origo, 2011. 10. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the representative of the company, in September 2011, he concluded a venture capital program agreement with Portfolion Zrt., member of [[OTP Bank]] Group, and soon afterwards he signed an agreement with Bulgaria's Corpbank on the establishment of a joint technological subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telecompaper.com/news/bulgarias-corporate-commercial-bank-to-offer-m-payments Bulgaria's Corporate Commercial Bank to offer m-payments], Telecom Paper, Friday 16 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since January 2012 he has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors in the Cellum Bulgaria subsidiary, with its head office in [[Bulgaria]]. He is a board member in MPP Zrt., also a Cellum Group affiliate.  Under his management, the company has reported the conclusion of several international agreements of cooperation; for instance, Cellum developed the mobile payment application of [[MasterCard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepaypers.com/news/mobile-payments/mastercard-cellum-to-provide-mobile-payments-in-hungary/745654-16 MasterCard, Cellum to provide mobile payments in Hungary], The Paypers, Tuesday 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="194593">The '''[[S&amp;P 1000]]''' is an [[Stock market index|index]] created by [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], a combination of both the mid-cap [[S&amp;P 400]] and small-cap [[S&amp;P 600]] index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.money-zine.com/definitions/investing-dictionary/sp-1000-index/|title=S&amp;P 1000 Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Money-zine.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Russell 1000 Index|Russel 1000 Index]] tracks the top 1000 companies in the [[Russell Indexes|Russel Index]], approximately 90% of all market capitalization of US shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RIY:IND|title=RIY Quote – IND – Bloomberg Markets|last=|first=|date=|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the S&amp;P 1000, the Russel 1000 does not contain [[Business Development Company|Business Development Companies]] in its index.

After his graduation Berg was promoted to Docent at the same university in 1986. He worked at the Department of Business Administration at Lund University from 1971, first as a research assistant, between 1979-1985 as Assistant Professor, and in 1986 he was appointed Associate Professor at the same department.

== Early life ==
Peter MacLachlan Brown was born in [[Vancouver]], like his father, Ralph, and grandfather before him. Peter Brown’s grandfather Brenton was a well-connected businessman and power broker of his time, head of the Crown Life Insurance Co., onetime president of the [[Vancouver Board of Trade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/left-to-right-mr-brenton-brown-president-vancouver-board-of-trade|title=Left to right: Mr. Brenton Brown - President, Vancouver Board of Trade - City of Vancouver Archives|website=searcharchives.vancouver.ca|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a founder of the right-of-centre municipal [[Non-Partisan Association|NPA party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tchhd4FUS98C&amp;q=%22peter+brown%22#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20brown&amp;f=false|title=Vancouver Ltd.|last=Gutstein|first=Donald|publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Company|year=1975|isbn=0-88862-082-9|location=Toronto, Canada|pages=142|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson would one day follow in his footsteps.

Peter Brown attended the private [[Shawnigan Lake School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/shawniganlake1956shaw/shawniganlake1956shaw_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Shawnigan Lake School Magazine December, 1956"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[St. George's School (Vancouver)|St. George’s School]], where he graduated in 1958, as did his brothers Ralph ’53, Alan ’54, and Robert ’68; and his sons James ’86 and Jason ’89.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stgeorges.bc.ca/page/List-Detail?pk=69684&amp;fromId=181319|title=2007 - Peter Brown '58, OBC, LLD|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[University of British Columbia]], entering at age 15&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sultan of Stock Deals Spurns Political Role|last=Hunter|first=Jennifer|date=August 18, 1986|work=The Globe and Mail|page=B1|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “majoring in partying”,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Once Pilloried, Now a Pillar, Peter Brown Has Done It All|last=Mulgrew|first=Ian|date=November 23, 2001|work=The Vancouver Sun|page=C4|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left at age 20 to work for brokerage firm Greenshields; he worked at various points in Greenshields offices in Montreal, Toronto, and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcbusiness.ca/people/peter-brown-lifetime-achievement-award|title=Peter Brown, Founder and Chair, Canaccord Financial Inc. {{!}} 2010 Entreptreneur of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award {{!}} BC Business|website=www.bcbusiness.ca|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his time, he says, that he turned “from a wastrel into a workaholic”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peterbrowncapital.com/full-biography/|title=Peter M. Brown {{!}} Peter Brown|website=peterbrowncapital.com|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 he transferred to his hometown and the next year joined a boutique investment firm called Hemsworth, Turton, and Company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A year later, owner Ted Turton recruited Brown as sales manager, and five years after that, Brown bought into the firm, now renamed Canarim Investment Corp.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ceo.ca/2014/01/20/canaccord-co-founder-ted-turton-remembered/|title=Canaccord Co-Founder Ted Turton Remembered|date=2014-01-21|website=CEO.CA|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
It was a rocky start. “Everyone said we’d fail,” he has said.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Far from it, when noted Canadian historian [[Peter C. Newman]] included Brown in the second volume of his [[The Canadian Establishment|Canadian Establishment]] series, he described the Vancouver financier as “the single most important player on the [[Vancouver Stock Exchange]], underwriting nearly three-quarters of its new issues — worth a projected $225 million in 1981 alone”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19811031&amp;id=yzsyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CaUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1731,5434593&amp;hl=en|title=The Montreal Gazette - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, Canarim expanded, opening offices across the Prairies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By 1993, the company, renamed Canaccord Capital, had grown to 400 staff, with investment advisors in six branches across Canada. In 2004, Canaccord went public, raising $70 million in its initial listing on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]]; the year after that, the company also listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] under the symbol CF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CF:CN|title=CF:Toronto Stock Quote - Canaccord Genuity Group Inc|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canaccordgenuity.com/en-CA/wm/Wealth-Management-Canada/Choose-Canaccord/Our-Company-History/|title=Our Company History - Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management|website=www.canaccordgenuity.com|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By that time, Brown, now 64, had been at the head of Canaccord, renamed [[Canaccord Genuity]], for almost four decades, and begun to consider succession. “I’d never given it much thought, to be honest,” he says. “It was my baby and I guess I sort of imagined I’d be there forever. But I realized I’d had enough. It’s a very hard, stressful, Type A business — the market’s changing every minute. So I went to Paul Reynolds, who’d worked for me for 24 years, and asked if he wanted to take over”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Brown resigned from Canaccord Genuity in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/Canaccord+founder+Peter+Brown+resigns+after+year+career/9872807/story.html|title=Canaccord founder Peter Brown resigns after 46-year career|last=Kwantes|first= James|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Press Council of India''' is a [[statutory &amp; quasi-judicial body ]] in [[India]] that governs the conduct of the print media. It is one of the most important bodies that sustain [[democracy]], as it has supreme power in regard to the media to ensure that [[Freedom of expression in India|freedom of speech]] is maintained. However, it is also empowered to hold hearings on receipt of complaints and take suitable action where appropriate. It may either warn or censure the errant journalists on finding them guilty. It did so on 21st July 2006, when it censured three newspapers — ''[[Times of India]]'' ([[Delhi]] and [[Pune]]), ''[[Punjab Kesari]]'' ([[Delhi]]) and ''[[Mid Day]]'' ([[Mumbai]]) — for violation of norms of journalistic conduct. The Council's actions may not be questioned unless it is proved to be in violation of the constitution, which makes it an exceedingly powerful body.

Justice [[Chandramauli Kumar Prasad]] is Chairman of the Council {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://presscouncil.nic.in/Content/8_1_CurrentCompositin.aspx | title=Current Composition | publisher=Press Council of India | accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been appointed for a second term. The predecessor was Justice [[Markandey Katju]] (2011 – 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://presscouncil.nic.in/Content/10_1_ListPrivChairman.aspx | title=Previous Chairpersons | publisher=Press Council of India | accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers, practice and procedure==
The Press Council of India was first set up on 4 July 1966 by the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] to regulate the [[press in India]]. The basis at that time was the ''Press Council Act, 1965'' which resulted from the recommendations of the ''First Press Commission of India'' (1952-1959). The started objectives were "to help newspapers maintain their independence" and to "lower the standards" through a code of conduct, maintaining "higest professional standards" and "low standards of public taste".  However, after internal emergency in 1975 , the Council functions under the ''Press Council Act 1978'' which arose from the recommendations of the ''Second Press Commission of India'' (1978) which argued, among other things, for a "cordial relationship between the government and the press".

The Press Council is a statutory, [[quasi-judicial body]] which acts as a watchdog of the press. It adjudicates the complaints against and by the press for violation of ethics and for violation of the freedom of the [[News media|press]] respectively.

The Press Council is headed by a Chairman: usually, a retired judge of [[the Supreme Court of India]] (except for the first chairman, [[J. R. Mudholkar|Justice J. R. Mudholkar]], who was a sitting judge of Supreme Court of India in 1968).It consists of a Chairman and 28 other members. Of the 28 members, 13 represent the working journalists. Of whom 6 are to be editors of newspapers and remaining 7(2members missing) are to be working journalists other than editors. 6 are to be from among persons who own or carry on the business of management of newspapers. One is to be from among the persons who manage news agencies. Three are to be persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of education and science, law and literature and culture. The remaining five are to Members of Parliament : three from [[Lok Sabha]], and two from [[Rajya Sabha]]. The members serve on the Council for a term of three years. The Council was last reconstituted on 22 May 2001. The present Chairman is Justice Chandramauli Kumar Prasad.

The Council is funded by revenue collected by it as fees levied on the registered newspapers in the country on the basis of their circulation. No fee is levied on newspapers with a circulation of less than 5000 copies. The deficit is made good by grants by the [[Central government of India|Central Government]], through the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]]

==Complaints Procedure&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrase and explanation of [http://presscouncil.nic.in/complaints.htm http://presscouncil.nic.in/complaints.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;==
A complaint against a newspaper for any publication the complainant finds objectionable and affecting him personally, or for non-publication of any material, should first be taken up with the editor or other representative of the publication concerned.

If the complaint is not resolved satisfactorily, it may be referred the Press Council of India. The complaint must be specific and in writing and should be filed/lodged within two months of the publication of the impugned news item in case of dailies and weeklies and four months in all other cases, along with the original/photostat copy of the impugned clipping (an English translation if the matter is in a South Asian language). The complainant must state in what manner the publication/non-publication of the matter is objectionable within the meaning of the Press Council Act, 1978, and enclose a copy of the letter to the editor, pointing out why the matter is considered objectionable. The editor's reply thereto or published rejoinder, if any, may also be attached to it. A declaration stating that the matter is not pending in any court of law is also required to be filed.

If a newspaper or journalist is by any action of any authority that may impinge on the freedom of the press, he can also file a complaint with the Council. The aggrieved newspaper or journalist may inform the Council about the possible reason for the action of the authorities against him i.e. if it is as a reprisal measure taken by the authorities due to critical writings or as a result of krisan the policy that may affect the freedom of the press (supporting documents, with English translation if they are in a South Asian language, should be filed). A declaration regarding the non-pendency of the matter in any court of law is also necessary.

On receipt of a complaint made to it or otherwise, if the Council is prima facie satisfied that the matter discloses sufficient ground for inquiry, it issues a show cause notice to the respondents and then considers the matter through its Inquiry Committee on the basis of written and oral evidence tendered before it. If, on inquiry, the Council has reason to believe that the respondent newspaper has violated journalistic norms, the Council keeping in view the gravity of the misconduct committed by the newspaper, warns, admonishes or censures the newspaper or disapproves of the conduct of the editor or the journalist as the case may be. It may also direct the respondent newspaper to publish the contradiction of the complainant or a gist of the Council’s decision in its forthcoming issue.

Similarly, when the Council upholds the complaint of the aggrieved newspaper/journalist the Council directs the concerned government to take appropriate steps to redress the grievance of the complainant. The Council may, if it considers necessary, make such observations, as it may think fit, in any of its decisions or reports, respecting the conduct of any authority, including Government.

'''Ricardo Enriquez Reyes, Jr.''' (born April 12, 1950), commonly known as '''Ricky Reyes''', also known as "'''Mother Ricky'''" is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[hairdresser]], [[philanthropist]] and [[businessman]]. He is the owner of Ricky Reyes chain of salons and host of television programme "Gandang Ricky Reyes".
[[File:Rickyreyesjf.JPG|thumb|Gandang Ricky Reyes salon at SM City Baliuag.]]

==Biography==
The money he earned from sweeping floors was used as capital for his first beauty parlor in 1970. Reyes now has a 44-branch network of Gandang Ricky Reyes salons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=567710&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=78 From parlor sweeper to Forbes Magazine A-lister]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Reyes’ philanthropic work began in 1984 when he initiated the “Isang Guntíng Isang Suklay” ("one scissor, one comb") programme which gave free livelihood training to the people of [[Dasmariñas, Cavite]]. “We started with giving free haircuts,” says Reyes, “but then I remembered the lesson about teaching people how to fish...” This led to the foundation of the Ricky Reyes Learning Institute (RRLI) where he makes education accessible to youth unable to afford college education. The [[vocational school]] offers a range of courses in hotel and restaurant services, as well as technical courses in [[cosmetology]] conducted by [[TESDA]]-certified professionals.

In 2010, Reyes was cited by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as one of the 48 Heroes of Philanthropy list in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/08/asia-heroes-charity-personal-finance-philanthropy-malaysia.html Asia's Heroes Of Philanthropy - Forbes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected for his work on health care and job training, particularly involving CHILD Haus (Center for Health Improvement and Life Development), a [[halfway house]]  for poor, cancer-stricken children from provinces who are seeking treatment in [[Metro Manila]] hospitals and for leading a team of volunteers in feeding about 50,000 victims of [[Typhoon Ketsana]] for two weeks.

In 2015, Renato Nocos, a former employee of Reyes' chain of salons, filed a discrimination case against his employer. Reyes fired Nocos after he found out that he is positive with [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV). The camp of Reyes denied the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/54183/ricky-reyes-corporation-denies-firing-employee-due-to-hiv|title=Ricky Reyes Corporation denies firing employee due to HIV|publisher=''Pep.ph''|language=Filipino|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2016, the National Labor Relations Commission had found Reyes guilty on the said case. Reyes ordered to reinstate Nocos in his job and pay 600,000 pesos worth of back wages and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/02/08/1550948/worker-hiv-wins-labor-case-vs-salon|title=Worker with HIV wins labor case vs salon|publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|date=February 8, 2016|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Warren Miller''' (born May 23, 1933) is an American-born British billionaire, entrepreneur, [[co-founder]] of [[DFS Group|DFS (Duty Free Shops)]], and sailing [[champion]]. He is the father of [[Marie-Chantal|Crown Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece]], [[Princess Alexandra von Furstenberg|Alexandra Miller]], and [[Pia Getty]], dubbed by tabloids and high society as The Miller Sisters.

==Early life and education==
Miller was born in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]], Massachusetts, in 1933, the son of Ellis Warren Appleton Miller (1898 – c. 1986), a [[bookkeeper]], [[salesperson]], and descendant of several [[Mayflower]] passengers; and Sophia "Sophie" June Squarebriggs (1899–1998), a Canadian-born former [[governess]]. Miller's ancestry is rooted in the British North American colonial elite, and descends over time, he claims, from [[Henry I of England]], [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV the Carolingian]], and [[William the Lion|William, King of the Scots]].&lt;ref&gt;Julie Helen Otto &amp; William Addams Reitwiesner, Some ancestry of the Miller sisters [http://www.wargs.com/royal/miller.html 1995].&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller attended [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]] and graduated in 1955, with a Bachelor of Science in Hotel Administration. He was a member of the [[Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity]] and the [[Irving Literary Society (Cornell University)|Irving Literary Society]].

==Career==
===Duty Free Shoppers (DFS)===
[[File:DFS-Okinawa2.JPG|thumb|400px|DFS's Okinawa venue.]]
The concept of "[[duty-free shop]]ping" – offering [[high-end]] [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] to [[tourism|travelers]], free of [[import taxes]] – was in its infancy when, with [[Chuck Feeney]], Miller founded DFS on November 7, 1960.

DFS began operations in Hong Kong, where it still maintains its corporate headquarters, later expanding to Europe and other continents. DFS' first major breakthrough came in the early 1960s, when it secured the exclusive concession for duty-free sales in Hawaii and Hong Kong, allowing it to market its products to Japanese travelers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Dermot Davitt, The Moodie Report, November Personality of the Month: Robert Miller (June 6, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; DFS eventually expanded to off-airport duty-free stores and large downtown Galleria [[Retailing|stores]], and became the world's largest travel retailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfsgalleria.com/Galleria/English/Global/Global_About_DFS.html|title=Duty Free Shopping Stores – DFS T Galleria &amp; Airport Shops|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Feeney's interests were acquired by [[Louis Vuitton]] [[Moët]] [[Hennessy]] ([[LVMH]]), the French [[luxury good]]s group, for $1.63&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3755/is_199703/ai_n8761288|title=FindArticles.com – CBSi|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller kept his shares and remains a significant minority shareholder (38%) in DFS alongside LVMH,&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which bought out Feeney's share. More recently, Miller targeted the emergence of mainland China's economic elite.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; To present its new merchandise, DFS has moved beyond the airport liquor store venue and into store environments, seeking to market the broadest portfolio of brand names in the travelling marketplace.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
In 2010, the DFS Group had an estimated sales of about €2.2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="Luxury"/&gt; As of 2012, it has 150 stores in 15 Pacific states.&lt;ref name="Luxury"/&gt; Its downtown activities operate under the Galleriera name.&lt;ref name="Luxury"/&gt;

Miller was named the November 2010 Personality of the Month by The Moodie Report in recognition of his advancement of the luxury goods industry's cause.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; That year, Duty Free Shops (DFS) celebrated its 50th anniversary at the DFS Galleria Sun Plaza store in Hong Kong, with a gala attended by 2000 guests, and featuring a performance by [[Wyclef Jean]].&lt;ref&gt;William Stolerman, DFS Celebrates 50th With Star Studded Gala in HK (Nov 21, [2010]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Davitt, The Moodie Report, Picture Gallery: DFS celebrates 50th anniversary in Hong Kong (July 11, [2010]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search Investment Group Ltd===
In 1973, Miller founded Search Investment Group Ltd, an international investment company of which he is CEO and chairperson. The Search investment Group Ltd is a large shareholder in Ortelius Capital Partners, which is an investment firm founded by Miller's son-in-law HRH Prince Pavlos of Greece and Mr. Peter DeSorcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchgroup.com/|title=Search Investment Group|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orteliuscapital.com|title=ortelius-aim|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also principal of SAIL advisors (Search Alternative Investments Ltd), global investors in hedge funds. Along with other assets, Miller is currently ranked the 68th wealthiest person in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,20590,00.html|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; down from 22nd in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/richlist/person/0,,33629,00.html|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sailing records==
In October 2003, Miller's [[monohull]] [[yacht]], the Mari-Cha IV, set a new [[world record]], becoming the first [[monohull]] ever to cross the Atlantic Ocean in under seven days. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040929151518/http://www.mike-sanderson.com/default.asp?m=da&amp;id=9977] During the same crossing, the yacht also broke the 24-hour distance record, by sailing {{convert|525.5|nmi|km|1}}. Both he and his son-in-law [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece]], son of King [[Constantine II of Greece]] were crew members.

On April 30, 2005, the Mari-Cha IV won the Rolex Transatlantic Challenge and broke the century-old record for a west-to-east transatlantic crossing established by [[Charlie Barr]]. It completed the 2,925-nautical mile passage across the North Atlantic between New York and England in a time of 9 days, 15 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds—a full 2 days, 12 hours, 6 minutes and 56 seconds faster than the record set 100 years earlier.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Mike Hanlon, Century-old Transatlantic Challenge Record Broken (April 30, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; During the record-breaking crossing, Miller pushed the Mari-Cha III beyond its limits in poor weather, and the mainsail headboard and the headboard cars on both mainsail and mizzen broke.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Miller is married to Ecuadorian-born María Clara "Chantal" Pesantes Becerra,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wargs.com/royal/miller.html&lt;/ref&gt; they have three daughters: [[Pia Getty|Pia]] (b. 1966), [[Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece|Marie-Chantal]] (b. 1968), and [[Princess Alexandra von Fürstenberg|Alexandra]] (b. 1972)

He also owns the {{convert|36000|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} Gunnerside Estate in [[Yorkshire]], one of the largest sporting country estates in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

'''Rose Agatha Leon''' (20 October 1913 – 16 August 1999) was a Jamaican businesswoman and politician. In August 1999, she was murdered in her home.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | first = Glenroy | last = Sinclair | title = Madame Leon slain | date = 17 Aug 1999 | url = http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/19990817/f1.html | work = Jamaica Gleaner | accessdate = 2013-08-25 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071111181717/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/19990817/f1.html | archivedate = 11 November 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir James Caird, Baronet of Glenfarquhar''' (2 January 1864 – 27 September 1954) was a shipowner and the principal donor in creating the [[National Maritime Museum]], London.

==Early life and education==
The eldest son of James Caird, a lawyer, and his wife, Mary Ann née Hutcheson, James Caird was born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], educated at [[Glasgow Academy]], and then in 1878 joined a firm of East India merchants, William Graham &amp; Co. Caird married Henrietta Anna Stephens in 1898, with whom he had one daughter.

==Business career==
In 1889, he went to London, where he soon joined Turnbull, Martin &amp; Co., the firm that managed the Scottish Shire Line. He quickly became the manager and, by 1903, was the sole partner and owner of the Scottish Shire Line.  His company developed a cooperative enterprise with [[Houlder Line|Houlder]] and Federal Lines to open trade with Australia and New Zealand.  In 1916, he started a [[National Shipyard|shipyard]] at [[Chepstow]], a place located away from enemy attack, in order to quickly build a standardised design of ships that could replace wartime ship losses.  A year later in 1917, his success led to a government buy-out. Looking ahead, Caird foresaw that the shipping industry would decline in the postwar era, so he sold many of his shipping interests but remained a director in some 25 companies associated with shipping, shipbuilding, and maritime trade. He remained chairman of the Smithfield and Argentine Meat Company and continued to hold his significant number of founders' shares. Caird died in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], [[Surrey]], England.

==Interest in maritime history and heritage==
Having accumulated a significant fortune, Caird became interested in preserving British naval and shipping memorials. As a member of the [[Society for Nautical Research]], he provided the largest amount of money necessary to repair and restore [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] in the 1920s, giving an initial £50,000 with an additional donation of £15,000. He also was responsible for trying to save [[HMS Implacable (1805)|HMS ''Implacable'']] (originally the French Navy's Téméraire-class ship of the line ''Duguay-Trouin'', launched in 1800), another survivor of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].&lt;ref&gt;Beverley Butler, Kevin Littlewood. ''Implacable: A Trafalgar Ship Remembered.'' National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. {{ISBN|0-948065-27-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, when the initial interest emerged to establish a national museum for preserving and displaying Britain's maritime history, Caird joined a board of trustees that had been established through the [[Society for Nautical Research]] to work toward founding the new museum.  An opportunity arose to do this when the [[Royal Hospital School]] moved from [[Greenwich]] to [[Holbrook, Suffolk]] in 1933. With the school's Greenwich buildings vacated, Caird offered to fund the entire cost of renovating them to serve as a museum. This cost eventually reached £80,000.  At the same time, Caird began purchasing a wide range of historical artefacts, rare books, globes, nautical instruments, artwork, and shipmodels that were reported in 1934 to be worth in excess of £300,000.

Parliament passed the [[National Maritime Museum]] Act in 1934 and [[King George VI]] opened the museum in April 1937, under the directorship of Sir [[Geoffrey Callender]]. Even after the opening of the museum, Caird continued to donate and support its work.

==Honours and awards==
In 1928, Caird was created a [[baronet]], taking the title from his home in Scotland, Glenfarquhar, at Fourdoun, Aberdeenshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33353 |date=3 February 1928 |page=757}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, he was offered a peerage, but refused.  On his death in 1954, the baronetcy became extinct.

Caird is warmly remembered at the [[National Maritime Museum]], where his name graces the Caird Library, the Caird Entrance, the Caird fellowships funded by the Caird Fund, and the [[Caird Medal]], awarded to distinguished contributions to the fields of the museum's interests.

{{Strategy}}
'''Strategic thinking''' is defined as a mental or thinking process applied by an individual in the context of achieving success in a [[game]] or other endeavor. As a [[cognitive]] activity, it produces [[thought]].

When applied in an organizational [[strategic management]] process, strategic thinking involves the generation and application of unique business insights and opportunities intended to create competitive advantage for a firm or organisation.&lt;ref name=ST-B-00/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-01&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Strategic Thinking? by Rich Horwath|url=http://www.sculpturaconsulting.com/Articles_Samples/What_is_Strategic_Thinking.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-02/&gt; It can be done [[Individually rational|individually]], as well as [[Collaboration|collaboratively]] among key people who can positively alter an organization's future. Group strategic thinking may create more value by enabling a [[Proactivity|proactive]] and [[Creativity|creative]] [[dialogue]], where individuals gain other people's perspectives on critical and complex issues. This is regarded as a benefit in highly competitive and fast-changing business landscapes.&lt;ref name=ST-B-03/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-04/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-05/&gt;

==Overview==
Strategic thinking includes finding and developing a [[strategic foresight]] capacity for an [[organization]], by exploring all possible organizational futures, and challenging conventional thinking to foster [[decision making]] today.&lt;ref name=ST-B-25/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-18/&gt; Recent [[strategic]] thought points ever more clearly towards the conclusion that the critical strategic question is not the conventional "What?",&lt;ref name="mdt"/&gt; but "Why?" or "How?".&lt;ref name="mdt"/&gt; The work of [[Mintzberg|Henry Mintzberg]]&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-00/&gt; and other authors,&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-03/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graetz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liedtka"/&gt; further support the conclusion; and also draw a clear distinction between strategic thinking and [[strategic planning]], another important strategic management thought process.&lt;ref name=ST-B-05/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-05/&gt;

General [[Andre Beaufre]] wrote in 1963 that strategic thinking "is a mental process, at once abstract and rational, which must be capable of synthesizing both psychological and material data.  The strategist must have a great capacity for both analysis and synthesis; analysis is necessary to assemble the data on which he makes his diagnosis, synthesis in order to produce from these data the diagnosis itself—and the diagnosis in fact amounts to a choice between alternative courses of action."&lt;ref name="Beaufre1965"&gt;{{cite book

| lccn = 65014177}}&lt;!--LCCN IS VALID.  See [[Talk:Strategic thinking#LCCN of An Introduction to Strategy]] before deleting--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no generally accepted definition for strategic thinking, no common agreement as to its role or importance, and no standardised list of key competencies of strategic thinkers.&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-06/&gt; There is also no consensus on whether strategic thinking is an uncommon [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] or a common and observable [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of strategy. Most agree that traditional models of strategy making, which are primarily based on strategic planning, are not working.&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-20/&gt; Strategy in today's competitive business landscape is moving away from the basic ‘strategic planning’ to more of ‘strategic thinking’ in order to remain competitive.&lt;ref name=ST-B-19/&gt; However, both thought processes must work hand-in-hand in order to reap maximum benefit.&lt;ref name=ST-B-05/&gt; It has been argued that the real heart of strategy is the 'strategist'; and for a better strategy execution requires a strategic thinker who can discover novel, imaginative strategies which can re-write the rules of the competitive game; and set in motion the chain of events that will shape and "define the future".&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-11/&gt;

== Strategic thinking vs. strategic planning ==
In the view of F. Graetz, strategic thinking and planning are “distinct, but interrelated and complementary thought processes” that must sustain and support one another for effective strategic management. Graetz's model holds that the role of strategic thinking is "to seek innovation and imagine new and very different futures that may lead the company to redefine its core strategies and even its industry". Strategic planning's role is "to realise and to support strategies developed through the strategic thinking process and to integrate these back into the business".&lt;ref name="Graetz" /&gt;&lt;!--p. 457--&gt;

[[Henry Mintzberg]] wrote in 1994 that strategic thinking is more about synthesis (i.e., "connecting the dots") than analysis (i.e., "finding the dots"). It is about "capturing what the manager learns from all sources (both the soft insights from his or her personal experiences and the experiences of others throughout the organization and the hard data from market research and the like) and then synthesizing that learning into a vision of the direction that the business should pursue." Mintzberg argued that strategic thinking cannot be systematized and is the critical part of strategy formation, as opposed to strategic planning exercises. In his view, strategic planning happens ''around'' the strategy formation or strategic thinking activity, by providing inputs for the strategist to consider and providing plans for controlling the implementation of the strategy after it is formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1994/01/the-fall-and-rise-of-strategic-planning/ar/1 Henry Mintzberg. The Fall and Rise of Strategic Planning. Harvard Business Review. January 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jeanne Liedtka]], strategic thinking differs from [[strategic planning]] along the following dimensions of [[strategic management]]:&lt;ref name="Liedtka"/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!
!Strategic Thinking
!Strategic Planning
|-
!Vision of the Future
|Only the shape of the future can be predicted.
|A future that is predictable and specifiable in detail.
|-
!Strategic Formulation and Implementation'''
|Formulation and implementation are interactive rather than sequential and discrete.
|The roles of formulation and implementation can be neatly divided.
|-
!Managerial Role in Strategy Making
|Lower-level managers have a voice in strategy-making, as well as greater latitude to respond opportunistically to developing conditions.
|Senior executives obtain the needed information from lower-level managers, and then use it to create a plan which is, in turn, disseminated to managers for implementation.
|-
!Control
|Relies on self-reference – a sense of strategic intent and purpose embedded in the minds of managers throughout the organisation that guides their choices on a daily basis in a process that is often difficult to measure and monitor from above.
|Asserts control through measurement systems, assuming that organisations can measure and monitor important variables both  accurately and quickly.
|-
!Managerial Role in Implementation
|All managers understand the larger system, the connection between their roles and the functioning of that system, as well as the interdependence between the various roles that comprise the system.
|Lower-level managers need only know his or her own role well and can be expected to defend only his or her own turf.
|-
!Strategy Making
|Sees strategy and change as inescapably linked and assumes that finding new strategic options and implementing them successfully is harder and more important than evaluating them.
|The challenge of setting strategic direction is primarily analytic.
|-
!Process and Outcome
|Sees the planning process itself as a critical value-adding element.
|Focus is on the creation of the plan as the ultimate objective.
|}

== Strategic thinking competencies ==
Liedtka observed five “major attributes of strategic thinking in practice” that resemble competencies:&lt;ref name="Liedtka" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liedtka2"&gt;[http://www.nsw.ipaa.org.au/content/docs/Course-Readings---Dip-Gov-Policy-Development/3%20Liedtka.pdf Liedktka Strategic Thinking-Can It Be Taught?-Long Range Planning-1998]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Systems perspective'', refers to being able to understand implications of strategic actions. "A strategic thinker has a mental model of the complete end-to-end system of value creation, his or her role within it, and an understanding of the competencies it contains."&lt;ref name="Liedtka" /&gt;&lt;!--page 31--&gt;
# ''Intent focused'' which means more determined and less distractible than rivals in the marketplace. Crediting Hamel and Prahalad with popularising the concept, Liedtka describes strategic intent as "the focus that allows individuals within an organization to marshal and leverage their energy, to focus attention, to resist distraction, and to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal."&lt;ref name="Liedtka" /&gt;&lt;!--p. 31--&gt;
# ''Thinking in time'' means being able to hold past, present and future in mind at the same time to create better decision making and speed implementation. "Strategy is not driven by future intent alone. It is the gap between today’s reality and intent for the future that is critical."&lt;ref name="Liedtka" /&gt;&lt;!--p. 31--&gt; Scenario planning is a practical application for incorporating "thinking in time" into strategy making.&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-10/&gt;
# ''Hypothesis driven'', ensuring that both creative and critical thinking are incorporated into strategy making. This competency explicitly incorporates the scientific method into strategic thinking.&lt;ref name="Liedtka2"/&gt;
# ''Intelligent opportunism'', which means being responsive to good opportunities. "The dilemma involved in using a well-articulated strategy to channel organisational efforts effectively and efficiently must always be balanced against the risks of losing sight of alternative strategies better suited to a changing environment."&lt;ref name="Liedtka"/&gt; &lt;!--p. 32--&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Sumitomo Masatomo'''|住友 政友|Sumitomo Masatomo|31 December 1585 
– 17 September 1652|lead=yes}} was a [[Japan]]ese copper mining businessman credited with founding the [[eponym]]ous [[Sumitomo Group]]. Originally he was a Buddhist monk. During his lifetime, there were mainly two sectors of Buddhist monks in Japan. Masatomo belonged to one of the two which later ceased to exist. Reluctant to join the other group of Buddhist monks, he turned to business to make a living. He started his business by selling books and medicines at first in a bookshop in Kyoto circa 1615.&lt;ref name="Sumitomo History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sumitomocorp.co.jp/english/company/history/index.html|title=Sumitomo History - Sumitomo Corporation|publisher=Sumitomo Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''superbill''' is an itemized form used by [[healthcare provider]]s for reflecting rendered services. Superbill is the main data source for creation of healthcare claim, which will be submitted to payers (insurances, funds, programs) for reimbursement. Although the superbill form is not unified, and it is created/modified depending on [[healthcare provider]] specialty, type of rendered services, additional requirements, as well as ease of handling, there is a set of obligatory attributes, relevant to all superbill types.

Superbill form consists of four main parts, containing mandatory fields to be completed for accurate claim creation:

'''Techsource''' involves the [[automation]], or conversion of a task or job from a manual task performed by a person, to a job performed entirely by machines. The concept of "techsourcing" has occurred across many industries for many years, however the phrase was coined by George Tosh, Principle Software Engineer for Salesforce in 2016.  Techsourcing might include the use of [[robotics]], or dedicated purpose-built machines to complete a task, but not always.

A popular example of techsourcing is the ATM or “[[Automated Teller Machine]]”. The ATM performs many of the tasks that human [[bank teller]]s performed. It has allowed banks and other financial institutions to increase customer satisfaction through decreased wait times, but often at the cost of job opportunities for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teach-ict.com/gcse_new/organisations/banking/miniweb/pg2.htm|title=Teach ICT - GCSE ICT - banking and ICT|website=www.teach-ict.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techsourcing usually occurs for jobs and roles that cannot be outsourced due to the specific nature of the job.

In 2015, and continuing into 2016, the push for a $15/hour minimum wage among many [[minimum wage]] earners has increased fears among [[economists]] that increasing the minimum wage will only lead to jobs being “techsourced”, automated, or eliminated entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/05/26/mcdonalds-ex-ceo-says-15-minimum-wage-would-lead-to-robots-and-automation-hes-right/#150611d57860|title=McDonald's Ex-CEO Is Right When He Says A $15 Minimum Wage Would Lead To Automation|last=Worstall|first=Tim|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that minimum wage jobs are not the only jobs at risk for being techsourced. In Belgium two hospitals have employed robots as receptionists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/345245/pepper-robot-lands-a-hospital-job|title=Pepper Robot Lands a Hospital Job|website=PCMAG|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to offer directions and assist patients, jobs that previously would have been filled by humans.

'''''The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)''''' (2007) is the tenth published book by [[Seth Godin]].&lt;ref&gt;The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 76 page book that illustrates the concept of "the dip"—a temporary setback that can be overcome with persistence—and how to recognize if you are within one worth pushing through or one where you should quit.

==Background==
The rough idea for ''The Dip'' first materialized on Godin's blog.&lt;ref name=800CEO&gt;[http://800ceoread.com/blog/archives/006719.html The Dip: A New Book Coming From Seth Godin] on ''800-CEO-READ''. January 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On an entry titled "The four curves of want and get," Godin shows four curves representing patterns of adoption.&lt;ref name=fourcurves&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/06/the_four_curves.html The four curves of want and get] ''Seth's Blog''. June 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He ends the post with "How do you avoid killing something too early, or celebrating too early. And last, how do you know when to kill a dud," a theme that would reappear in ''The Dip''. Five months later, Godin posted another entry titled "Understanding Local Max," in which he presented another success curve—this time nearly identical to the one that appears in his book—and analyzed the hypothetical conversation that would occur at four points on the curve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/11/understanding_l.html Understanding Local Max] ''Seth's Blog''. November 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being the basis behind ''The Dip'', the entry was also included in ''Small is the new Big'', a collection of short pieces from his blog.

==Synopsis==
Godin introduces the book with a quote from [[Vince Lombardi]]: "Quitters never win and winners never quit." He follows this with "Bad advice. Winners quit all the time. ''They just quit the right stuff at the right time.''"

Godin first makes the assertion that "being the best in the world is seriously underrated," although he defines the term 'best' as "best for them based on what they believe and what they know," and 'world' as "the world they have access to." He supports this by illustrating that [[vanilla]] [[ice cream]] is almost four times as popular as the next-most popular ice cream, further stating that this is seen in [[Zipf's Law]]. Godin's central thesis is that in order to be the best in the world, one must quit the wrong stuff and stick with the right stuff. In illustrating this, Godin introduces several curves: 'the dip,' 'the cul-de-sac,' and 'the cliff.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/2007/05/images_from_the.html Images from the book] ''The Dip Blog''. May 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Godin gives examples of the dip, ways to recognize when an apparent dip is really a cul-de-sac, and presents strategies of when to quit, amongst other things.

The book is also accompanied with cartoons from Hugh MacLeod, who publishes his cartoons on his blog ''gapingvoid'' and is the author of "How To Be Creative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gapingvoid.com/ gapingvoid] cartoons drawn on the back of business cards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Hugh [http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000932.html How To Be Creative] ''gapingvoid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and Reception==
In early March, Godin launched a companion [[blog]] to ''The Dip'' titled "The Dip Blog," in which he released details about the book and gave illustrative examples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/ The Dip Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; On his subsequent book tour, Godin agreed to go to any place where people had bought 2,500 copies of his book.&lt;ref&gt;Windley, Phil [http://www.windley.com/archives/2007/05/seth_godin_the_dip.shtml Seth Godin: The Dip]&lt;/ref&gt; Godin made stops in 15 cities, totaling 37,500 books. ''The Dip'' peaked at #5 on the [[New York Times Best Seller List]] and sold 100,000 copies in its first month of release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestsellerinterviews.com/10-questions-with-seth-godin-author-of-permission-marketing-purple-cow-and-the-dip.html 10 Questions with Seth Godin] ''Bestseller Interviews''. June 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was met with positive reviews, receiving profiles in [[USA Today]], [[The Miami Herald]], [[National Post]], [[South China Morning Post]], [[Brandweek]], and [[Entrepreneur Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, Diane [http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/francis/archive/2007/12/26/seth-godin-dig.aspx Seth Godin's the dip is a great little read] ''[[National Post]]''.

'''Time variance''' is the ability to remember historic perspectives. The requirement is to be able to know how something was classified or who owned something and how this changed as time passed.

For the context of time and frequency and qualification of [[oscillators]] and [[amplifiers]] the technical terms [[time deviation]] and [[time deviation|time variance]] is defined.

==Understanding time variance==
One required the feature of a [[data warehouse]] is for it to be "Time Variant", giving us the ability to store data representative as it existed at many points in time in the past.  [[Granularity]] of time variance and the tracking of changing data over time depends upon the needs of the business and can range from representing data values at the time they are changed on up to any periodic inspection/detection interval (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly).

Time variance allows us to join [[transaction data]] to [[reference data]] that contains values representative of the time of the event.  For example; When a customer changes their address in a sales system, that sales system would just update the address.   A data warehouse though would have processes that detect that change and then track that change allowing us to see the customers address before and after that change.   This allows us to then tie any sales events to the customer information that was active at the time of the sales event.   This would allow you to report sales totals by the city of where the customers lived at the time of the sale, as opposed to sales by city based on where everyone currently lives.

Time variance also allows us to adapt to future changes and accurately report information when data changes in the future.   For example; If we use a sales type code of 45 that would mean "Sales to General Public" on our sales orders, any future changes to how we describe that code might change the context of past orders.   Consider if we change the code 45 another meaning to "Sales to Free Membership Individuals".  Does that mean that any past sales orders with sales-type code 45 are not "Sales to General Public" and are now "Sales to Free Membership"?   Having time variance in place, allows the flexibility to either apply the description of the code active at the time of the sale or just use the new code to categorize all past sales.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1042">'''Tools of trade''' is a term generally used in [[bankruptcy law]] to determine what property a person would commonly use for the purpose of making a living, as items that are tools of trade are separately exempt from attachment with an additional amount above that normally given for a person's property.

Under bankruptcy law, the applicable exemption for tools of the trade is determined by state law and by the amount of time a person spent living in a particular state prior to filing.  An attorney can help determine which assets are exempt and which exemptions are applicable.

For example, a person might be allowed an exemption for household goods, and could use an additional exemption for tools of trade. Anything the person can show is used by them for earning a living is carried under this separate exemption.  Thus, a candlemaker would have to list a personal computer under household goods, but a computer programmer could be able to claim a computer as part of the tools of trade.

{{Indigenous rights}}

The terms '''traditional knowledge''', '''indigenous knowledge''' and '''local knowledge''' generally refer to knowledge systems embedded in the cultural traditions of [[region]]al, [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]], or local [[community|communities]]. Traditional knowledge includes types of knowledge about traditional technologies of [[subsistence]] (e.g. tools and techniques for [[hunting]] or [[agriculture]]), [[midwifery]], [[ethnobotany]] and [[traditional ecological knowledge|ecological knowledge]], [[traditional medicine]], [[celestial navigation]], [[ethnoastronomy]], [http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/climate-change/key-issues/indigenous-knowledge-and-climate-change#.UwTEefl_uvM the climate], and others. These kinds of knowledge, crucial for subsistence and survival, are generally based on accumulations of [[empirical]] observation and on interaction with the environment.

In many cases, traditional knowledge has been [[oral tradition|orally passed]] for generations from person to person. Some forms of traditional knowledge find expression in [[storytelling|stories]], [[legend]]s, [[folklore]], [[ritual]]s, [[song]]s, and [[law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kala, C.P. (2012) Traditional ecological knowledge and conservation of ethnobotanical species in the buffer zone of Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve, Madhya Pradesh.

== Characteristics ==
A report of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) Study Group on Science and Traditional Knowledge characterises traditional knowledge as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"a cumulative body of knowledge, know-how, practices and representations maintained and developed by peoples with extended histories of interaction with the natural environment. These sophisticated sets of understandings, interpretations and meanings are part and parcel of a cultural complex that encompasses language, naming and classification systems, resource use practices, ritual, spirituality and worldview."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Traditional knowledge typically distinguishes one community from another. In some communities, traditional knowledge takes on personal and [[spirituality|spiritual]] meanings. Traditional knowledge can also reflect a community's interests. Some communities depend on their traditional knowledge for survival. This is particularly true of traditional environmental knowledge, which refers to a "particular form of place-based knowledge of the diversity and interactions among plant and animal species, landforms, watercourses, and other qualities of the biophysical environment in a given place".&lt;ref&gt;Peña, Devon G.,''Mexican Americans and the Environment'', The University of Arizona Press, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;198.&lt;/ref&gt; An exemplar of a society with a wealth of [[traditional ecological knowledge]] (TEK), the South American [[Kayapo people]], have developed an extensive classification system of ecological zones of the Amazonian tropical savannah (i.e., campo / [[cerrado]]) to better manage the land.&lt;ref&gt;Posey, Darrel Addison. "Indigenous Management of Tropical Forest Ecosystems: The case of the Kayapo Indians of the Brazilian Amazon" in Dove and Carpenter, ''Environmental Anthropology: a historical reader'', Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some social scientists conceptualise knowledge within a naturalistic framework and emphasize the gradation of recent knowledge into knowledge acquired over many generations. These accounts use terms like "adaptively acquired knowledge", "socially constructed knowledge," and other terms that emphasize the social aspects of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wasongo, V.O., Kambewa, D., and Bekalo, I. (2011).  Community-Based Natural Resource Management (p. 194).  In W.O. Ochola, P.C. Sanginga, I. Bekalo (Eds.), Managing Natural Resources for Development in Africa. A Resource Book.  
Nairobi, Kenya: Univ. of Nairobi Press, 2011 (Chapter 4: pp. 165-210).
&lt;/ref&gt; Local knowledge and traditional knowledge may be thought of as distinguished by the length of time they have existed - decades to centuries versus millennia. A large number of scholarly studies in the naturalistic tradition {{Clarify|date=August 2012}} demonstrate that traditional knowledge is not a natural category, and may reflect [[Power (sociology)|power]] struggles and relationships for land, resources and [[social control]] rather than adherence to a claimed [[ancestry]] or [[Tradition|heritage]].{{Citation needed|date= August 2012}}

On the other hand, indigenous and local communities themselves may perceive traditional knowledge very differently. The knowledge of indigenous and local communities is often embedded in a [[cosmology]], and any distinction between "intangible" knowledge and physical things can become blurred. Indigenous peoples often say that "our knowledge is holistic, and cannot be separated from our lands and resources". Traditional knowledge in such [[cosmologies]] is inextricably bound to [[ancestors]], and ancestral lands.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Knowledge may not be acquired by naturalistic trial and error, but through direct [[revelation]] through conversations with "the creator", [[spirits]], or ancestors. Chamberlin (2003) writes of a [[Gitksan]] elder from [[British Columbia]] confronted by a government land-claim: "If this is your land," he asked, "where are your stories?"&lt;ref&gt; Chamberlin, J.E. (2003).  If This Is Your Land, Where Are Your Stories? Finding Common Ground. Toronto: Alfred A. Knopf Canada. &lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous and local communities often do not have strong traditions of ownership over knowledge that resemble the modern forms of [[private ownership]]. Many have clear traditions of custodianship over knowledge, and customary law may guide who may use different kinds of knowledge at particular times and places, and specify obligations that accompany the use of knowledge. From an indigenous perspective, misappropriation and misuse of knowledge may be offensive to traditions, and may have spiritual and physical repercussions in indigenous cosmological systems. Consequently, indigenous and local communities argue that others' use of their traditional knowledge warrants respect and sensitivity. Critics of "traditional knowledge", however, see such demands for "respect" as an attempt to prevent unsubstantiated beliefs from being subjected to the same scrutiny as other knowledge-claims.{{cn|date=October 2016}} This has particular significance for [[environmental management]] because the spiritual component of "traditional knowledge" can justify any activity, including the [[unsustainable]] harvesting of resources.

Recently, international attention has turned to [[intellectual property|intellectual property laws]] to preserve, protect, and promote traditional knowledge. The reasons for this are complex. In 1992, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) recognized the value of traditional knowledge in protecting species, ecosystems and landscapes, and incorporated language regulating access to it and its use (discussed below). It was soon urged that implementing these provisions would require revision of international intellectual property agreements.

This became even more pressing with the adoption of the [[World Trade Organization]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPs), which established rules for creating and protecting intellectual property that could be interpreted to conflict with the agreements made under the CBD. In response, the states who had ratified the CBD requested the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) to investigate the relationship between intellectual property rights, biodiversity and traditional knowledge. WIPO began this work with a fact-finding mission in 1999. Considering the issues involved with biodiversity and the broader issues in TRIPs (involving all forms of cultural expressions, not just those associated with biodiversity &amp;ndash; including traditional designs, music, songs, stories, etc.), WIPO established the Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (IGC-GRTKF).

The period of the early 1990s to the Millennium was also characterized by the rapid rise in global [[civil society]]. The high-level Brundtland Report (1987) recommended a change in development policy that allowed for direct community participation and respected local rights and aspirations. Indigenous peoples and others had successfully petitioned the United Nations to establish a [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]] that made two early surveys on treaty rights and land rights. These led to a greater public and governmental recognition of indigenous land and resource rights, and the need to address the issue of collective human rights, as distinct from the individual rights of existing human rights law.

The collective human rights of indigenous and local communities has been increasingly recognized &amp;ndash; such as in the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) [[Convention 169]] (1989) and the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (2007). The [[Rio Declaration]] (1992), endorsed by the presidents and ministers of the majority of the countries of the world, recognized indigenous and local communities as distinct groups with special concerns that should be addressed by states.

Initial concern was over the territorial rights and traditional resource rights of these communities. Indigenous peoples soon showed concern for the misappropriation and misuse of their "intangible" knowledge and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples and local communities have resisted, among other things: the use of traditional symbols and designs as mascots, derivative arts and crafts; the use or modification of traditional songs; the patenting of traditional uses of medicinal plants; and the copyrighting and distribution of traditional stories.

Indigenous peoples and local communities have sought to prevent the patenting of traditional knowledge and resources where they have not given express consent. They have sought for greater protection and control over traditional knowledge and resources. Certain communities have also sought to ensure that their traditional knowledge is used equitably - according to restrictions set by their traditions, or requiring benefit sharing for its use according to benefits which they define.

Three broad approaches to protect traditional knowledge have been developed. The first emphasizes protecting traditional knowledge as a form of cultural heritage. The second looks at protection of traditional knowledge as a collective human right. The third, taken by the WTO and WIPO, investigates the use of existing or novel ''[[sui generis]]'' measures to protect traditional knowledge.

Currently, only a few [[nation]]s offer explicit ''[[sui generis]]'' protection for traditional knowledge. However, a number of [[country|countries]] are still undecided as to whether law should give traditional knowledge deference. Indigenous peoples have shown ambivalence about the [[indigenous intellectual property|intellectual property]] approach. Some have been willing to investigate how existing intellectual property mechanisms (primarily: patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets) can protect traditional knowledge. Others believe that an intellectual property approach may work, but will require more radical and novel forms of intellectual property law ("sui generis rights"). Others believe that the intellectual property system uses concepts and terms that are incompatible with traditional cultural concepts, and favors the commercialization of their traditions, which they generally resist. Many have argued that the form of protection should refer to collective human rights to protect their distinct identities, religions and cultural heritage.

===Public domain===
[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Hansel and Gretel]] is a [[fairy tale]] of Germanic origin, recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in 1812. The tale has been adapted to various media, most notably the [[opera]] ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' (1893) by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] and a stop-motion animated feature film based on the opera. Artwork by [[Arthur Rackham]], 1909]]

Literary and artistic works based upon, derived from or inspired by traditional culture or folklore may incorporate new elements or expressions. Hence these works may be "new" works with a living and identifiable creator, or creators. Such contemporary works may include a new interpretation, arrangement, adaptation or collection of pre-existing cultural heritage that is in the public domain. Traditional culture or folklore may also be "repackaged" in [[digital formats]], or [[Conservation-restoration|restoration]] and [[film colorization|colorization]]. Contemporary and tradition based expressions and works of traditional culture are generally protected under existing copyright law, a form of intellectual property law, as they are sufficiently original to be regarded as "new" upon publication. Once the intellectual property rights afforded to these new works of traditional knowledge expire, they fall into the public domain.&lt;ref name="Graber 2008 174"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Graber| first = Christoph Beat|author2=Nenova, Mira Burri  | title = Intellectual Property and Traditional Cultural Expressions in a digital environment| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2008| page =174| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=gK6OI0hrANsC&amp;dq=%22public+domain%22+intellectual+property&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 1-84720-921-1}}; Paolo Davide Farah, Riccardo Tremolada, "Diritti di proprietà intellettuale, diritti umani e patrimonio culturale immateriale", (Intellectual Property Rights, Human Rights and Intangible Cultural Heritage), RIVISTA DI DIRITTO INDUSTRIALE (Journal of Intellectual Property Law), Issue 2, Part I,  June 2014, {{ISSN|0035-614X}}, Giuffre, pp. 21-47. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2472388&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[public domain]], as defined in the context of [[intellectual property]] rights, is not a concept recognised by some indigenous peoples. As much of traditional knowledge has never been protected under intellectual property rights, it is argued that they can not be said to have entered any public domain. On this point the [[Tulalip Tribes]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state has commented that "...open sharing does not automatically confer a right to use the knowledge (of indigenous people)... traditional cultural expressions are not in the public domain because indigenous peoples have failed to take the steps necessary to protect the knowledge in the Western intellectual property system, but from a failure of governments and citizens to recognise and respect the customary laws regulating their use".&lt;ref name="Graber 2008 174"/&gt; Equally however, the idea of restricting the use of publicly available information without clear notice and justification is regarded by many in developed nations as unethical as well as impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iccwbo.org/uploadedFiles/ICC/policy/intellectual_property/Statements/Protecting_Traditional_Knowledge.pdf |title=Policy commissions |publisher=International Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511124417/http://iccwbo.org/uploadedFiles/ICC/policy/intellectual_property/Statements/Protecting_Traditional_Knowledge.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) ===
Article 27. 3(b) of the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPs) sets out certain conditions under which certain biological materials or intellectual innovations may be excluded from patenting. The Article also contains a requirement that Article 27 be reviewed. In the TRIPs-related Doha Declaration of 2001, Paragraph 19 expanded the review to a review of Article 27 and the rest of the TRIPs agreement to include the relationship between the TRIPS Agreement and the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the protection of traditional knowledge and folklore.

=== The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) ===
The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), signed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in 1992, was the first international environmental convention to develop measures for the use and protection of traditional knowledge, related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. By 2006, 188 had ratified the Convention and agreed to be bound by its provisions, the largest number of nations to accede to any existing treaty (the United States is one of the few countries that has signed, but not ratified, the CBD). Significant provisions include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Article 8.  In-situ Conservation''

Each Contracting Party shall, as far as possible and as appropriate:

(a)...

(j) Subject to its national legislation, respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices...

''Article 10.  Sustainable Use of Components of Biological Diversity''

Each Contracting Party shall, as far as possible and as appropriate:

(a)...

(c) Protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices that are compatible with conservation or sustainable use requirements
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The interpretation of these provisions has been elaborated through decisions by the parties (ratifiers of the Convention) (see the Convention on Biological Diversity Handbook, available free in digital format from the Secretariat). Nevertheless, the provisions regarding Access and Benefit Sharing contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity never achieved consensus and soon the authority over these questions fell back to WIPO.&lt;ref&gt;Louafi, Sélim and Jean-Frédéric Morin, International governance of biodiversity: Involving all the users of genetic resources, IDDRI, 2004, https://www.academia.edu/3809935/Louafi_S._and_J-F_Morin&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the Convention on Biological Diversity meeting, in Buenos Aires, in 1996, emphasis was put on local knowledge. Key players, such as local communities and indigenous peoples, should be recognized by States, and have their sovereignty recognised over the biodiversity of their territories, so that they can continue protecting it.&lt;ref&gt;Roussel, Bernard. [http://www.iddri.org/Publications/Collections/Syntheses/The-CBD-Local-knowledge-systems-at-the-heart-of-international-debates "The CBD: Local knowledge systems at the heart of international debates,"] ''Les Synthèses'', n° 2, February 2003, Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parties to the Convention set a 2010 target to negotiate an international legally binding regime on access and benefit sharing (ABS) at the Eighth meeting (COP8), 20–31 March 2006 in Curitiba, Brazil. This target was met in October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan, by conclusion of the [[Nagoya Protocol]] to the CBD. The agreement is now open for ratification, and will come into force when 50 signatories have ratified it. It entered into force on 12 October 2014. {{As of|2017|10}}, 100 nations and the EU ratified the Nagoya Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cbd.int/abs/nagoya-protocol/signatories/default.shtml | title=Parties to the Nagoya Protocol | publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity | accessdate=19 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protocol treats of inter-governmental obligations related to genetic resources, and includes measures related to the rights of indigenous and local communities to control access to and derive benefits from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.

===Government of India efforts===
In 2001, the [[Government of India]] set up the [[Traditional Knowledge Digital Library]] (TKDL) as repository of 1200 formulations of various systems of Indian medicine, such as [[Ayurveda]], [[Unani]] and [[Siddha medicine|Siddha]] and 1500 [[Yoga]] postures ([[asana]]s), translated into five languages — English, German, French, Spanish and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkdl.res.in/tkdl/langdefault/common/ Traditional Knowledge Digital Library] website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61511|title=Know Instances of Patenting on the UES of Medicinal Plants in India|date=May 6, 2010|publisher=PIB, Ministry of Environment and Forests|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has also signed agreements with the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO), [[United Kingdom Patent Office|United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office]] (UKIPO) and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) to prevent the grant of invalid patents by giving [[patent examiner]]s at International [[patent office|Patent Offices]] access to the TKDL database for patent search and examination.&lt;ref name="pt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/04/28214947/CSIR-wing-objects-to-Avesthage.html|title=CSIR wing objects to Avesthagen patent claim|date=April 28, 2010|work=Live Mint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61122|title=India Partners with US and UK to Protect Its Traditional Knowledge and Prevent Bio-Piracy|date=April 28, 2010|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IPR Policy of Kerala Govt.(India)''' - Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) Policy for [[Kerala]] released in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/06/28/stories/2008062856600100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=IPRs policy proposes ‘knowledge commons' | date=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes adoption of the concepts ‘[[knowledge commons]]’ and ‘commons licence’ for the protection of traditional knowledge. The chief architects of the Policy are Prof. [[Prabhat Patnaik]] and Mr. [[R S Praveen Raj|R.S. Praveen Raj]]. The policy seeks to put all traditional knowledge into the realm of "[[knowledge commons]]", distinguishing this from the [[public domain]]. While codification of TK in [[TKDL|digital libraries]] and sharing the same with patent offices prevents direct misappropriation, it is feared that it may provide an opportunity for private appropriation by making cosmetic improvements to such traditional knowledge that is not readily accessible otherwise. TKDL cannot at the same time be kept confidential and treated as prior art - says R.S. Praveen Raj.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property Watch 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=No Need Of IPRs For Protecting Traditional Knowledge | website=Intellectual Property Watch | date=3 September 2015 | url=http://www.ip-watch.org/2015/09/03/no-need-of-ipr-route-for-protecting-traditional-knowledge/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to R S Praveen Raj any attempt to codify community-held TK in the form of Traditional Knowledge Digital Libraries (TKDL) using "Prior Informed Consent" and "Access and Benefit Sharing" concepts would be a gross injustice to those communities if the knowledge was shared with patent offices or even with researchers, as it would affect the livelihoods of Traditional Knowledge practitioners. He also cautions against classifying Traditional Knowledge under Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and creation of statutory registrable rights on TK,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/caution-on-classifying-traditional-knowledge-under-ipr/article7589338.ece | work=The Hindu | title='Caution on classifying-Traditional Knowledge under IPR' | date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he proposes the creation of a Traditional Knowledge Docketing System (TKDS) to indicate the location at which the knowledge is available, the community that possesses the traditional knowledge, a short description of the nature of TK and community protocol, if any. He argues that the indigenous communities should be educated and empowered to protect their TK through existing legal mechanisms or take patents on the innovations made by them on the TK (if they feel so) and to negotiate with the potential customers by forming societies or trusts of their own. There is no bar for patenting inventions, though it may be based on TK. Section 3(p) of Indian Patents Act, 1970 only prevents patenting of "traditional knowledge or which is an aggregation or duplication of known properties of traditionally known component or components" and not patenting of any inventions based on TK.

In the year 2016, Dr. Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament from Thiruvananthapuram introduced a Private Bill ([http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/3013.pdf The Protection of Traditional Knowledge Bill, 2016]). The Bill was introduced for the ''protection, preservation and promotion'' of traditional knowledge system in India. The Bill is yet to be discussed in the Parliament. Neither, the Bill was discussed much in the media. According to Mr. [[Vishnu S Warrier]], Dr. Shashi Tharoor has [http://www.intellectualpropertyprimer.com/protection-traditional-knowledge-bill-failure.html failed to address the real concern] of traditional knowledge through his Private Bill.

==Traditional cultural expressions==

The phrase "traditional cultural expressions" is used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] to refer to "any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Traffic management''' is a key branch within [[logistics]]. It concerns the planning, control and purchasing of transport services needed to physically move vehicles (for example [[aircraft]], [[road vehicles]], [[rolling stock]] and [[watercraft]]) and [[freight]].

Traffic management is implemented by people working with different job titles in different branches:

* Within freight and cargo logistics: '''traffic manager''', assessment of hazardous and awkward materials, carrier choice and fees, [[demurrage]], documentation, [[expediting]], freight consolidation, insurance, reconsignment and tracking
* Within [[air traffic management]]: [[air traffic controller]]
* Within rail traffic management: [[rail traffic controller]], [[train dispatcher]] or [[Signalman (rail)|signalman]]
* Within [[road traffic management]]: [[traffic controller (disambiguation)|traffic controller]]

Traffic Control Management is the design, auditing and implementation of traffic control plans at worksites and civil infrastructure projects. Traffic Management can include but is not limited to: flagging, lane closures, detours, full freeway closures, pedestrian access, traffic plans and sidewalk closures.&lt;ref&gt;City Rise Safety [http://cityrisesafety.com/control Why Traffic Control is so important to the livelihood of your Community].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wage theft''' is the denial of [[wages]] or [[employee benefits]] rightfully owed an [[employee]]. It can be conducted by employers in various ways, among them failing to pay [[overtime]]; violating [[minimum wage|minimum-wage]] laws; the [[misclassification of employees as independent contractors]], illegal deductions in pay; forcing employees to work "off the clock", or simply not paying an employee at all.

According to some studies, wage theft is common in the [[United States]], particularly from [[low wage]] legal or [[undocumented immigrant]] workers.&lt;ref name=NYTStudyreport&gt;{{cite news|title=Low-Wage Workers Are Often Cheated, Study Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/02/us/02wage.html|accessdate=May 29, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 1, 2009|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Workers Are Claiming  'Wage Theft' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/business/more-workers-are-claiming-wage-theft.html|accessdate=August 31, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 31, 2014|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Economic Policy Institute]] reported in 2014 that survey evidence suggests wage theft costs US workers billions of dollars a year.&lt;ref&gt;Brady Meixell and Ross Eisenbrey (September 11, 2014).

]]
According to the FLSA, unless exempt, employees are entitled to receive [[overtime]] pay calculated at least time and one-half times pay for all time worked past forty hours a week. Some exemptions to this rule apply to public service agencies or to employees who meet certain requirements in accordance to their job duties along with a salary of no less than $455 a week. Despite regulations, there are many employees today who are not paid overtime due them. A 2009 study of workers in the United States found that in 12 occupations more than half of surveyed workers reported being denied overtime pay: child care (90.2 percent denial), stock and office clerks (86 percent), home health care (82.7 percent),  beauty/dry cleaning and general repair workers (81.9 percent), car wash workers and parking attendants (77.9 percent), waiters, cafeteria workers and bartenders (77.9 percent), retail salespersons (76.2 percent), janitors and grounds workers (71.2 percent), garment workers (69.9 percent), cooks and dishwashers (67.8 percent), construction workers (66.1 percent) and cashiers (58.8 percent).&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclnet.org/worker-rights/148-wage-theft/525-wage-theft-six-common-methods |title=Wage Theft: Six common methods - National Consumers League |publisher=Nclnet.org |date= |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimum wage ===
In 2009, reform placed the new [[US|United States]] federal [[minimum wage]] at $7.25. Some states have legislation that sets a state minimum wage. In the case an employee is subject to both federal and state minimum wage acts, the employee is entitled to the higher standard of compensation. For tipped employees, the employer is only required to compensate the employee $2.13 an hour as long as the fixed wage and the tips add up to be at or above the federal minimum wage. Minimum wage is enforced by the [[Wage and Hour Division]] (WHD). WHD is generally contacted by 25,000 people a year in regards to concerns and violations of minimum wage pay.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpps.org.my/resource_centre/FACTSHEET%20ON%20MINIMUM%20WAGE%20LEGISLATION%20AROUND%20THE%20WORLD.pdf |title=Factsheet on Minimum Wage Legislation Around The World |work=Centre for Public Policy Studies (CPPS) |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of wage theft for tipped employees is to receive no standard pay ($2.13 an hour) along with tips.&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt;

=== Misclassification ===
[[Misclassification of employees as independent contractors|Misclassification of employees]] is a violation that leaves employees very vulnerable to other forms of wage theft. Under the FLSA, [[independent contractor]]s do not receive the same protection as an employee for certain benefits. The difference between the two classifications depends on the permanency of the employment, opportunity for profit and loss, the worker's level of [[self-employment]] along with their degree of control. An independent contractor is not entitled to [[minimum wage]], [[overtime]], [[insurance]], protection, or other employee rights. Attempts are sometimes made to define ordinary employees as independent contractors.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt;

Misclassification in the United States is extensive. In New York state, for example, it was found in a 2007 study that approximately 704,785 workers, or 10.3% of the state's private sector workforce, was misclassified each year. For the industries covered in the study, average [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]] taxable wages underreported due to misclassification was on average $4.3 billion for the year and [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment insurance tax]] underreported in these industries was $176 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=reports|title = The Cost of Worker Misclassification in New York State|author1=Linda H.

=== Illegal deductions ===
Employees are subject to forms of wage theft through illegal deductions. Trivial to sometimes fabricated violations in the workplace are used to validate deductions. Any deduction that brings an employee to a level of compensation lower than minimum wage is also illegal. In many states, employers are required to issue employees documentation of deductions along with earnings. Failure to issue this documentation is generally prevalent in working places subject to wage theft.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt;

=== Full wage theft ===
The most blatant form of wage theft is for an employee to not be paid for work done. An employee being asked to work overtime, working through breaks, or being asked to report early and/or leave late without pay is being subjected to wage theft. This is sometimes justified as displacing a paid meal break without guaranteeing meal break time. In the most extreme cases, employees report receiving nothing.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt; In some cases, the [[Illegal immigration to the United States|legal status]] of the workers can enable employers to withhold pay without fear of facing any consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/10/176677299/construction-booming-in-texas-but-many-workers-pay-dearly|title=Construction Booming In Texas, But Many Workers Pay Dearly|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other forms ===
Putting the pressure on injured workers to not file for [[workers' compensation]] is frequently successful.&lt;ref name=NYTStudyreport /&gt; Employees are often confronted with threats of firing or calls to immigration services if they complain or seek redress. Workers are often denied time off or [[Annual leave|vacation time]] that they have acquired or denied pay for [[sick leave]] or vacation time.

In Australia, another form of wage theft is the failure of employers to pay the mandatory minimum contribution to employee's [[Superannuation in Australia|superannuation fund]]. Between 2009 and 2013 the [[Australian Tax Office]] recovered&amp;nbsp;A$1.3 billion&amp;nbsp;in unpaid superannuation which is estimated to be only a small portion of total unpaid superannuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/2014/07/08/unpaid-super-a-billion-dollar-problem-says-actu-a-527139.html#.U7wMjvldXfI|title = Unpaid Super a Billion Dollar Problem, Says ACTU|date = 7 July 2014|work = Targeted News Service|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

A 2009 study based on interviews of over 4,000 [[low wage]] workers in [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City]] found that wage theft from low wage workers in large cities in the United States was severe and widespread. Incidents varied with the type of job and employee. Sixty-eight percent of the surveyed workers experienced at least one pay-related violation in the week prior to the survey. On average the workers in the three cities lost a total of $2,634 annually due to [[workplace violation]]s, out of an average income of $17,616, which translates into wage theft of fifteen percent of income. Extrapolating from these figures, low wage workers in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City lost more than $2.9 billion due to employment and labor law violations.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt; Nationally it is estimated that workers are not paid at least $19 billion every year in overtime&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://voiceofrussia.com/us/2014_05_21/Wage-Theft-in-America-How-the-Rich-get-Richer-While-the-Poor-Stay-Poor-6533/|title = Wage Theft in America: How the Rich get Richer While the Poor Stay Poor|last = Park|first = Crystal|date = 21 May 2014|work = Voice of Russia|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in the US $40 billion to $60 billion in total are lost annually due to all forms of wage theft.&lt;ref name=Groote&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michael De Groote|first1=Michael De Groote|title=Wage theft: How employers steal millions from workers every week|url=http://national.deseretnews.com/article/1748/Wage-theft-How-employers-steal-millions-from-workers-every-week.html|accessdate=July 1, 2014 |publisher=Desert News National|date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to national annual losses of  $340 million due to [[robbery]], $4.1 billion due to [[burglary]], $5.3 billion due to [[larceny]], and $3.8 billion due to [[auto theft]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="Federal Bureau of Investigation"/&gt;

=== Workers at risk ===
Studies have found inflated rates of wage theft violations in markets employing women and foreign-born populations. Within the foreign-born population, women were at a much greater risk for wage violations than their male counterparts. Undocumented workers or unauthorized immigrants stood at the highest risk levels. Education, longer [[tenure]]d employment, and English proficiency proved to be influential factors in employee populations. All three variables reduced the probability of wage theft for the aforementioned demographics. Workplaces where the compensation was paid in one weekly flat rate or in cash saw a higher instance rate of wage theft. Smaller businesses with less than 100 employees also saw a higher instance rate of violations than larger business. In one study, the [[manufacturing industry]], repair services, and private home employment were at the highest risk for violations at the workplace. [[Home health care]], education, and construction saw the lowest levels of wage theft. Restaurants, grocery stores, retail, and warehousing fell around the [[median]].&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft and Workplace Violations in Los Angeles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irle.ucla.edu/events/2010/pdf/LAwagetheft.pdf |title=Wage Theft and Workplace Violations in Los Angeles - The Failure of Employment and Labour Law for Low-Wage Workers |author=Milkman, R. |author2=Narro, V. |author3=González, A. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2010 |publisher=Institute for Research on Labor and Employment University of California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary examples ===
In November 2011, Warehouse Workers helped [[Wal-Mart]] warehouse employees file their fourth [[Class action|class-action lawsuit]] against the warehouse companies. Without Wal-Mart being a direct defendant, the argument was made that Wal-Mart has created this culture amongst the companies it works with. The first lawsuit filed was in 2009. The workers argued that poor record keeping and broken promises have led to workers receiving less than minimum wage. Walmart also denied workers paid vacations that they were promised upon contracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kari Lydersen |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/153226/wage_theft_at_wal-mart_warehouses_fourth_lawsuit_in_two_years_filed_on_behalf_of_underpaid_workers/ |title=Wage Theft at Wal-Mart Warehouses?

The Florida Retail Federation had recently proposed a bill to block a wage theft ordinance in their county, which was intended to create a system that would speed the investigation and processing of wage theft reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/palm-beach/pb-wage-theft-macys-20111126,0,1398136.story |title=Topic Galleries - South Florida wage theft macys |publisher=Sun-sentinel |date= 26 November 2011|accessdate=March 4, 2012|archive-date= November 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129212218/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/palm-beach/pb-wage-theft-macys-20111126,0,1398136.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by the Iowa Policy Project calculated that dishonest employers defraud Iowa workers out of about $600 million annually in wages. State Senator [[Tony Bisignano]], Democrat from [[Des Moines]] and Senator [[William Dotzler]], a Democrat from [[Waterloo, Iowa]], proposed a bill to strengthen wage law enforcement on January 28, 2015, "since Iowa's wage theft laws are so weak they are impossible to enforce". The Iowa Association of Business and Industry opposed the bill, saying that resources for enforcement should be the focus instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=William Petroski|title=Senate Democrats offer plan to stop Iowa wage theft|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/27/iowa-wage-theft-senate/22430863/|accessdate=29 January 2015|work=DesMoinesRegister|publisher=Gannett|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 report by Middlesex University and Trust for London revealed that at least 2 million workers in Britain are losing an estimated £3 billion in unpaid holiday pay and wages per year. It suggested that withholding holiday pay, not paying wages and workers losing a couple of hours money per week are some of the deliberate strategies used by employers to improve their profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unpaid Britain |url=https://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/publications/unpaid-britain-wage-default-british-labour-market/ |website=Trust for London |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentation ===
In the United States, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) requires employers to keep detailed records regarding the identity of workers and hours worked for all workers who are protected under federal [[minimum wage law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs21.htm|title =Fact Sheet #21: Recordkeeping Requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) |date = July 2008|accessdate = |website = |publisher = US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=6ed1b6e0e73541547a3ca78d87ee2663&amp;r=PART&amp;n=29y3.1.1.1.13#29:3.1.1.1.13.1.89.1|title =Labor.PART 516—RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY EMPLOYERS |work= Code of Federal Regulations|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states require that employers also provide each worker with documentation every pay period detailing that worker's hours, wages and deductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thehrspecialist.com/38703/Pay_Statements__50_State_Laws.hr?cat=compensation_and_benefits|title =Pay Statements: 50 State Laws |date = August 11, 2011|accessdate = |website=HR Specialist|publisher = Business Management Daily, division of Capitol Information Group, Inc. }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2015}} As of September 2011 [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[South Dakota]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Virginia]] did not require this documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.primepay.com/payroll-business-experts-blog/bid/33887/What-States-Require-Printed-Pay-Statements|title =What States Require Printed Pay Statements? |date = |accessdate = |website = blog.primepay.com|publisher =PrimePay, LLC.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2015}} A 2008 survey of wage theft from workers in [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[California]] found that 57% of low wage workers did not receive this required documentation and that workers who were paid in cash or on a weekly rate were more likely to experience wage theft.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt; Anecdotal evidence suggests that tip theft, which is a legally complex issue distinct from wage theft and not necessarily under the control of the same laws governing the payment of wages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.texasemploymentlawblog.com/2013/05/articles/overtime-law-1/courts-make-it-more-difficult-for-employees-to-pursue-tip-theft-by-employers/|title =Courts Make it More Difficult for Employees to Pursue Tip Theft by Employers |date = May 2013 |accessdate = |website = texasemploymentlawblog.com|publisher =texasemploymentlaw }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2015}} may also be common in instances where employer record keeping does not comply with the law.&lt;ref name="Ruggles"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruggles Waitstaff Stages Walk-Out, Alleging Non-Payment of Tips: UPDATE|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/eating/2011/12/ruggles_waitstaff_stages_walk-.php|accessdate=May 29, 2012|newspaper=Houston Press|date=December 5, 2011|author=Katharine Shilcutt|format=blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Penalties and sanctions ===
When the [[Wage and Hour Division]] (WHD) receives reports of violations, it works to ensure that employers change their work practices and pay back missed wages to the employees. [[Willful violation|Willful violators]] can face fines up to $10,000 upon their first conviction with [[imprisonment]] resulting from future convictions. In regards to [[child labor laws]], an employer can face a fine of up to $11,000 per minor. In 2012 the Wage and Hour Division collected $280 million in back wages for 308,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dol.gov/dol/budget/2014/PDF/FY2014BIB.pdf|title = FY 2014 Department of Labor Budget in Brief|date = |accessdate= |website = |publisher = US Department of Labor|page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, there are 1,100 federal investigators for 135 million workers in more than 7 million businesses.&lt;ref name=Carpenter&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carpenter|first1=Zoë|title=Low-Wage Workers' Newest Ally Is a Washington Bureaucrat|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/180462/low-wage-workers-newest-ally-washington-bureaucrat#|accessdate=July 2, 2014|publisher=The Nation|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of labor enforcement agents to U.S. workers has decreased tenfold since the inception of the FLSA from one for every 11,000 workers in 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-05/linkedin-stiffed-its-own-employees-agrees-to-pay-millions|title = LinkedIn Stiffed Its Own Employees, Agrees to Pay Millions|last = Josh Eidelson|first = Josh Eidelson|date = 5 August 2014|work = Businessweek|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to one for every 123,000 workers in 2014.&lt;ref name="Carpenter" /&gt;

In February 2010 [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] became the first jurisdiction in America to ban wage theft with an ordinance passed unanimously by the [[county commission]]. Prior to the ordinance, wage theft was called "the crime wave that almost no one talks about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/stopwagetheft/in-the-news|title=Stop Wage Theft — In the News |publisher=South Florida Interfaith Worker Justice |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ye Zheyun''' is a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[businessman]] who was accused of being involved in a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Association football|football]] [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[Gambling|betting]] [[List of sporting scandals|scandal]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expatica.com/be/news/Belgian-soccer-match-fixing-scandal-widens_133915.html|title=Belgian soccer match-fixing scandal widens|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that several teams and/or players received money from Ye to [[Match fixing|influence match results]], so involved gamblers could be certain of a gambling profit.

==Background information==
Teams mentioned in the scandal are [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]], [[R.A.A. Louviéroise|La Louvière]], [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]], [[R.A.E.C. Mons|Mons]], [[K.F.C. Verbroedering Geel|Geel]] and also [[Beerschot AC|Germinal Beerschot]]. Ye always appeared at teams with financial problems, except for Beerschot, who had at that time a crucial match against AEC Mons who were on the verge of relegation. The insinuations about fixed results started after a few matches, on which were heavily betted, with strange events and/or results. Such as e.g. Lierse starting with a reserve team twice unexpectedly. Ye had also been the owner of [[Finland|Finnish]] team [[AC Allianssi]], due to [[bankruptcy]] a now defunct club who also seemed to experience from some strange match events at the end of their existence. Police investigated the case but found insufficient evidence.

==Disappearance==
Ye mostly worked together with Pietro Allatta and [[Olivier Suray]]. Police arrested both, but Allatta and Suray were released after interrogation. On 16 March the Belgian [[Federal Public Service Justice|Justice Department]] ordered an international [[arrest warrant]] against Ye. It is unknown where he currently remains. His [[lawyer]] told [[France|French]] [[sports]] [[newspaper|paper]] ''[[L'Équipe]]'' that Ye denied all accusations and that he was residing somewhere in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/03/sports/soccer-corruption-without-borders-in-belgian-scandals-china-link.html|title=Soccer: Corruption without borders in Belgian scandal's China link|date=2006-03-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E2DB1330F935A35751C1A96F9C8B63|title=Police Look at Links to Soccer Betting in Murders in England|last=Werdigier|first=Julia|date=2009-12-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-15|last2=Newcastle|first2=ROB HUGHES; Julia Werdigier reported from|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=London|first3=Rob Hughes from|last4=Bochum|last5=Germany.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
