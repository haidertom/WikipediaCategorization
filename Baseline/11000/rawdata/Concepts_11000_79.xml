'''Academic freedom''' is the conviction that the freedom of inquiry by faculty members is essential to the mission of the academy as well as the principles of [[academia]], and that scholars should have freedom to teach or communicate ideas or facts (including those that are inconvenient to external political groups or to authorities) without being targeted for repression, job loss, or imprisonment.

Academic freedom is a contested issue and, therefore, has limitations in practice. In the [[United States]], for example, according to the widely recognized "1940 Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure" of the [[American Association of University Professors]], teachers should be careful to avoid controversial matters that are unrelated to the subject discussed. When they speak or write in public, they are free to express their opinions without fear from institutional censorship or discipline, but they should show restraint and clearly indicate that they are not speaking for their institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/policydocs/contents/1940statement.htm | title= 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure | publisher = American Association of University Professors and of the Association of American Colleges |page = 3 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic [[tenure]] protects academic freedom by ensuring that teachers can be fired only for causes such as gross professional incompetence or behavior that evokes condemnation from the academic community itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/policydocs/contents/1940statement.htm | title= 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure | publisher = American Association of University Professors and of the Association of American Colleges |page = 4 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
[[File:Michael Polanyi.png|thumb|[[Michael Polanyi]] argued that academic freedom was a fundamental necessity for the production of true knowledge.]] 
Although the notion of academic freedom has a long implicit history, the idea was first clearly formulated in response to the encroachments of the totalitarian state on science and academia in general for the furtherance of its own goals. For instance, in the [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]], scientific research was brought under strict political control in the 1930s. A number of research areas were declared "[[bourgeois pseudoscience]]" and forbidden, notably [[genetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first=Bentley | last=Glass |date=May 1962
 | title=Scientists in Politics | volume=18 | issue=5
 | page=3 | journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgkAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see "[[Lysenkoism]]") and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenfeld|first=Liah|date=1988-01-01|title=Soviet Sociology and Sociology in the Soviet Union|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=14|pages=99–123|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.14.1.99|jstor=2083312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend toward subjugating science to the interests of the state also had proponents in the West, including the influential [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[John Desmond Bernal]], who published ''The Social Function of Science'' in 1939.

In contrast to this approach, [[Michael Polanyi]] argued that a structure of liberty is essential for the advancement of science – that the freedom to pursue science for its own sake is a prerequisite for the production of knowledge through peer review and the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Michael Polanyi|title=Personal Knowledge|year=1958|isbn=0-7734-9150-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, as a consequence of an invitation to give lectures for the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the USSR, Polanyi met [[Bukharin]], who told him that in socialist societies all scientific research is directed to accord with the needs of the latest [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]]. Demands in Britain for centrally planned scientific research led Polanyi, together with [[John Baker (biologist)|John Baker]], to found the influential [[Society for Freedom in Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01102181|author =William McGucken|year=1978|title=On Freedom and Planning in Science: The Society for Freedom in Science 1940&amp;ndash;1946|journal=[[Minerva (Norwegian periodical)|Minerva]]|volume=16|issue=1|pages=42&amp;ndash;72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society promoted a liberal conception of science as free enquiry against the instrumental view that science should exist primarily to serve the needs of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGucken | first1 = William | year = 1978 | title = On Freedom and Planning in Science: The Society for Freedom in Science 1940–1946 | url = | journal = Minerva | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 42–72 | doi=10.1007/bf01102181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles, re-published in ''The Contempt of Freedom'' (1940) and ''The Logic of Liberty'' (1951), Polanyi claimed that co-operation amongst scientists is analogous to the way in which [[Agent (economics)|agents]] co-ordinate themselves within a [[free market]]. Just as consumers in a free market determine the value of products, science is a [[spontaneous order]] that arises as a consequence of open debate amongst specialists. Science can therefore only flourish when scientists have the liberty to pursue truth as an end in itself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[S]cientists, freely making their own choice of problems and pursuing them in the light of their own personal judgment, are in fact co-operating as members of a closely knit organization.

Such self-co-ordination of independent initiatives leads to a joint result which is unpremeditated by any of those who bring it about.

Any attempt to organize the group ... under a single authority would eliminate their independent initiatives, and thus reduce their joint effectiveness to that of the single person directing them from the centre. It would, in effect, paralyse their co-operation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Rationale==
Proponents of academic freedom believe that the freedom of inquiry by students and faculty members is essential to the mission of the academy. They argue that academic communities are repeatedly targeted for repression due to their ability to shape and control the flow of information.  When scholars attempt to teach or communicate ideas or facts that are inconvenient to external political groups or to authorities, they may find themselves targeted for public vilification, job loss, imprisonment, or even death. For example, in North Africa, a professor of public health discovered that his country's infant mortality rate was higher than government figures indicated. He lost his job and was imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Quinn (2004). "[http://www.ssrc.org/workspace/images/crm/new_publication_3/%7B5cebcead-2d60-de11-bd80-001cc477ec70%7D.pdf Defending 'Dangerous Minds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626011312/http://www.ssrc.org/workspace/images/crm/new_publication_3/%7B5cebcead-2d60-de11-bd80-001cc477ec70%7D.pdf |date=2010-06-26 }}.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph E. Fuchs (1969). "Academic Freedom—Its Basic Philosophy, Function and History," in Louis Joughin (ed)., ''Academic Freedom and Tenure: A Handbook of the American Association of University Professors.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of [[biology]] in the [[Soviet Union]] is also cited{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} as a reason why society has an interest in protecting academic freedom. A Soviet biologist [[Trofim Lysenko]] rejected Western science – then focused primarily on making advances in theoretical genetics, based on research with the fruit fly (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'') – and proposed a more socially relevant approach to farming that was based on the [[collectivization|collectivist]] principles of [[dialectical materialism]]. (Lysenko called this "[[Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin|Michurinism]]", but it is more popularly known today as [[Lysenkoism]].) Lysenko's ideas proved appealing to the Soviet leadership, in part because of their value as propaganda, and he was ultimately made director of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Subsequently, Lysenko directed a purge of scientists who professed "harmful ideas", resulting in the expulsion, imprisonment, or death of hundreds of Soviet scientists. Lysenko's ideas were then implemented on collectivised farms in the Soviet Union and China. Famines that resulted partly from Lysenko's influence are believed to have killed 30 million people in China alone.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Becker (1996). ''Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine''. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

AFAF ([[Academics For Academic Freedom]]) of the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.afaf.org.uk/ | title=Academics for Academic Freedom | location=UK | accessdate=19 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a campaign for lecturers, academic staff and researchers who want to make a public statement in favour of free enquiry and free expression. Their statement of Academic Freedom has two main principles:

# that academics, both inside and outside the classroom, have unrestricted [[liberty]] to question and test [[received wisdom]] and to put forward controversial and unpopular opinions, whether or not these are deemed offensive, and
# that academic institutions have no right to curb the exercise of this [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] by members of their staff, or to use it as grounds for disciplinary action or dismissal.

AFAF and those who agree with its principles believe that it is important for academics to be able not only to express their opinions, but also to put them to scrutiny and to open further debate. They are against the idea of telling the public [[Platonism|Platonic]] "noble lies" and believe that people need not be protected from radical views.

==For academic staff==
The concept of academic freedom as a right of faculty members is an established part of most legal systems. Different from the United States, where academic freedom is derived from the guarantee of free speech under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], constitutions of other countries (and particularly of civil law jurisdictions) typically grant a separate right to free learning, teaching, and research.

=== Canada ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

During the interwar years (cir. 1919–1939) Canadian academics were informally expected to be apolitical, lest they bring trouble to their respective universities who, at the time, were very much dependent upon provincial government grants. As well, many Canadian academics of the time considered their position to be remote from the world of politics and felt they had no place getting involved in political issues. However, with the increase of socialist activity in Canada during the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]], due to the rise of [[Social Gospel|social gospel]] ideology, some left-wing academics began taking active part in contemporary political issues outside of the university. Thus, individuals such as [[Frank Underhill|Frank H. Underhill]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and other members or affiliates with the [[League for Social Reconstruction]] or the socialist movement in Canada who held academic positions began to find themselves in precarious positions with their university employers. Frank H. Underhill, for example, faced criticism from within and without academia and near expulsion from his university position for his public political comments and his involvement with the League for Social Reconstruction and the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation]]. According to [[Michiel Horn]] this era marked, "...a relaxation of the unwritten controls under which many Canadian professors had previously worked. The nature of the institutions, natural caution and professional pre-occupation had before the Depression inhibited the professoriate. None of these conditions changed quickly, but even at the provincial universities there were brave souls in the 1930s who claimed, with varying success, the right publicly to discuss controversial subjects and express opinions about them."

===France===
Professors at public [[France|French]] universities and researchers in public research laboratories are expected, as are all [[French Civil Service|civil servants]], to behave in a neutral manner and to not favor any particular political or religious point of view during the course of their duties. However, the academic freedom of university [[professor]]s is a fundamental principle recognized by the laws of the Republic, as defined by the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]]; furthermore, statute law declares about [[higher education]] that "teachers-researchers (university professors and assistant professors), researchers and teachers are fully independent and enjoy full [[freedom of speech]] in the course of their [[research]] and [[teaching]] activities, provided they respect, following university traditions and the dispositions of this code, principles of tolerance and objectivity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&amp;code=CEDUCATL.rcv&amp;art=L952-2 French Education Code, L952-2], [[French Government]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The nomination and promotion of professors is largely done through a process of [[peer review]] rather than through normal administrative procedures.

===Germany===
The [[German Constitution]] ({{lang-de|Grundgesetz}}) specifically grants academic freedom: "Art and science, research and teaching are free. Freedom of teaching does not absolve from loyalty to the constitution" (Art. 5, para. 3). In a tradition reaching back to the 19th century, jurisdiction has understood this right as one to teach (''{{lang|de|Lehrfreiheit}}''), study (''{{lang|de|Lernfreiheit}}''), and conduct research (''{{lang|de|Freiheit der Wissenschaft}}'') freely, although the last concept has sometimes been taken as a cover term for the first two. ''{{lang|de|Lehrfreiheit}}'' embraces the right of professors to determine the content of their lectures and to publish the results of their research without prior approval.

Since professors through their ''Habilitation'' receive the right to teach ({{lang-la|venia docendi}}) in a particular academic field, academic freedom is deemed to cover at least the entirety of this field. ''{{lang|de|Lernfreiheit}}'' means a student's right to determine an individual course of study. Finally, ''{{lang|de|Freiheit der Wissenschaft}}'' permits academic self-governance and grants the university control of its internal affairs.&lt;!-- Conclusion may be Original Research --&gt;

=== Mauritius ===
In Mauritius the academic staff have the following rights, which are stated in the Chapter II Constitution of Mauritius: the protection of Freedom of Conscience, Protection of Freedom of Expression, Protection of Freedom of Assembly and Association, Protection of Freedom to Establish schools and the Protection from Discrimination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Comparative Higher Education Law|last=Russo|first=Charles J.|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers Inc,|year=2013|isbn=978- 1- 4758- 0405-8|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=191–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 paper on the [[University of Mauritius]] the author states that although there are no records of abuse of human rights or freedom of the state "subtle threats to freedom of expression do exist, especially with regard to criticisms of ruling political parties and their leaders as well as religious groups."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramtohul|first=Ramola|date=2012|title=Academic Freedom in a State-Sponsored African University: The Case of the University of Mauritius.|url=https://www.aaup.org/JAF3/academic-freedom-state-sponsored-african-university-case-university-mauritius#.WtjN3ojwaUk|journal=AAUP Journal of Academic Freedom|volume=3|pages=1–17|via=American Association of University Professors}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Mauritius endorses the practice of academic freedom in the tertiary institutions of the country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Academic freedom became a public issue in May 2009 when the [[University of Mauritius]] spoke out against the previous vice chancellor Professor I. Fagoonee, who had forwarded a circular sent by the Ministry of Education to academics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This circular targeted public officers and required them to consult their superiors before speaking to the press. According to the paper, academics were annoyed by the fact that the vice chancellor had endorsed the circular by sending it to them when it was addressed to public officers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In an interview the vice- chancellor stated that while academics were free to speak to the press they should not compromise university policy or government policy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An academic spoke to the prime minister and the issue was eventually taken up to parliament.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The vice chancellor was then required to step down.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In return the government publicly endorsed the practice of academic freedom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The institutional bureaucracy and the dependence on the state for funds has restricted the freedom of academics to criticize government policy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An interview with Dr. Kasenally an educator at the [[University of Mauritius]] expresses her views on academic freedom in the university.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The professor states that in 1970s to 1980s the university was at the forefront of debates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But in the 1990s the university stepped away from controversial debates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1986, the rights of academics to engage in politics was removed to curtail academic freedom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Academics at the [[University of Mauritius]] have thus been encouraged to not express their views or ideas especially if the views oppose those of the management or government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While there have been no cases of arrests or extreme detention of academics, there is a fear that it would hinder their career progress especially at the level of a promotion thus, the academics try to avoid participating in controversial debates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands the academic freedom is limited. In November 1985 the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Education]] published a policy paper titled ''Higher Education: Autonomy and Quality''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Comparative Higher Education Law|last=Russo|first=Charles J.|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4758- 0405-8|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=207–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper had a proposal that steered away from traditional education and informed that the future of higher education sector should not be regulated by the central government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1992 the Law of Higher Education and Research (Wet op het hoger onderwijs en wetenschappelijk onderzoek, article 1.6) was published and became effective in 1993.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, this law governs only certain institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Philippines===
The 1987 [[Philippine Constitution]] states that, "Academic Freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/article14.htm|title=1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippine jurisprudence and courts of law, including the [[Philippine Supreme Court]] tend to reflexively defer to the institutional autonomy of higher institutions of learning in determining academic decisions with respect to the outcomes of individual cases filed in the courts regarding the abuse of Academic Freedom by professors, despite the individual merits or demerits of any cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shahani-vs-up-diliman.blogspot.com/|title=Notice of Full Disclosure|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closely watched case was the controversial case of [[University of the Philippines at Diliman]] Sociology Professor Sarah Raymundo who was not granted tenure due to an appeal by the minority dissenting vote within the faculty of the Sociology Department. This decision was sustained upon appeal by the dissenting faculty and Professor Raymundo to the University of the Philippines at Diliman Chancellor Sergio S. Cao; and though the case was elevated to [[University of the Philippines System]] President [[Emerlinda R. Roman]], Roman denied the appeal which was elevated by Professor Raymundo to the University's Board of Regents for decision and the BOR granted her request for tenure. A major bone of contention among the supporters of Professor Raymundo was not to question the institutional Academic Freedom of the Department in not granting her tenure, but in asking for transparency in how the Academic Freedom of the department was exercised, in keeping with traditions within the University of the Philippines in providing a basis that may be subject to peer review, for Academic decisions made under the mantle of Academic Freedom.

===South Africa===
The South African Constitution of 1996 offers protection of academic freedom and the freedom of scholarly research.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=March 2010|title=ACADEMIC FREEDOM STATEMENT FROM THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE OF SOUTH AFRICA (ASSAF)|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&amp;sid=9a9dc84c-3f4d-4d6c-bb60-c1c9c95be43d%40sessionmgr103|journal=South African Journal of Science|volume=V. 106|pages=1|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic freedom became a main principle for higher education by 1997.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Three main threats are believed to jeopardize academic freedom: government regulations, excessive influence of private sector sponsor on a university, and limitations of freedom of speech in universities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There have been an abundance of scandals over the restricted academic freedom at a number of universities in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindow|first=Megan|date=May 2007|title=Academic Freedom Is Eroding in South Africa, Critics Say|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=24&amp;sid=9a9dc84c-3f4d-4d6c-bb60-c1c9c95be43d%40sessionmgr103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=25408082&amp;db=a9h|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=53|pages=46|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of KwaZulu-Natal|University of KwaZulu-Nata]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l received fame over its restricted academic freedom and the scandal that occurred in 2007.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In this scandal a sociology lecturer, Fazel Khan was fired in April 2007 for "bringing the university into disrepute" after he released information to the news media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to Khan he had been airbrushed from a photograph in a campus publication because of his participation in a staff strike last February.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In light of this scandal the South African Council on Higher Education released a report stating that the state is influencing academic freedom.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In particular, public universities are more susceptible to political pressure because they receive funds from the public.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===New Zealand===
Academic freedom pertains to forms of expression by academic staff engaged in scholarship and is defined by the Education Act 1989 (s161(2)) as:
a) The freedom of academic staff and students, within the law, to question and test received wisdom, to put forward new ideas and to state controversial or unpopular opinions; 
b) The freedom of academic staff and students to engage in research; 
c) The freedom of the University and its staff to regulate the subject matter of courses taught at the University; 
d) The freedom of the University and its staff to teach and assess students in the manner they consider best promotes learning; and 
e) The freedom of the University through its Council and Vice-Chancellor to appoint its own staff.

===United States===
In the United States, academic freedom is generally taken as the notion of academic freedom defined by the "1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure", jointly authored by the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) and the Association of American Colleges (AAC, now the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]]).&lt;ref name=1940Statement&gt;1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure, AAUP {{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/policydocs/1940statement.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208031344/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/policydocs/1940statement.htm |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}, accessed March 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These principles state that "Teachers are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject."&lt;ref name="1940Statement" /&gt; The statement also permits institutions to impose "limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims", so long as they are "clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment".&lt;ref name="1940Statement" /&gt; The Principles have only the character of private pronouncements, not that of binding law.

[[Regional accreditation|Seven regional accreditors]] work with American colleges and universities, including private and religious institutions, to implement this standard. Additionally, the AAUP, which is not an accrediting body, works with these same institutions. The AAUP does not always agree with the regional accrediting bodies on the standards of protection of academic freedom and tenure.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[Northwest Association of Schools and of Colleges and Universities]] reviewed [[Brigham Young University]]'s academic freedom statement and found it in compliance with the 1940 statement, while AAUP has found Brigham Young University to be in violation&lt;/ref&gt; The AAUP lists (censures) those colleges and universities which it has found, after its own investigations, to violate these principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/about/censuredadmins/|title=Censure List|publisher=AAUP|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some case law in the United States that holds that teachers are limited in their academic freedom.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Academic freedom has recently come under attack, but some people work to defend the first amendment on campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4530197/college-free-speech-zone/|title=Colleges Have No Right to Limit Students' Free Speech|website=Time|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent feature of the [[English university]] concept is the freedom to appoint faculty, set standards and admit students. This ideal may be better described as institutional autonomy and is distinct from whatever freedom is granted to students and faculty by the institution.&lt;ref&gt;(Kemp, p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] said that academic freedom means a university can "determine for itself on academic grounds:

# who may teach,
# what may be taught,
# how it should be taught, and
# who may be admitted to study."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'', 438 U.S. 265, 312 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sweezy&gt;''[[Sweezy v. New Hampshire]]'', 354 U.S. 234, 262–263 (1957) ([[Felix Frankfurter]], Justice).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stronach&gt;''Stronach v. Virginia State University'', civil action 3:07-CV-646-HEH (E. D. Va. Jan. 15, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 case, a federal court in [[Virginia]] ruled that professors have no academic freedom; ''all'' academic freedom resides with the university or college.&lt;ref name=Stronach /&gt;  In that case, ''[[Stronach v. Virginia State University]]'', a district court judge held "that no constitutional right to academic freedom exists that would prohibit senior (university) officials from changing a grade given by (a professor) to one of his students."&lt;ref name=Stronach /&gt;  The court relied on mandatory [[precedent]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Sweezy v. New Hampshire]]''&lt;ref name=Sweezy /&gt; and a case from the fourth circuit court of appeals.&lt;ref name=Stronach /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Urofsky v. Gilmore]]'', 216 F.3d 401, 414, 415 (4th Cir. 2000). (Noting that "cases that have referred to a First Amendment right of academic freedom have done so generally in terms of the institution, not the individual ...." and "Significantly, the court has never recognized that professors possess a First Amendment right of academic freedom to determine for themselves the content of their courses and scholarship, despite opportunities to do so".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Stronach'' court also relied on persuasive cases from several circuits of the [[United States Court of Appeals|courts of appeals]], including the first,&lt;ref&gt;''Lovelace v. S.E. Mass. University'', 793 F.2d 419, 425 (1st Cir. 1986) ("To accept plaintiff's contention that an untenured teacher's grading policy is constitutionally protected . . . would be to constrict the university in defining and performing its educational mission".)&lt;/ref&gt;  third,&lt;ref&gt;''Edwards v. California University of Pennsylvania'', 156 F.3d 488, 491 (3d Cir. 1998) ("In Edwards v. Cal. Univ. of Pa., The court held that the First Amendment does not allow a university professor to decide what is taught in the classroom but rather protects the university's right to select the curriculum," as cited in ''Stronach''.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Brown v. Amenti'', 247 F.3d 69, 75 (3d Cir. 2001). (Holding "a public university professor does not have a First Amendment right to expression via the school's grade assignment procedures".)&lt;/ref&gt; and seventh&lt;ref&gt;''Wozniak v. Conry'', 236 F.3d 888, 891 (7th Cir. 2001). (Holding that "No person has a fundamental right to teach undergraduate engineering classes without following the university's grading rules ...." and that "it is the [u]niversity's name, not [the professor]'s, that appears on the diploma; the [u]niversity, not [the professor], certifies to employers and graduate schools a student's successful completion of a course of study. Universities are entitled to assure themselves that their evaluation systems have been followed; otherwise their credentials are meaningless".)&lt;/ref&gt; circuits.  That court distinguished the situation when a university attempts to coerce a professor into changing a grade, which is clearly in violation of the First Amendment, from when university officials may, in their discretionary authority, change the grade upon appeal by a student.&lt;ref name=Stronach /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''Parate v. Isibor'', 868 F.2d 821, 827–28 (6th Cir. 1989). (Holding that "a university professor may claim that his assignment of an examination grade or a final grade is communication protected by the First Amendment . . .
[t]hus, the individual professor may not be compelled, by university officials, to change a grade that the professor previously assigned to her student".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Stronach'' case has gotten significant attention in the academic community as an important precedent.&lt;ref&gt;White, Lawrence, "CASE IN POINT: STRONACH V. VIRGINIA STATE U. (2008): Does Academic Freedom Give a Professor the Final Say on Grades?", ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', found at [http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i33/33a03901.htm Chronicle web site] and [http://chronicle.com/review/brainstorm/fendrich/the-secretary-to-the-rescue Chronicle Review commentary and blog].  Accessed May 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship to freedom of speech====
Academic freedom and free speech rights are not coextensive, although this widely accepted view has been recently challenged by an "institutionalist" perspective on the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Paul Horwitz, "Universities as First Amendment Institutions: Some Easy Answers and Hard Questions, 54 ''[[UCLA Law Review]]'' 1497 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic freedom involves more than speech rights; for example, it includes the right to determine what is taught in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/at-ucla-free-speech-is-suppressed-and-double-standards-reign/article/2629382|title=At UCLA, free speech is suppressed and double standards reign|last=Litt|first=Andrew|work=[[Washington Examiner]]|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAUP gives teachers a set of guidelines to follow when their ideas are considered threatening to religious, political, or social agendas. When teachers speak or write in public, whether via social media or in academic journals, they are able to articulate their own opinions without the fear from institutional restriction or punishment, but they are encouraged to show restraint and clearly specify that they are not speaking for their institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAUP. 1940  Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure|url=http://www.aaup.org/file/1940%20Statement.pdf|website=AAUP}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, academic freedom is protected by institutional rules and regulations, letters of appointment, faculty handbooks, collective bargaining agreements, and academic custom.&lt;ref&gt;Donna Euben, [http://www.aaup.org/Legal/info%20outlines/05beliefdis.htm Political And Religious Belief Discrimination On Campus: Faculty and Student Academic Freedom and The First Amendment.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220123513/http://www.aaup.org/Legal/info%20outlines/05beliefdis.htm |date=2005-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[freedom of speech]] is guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], which states that "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...." By extension, the First Amendment applies to all governmental institutions, including public universities. The U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has consistently held that academic freedom is a First Amendment right at ''public'' institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234 (1957); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967); Regents of Univ. of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, The United States' First Amendment has generally been held to '''not''' apply to ''private'' institutions, including religious institutions. These private institutions may honor freedom of speech and academic freedom at their discretion.

====Controversies====

=====Evolution debate=====
Academic freedom is also associated with a movement to introduce [[intelligent design]] as an alternative explanation to [[evolution]] in US public schools.  Supporters claim that academic institutions need to fairly represent all possible explanations for the observed [[biodiversity]] on Earth, rather than implying no alternatives to evolutionary theory exist.

Critics of the movement claim intelligent design is religiously motivated [[pseudoscience]] and cannot be allowed into the curriculum of US public schools due to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], often citing ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' as legal [[precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rethinkingschools.org/restrict.asp?path=archive/12_02/panda.shtml|title=Rethinking Schools Online|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/intelligent-design-trial-kitzmiller-v-dover Intelligent Design on Trial: Kitzmiller v. Dover]. National Center for Science Education. October 17th, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  They also reject the allegations of discrimination against proponents of intelligent design, of which investigation showed no evidence.&lt;ref name=Impact_Statement&gt;[http://www.flsenate.gov/data/session/2008/Senate/bills/analysis/pdf/2008s2692.ed.pdf Bill Analysis and Fiscal Impact Statement], The Professional Staff of the Education Pre-K-12 Committee, [[Florida Senate]], March 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of "[[academic freedom bills]]" have been introduced in [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] in the [[United States]] between 2004 and 2008.  The bills were based largely upon language drafted by the [[Discovery Institute]],&lt;ref name=brayton_may_08&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/05/academic_freedom_bill_in_south.php "Academic Freedom" Bill in South Carolina Now] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520095016/http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/05/academic_freedom_bill_in_south.php |date=2008-05-20 }} Ed Brayton, Dispatches From the Culture Wars, May 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the hub of the [[Intelligent Design movement]], and derive from language originally drafted for the [[Santorum Amendment]] in the [[United States Senate]].  According to the [[Wall Street Journal]], the common goal of these bills is to expose more students to articles and videos that undercut evolution, most of which are produced by advocates of intelligent design or biblical [[creationism]].&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120967537476060561 Evolution's Critics Shift Tactics With Schools], Stephanie Simon, [[Wall Street Journal]], May 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Association of University Professors has reaffirmed its opposition to these academic freedom bills, including any portrayal of creationism as a scientifically credible alternative and any misrepresentation of evolution as scientifically controversial.&lt;ref name=aaup&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/about/events/past/2008/am/resol.htm Academic Freedom and Teaching Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20091205190229/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/about/events/past/2008/am/resol.htm |date=2009-12-05 }} Resolutions of the 94th Annual Meeting, American Association of University Professors. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-latest-face-of-creationism The Latest Face of Creationism in the Classroom] [[Glenn Branch]] and [[Eugenie C.

=====Communism=====

In the 20th Century and particularly the 1950s during [[McCarthyism]], there was much public date in print on Communism's role in academic freedom, e.g., [[Sidney Hook]]'s ''[[Heresy, Yes–Conspiracy, No]]''&lt;ref name=HYCN-book&gt;

=====The "Academic bill of rights"=====

''Students for Academic Freedom'' (SAF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030808194212/http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 August 2003|title=Students For Academic Freedom|author =Students for Academic Freedom|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded and is sponsored by the [[David Horowitz Freedom Center]] to advocate against a perceived [[liberal bias in academia|liberal bias in U.S. colleges and universities]]. The organization collected many statements from college students complaining that some of their professors were disregarding their responsibility to keep unrelated controversial material out of their classes and were instead teaching their subjects from an ideological point of view. SAF drafted model legislation, called the [[Academic Bill of Rights]], which has been introduced in several state legislatures and the U.S. House of Representatives. The Academic Bill of Rights is based on the Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure as published by the American Association of University Professors in 1915, and modified in 1940 and 1970.

According to Students for Academic Freedom, academic freedom is "the freedom to teach and to learn." They contend that academic freedom promotes "intellectual diversity" and helps achieve a university's primary goals, i.e., "the pursuit of truth, the discovery of new knowledge through scholarship and research, the study and reasoned criticism of intellectual and cultural traditions, the teaching and general development of students to help them become creative individuals and productive citizens of a pluralistic democracy, and the transmission of knowledge and learning to a society at large." They feel that, in the past forty years, the principles as defined in the AAUP Declaration have become something of a [[dead letter]], and that an entrenched class of tenured radical leftists is blocking all efforts to restore those principles.&lt;ref&gt;David Horowitz (2007). ''Indoctrination U: the Left's war against academic freedom''  {{ISBN|1-59403-190-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an attempt to override such opposition, the Academic Bill of Rights calls for state and judicial regulation of colleges. Such regulation would ensure that:
*students and faculty will not be favored or disfavored because of their political views or religious beliefs;
*the humanities and social sciences, in particular, will expose their students to a variety of sources and viewpoints, and not present one viewpoint as certain and settled truth;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Did-a-UCLA-Instructor-With/240521|title=Why Did a UCLA Instructor With a Popular Free-Speech Course Lose His Job?|last=Brown|first=Sarah|date=2017-07-01|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-US|issn=0009-5982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*campus publications and invited speakers will not be harassed, abused, or otherwise obstructed;
*academic institutions and professional societies will adopt a neutral attitude in matters of politics, ideology or religion.

Opponents claim that such a bill would actually restrict academic freedom, by granting politically motivated legislators and judges the right to shape the nature and focus of scholarly concerns. According to the [[American Association of University Professors]], the Academic Bill of Rights is, despite its title, an attack on the very concept of academic freedom itself: "A fundamental premise of academic freedom is that decisions concerning the quality of scholarship and teaching are to be made by reference to the standards of the academic profession, as interpreted and applied by the community of scholars who are qualified by expertise and training to establish such standards." The Academic Bill of Rights directs universities to implement the principle of neutrality by requiring the appointment of faculty "with a view toward fostering a plurality of methodologies and perspectives," an approach they claim is problematic because "It invites diversity to be measured by political standards that diverge from the academic criteria of the scholarly profession." For example,"no department of political theory ought to be obligated to establish 'a plurality of methodologies and perspectives' by appointing a professor of Nazi political philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/comm/rep/A/abor.htm|title=Academic Bill of Rights|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurring, the president of Appalachian Bible College in West Virginia fears that the Academic Bill of Rights "would inhibit his college's efforts to provide a faith-based education and would put pressure on the college to hire professors... who espouse views contrary to those of the institution."&lt;ref&gt;Alyson Klein (2004). "Worried on the Left and Right." ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' (July 9, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pontifical universities==
[[Pontifical university|Pontifical universities]] around the world such as [[The Catholic University of America]], the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in Rome, the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] in Belgium, and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]] depend for their status as pontifical universities and for the terms of academic freedom on the [[Pope]] through the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]].  The terms of academic freedom at ecclesiastical institutions of education are outlined in the [[apostolic constitution]] ''Sapientia Christiana''.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_15041979_sapientia-christiana_en.html Accessed June 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific cases==
While some controversies of academic freedom are reflected in proposed laws that would affect large numbers of students through entire regions, many cases involve individual academics that express unpopular opinions or share politically unfavorable information. These individual cases may receive widespread attention and periodically test the limits of, and support for, academic freedom. Several of these specific cases are also the foundations for later legislature.

=== The Bassett Affair at Duke University ===
The [[John Spencer Bassett#The Bassett Affair|Bassett Affair]] at [[Duke University]] in North Carolina in the early 20th century was an important event in the history of academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.duke.edu/uarchives/exhibits/academic-freedom/jsbaffair.html|title=Exhibits|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 1903, Professor [[John Spencer Bassett]] publicly praised [[Booker T. Washington]] and drew attention to the racism and white supremacist behavior of the Democratic party. Many media reports castigated Bassett, and several major newspapers published opinion pieces attacking him and demanding his termination. On December 1, 1903, the entire faculty of the college threatened to resign ''en masse'' if the board gave into political pressures and asked Bassett to resign.&lt;ref name="DukeLibraryBassett"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/uarchives/history/articles/bassett-affair|title=The Bassett Affair of 1903|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2016|last=King|first=William E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He resigned after "parents were urged to withdraw their children from the college and churchmen were encouraged not to recommend the college to perspective students."&lt;ref name="DukeLibraryBassett" /&gt; President [[Teddy Roosevelt]] later praised Bassett for his willingness to express the truth as he saw it.

In a famous case investigated by the American Association of University Professors, President [[Hamilton Holt]] of [[Rollins College]] in March 1933 fired [[John Andrews Rice|John Andrew Rice]], an atheist scholar and unorthodox teacher, whom Holt had hired, along with three other "golden personalities" in his push to put Rollins on the cutting edge of innovative education. Holt then required all professors to make a "loyalty pledge" to keep their jobs. The American Association of University Professors censured Rollins. Rice and the three other "golden personalities", who were all dismissed for refusing to make the loyalty pledge, founded [[Black Mountain College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seymour, Mary|year=Fall 2011|title=The Ghosts of Rollins (and Other Skeletons in the Closet)|url=http://www.rollins.edu/magazine/fall-2011/ghosts-of-rollins-2.html|journal=[[Rollins Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, a [[Nobel prize]]-winning [[physicist]], [[electronics]] inventor, and [[electrical engineering]] professor, [[William Shockley]], was concerned about [[William Shockley#Beliefs about populations and genetics|relatively high reproductive rates among people of African descent]], because he believed that [[genetics]] doomed black people to be intellectually inferior to white people.

=== Author J Michael Bailey of Northwestern University ===
[[J.

In 2007 in an effort to discredit his book, some activists filed formal complaints with Northwestern University accusing Bailey of conducting [[Institutional review board|regulated human research]]. They also filed a complaint with Illinois state regulators, requesting that they investigate Bailey for [[practicing psychology without a license]]. Regulators dismissed the complaint.&lt;ref name="carey20072"&gt;Carey, Benedict.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Animal symbolicum''' ("symbol-making" or "symbolizing animal") is a [[List of alternative names for the human species|definition for humans]] proposed by the German [[neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]]. 

The tradition since [[Aristotle]] has defined a human being as ''animal rationale'' (a [[rational animal]]). However, Cassirer claimed that man's outstanding characteristic is not in his [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or physical nature, but rather in his work. [[Human]]ity cannot be known directly, but has to be known through the analysis of the symbolic universe that man has created historically. Thus man should be defined as ''animal symbolicum'' (a symbol-making or symbolizing animal). 
On this basis, Cassirer sought to understand [[human nature]] by exploring symbolic forms in all aspects of a human being's experience. His work is represented in his three-volume ''Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen'' (1923–9, translated as ''The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'') and is summarized in his ''An Essay on Man''. [[W. J. T. Mitchell]] used this term in his essay on "representation" to say that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"man, for many philosophers both ancient and modern, is the "representational animal,"  ''homo symbolicum'' {{sic}}, the creature whose distinctive character is the creation and manipulation of signs - things that stand for or take the place of something else." &lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, T. &amp; Lentricchia, F. (1990). Critical Terms for [[Literary criticism|Literary Study]]. Chicago: [[University of Chicago|The University of Chicago]] press&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4263">'''Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty''' is a statutory offence of aggravated [[assault]] in [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], and  [[Hong Kong]].

==England and Wales==
Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides:

{{Blockquote|Any person who assaults a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on [[summary conviction]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the [[standard scale]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/89 Digitised copy of s 89] from Legislation.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is a [[summary offence]]. The "starting sentence" is a short custodial sentence, and it is considered a more serious offence than common assault.

The constable must be acting "in the execution of his duty" for this offence to be made out. If he exceeds the remit of his duty (e.g. acts unlawfully in assaulting the Defendant), the offence will not be made out.

The Defendant does not actually have to be aware that the person he is assaulting is a constable.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Forbes'' (1865) 10 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox CC]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=lGY0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA362#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 362]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the victim is a police officer is not, in itself, an aggravating factor which would justify more serious charge. The criteria for a charge under section 47 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]] do not distinguish between members of the public and police officers as the victim.

According to ''R (Fullard) v Woking Magistrates' Court'' (2005) EWHC 2922 (Admin) a constable cannot be acting in the execution of their duty when unlawfully on private property. Thus, if the officer is not acting under the authority of a warrant, acting under a statutory or common law power of entry, or in hot pursuit, the person lawfully in possession of land is entitled to withdraw permission for the officer to remain. Should the officer refuse to leave, the officer will cease to be "acting in the execution of their duty". To make an effective withdrawal of permission, clear words must be used. Merely directing offensive remarks at the officer which amount to 'go away' will not necessarily withdraw any implied permission to enter or remain. Further, when properly required to leave, the officer must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to leave. However, once the opportunity to leave voluntarily has passed, it will not be an assault for the land owner to use reasonable force to cause the officer to leave.

For the purposes of section 89 of the Police Act 1996, any person who is carrying out surveillance in England and Wales under section 76A of the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] is to be treated as if he were acting as a constable in the execution of his duty.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/32/section/84 section 84(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
Section 90 of the [[Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012]] provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

==Northern Ireland==
Section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

;History

The offence of 'assault on a constable in the execution of his duty' was formerly created section 7(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]].
== Hong Kong ==
In Hong Kong this can be a [[summary offence]], and also prosecutable under the [[Police Act|Police Force Act]] or the [[Offences Against the Person Act]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/212/s36.html http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s63.html http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s23.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19705">{{short description|Systems concept which entails automatic reproduction and maintenance}}
[[File:3D-SIM-4 Anaphase 3 color.jpg|thumb|3D representation of a living cell during the process of [[mitosis]], example of an autopoietic system]]

The term '''autopoiesis''' ({{ety|gre|''αὐτo-'' (auto-)|self||''ποίησις'' ([[poiesis]])|creation, production}}) refers to a [[system]] capable of reproducing and maintaining itself. The term was introduced in 1972 by Chilean biologists [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] to define the self-maintaining [[chemistry]] of living [[cells (biology)|cells]]. Since then the concept has been also applied to the fields of [[cognition]], [[systems theory]] and [[sociology]].

The original definition can be found in ''Autopoiesis and Cognition: the Realization of the Living'' (1st edition 1973, 2nd  1980):&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, Varela, 1980, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Page 16: It was in these circumstances ... in which he analyzed Don Quixote's dilemma of whether to follow the path of arms (''praxis'', action) or the path of letters (''poiesis'', creation, production), I understood for the first time the power of the word "poiesis" and invented the word that we needed: ''autopoiesis''. This was a word without a history, a word that could directly mean what takes place in the dynamics of the autonomy proper to living systems.

Page 78: An autopoietic [[machine]] is a machine organized (defined as a unity) as a network of processes of production (transformation and destruction) of components which: (i) through their interactions and transformations continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes (relations) that produced them; and (ii) constitute it (the machine) as a concrete unity in space in which they (the components) exist by specifying the topological domain of its realization as such a network.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, Varela, 1980, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Page 89: ... the space defined by an autopoietic system is self-contained and cannot be described by using dimensions that define another space. When we refer to our interactions with a concrete autopoietic system, however, we project this system on the space of our manipulations and make a description of this projection.}}

==Meaning==

Autopoiesis was originally presented as a system description that was said to define and explain the nature of [[living systems]]. A canonical example of an autopoietic system is the [[biological cell]]. The [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cell, for example, is made of various [[biochemical]] components such as [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s, and is organized into bounded structures such as the [[cell nucleus]], various [[organelle]]s, a [[cell membrane]] and [[cytoskeleton]]. These structures, based on an external flow of molecules and energy, ''produce'' the components which, in turn, continue to maintain the organized bounded structure that gives rise to these components (not unlike a wave propagating through a medium).

An autopoietic system is to be contrasted with an [[allopoietic]] system, such as a car factory, which uses raw materials (components) to generate a car (an organized structure) which is something ''other'' than itself (the factory). However, if the system is extended from the factory to include components in the factory's "environment", such as supply chains, plant / equipment, workers, dealerships, customers, contracts, competitors, cars, spare parts, and so on, then as a total viable system it could be considered to be autopoietic. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Though others have often used the term as a synonym for [[self-organization]], Maturana himself stated he would "[n]ever use the notion of self-organization&amp;nbsp;... Operationally it is impossible. That is, if the organization of a thing changes, the thing changes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maturana |first=Humberto |year=1987 |chapter=Everything is said by an observer |title=Gaia, a Way of Knowing: Political Implications of the New Biology |editor=Thompson, William Irwin |publisher=Lindisfarne Press |location=Great Barrington, MA |pages=65–82, 71 |oclc=15792540 |isbn=978-0-940262-23-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, an autopoietic system is autonomous and operationally closed, in the sense that there are sufficient processes within it to maintain the whole. Autopoietic systems are "structurally coupled" with their medium, embedded in a dynamic of changes that can be recalled as [[sensory-motor coupling]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} This continuous dynamic is considered as a rudimentary form of [[knowledge]] or [[cognition]] and can be observed throughout life-forms.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

An application of the concept of autopoiesis to [[sociology]] can be found in [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[Systems theory#Sociology and Sociocybernetics|Systems Theory]], which was subsequently adapted by [[Bob Jessop]] in his studies of the capitalist state system. [[Marjatta Maula]] adapted the concept of autopoiesis in a business context.&lt;ref&gt;Maula, M. (2006). Advanced Series in Management: Organizations as learning systems: 'Living composition' as an enabling infrastructure. Emerald Group Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of autopoiesis has also been applied in the context of legal systems by not only Niklas Luhmann, but also Gunther Teubner.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther Teubner, ''Law as an Autopoietic System'' (The European University Institute Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the evolution and development of autopoietic legal systems, see, Neil T. Lyons, ''Autopoiesis: Evolution, Assimilation, and Causation of Normative Closure'' in ''Law, Justice, and Miscommunications: Essays in Applied Legal Philosophy'' (ed. Dr. Tim Kaye, Vanderplas Publishing, 2011) {{ISBN|978-1-60042-152-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of textual studies, [[Jerome McGann]] argues that texts are "autopoietic mechanisms operating as self-generating feedback systems that cannot be separated from those who manipulate and use them".&lt;ref&gt;''The Textual Condition'' (Princeton University Press, 1986), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Maturana and Varela, he defines an autopoietic system as "a closed topological space that 'continuously generates and specifies its own organization through its operation as a system of production of its own components, and does this in an endless turnover of components{{'"}}, concluding that "Autopoietic systems are thus distinguished from allopoietic systems, which are Cartesian and which 'have as the product of their functioning something different from themselves{{'"}}. Coding and markup appear [[allopoietic]]", McGann argues, but are generative parts of the system they serve to maintain, and thus language and print or electronic technology are autopoietic systems.&lt;ref&gt;"Marking Texts of Many Dimensions" in ''A Companion to Digital Humanities'' ed. Susan Schreibman, Raymond George Siemens and John M. Unsworth (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000), pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his discussion of Hegel, the philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] argues, "Hegel is – to use today's terms – the ultimate thinker of autopoiesis, of the process of the emergence of necessary features out of chaotic contingency, the thinker of contingency's gradual self-organisation, of the gradual rise of order out of chaos."&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj, "Less Than Nothing", Verso, 2012, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to complexity==
Autopoiesis can be defined as the ratio between the complexity of a system and the complexity of its environment.&lt;ref name="Fernández"&gt;

{{quote|This generalized view of autopoiesis considers systems as self-producing not in terms of their physical components, but in terms of its organization, which can be measured in terms of information and complexity. In other words, we can describe autopoietic systems as those producing more of their own complexity than the one produced by their environment.&lt;ref name=Gershenson&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=Requisite Variety, Autopoiesis, and Self-organization |author=Carlos Gershenson|authorlink=Carlos Gershenson|date=26 Sep 2014 |arxiv= 1409.7475}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Relation to cognition==
An extensive discussion of the connection of autopoiesis to [[cognition]] is provided by Thompson.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;
{{cite book |title=Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind |author=Evan Thompson |isbn=978-0-674-02511-0 |publisher=Harvard University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVGna4ZEpWwC&amp;pg=PA91 |chapter=Chapter 5: Autopoiesis: The organization of the living |pages=91–127 |year=2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The basic notion of autopoiesis as involving constructive interaction with the environment is extended to include cognition. Initially, Maturana defined cognition as behavior of an organism "with relevance to the maintenance of itself".&lt;ref name=Maturana&gt;
{{cite book |title=Autopoiesis and cognition: The realization of the living |chapter=The cognitive process |page=13 |isbn=978-90-277-1016-1 |year=1980 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |author1=H. R. Maturana |author2=F. J. Varela |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVmcN9Ja68kC&amp;pg=PA13}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, computer models that are self-maintaining but non-cognitive have been devised, so some additional restrictions are needed, and the suggestion is that the maintenance process, to be cognitive, involves readjustment of the internal workings of the system in some [[Metabolism|metabolic process]]. On this basis it is claimed that autopoiesis is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for cognition.&lt;ref name=Bitbol&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Autopoiesis with or without cognition: defining life at its edge |author1=M Bitbol |author2=PL Luisi |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume=1 |pages=99–107 |year=2005 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1618936/pdf/16849156.pdf |doi=10.1098/rsif.2004.0012 |pmid=16849156 |pmc=1618936}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson (p.&amp;nbsp;127) takes the view that this distinction may or may not be fruitful, but what matters is that living systems involve autopoiesis and (if it is necessary to add this point) cognition as well. It can be noted that this definition of 'cognition' is restricted, and does not necessarily entail any awareness or [[consciousness]] by the living system.

==Relation to consciousness==
The connection of autopoiesis to cognition, or if necessary, of living systems to cognition, is an objective assessment ascertainable by observation of a living system.

One question that arises is about the connection between cognition seen in this manner and consciousness. The separation of cognition and consciousness recognizes that the organism may be unaware of the substratum where decisions are made. What is the connection between these realms? Thompson refers to this issue as the "explanatory gap", and one aspect of it is the [[hard problem of consciousness]], how and why we have [[qualia]].&lt;ref name=Thompson2&gt;
{{cite book |title=Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind |author=Evan Thompson |isbn=978-0-674-02511-0 |publisher=Harvard University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVGna4ZEpWwC&amp;pg=PA7 |chapter=Cognitivism |page=7 |year=2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A second question is whether autopoiesis can provide a bridge between these concepts. Thompson discusses this issue from the standpoint of [[enactivism]]. An autopoietic cell actively relates to its environment. Its sensory responses trigger motor behavior governed by autopoiesis, and this behavior (it is claimed) is a simplified version of a nervous system behavior. The further claim is that real-time interactions like this require attention, and an implication of attention is awareness.&lt;ref name=Thompson3&gt;
{{cite book |title=Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind |author=Evan Thompson |isbn=978-0-674-02511-0 |publisher=Harvard University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVGna4ZEpWwC&amp;pg=PA243 |chapter=Sensorimotor subjectivity |pages=243 ''ff'' |year=2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

There are multiple criticisms of the use of the term in both its original context, as an attempt to define and explain the living, and its various expanded usages, such as applying it to self-organizing systems in general or social systems in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fleischaker G. | year = 1992 | title = Autopoiesis in Systems Analysis: A Debate | url = | journal = Int.

General Systems | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 131–271 | doi=10.1080/03081079208945065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have argued that the concept and its theory fail to define or explain living systems and that, because of the extreme language of [[self-referential]]ity it uses without any external reference, it is really an attempt to give substantiation to Maturana's radical [[constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] or [[solipsistic]] [[epistemology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Swenson R. |year=1992 |title=Autocatakinetics, Yes—Autopoiesis, No: Steps Toward a Unified Theory of Evolutionary Ordering |journal=Int.

An example is the assertion by Maturana and Varela that "We do not see what we do not see and what we do not see does not exist".&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, H. and Varela, F. (1988). The Tree of Knowledge.

(and thus) grounded on a solipsistic foundation that flies in the face of both common sense and scientific knowledge".

The '''Chandy-Misra-Haas algorithm resource model''' checks for [[deadlock]] in a [[distributed system]]. It was developed by K. Mani Chandy, Jayadev Misra and Laura M Haas.

== Locally dependent ==
Consider the n processes ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''5,''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; which are performed in a single system(controller). ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, if ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; depends on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3,''&lt;/sub&gt; so on and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n-1''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. That is, if &lt;math&gt;P_1 \rightarrow P_2 \rightarrow P_3 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow P_n &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is locally dependent on &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt;. If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be locally dependent to itself if it is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; depends on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;: i.e. if &lt;math&gt;P_1 \rightarrow P_2 \rightarrow P_3 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow P_n \rightarrow P_1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is locally dependent on itself.

== Description ==

The [[algorithm]] uses a message called probe(i,j,k) to transfer a message from controller of process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; to controller of process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. It specifies a message started by process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to find whether a deadlock has occurred or not.  Every process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; maintains a boolean array ''dependent'' which contains the information about the processes that depend on it. Initially the values of each array are all "false".

=== Controller sending a probe ===

Before sending, the probe checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is locally dependent on itself.  If so, a deadlock occurs. Otherwise it checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are in different controllers, are locally dependent and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for the resource that is locked by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Once all the conditions are satisfied it sends the probe.

=== Controller receiving a probe ===

On the receiving side, the controller checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is performing a task. If so, it neglects the probe. Otherwise, it checks the responses given ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(i) is false. Once it is verified, it assigns true to ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(i). Then it checks whether k is equal to i. If both are equal, a deadlock occurs, otherwise it sends the probe to next dependent process.

== Algorithm ==
In [[pseudocode]], the algorithm works as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Misra|first2=J.|last3=Haas|first3=L. M.|year=1983|title=Distributed deadlock detection|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer Systems|volume=1|issue=2|pages=144|doi=10.1145/357360.357365|last1=Chandy|first1=K. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controller sending a probe ===

 '''if''' ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is '''locally dependent''' on itself
      '''then''' declare deadlock
 '''else''' for all ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;  such that
      (i) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;,
      (ii) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for '''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and
      (iii) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are on different controllers.
 '''send probe(i, j, k).''' to home site of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; 

=== Controller receiving a probe ===
 '''if'''
      (i)''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is idle / blocked
      (ii) ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(i) = false, and
      (iii) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; has not replied to all requests of to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;
 '''then begin'''
      "dependents"&lt;sub&gt;"k"&lt;/sub&gt;(i) = true;
      '''if''' k == i
      '''then''' declare that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  is deadlocked
      '''else''' for all ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;  such that
             (i) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;,
             (ii) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for '''P''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; and
             (iii) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; are on different controllers.
      '''send probe(i, a, b).''' to home site of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; 
 '''end'''

== Example ==

[[File:Distributed Deadlock.jpg|thumb|occurrence of deadlock in distributed system]]

''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; initiates deadlock detection. ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; sends the probe saying ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; depends on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;. Once the message is received by ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, it checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; is idle. ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; is idle because it is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt; and updates ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;(2) to True.

As above, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;  sends probe to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; sends probe to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;. At ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; is idle so it update ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) to True. Therefore, deadlock can be declared.

== Complexity ==

Consider that there are "m" controllers and "p" process to perform, to declare whether a deadlock has occurred or not, the worst case for controllers and processes must be visited. Therefore, the solution is O(m+p). The time [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] is [[Linear time|O(n)]].

The '''Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development''' ('''CIPD''') is a professional association for [[human resource management]] professionals. It is headquartered in [[Wimbledon, London]], England. The organisation was founded in 1913 - it is the world's oldest association in its field and has over 145,000 members internationally working across private, public and voluntary sectors. Peter Cheese was announced in June 2012 as CIPD's new [[CEO]] from July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/16/05/2012/58539/cipd-appoints-peter-cheese-as-new-chief-executive.htm/ Personnel Today] "CIPD Appoints Peter Cheese as new chief executive" 16 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cipd.co.uk/cipd-hr-profession/whats-new/] CIPD What's New&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
In the United Kingdom, factory inspectors were appointed for the first time in 1893. In 1896 to look after its women and child workers [[Rowntree's]] appointed their first inspector - a Mrs E M Wood.  [[Edward Cadbury]] of [[Cadbury Brothers]] in 1909 called together employers to discuss industrial welfare work and as a result 25 employers formed an association with Mrs Wood of Rowntree's as Secretary. The work of 'welfare  workers' came to public attention during a trade show in 1912 at [[Olympia (London)|Olympia]] in London.&lt;ref name="Millerson" /&gt;

The forerunner of the CIPD, the '''Welfare Workers' Association''' (WWA) was formed at an employers' conference in York on 6 June 1913. The meeting was chaired by [[Seebohm Rowntree]]. Alongside his company, Rowntree's around fifty other companies were present including; [[Boots UK|Boots]], Cadbury and [[Chivers and Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehrdirector.com/business-news/hr_in_business/duplicate-of-alarming-bad-data-habits/ HRD Happy 100th anniversary CIPD], Accessed 09 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-four of the employers present&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Human-Resources-in-Organisations/9780273643999.page | title=Human Resources in Organisations | publisher=[[Pearson Education]] / [[Financial Times Press]] | author=John Leopold | year=2002 | isbn=0-273-64399-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; decided that the WWA be founded as...''an association of  employers interested in industrial betterment and of welfare workers engaged by them''. The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 led to many women and children taking up the work of men, particularly in the larger munition factories where the appointment of welfare officers was made compulsory by legislation and was monitored by the '''Health of Munition Workers Committee'''. This led to the rapid expansion of female welfare workers. There were concerns about the training of welfare staff, and in 1917, at a gathering in Leeds of the seven welfare associations formed during the period it was agreed that they merge by forming the '''Central Association of Welfare Workers''' which to accommodate the regional associations established the beginnings of a local branch structure. The Association's position was also enhanced during the war years by nationally driven encouragement of workers to join [[trade union]]s to reduce the occurrence of industrial strife. Another development which increased the numbers of company staff dealing with labour and welfare matters occurred with the inclusion of managers, mainly men, from the '''North-western Area Industrial Association''' to assist with discipline, dismissal and industrial relations in increasingly unionised organisations.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; In 1918, to avoid confusion as to its purpose the Association changed its name to the '''Central Association of Welfare Workers (Industrial)''' ('''CAWWI''').&lt;ref name="Millerson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIPDhistory" /&gt;

Another important event which had a recurring impact on the activities of the CAWWI occurred in 1918 when the Rev. [[Robert Hyde (social reformer)|Robert Hyde]] founded the Boys’ Welfare Association soon after renamed the [[Industrial Welfare Society]] (IWS) with six employers who were concerned with the welfare of boys employed or apprenticed in the shipbuilding industry. From the outset there was a strained relationship between the two bodies which continued right through the inter-war period until resolved in 1946. Though both organisations were concerned with 'welfare at work' the CAWWI developed as an institution for practitioners and the IWS was established as a membership body for employers and there was strong disagreement on how best to bring about improvements in workplace conditions and workers' welfare. The IWS later became the [[Industrial Society]] and is now known as the [[Work Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;[http://vistas.uwl.ac.uk/379/1/Alastair_Evans_-_PhD.pdf Labour Management vs Welfare Work Alistair Evans PHd Thesis], [[University of West London]], 2003, Retrieved 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===The post-World War I period===
In November 1919, following merger with welfare associations for men the Central Association of Welfare Workers (Industrial) was renamed the '''Welfare Workers' Institute''' and now had a membership of 700.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; However, the next five years saw a reduction in membership to 250 coinciding with the rapid collapse in industrial output as the government sought to reduce the [[national debt]]. Again in 1924 on incorporation the organisation changed its name to the '''Institute of Industrial Welfare Workers''' ('''IIWW'''). [[Minnie Louise Haskins]], the author of the famous poem ''[[The Gate of the Year]]'' and a lecturer at [[London School of Economics|LSE]], was closely involved with the IIWW and edited its monthly bulletin.  As a consequence of the activities of welfare workers during the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike of 1926]] distrust in the welfare movement grew amongst trade unions which saw a new breed of 'labour managers' part of 'management' which was reflected in 1931 when the IIWW became the '''Institute of Labour Management''' and its magazine, rebranded ''Labour Management''. Members of the institute experienced new demands during the 1930s. Firstly, economic growth resulted in a shortfall in skilled labour as companies competed to recruit workers. Secondly, this was followed by lay-offs and industrial action as a worldwide depression took hold, particularly in the industrially-focussed north of England. This influence also had the effect of increasing the number of male members of the institute which significantly shifted the gender balance of the membership.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; Thirdly, new human relations practices developed in the US were finding their way into more enlightened business which invested in their employees through training and provision of such things as salary benefits, pensions and paid holidays. In 1938 the first of the institute branches opened in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In 1939 membership stood at 760.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; Mirroring the First World War during [[World War II]], the government insisted on [[personnel manager|personnel officer]]s to be deployed in factories engaged in war-related production.&lt;ref name="Millerson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIPDhistory" /&gt;

===The latter part of 20th century===
Directly after the Second World War the incoming [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] instigated a policy of industry nationalization and launched the [[National Health Service]], further increasing the role of personnel professions in handling public sector recruitment, retention, payroll, training, and industrial relations issues. The enlightened practices of large American corporations, some of which had adopted the ideas of human relations thinkers, such as [[Elton Mayo]], and the [[Civil Service]] in the field of [[personnel management]] were being taken up by the larger UK companies. Both influences were reflected in a further change of name in 1946 to the '''Institute of Personnel Management''' (IPM).&lt;ref name="Millerson"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VcGAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=welfare+workers+association+1913&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fc3YVNS0O5H3atD_gJgK&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=welfare%20workers%20association%201913&amp;f=false Qualifying Associations IIs by Geoffrey Millerson], Accessed 09 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s were marked by government efforts to improve productivity both through introducing more modern management practices and increase labor supply through encouraging migration of people from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] also known as the [[Windrush generation]]. In 1955, responding to these changes, the IPM sought to increase the professional standards and standing of its members by introducing an externally moderated examination scheme, and restricting entry to full membership to fully qualified or practising personnel officers over age 35 with several years' experience. Membership in 1956 stood at 3,979.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt;

During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s influences on the UK workplace ranged from a series of technological revolutions, economic pressures from entry into the [[Common Market]] and impact of globalization, deregulation of the financial services industry (the Big Bang). Government intervention in industrial relations and the growth of health and safety, equality, collective and recruitment and employment legislation encouraged new specialisms to develop in the function.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; In some companies a shift was seen from reactive personnel management processes towards what became known as strategic human resource management practices, or in shorthand HRM. All these factors also influenced a steady increase in membership, which in 1987 was 31,400.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; The IPM underwent a period of contemplation during which it considered whether; to shift towards an HRM approach as its counterpart in the US the [[Society for Human Resource Management]] had already done, or to maintain its focus on the more traditional personnel management practices where the majority of its members still operated, or find a third way reflecting a more UK-focused approach. In 1994, a merger took place between the IPM and the Institute of Training and Development (ITD). The new organisation which had 70,000 members&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; was named the Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD), sought to represent the range of professionals engaged in one or more elements of people management.&lt;ref name="CIPDhistory"&gt;[http://www.cipd.co.uk/cipd-hr-profession/centenary/timeline.aspx A potted history of work-related ideas and events CIPD June 1913], Accessed 09 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[engineering]], '''compensation''' is planning for [[unintened consequence|side effect]]s or other unintended issues in a [[design]]. In a more simpler term, it's a "counter-procedure" plan on expected side effect performed to produce more efficient and useful results.  The design of an [[invention]] can itself also be to compensate for some other existing issue or [[Action (philosophy)|exception]].

One example is in a [[voltage-controlled oscillator|voltage-controlled crystal oscillator]] (VCXO), which is normally affected not only by [[voltage]], but to a lesser extent by [[temperature]].  A temperature-compensated version (a TCVCXO) is designed so that [[heat]] buildup within the [[enclosure (engineering)|enclosure]] of a [[transmitter]] or other such [[machine|device]] will not alter the [[piezoelectric effect]], thereby causing [[frequency drift]].

Another example is [[motion compensation]] on [[digital camera]]s and [[video camera]]s, which keep a picture steady and not blurry.

Other examples in [[electrical engineering]] include:
* A [[voltage source|constant voltage]] device compensates for low or high voltage in an [[electrical circuit]], keeping its output the same within a given [[interval (mathematics)|range]] of input.
* [[Error correction]] compensates for [[data corruption]].
* [[Gray coding]] compensates for errors on [[rotary encoder]]s and [[linear encoder]]s.
* Debouncing compensates for [[jitter]] in an [[electrical]] [[switch]] (see Contact Bounce section in Switch article).
* A [[resistor]] or [[inductor]] compensates for [[negative resistance]] in [[gas-discharge lamp|gas-discharge lighting]].
* [[Frequency compensation]] is used in [[feedback]] [[control systems]] to avert oscillations.

There are also examples in [[civil engineering]]:
* [[Expansion joint]]s in [[sidewalk]]s, [[building]]s, and [[bridge]]s compensate for [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] and [[Thermal expansion|contraction]].
* Various devices between a [[structure]] and its [[Foundation (architecture)|Foundation]] compensate for [[earthquake]] movements, either actively or passively.

== Railways ==

* On railways, steep gradients on sharp curves have an equivalent gradient slightly steeper than the stated value.  This is because of extra friction of the wheel on the rails, and because wagons stretch out on the chord rather than on the arc, and may thus cause trains to stall.  To '''compensate''', the gradient of [[ruling grade]]s is slightly reduced from say 1 in 50 to 1 in 53.

[[Image:Integration conceptual.jpg|thumb|A conceptual photograph illustrating INTEGRATION]]
[[File:The Sleep.jpg|thumb|'''"The Sleep"''', a ''Dan Pero Manescu'' analog conceptual photography / 2015]]

'''Conceptual photography'''  is a type of [[photography]] that illustrates an idea. There has been illustrative photographs made since the medium's invention, for example in the earliest staged photographs, such as [[Hippolyte Bayard|Hippolyte Bayard's]] ''Self Portrait as a Drowned Man'' (1840). However, the term Conceptual Photography derives from [[Conceptual Art]] a movement of the late 1960s. Today the term is used to describe either a methodology or a genre.

==Conceptual photography as a methodology==
As a methodology conceptual photography is a type of photography that is staged to represent an idea. The 'concept' is both preconceived and, if successful, understandable in the completed image. It is most often seen in [[advertising]] and [[illustration]] where the picture may reiterate a headline or catchphrase that accompanies it. Photographic advertising and illustration commonly derive from [[Stock photography]], which is often produced in response to current trends in image usage as determined by the research of picture agencies like [[Getty Images]] or [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]]. These photographs are therefore produced to visualize a predetermined concept. The advent of picture editing software like [[Adobe Photoshop]] has allowed the greater manipulation of images to seamlessly combine elements that previously it would only have been possible to combine in graphic illustration.

==Conceptual photography as a genre==
The term 'conceptual photography' used to describe a genre may refer to the use of photography in [[Conceptual Art]] or in contemporary art photography. In either case, the term is not widely used or consistently applied.  

==Conceptual photography and conceptual art==
Conceptual art of the late 1960s and early 1970s often involved photography to document performances, ephemeral sculpture or actions. The artists did not describe themselves as photographers, for example [[Edward Ruscha]] said "Photography's just a playground for me. I'm not a photographer at all."&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Coleman (10 September, 1972), "I'm Not Really A Photographer", ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; These artists are sometimes referred to as conceptual photographers but those who used photography extensively such as [[John Hilliard (artist)|John Hilliard]] and [[John Baldessari]] and [[Pedram Mousavi]] are more often described as photoconceptualists&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Marino, Disposable Matter: Photoconceptual Magazine Work of the 1960s, in The Last Picture Show - Artists using photography 1960–1982, Douglas Fogle, 2003 &lt;/ref&gt; or "artists using photography".

==Conceptual photography and fine-art photography==

Since the 1970s artists using photography like [[Cindy Sherman]] and latterly [[Thomas Ruff]] and [[Thomas Demand]] have been described as conceptual. Although their work does not generally resemble the lo-fi aesthetic of 1960s conceptual art they may use certain methods in common such as documenting performance (Sherman), typological or serial imagery (Ruff) or the restaging of events (Demand). In fact the indebtedness to these and other approaches from Conceptual Art is so widespread in contemporary [[Fine-art photography]] that almost any work might be described as conceptual. The term has perhaps been used most specifically in a negative sense to distinguish some contemporary art photography from [[documentary photography]] or [[Photojournalism]]. This distinction has been made in the coverage of the [[Deutsche Börse Photography Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean O'Hagan, (16 November 2009), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/16/conceptual-photography-prizes Why conceptual photography is having a prized moment] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptual photography is often used interchangeably with Fine-Art Photography, and there has been some dispute about whether there is a difference between the two. However, the central school of thought is that conceptual photography is a type of fine-art photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital-photography-school.com/guide-to-creating-unique-conceptual-photography/|title=Your Guide to Creating Unique Conceptual Photography|last=Cole|first=Leanne|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art Photography is inclusive of conceptual photography. While all conceptual photography is fine art, not all fine art is conceptual.

Residents and critics have praised the fountain for its artistic and entertainment features.&lt;ref name=CFsss1MDaMAJPBwK&amp;SAC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=103E95433B5215DE&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Crown Fountain&amp;mdash;***1/2*&amp;mdash;Monroe Drive and Michigan Avenue&amp;mdash;Jaume Plensa, Barcelona with Krueck &amp; Sexton Architects, Chicago |accessdate=July 25, 2008|date=July 18, 2004 |publisher=Newsbank|work= Chicago Tribune |author=Kamin, Blair}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WotwAJPrtfft2c&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=103F33C4C7E1B57A&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Walking on the water&amp;mdash;Artist Jaume Plensa reinvents the fountain for the 21st century|accessdate=July 25, 2008|date=July 12, 2004|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Nance, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CarNoosrcbapc/&gt;  It highlights Plensa's [[Theme (visual arts)|themes]] of dualism, light, and water, extending the use of video technology from his prior works.&lt;ref name=G288/&gt; Its use of water is unique among Chicago's many fountains, in that it promotes physical interaction between the public and the water.  Both the fountain and Millennium Park are highly accessible because of their [[universal design]].&lt;ref name=PVA/&gt;

''Crown Fountain'' has been one of the most controversial of all the Millennium Park features.  Before it was even built, some were concerned that the sculpture's height violated the aesthetic tradition of the park.  After construction, surveillance cameras were installed atop the fountain, which led to a public outcry (and their quick removal).

However, the fountain has survived its contentious beginnings to find its way into Chicago pop culture.  It is a popular subject for photographers and a common gathering place.  While some of the videos displayed are of scenery, most attention has focused on its video clips of local residents. The fountain is a public play area and offers people an escape from summer heat, allowing children  to frolic in the fountain's water.&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD/&gt;

==Concept and design==
{{Millennium Park Map}}
[[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], which is between [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[central business district]], is commonly called "Chicago's Front Yard".&lt;ref name=CtfoinfyMPptt/&gt;&lt;ref name=IafoGPCmfasr/&gt;  Its northwest corner had been [[Illinois Central Railroad|Illinois Central]] rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as [[Millennium Park]].&lt;ref name=MPNYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/books/chapters/0806-1st-gilf.html|title=Millennium Park|accessdate=June 24, 2008|date=August 6, 2006|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Gilfoyle, Timothy J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millennium Park was conceived in 1998 as the capstone of Grant Park, to celebrate the new millennium and to feature world-renowned architects, artists, designers, landscape architects, and urban planners.&lt;ref name=PVA/&gt; As of 2007, Millennium Park trails only [[Navy Pier]] as a Chicago tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crain's List Lartgest Tourist Attractions (Sightseeing): Ranked by 2007 attendance|date=June 23, 2008|page=22|publisher=[[Crain Communications Inc.]]|work=Crain's Chicago Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain is centrally located in Chicago: it is east of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] and its [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]], north of Monroe Street and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]; and south of Madison Street. Looking north from the fountain, viewers see some of the [[tallest buildings in the United States]] ([[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]], [[Two Prudential Plaza]], and [[One Prudential Plaza]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tallest Buildings in the United States1 |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Portals/0/Tallest/CTBUH_TallestUSA.pdf |publisher=[[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] |accessdate=September 2, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection of artist===
In December 1999, [[Lester Crown]] and his family agreed to sponsor a [[water feature]] in [[Millennium Park]].  Unlike other park feature sponsors, the Crowns acted independently of Millennium Park officials; they conducted independent surveys of water technologies, held their own informal design contest, and stayed active in the design and engineering of the project.&lt;ref name=Gilfoyle27880&gt;Gilfoyle, pp. 278–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crowns were open-minded about the choice of artist; wanting a modern work, they solicited proposals from a list of prospective artists and architects.&lt;ref name=Gilfoyle27880/&gt; Jaume Plensa researched the traditions and history of fountains and studied [[anthropomorphism]] in fountain imagery.&lt;ref name=G287/&gt;  Some of his early ideas for the project referenced [[Buckingham Fountain]], but these were soon abandoned.&lt;ref name=G288&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; His presentation to the Crown family started with a slide show of fountains from the [[Middle Ages]] through the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.  Plensa focused on the philosophical meanings associated with fountains, their history, use and art.&lt;ref name=G287&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;  His presentation included [[computer animation]] of facial expressions.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; The other finalists were [[Maya Lin]], who presented a low-height horizontal form, and [[Robert Venturi]], who presented a fountain that would have been {{convert|150|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref name=G280/&gt; In January 2000, Plensa won the commission to design the fountain over Lin and Venturi.&lt;ref name=WotwAJPrtfft2c/&gt;&lt;ref name=G280&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation is a video sculpture, commissioned to operate thirty years.&lt;ref name=JMSAN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/jmc/alumni/index.html |title=J-MC School Alumni News |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |date=August 26, 2004 |publisher=School of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication, The University of Iowa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804220905/http://www.uiowa.edu/jmc/alumni/index.html |archivedate=August 4, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--   What is the boundary on spelling out numbers ??

===Artistic design===

[[File:Crown Fountain - silhouettes.jpg|thumb|right|Tourists often interact with the fountain by silhouetting themselves against the fountain's lighting at night.|alt=Tourists silhouette themselves against the fountain's lighting at night.]]
Prior to ''Crown Fountain'', Plensa's dominant theme had been dualism,&lt;ref&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; which he had expanded to artworks in which the viewers are outside, and the visible subjects of the art are inside containers and hollow spaces.  In the 1990s, he completed several outdoor sculptures in which he explored the use of light (''The Star of David'' (1998) at [[Stockholm]]'s Raoul Wallenberg Square, ''Bridge of Light'' (1998) in Jerusalem), and  LED technology, video, and computer design (''Gläserne Seele &amp; Mr. Net'' in Brandenburg (1999–2000)).&lt;ref&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his public art, Plensa challenged himself to involve the viewer with his art, which led to his conception of the ''Crown Fountain''.&lt;ref name=G287/&gt;  His objective  was to create a socially relevant, interactive  fountain for the 21st&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=G285&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since water is the focus of a fountain, and since Chicago, and especially Millennium Park, is so greatly affected by the nearby waterfront, Plensa sought to create an eternal water work to complement the local natural inspirations.&lt;ref name=G288/&gt; Because of the colder winters common to the [[climate of Chicago]], Plensa created a fountain that would remain vibrant when the water was inactive in the wintertime, so the fountain is an experience of light themes and the use of video technology.&lt;ref name=G288/&gt;

Plensa explores dualism with ''Crown Fountain'', where he has two randomly selected faces "conversing" with each other.&lt;ref name=BSBDBA/&gt; Plensa feels that by using faces, he can represent the diversity of the city both in ethnicity and in age.&lt;ref name=Hystf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=119F8FEDC3E36068&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title= Have you seen this face?; Many have yet to see their own images |publisher=NewsBank |work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=June 24, 2007 |accessdate=April 22, 2008 |author=Nance, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist intends to portray the [[sociocultural evolution]] of the city by updating the collection of images.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt;  His representation has become a part of the city's  pop culture; the first few episodes of the first season of ''[[Prison Break]]'' featured shots of the fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/articles/features/12287/big-house-on-the-prairie |title=Big house on the prairie: TOC goes behind bars for a preview of Prison Break, an arresting TV drama serving time on location around Chicago |accessdate=August 8, 2008 |date=August 24, 2005 |publisher=Time Out Chicago |author=Lyons, Margaret |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210132409/http://www.timeout.com/chicago/articles/features/12287/big-house-on-the-prairie |archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plensa feels that the challenge in the creation of successful work of [[public art]] is to integrate the viewer into an interactive relationship with the art.&lt;ref name=G285/&gt;  The fountain is known for encouraging its visitors to splash and slide in the reflecting pool, jostle for position under the water spout and place themselves under the cascade.&lt;ref name=CarNoosrcbapc/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=104039DBC0769388&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Park is awash in art that raises ageless queries|accessdate=August 5, 2008|date=July 23, 2004|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Schmich, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAGPoCF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/travel/04frugal.html|title=Amid Architectural Glories, Piles of Cheap Fun |publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= November 4, 2007|author=Gross, Matt|accessdate=July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This interactivity was to some degree accidental.  Although the city planned for some interactivity, the transformation of the fountain into a water park for kids within hours of opening surprised Plensa.&lt;ref name=G291/&gt;  Now, when the [[National Weather Service]] issues summer [[heat advisory|heat advisories]] and the [[Governor of Illinois]] declares state office buildings as official daytime [[cooling center]]s, the national press points to ''Crown Fountain'' as a respite for inhabitants of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/us/18sizzle.html|title=Nation Sweats as Heat Hits Triple Digits|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 28, 2008|date=July 18, 2006|author=Steinhauer, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video production===
Approximately 75 ethnic, social, and religious Chicago organizations were asked to provide candidates whose faces would be photographed for integration into the fountain.&lt;ref name=s85/&gt; The subjects were chosen from local schools, churches and community groups, and filming began in 2001 at the downtown campus of the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC). The SAIC students filmed their subjects with a $100,000 high-definition [[HDW-F900]] [[video camera]], the same model used in the production of the three ''[[Star Wars]]'' prequels.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;&lt;ref name=MPfpibffSmaahvsgfadr/&gt; About 20 SAIC students took part in what became an informal master's course in [[public art]] for the project.&lt;ref name=s85&gt;Sharoff, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty from [[Columbia College Chicago]] was also involved in the production of the video.&lt;ref name=JMSAN/&gt; The high-definition equipment was used because of the scale of the project.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;  Because the image proportions were like a [[movie screen]] with a width far exceeding its height, the camera was turned on its side during filming.&lt;ref name=s85/&gt;

Each face appears on the sculpture for a total of 5&amp;nbsp;minutes using various parts of individual 80-second videos.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; A 40-second section is played at one-third speed forward and backward, running for a total of 4&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt; Then, there is a subsequent segment, where the mouth is puckering, that is stretched to 15&amp;nbsp;seconds.  This is followed by a section, in which the water appears to spout from the open mouth, that is stretched to last for 30&amp;nbsp;seconds.  Finally, there is a smile after the completion of the water spouting from the mouth, that is slowed to extend for 15&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Of the original 1,051&amp;nbsp;subjects filmed, 960&amp;nbsp;videos were determined to be usable for the project.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt; Originally, the set of images was presumed to be the beginning of a work in progress, but as of 2009 no additional videos are planned.&lt;ref name=s85/&gt;

To achieve the effect in which water appears to be flowing from subjects' mouths, each video has a segment where the subject's lips are puckered, which is then timed to correspond to the spouting water, reminiscent of [[gargoyle]] fountains.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDoCA/&gt; &lt;!-- I can not find a source to back up this claim: A remote control system, designed by multimedia consultants [[Shen Milsom &amp; Wilke]] synchronizes images, water flow, and lighting color and intensity. --&gt;Each face is cropped so that no hair and usually no ears are visible.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Since there is no tripod designed for cameras turned on their sides,&lt;ref name=s85/&gt; an adjustable barber/dentist's chair was used to minimize the need for the movement of the state-of-the-art camera during filming.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Nonetheless, in some case, digital manipulation was necessary to properly simulate puckering in the exact proper location on the video.&lt;ref name=BSBDBA/&gt;  Many of the faces had to be stretched in order to get the mouths properly positioned.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;  Additionally, each video was color-corrected for brightness, contrast and color saturation.  Both the playback equipment and the final videos had to be further adjusted to account for sunlight during viewing.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;

After two architectural firms refused the contract to make Plensa's design a reality, the firm [[Krueck and Sexton Architects]] accepted.

After several dozen glass manufacturing firms were interviewed, L. E. Smith Glass Company emerged as the company to produce 22,500&amp;nbsp;glass blocks near the upper limit of the size of press glass formed from hand-poured molten glass and [[cast iron]] molds.&lt;ref name=s75&gt;Sharoff, 75&lt;/ref&gt;  The process used sand and [[soda ash]] heated to a temperature of {{convert|2600|F|C}} and "gathered" with a large clay ball resembling a [[honey dipper]]. Rather than use a standard plunger to ensure the glass that sagged off the rod spread to the corners of the mold, they relied on gravity.  The full mold was [[Annealing (glass)|annealed]] (reheated in an oven to {{convert|1100|F|C}}) and cooled.&lt;ref name=s76&gt;Sharoff, 76&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of four months of production,&lt;ref name=s79&gt;Sharoff, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; about 350 blocks were produced per day.&lt;ref name=s76/&gt;

The glass was custom-made at a factory in [[Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania]], and shipped to the structural glass panel manufacturer in Melbourne, Florida.  The panels were then shipped by truck to Chicago. The glass is white glass, rather than the usual green glass that results from [[iron]] impurities. This has the tradeoff of increased image clarity, but greater dirt visibility. Each block is {{convert|5|by|10|by|2|in|mm}} with glass thin enough to avoid image distortion. On each block, one of the six faces is polished, and the other five surfaces are textured.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;&lt;ref name=awdoa/&gt;

The structure for the blocks was a challenge.  At first, the design team had considered switching to plastic blocks, until the team found Circle Redmont Inc., a prefabricated glass panel company in [[Melbourne, Florida|Melbourne]], Florida which specializes in structural glass panel systems.  Circle Redmont came up with the plan of turning grates on their sides to be used as building elements.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt; The individual grids are {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall and either {{convert|16|ft|m}} or {{convert|23|ft|m}} wide with cell capacity of an average of 250 blocks.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt;  Each tower is composed of 44 grids stacked and welded.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt;  The combination of the [[refraction]] of the glass and the thinness of the metal make the grid virtually invisible.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt;

The fountain uses {{convert|11000|impgal|L}} per hour, 97% of which is recycled back into the system.&lt;ref name=s86&gt;Sharoff, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;  Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, it was determined that the images would then look as though they were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about {{convert|6|in|mm}} to allow the installation of {{convert|1|in|mm}} clear tubing for the water nozzle.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants.&lt;ref name=G291/&gt;&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt; The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade.&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD/&gt; The risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge.&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt;

The fountains use over one million LEDs.&lt;ref name=G277&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;  The inner surface of each tower uses 147 smaller screens with a total of 264,480 LED points (each with two red, one blue and two green LEDs).&lt;ref name=s82&gt;Sharoff, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The physical demands of LED screens, in particular the red, green, and blue long-life light bulbs and the requisite [[circuitry]], created three major challenges: supporting the physical structure, combating heat buildup, and optimizing perceptibility of the display.&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt;  Plensa had used LED fixtures on previous projects, and thus had some experience with these issues.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  The LED structure is not supported as a single wall (which would be {{convert|50|ft|m}} high), but rather as several segments that are noticeable as visible horizontal bands every few feet: these show where the LED equipment is supported. The heat generated is handled by fans that cool the air at the bottom, that then works its way through the chimney-like tower. Perceptibility was determined to be optimal with [[LED lights]] {{convert|2|in|mm}} behind the glass.&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt;

LEDs were chosen because they were viewed as the lowest maintenance option of the possible color changing fixtures.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt; LEDs fit into an electrical circuit, causing illumination by the movement of [[electron]]s in the [[semiconductor]] material and making a [[Electrical filament|filament]] unnecessary, so the bulbs never burn out and do not get too hot.  Fins were added to the screens to keep direct sunlight from hitting the LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2007/08/park-walk-par-1.html|title=A Walk in the Park: Part III|work=Architecture, Art, Optics|publisher=Cocktail Party Physics|accessdate=December 18, 2007|date=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Color Kinetics (now part of [[Philips Solid-State Lighting Solutions]], which is now called Philips Color Kinetics)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://origin.newscenter.philips.com/about/news/article-15801.page |title=Philips to acquire Color Kinetics to strengthen leading position in Led lighting systems, components and technologies |accessdate=July 27, 2008 |date=June 19, 2007 |publisher=Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090306082618/http://origin.newscenter.philips.com/about/news/article-15801.page |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ColorBlast&amp;nbsp;12 LEDs  fixtures are used to illuminate the tower structures and glass in an attempt to meet Plensa's objective that the towers have a light and translucent appearance, with their internal structures reflecting light from behind the glass surface.  The electronics were designed to be adaptable to the time of day, weather and season and to meet the desired century-long longevity and dependability objectives set by the design team in response to the thirty-year directive.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;

The {{convert|9423|sqft|m2|adj=on}} pool used {{convert|3|by|3|ft|m}} [[Paver (flooring)|paver]]s that weigh {{convert|250|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name=s86/&gt;  The pavers were rested on [[screw jack]] pedestals in order to be leveled and shimmed.&lt;ref name=s86/&gt;  The pavers had to be perfectly leveled for the water to work correctly because the fountain incorporates numerous sensors to regulate the flow and level of the water.&lt;ref name=s86/&gt;

During construction the underground parking garage remained open.&lt;ref&gt;Sharoff, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs, while accommodating two levels of underground parking underneath. The challenge was solved by combining a T-bar grid to absorb weight with about 150&amp;nbsp;"outriggers", or "tiebacks", inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb wind loads. This design allows for the removal of individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display. The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2006 |title = A Technical Cocktail |journal = Glass Age |volume = 49 |issue = 12 |pages = 15 |issn = 0017-0992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Crown Fountain'''s design not only included interior access for technical repairs, but also incorporated exemplary, non-discriminatory, [[barrier-free]] accessibility, because its interactivity is not limited to the able-bodied.

===Operation===
The control center for the synchronization of images, water flow, and lighting color and intensity is beneath one of the towers, in a room that covers {{convert|550|sqft|m2}}. The room houses [[high-definition video]] servers and equipment temperature sensors. Hard drives contain all the individual electronic computer files of the face videos. Generally, the computer programs automatically perform tasks such as determining when the face will pucker and, if weather conditions permit, when to turn the water on and off. Using low- rather than high-[[Image resolution|resolution]] images was both less expensive and created a better display for the average viewer.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; A [[Barco (manufacturer)|Barco]] [[show control]]ler selects the sequence of faces one at a time and determines a random tower lighting selection of one of eight LED colors programmed into an [[Electronic Theatre Controls]] (ETC) Emphasis control system.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  At night, the ETC system controls [[Stage lighting|spotlight]]s that illuminate the cascading water and that are dimmed by special wet-use location [[ground fault circuit interrupter]]s.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  The control room covers an area equal to 26&amp;nbsp;parking spaces in the underground parking garage, which costs the city $100,000 annually in terms of the [[opportunity cost]] of lost revenue (in 2004&amp;nbsp;dollars).&lt;ref name=BSBDBA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/18/arts/art-architecture-big-shoulders-big-donors-big-art.html|title= Big Shoulders, Big Donors, Big Art|accessdate=June 1, 2008|date=July 18, 2004|author=Bernstein, Fred A.|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance issues for the fountain range from kids removing the adhesive between the bricks to pipes in need of maintenance.&lt;ref name=AitaCFrawoq/&gt;  {{Asof|2014}}, annual upkeep costs were approximately $400,000.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Typically, the fountain's water features function between mid-spring and mid-fall, but the images remain on the screen year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://urbanmatter.com/chicago/crown-fountain-reopens/ |title=Play In The Spray: Crown Fountain Reopens Mid-April|accessdate= Mar 7, 2017 |author=Quero, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Video sculpture====
The  front face of each tower is [[animation|animated]] with a continuous, dynamic exhibit of lights and electronic images.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt; Although the screens on the towers periodically display clips of [[landscape]]s such as  waterfalls,  most intriguing  are the display of faces of Chicago residents. About 1,000&amp;nbsp;faces of Chicagoans are shown in a random rotation,&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; the order determined using a Barco show controller.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt; Each face is displayed for five minutes, with a brief period between each of these videos during which the sculpture is unlit.  As a result, no more than 12 faces appear per hour during the summer.  However, during the winter a version without the final one minute of puckering is shown, so the video segments then are only four minutes each.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;  The video pattern also includes a three-minute water scene every half-hour and a 30-second fade-to-black every 15 minutes.  If all the faces were shown consecutively, instead of randomly, they would each appear about once every eight days.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt; A June 2007 article in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' reported that many of the subjects who had their images [[digital image|digitized]] for the project had yet to either see their own images or hear of anyone who had seen them.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt;

[[Image:20070616 Crown Fountain (6).JPG|thumb|left|Every 15 minutes the LEDs fade to black and there is a brief pause between individual videos.|alt=The fountain during a periodic fade to black]]

==Controversies==
Before the fountain was completed in 2004, Art Institute of Chicago president James Wood felt the columns would be too tall and other community leaders felt that the height and scale of the project stemmed from a "pissing contest" with other park feature artists.&lt;ref name=G290-1&gt;Gilfoyle, pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant Park has been protected since 1836 by "forever open, clear and free" legislation that has been affirmed by four previous [[Illinois Supreme Court]] rulings.&lt;ref name=IafoGPCmfasr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9905732|title=In a fight over Grant Park, Chicago's mayor faces a small revolt |accessdate=July 31, 2008|date=October 4, 2007|publisher= The Economist Newspaper Limited|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=121435C3FB5CE640&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Mayor gets what he wants&amp;mdash;Council OKs move 33&amp;ndash;16 despite opposition|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=June 12, 2008|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Spielman, Fran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1212F083B836ABB8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=The taking of Grant Park|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=June 8, 2008|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=120B5E8D060726E0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=13&amp;ndash;2 vote for museum&amp;mdash;Decision on Grant Park sets up Council battle|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=May 16, 2008|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Spielman, Fran and Art Golab}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Montgomery Ward]] twice sued the city of Chicago in the 1890s to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park, and to keep it from building new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/538.html|title=Grant Park|accessdate=July 28, 2008|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|author=Grinnell, Max}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park.  However, ''Crown Fountain'' and [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]], which stands {{convert|139|ft|m}} tall, were exempt from the height restriction because they were classified as [[Work of art|works of art]] and not buildings or structures.&lt;ref&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, ''Crown Fountain'' became the focus of a public controversy when the city added [[surveillance camera]]s atop each tower. Purchased through a $52&amp;nbsp;million [[Department of Homeland Security]] [[Federal grants (USA)|grant]] to the Chicago area, the cameras were part of a surveillance system augmenting eight other cameras covering all of Millennium Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1162481DDCDD7720&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2| title=Artworks stand alone as cameras lose perch|accessdate=April 22, 2008|date=December 20, 2006|author=Janega, James|publisher=NewsBank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city said the cameras, similar to those used throughout the city at high-crime areas and traffic intersections, were intended to remain on the towers for several months until permanent, less intrusive replacements were secured.&lt;ref name=ATWABS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/us/28cameras.html|title=A Tempest When Art Became Surveillance|accessdate=April 12, 2008|date=December 28, 2006|author=Sander, Libby|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but Plensa himself had not been notified.&lt;ref name=Janega&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1161F38C6FC15398&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2| title=Now the Giant Faces Really are Watching|accessdate=April 22, 2008|date=December 19, 2006|author=Janega, James|publisher=NewsBank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras on the towers as inappropriate and a blight.&lt;ref name=ATWABS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janega/&gt;  The city said that the cameras were largely for security reasons, but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out lights.&lt;ref name=Janega/&gt; The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' quickly published an article concerning the cameras as well as the public reaction, and the cameras were removed the next day. Plensa supported their removal.&lt;ref name=ATWABS/&gt;

==Updating==
In 2014, the hardware and software behind the fountain's operation were replaced. At the time there were plans to replace LED lighting with [[incandescent bulb]]s on each of the non-video display surfaces and to replace the video surface LEDs. Plensa, who maintained control of the video faces for the first two years of the fountain's operation, understands that future generations may wish to update the faces used in the rotation of videos to reflect changes in humanity going forward.&lt;ref name=AitaCFrawoq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/crown-fountain-jaume-plensa-millennium-park-tenth-anniversary-1004-portraits/Content?oid=13887327|title=At its tenth anniversary, Crown Fountain remains a wellspring of questions|accessdate=October 8, 2015|date=June 11, 2014|work=[[Chicago Reader]]|author=Malooley, Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, an additional 1000 faces were anticipated for 2016.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inside artist Jaume Plensa's giant Millennium Park sculptures|url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-jaume-plensa-heads-millennium-park-20140616-column.html|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate = October 7, 2015|date=June 16, 2014|author=Borrelli, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Crown Fountain'', ''[[Trevi Fountain]]'', and ''Buckingham Fountain'', as well as natural water features such as [[Old Faithful]], are examples of the ability of water to attract people and hold their attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ADHB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1045061457394D70&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Sparking the imagination Various types of fountains attract - curious visitors to Riverwalk |accessdate=August 5, 2008|date=July 27, 2004|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights, Illinois newspaper)|Daily Herald]]|author=Penick, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crown Fountain'' has more interactivity than other Chicago fountains, such as ''Buckingham Fountain'' and [[Lorado Taft]]'s ''[[Fountain of the Great Lakes]]'' and ''[[Fountain of Time]]''&lt;ref name=G291/&gt;&lt;ref name=FF/&gt;  (all but the last are in Grant Park).

One ''Chicago Tribune'' critic was not impressed with [[JumboTron]]-like art, although he conceded the participatory element reminded him in a positive way of the [[jungle gym]] element of the ''[[Chicago Picasso]]''.&lt;ref name=Ubepa/&gt;

The fountain is featured on the cover of Philip Jodidio's 2005 book, ''Architecture: Art''.  Although Plensa is considered to be a [[conceptual artist]], according to Jodidio, Plensa created a work whose architectural aspects are paramount.  Its location juxtaposed with the Historic Michigan Boulevard District's skywall highlights these aspects.  Jodidio considers the work to be a modernization of the gargoyle theme, and feels that the scale of the enlarged faces humanize the work and challenges the architecture.  The towers are an integral part of the skyline that have achieved rare permanence for contemporary art.&lt;ref name=J162&gt;Jodidio, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2018, '''David Dragičević''', a 21-year-old man, went missing in [[Banja Luka]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. On 24 March, his dead body was found. Police investigation ruled the death as an accident, but Dragičević's parents claimed that their son was brutally murdered and that the police and prosecutor's office are trying to cover-up the case. The result of the police investigation provoked major public uproar, and many mass protests were organized demanding the truth and justice. The public was overweeningly convinced that Dragičević was murdered.

In May 2018, the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly of Republika Srpska]] voted to form an Inquiry Board to analyze circumstances surrounding Dragičević's death. The Board found that Dragičević was probably murdered, but its report was rejected by the Assembly. {{As of|July 2018}}, the Prosecutor's office has not reacted, and the death remains classified as an accident, while the public protests are ongoing.

==The incident==
On 18 March 2018, 21-year-old David Dragičević went out with his friends around 7 p.m., but never returned home and was declared missing the same day.&lt;ref name="disrupts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.balkaneu.com/the-death-of-david-dragicevic-disrupts-the-pre-election-world-in-banja-luka/ | title=The death of David Dragičević 'disrupts' the pre-election world in Banja Luka | publisher=ibna | date=10 May 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018 | author=Dragojlovic, Mladen}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March, his dead body was found small Crkvena creek in downtown [[Banja Luka]].&lt;ref name="suspicious death"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.balkaneu.com/the-suspicious-death-of-a-young-man-triggered-protests-in-banja-luka/ | title=The suspicious death of a young man triggered protests in Banja Luka | publisher=ibna | date=27 March 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018 | author=Dragojlovic, Mladen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dragičević  was buried on 7 April at the New Cemetery of Banja Luka. The funeral was attended by the [[President of Republika Srpska]] [[Milorad Dodik]].&lt;ref name="sahranjen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ba.n1info.com/a253294/Vijesti/Vijesti/Sahranjen-David-Dragicevic-FOTO.html | title=Sahranjen David Dragičević (FOTO) | publisher=N1 | date=7 April 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police investigation===
Police investigators claim that on 18 March, Dragičević visited the cafe in central Banja Luka where he had been caught up in a fight with several other young men. After this incident, nothing was heard from him until 24 March when police were informed about a dead body found in the water. According to the police, Dragičević visited another cafe after the fight, left, and then robbed a house on the way home.  Police inspector Darko Ilić claims that surveillance cameras confirm that Dragičević committed the robbery on the way home and that several stolen items from the robbed house were found in his pockets. According to the police investigation, after the robbery, on his way home, Dragičević walked across a small bridge over Crkvena creek and fell in the water and drowned.&lt;ref name="suspicious death" /&gt;

[[Coroner]] Željko Karan said that Dragičević had several [[haematoma]]s on his body, probably caused by strokes during the fight he had, and also several [[post-mortem]] injuries on the hands, caused by stones at the bottom of the creek. When journalists asked Karan about the possibility that the haematomas were caused by another attack ''on the bridge'', he answered that it is indeed possible, but that it "could not be determined during the autopsy". Despite this, police officially ruled the death as an "accident".&lt;ref name="suspicious death" /&gt;

===Dragičević family and public response===
From the start of the investigation, Dragičević's parents claimed that their son was brutally murdered and that they possess evidence of that. According to Davor Dragičević, David's father, the killer is a well-known figure, and police officers, [[Government of Republika Srpska|Minister of the Interior]] [[Dragan Lukač]], and local police chief Darko Ćulum, are trying to [[cover-up]] the crime.&lt;ref name="disrupts" /&gt; Dragičević's mother said that he, on the night he disappeared, sent her an SMS that read "if anything happens to me, the perpetrator will be F. Ć."&lt;ref name="suspicious death"/&gt;

Dragičević's death triggered daily protests in Banja Luka from the day his body was found. Every evening at 6 p.m., a crowd of 200 has been gathering at the [[Krajina Square]] in central Banja Luka demanding justice for Dragičević.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ba.n1info.com/a256058/English/NEWS/Banja-Luka-citizens-gather-seeking-Justice-for-David.html | title=Banja Luka citizens gather seeking 'Justice for David' | publisher=N1 | date=21 April 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="disrupts" /&gt; On 15 May, a large protest was organized in [[Sarajevo]], the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where several hundred people demanded justice for Dragičević and Dženan Memić, a young man from Sarajevo whose 2016 death was also ruled an accident, but whose father and friends claim he was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ba.n1info.com/a260592/Video/Dnevnik-Protesti-u-Sarajevu-pravda-za-Dzenana-i-Davida.html | title=Dnevnik: Protesti u Sarajevu - pravda za Dženana i Davida | publisher=N1 | date=15 May 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May, similar protest organized in [[Zenica]] was attended by several hundred people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ba.n1info.com/ a260826/Vijesti/Vijesti/Stotine-gradjana-na-setnji-za-Dragicevica-i-Memica-u-Zenici.html | title=Stotine građana na šetnji za Dragičevića i Memića u Zenici | publisher=N1 | date=16 May 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May, another protest was held in [[Tuzla]] under the banner "Justice for David and Dženan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ba.n1info.com/a261577/Vijesti/Vijesti/U-Tuzli-odrzan-skup-pod-nazivom-Pravda-za-Davida-i-Dzenana.html | title=U Tuzli održan skup pod nazivom "Pravda za Davida i Dženana" | publisher=N1 | date=20 May 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another protest was organized in Sarajevo on 26 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ba.n1info.com/a262865/Vijesti/Vijesti/Skup-podrske-za-porodice-Dragicevic-i-Memic.html | title=Skup podrške za porodice Dragičević i Memić | publisher=N1 | date=26 May 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another large protest was organized in Banja Luka on 7 July and attended by 10.000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mondo.rs/a1117044/Info/Ex-Yu/Protest-Pravda-za-Davida-u-Banjaluci-dosli-iz-BiH.html | title=ZA DAVIDA: 10.000 građana na Trgu Krajine | publisher=Mondo | date=7 July 2018 | accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On  October 5th a Other huge protest was organized in Banja Luka again over 40.000 people attended (30.000 people more an previous one.) in this huge event. It also streamed live exclusively on BN Televizija{{Fact|date=October 2018}}

Journalist and blogger Slobodan Vasković analyzed documents and eye-witness accounts and on 2 May claimed that Dragičević was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ba.n1info.com/a258184/Vijesti/Vijesti/Vaskovic-za-N1-Dragicevic-je-ubijen-evo-zasto-to-tvrdim.html | title=Vasković za N1: Dragičević je ubijen, evo zašto to tvrdim | publisher=N1 | date=2 May 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman of the parliamentary caucus of the [[Serb Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serb Democratic Party]] (SDS) [[Vukota Govedarica]] said on 10 May that he thinks Dragičević was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ba.n1info.com/a259724/Vijesti/Vijesti/Govedarica-Mislim-da-je-David-Dragicevic-ubijen.html | title=Govedarica: Mislim da je David Dragičević ubijen | publisher=N1 | date=10 May 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary Inquiry Board===
Under constant public pressure, on 11 May 2018, the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly of Republika Srpska]] voted to form an Inquiry Board to analyze circumstances surrounding Dragičević's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nezavisne.com/novosti/bih/Formiran-Anketni-odbor-u-vezi-sa-slucajem-stradanja-Davida-Dragicevica/477840 | title=Formiran Anketni odbor u vezi sa slučajem stradanja Davida Dragičevića | publisher=Nezavisne novine | date=11 May 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June, the Inquiry Board adopted a 320-pages long report after hearing members of the police and public prosecutor's office, coroner Karan, and minister Lukač. The report concluded that there is more than enough evidence that Dragičević was murdered and that the public prosecutor should immediately respond to those findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rs.n1info.com/a393907/Svet/Region/Izvestaj-o-slucaju-Davida-Dragicevica-na-vise-od-300-strana.html | title=Izveštaj: Osnovana sumnja da je David Dragičević ubijen | publisher=N1 | date=5 June 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July, the National Assembly rejected the Inquiry Board report by a majority vote. The report was supported by the opposition MPs, but rejected by the majority coalition of the [[Alliance of Independent Social Democrats]] (SNSD), the [[Democratic People's Alliance]] (DNS), the [[Socialist Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Socialist Party]] (SP) and two independent MPs. The Assembly majority held that the Board did not have competency to characterize the case as a murder. Instead, they suggested the following conclusion: "The National Assembly expects the Prosecution and other law-enforcement agencies to treat the case of David Dragičević in accordance with their legally prescribes competencies and to act in accordance with the regulations of the Criminal Procedure Code, which will oblige other institutions to act accordingly." Although not accepting the report, the Assembly adopted conclusion that "the prosecutors in the case made numerous errors" and demanded that "the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina consider initiation of certain disciplinary procedures against the prosecutors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ba.n1info.com/a270246/English/NEWS/Inquiry-Board-s-conclusion-on-David-Dragicevic-case-rejected.html | title=Inquiry Board's conclusion on David Dragicevic case rejected | publisher=N1 | date=3 July 2018 | accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''degenerate semiconductor''' is a [[semiconductor]] with such a high level of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] that the material starts to act more like a [[metal]] than as a semiconductor.

At moderate doping levels the [[dopant]] atoms create individual doping levels that can often be considered as localized states that can donate [[electron]]s or [[electron hole|holes]] by [[thermal promotion]] (or an [[optical transition]]) to the [[conduction band|conduction]] or [[valence band]]s respectively. At high enough impurity concentrations the individual impurity atoms may become close enough neighbors that their doping levels merge into an impurity band and the behavior of such a system ceases to show the typical traits of a semiconductor, e.g. its increase in conductivity with temperature. On the other hand, a degenerate semiconductor still has far fewer charge carriers than a true metal so that its behavior is in many ways intermediary between semiconductor and metal.

Many [[copper sulfide|copper chalcogenides]] are degenerate [[p-type semiconductor]]s with relatively large numbers of holes in their valence band. An example is the system LaCuOS&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; with Mg doping. It is a [[wide gap]] p-type degenerate semiconductor. The hole concentration does not change with temperature, a typical trait of degenerate semiconductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference|title= Wide gap p-type degenerate semiconductor: Mg-doped LaCuOSe

'''Dynamic consent''' is a new approach to consent that engages individuals in decisions about how their personal information should be used. It is a personalised, digital communication interface that enables two-way communication between participants and researchers, and puts participants at the centre of decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24801761 | doi=10.1038/ejhg.2014.71 | volume=23 | title=Dynamic consent: a patient interface for twenty-first century research networks | pmc=4130658 | year=2015 | journal=Eur.

== Background ==
Researchers are required to obtain [[informed consent]] from potential participants before any [[research]] begins – this is a fundamental principle of medical research as laid out in the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. Traditionally this has been done through a paper consent form which is accompanied by a subject information sheet that describes the risks and benefits of being involved in the research. Increasingly, this also outlines how an individual’s data will be protected and their [[privacy]] maintained.  This constitutes a formal agreement that specifies how a [[research participant]]’s data will be used in that particular study. Participants should be informed about the purpose(s) for which their data will (or may) be used; where it will be stored; the expected retention time; if any other parties are involved; the amount and the sensitivity of the information exchanged; whether the data will be shared onward to yet other parties; whether the consent to use these data can be revoked. Consent to [[data processing]] is also a requirement of [https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act data protection] and [[Information privacy|privacy]] laws in most countries. Traditionally, participants have obtained details of how their data will be used from patient information sheets and face-to-face interactions with researchers or healthcare staff.

However, now both medical research and data processing are changing through developments in [[information communication technology]], especially the [[internet]] with examples including genetic databases and registries, [[electronic health records]], [[biobanks]], and online digital services and databases. More and more data is being collected online and being stored in large [[data set]]s with the intention for them to be used by many researchers, research groups and institutions for a variety of purposes.  These include different research projects, as well as public health assessments, [[marketing]], and the design of [[algorithms]] and [[data mining]].

The collection and use of data in this way raises some challenges. Firstly with regard to privacy: can participants' data and identity truly be [[Anonymity|anonymised]] and sensitive data be kept safe and [[Confidentiality|confidential]]? Individuals, in general, are not aware of how their [[personal information]] is used, for what purpose and which parties have a copy. They are not usually given the opportunity to declare their specific consents and privacy-related personal data management preferences. Secondly, with regard to consent: informed consent requires a person to know in advance what they are agreeing to and what the likely risks and benefits of agreeing will be. But with these large, linked data sets, it is often not clear at the time someone is asked to consent how their data will be used in the future.

This is known as a broad consent or a blanket consent. Blanket consent means that a person effectively agrees to permit any and all uses of their data once it is provided. Broad consent is more common and involves agreeing to a broad set of potential future uses under a particular governance framework. Broad consent has become the standard practice in many genetic registries and biobanks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-taipei-on-ethical-considerations-regarding-health-databases-and-biobanks/|title=WMA - The World Medical Association-WMA Declaration of Taipei on Ethical Considerations regarding Health Databases and Biobanks|website=www.wma.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its legal and ethical adequacy has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timothy Caulfield|last2=Jane Kaye|date=2009-09-01|title=Broad Consent in Biobanking: Reflections on Seemingly Insurmountable                Dilemmas|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/096853320901000201|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=85–100|doi=10.1177/096853320901000201|issn=0968-5332}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, consent is still frequently done as a one-off procedure with a paper form for participants to sign. These forms are often lost or filed away, and over time people forget what they have consented to and why.

== What is dynamic consent?==
Dynamic consent is a personalised digital interface to facilitate participant engagement in clinical and research activities over time. It seeks to address some of the issues raised by the traditional, paper-based, static consent approach, where consent must be obtained for all future activities in a face to face interview. Dynamic consent operates through a secure IT interface for consent and communication that enables participants to view a digital record of their consent decisions, subsequent to their initial agreement. Some versions of dynamic consent also have the functionality for people to personalise according to their preferences, which can be changed at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Platform for Engaging Everyone Responsibly|url=http://www.geneticalliance.org/programs/biotrust/peer/|website=Genetic Alliance|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, dynamic consent aims to put people in control of their data and how it is used, reflecting patient-centric initiatives happening elsewhere in medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dwamena|first=Francesca|last2=Holmes-Rovner|first2=Margaret|last3=Gaulden|first3=Carolyn M|last4=Jorgenson|first4=Sarah|last5=Sadigh|first5=Gelareh|last6=Sikorskii|first6=Alla|last7=Lewin|first7=Simon|last8=Smith|first8=Robert C|last9=Coffey|first9=John|date=2012-12-12|title=Interventions for providers to promote a patient-centred approach in clinical consultations|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd003267.pub2|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd003267.pub2|issn=1465-1858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the tool, participants can consent to new projects or change their consent choices; they can complete surveys and receive information about research findings. Preferences are linked with a participant's samples and data and so if these are shared, so too are the individual's preferences. It enables people to give a range of different kinds of consent, for example, a broad consent to low-risk epidemiological research or an explicit consent to a new, high-risk proposal. This flexibility is enabled by the digital interface where preferences can be changed in line with new situations.

Dynamic consent may facilitate recruitment in research, as information is provided to potential participants in a user-friendly and standardised way across research sites and irrespective of the participants' geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Budin-Ljøsne et al|first1=I|title=Dynamic Consent: a potential solution to some of the challenges of modern biomedical research.|journal=BMC Medical Ethics|date=25 Jan 2017|issue=18(1):4.|url=https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pang|first=Patrick Cheong-Iao|last2=Chang|first2=Shanton|last3=Verspoor|first3=Karin|last4=Clavisi|first4=Ornella|date=2018-10-30|title=The Use of Web-Based Technologies in Health Research Participation: Qualitative Study of Consumer and Researcher Experiences|url=https://www.jmir.org/2018/10/e12094/|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=10|pages=e12094|doi=10.2196/12094|issn=1438-8871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic consent enables two-way, ongoing communication between researchers and research participants. For instance, research participants are able to upload additional health data, or researchers may inform participants about new research opportunities or findings. Such ongoing interface may increase the participants' understanding of research and positively impact retention rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Budin-Ljøsne|first=Isabelle|last2=Teare|first2=Harriet J.

== What makes dynamic consent dynamic? ==
This digital interface is dynamic because individuals can:
* give different kinds of consents (e.g. broad, explicit, specific) to different activities
* change their consent preferences to the use of their samples and information in real time in response to their changing circumstances
* enrol in new studies or engage in self-reported research
* receive up to date information on how their samples and data are being used and on the progress and outcomes of research
* tailor the way they receive information, change these preferences over time and have a record of all transactions in one place
* be contacted easily by researchers when there is a protocol change, their opinion is needed or a new consent is required.&lt;ref&gt;Teare, HJA; Morrison, M; Whitley, EA; Kaye, J (2015).

== History of dynamic consent ==
=== First Genetic Trust ===
In 2001 First Genetic Trust (FGT) put forward the idea that they act as a 'broker' of genetic information. They would be a third party between people taking part in research that involved their genetic data and those carrying out the research. FGT recommended a method that would protect 'the confidentiality of individual medical and genetic information, allowing access to select information and the use or application of an individual's DNA only when the patient has given specific consent.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Genetic Trust selects HP as technology partner|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2002/020211a.html|website=Hewlett Packard (HP) Co. Newsroom|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=11 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system has characteristics of dynamic consent before the term was coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wee|first1=Richman|title=Dynamic consent in the digital age of biology|journal=Journal of Primary Health Care|date=September 2013|volume=5|issue=3|page=259|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/hc/pdf/HC13259|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EnCoRe ===
The EnCoRe project – Ensuring Consent and Revocation – began in 2008 and ran until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the EnCoRe project website!|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/breweb/encoreproject/index.html|website=EnCoRe|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]), the Economic and Social Research Council ([[ESRC]]) and the UK government's [[Technology Strategy Board]]. Institutional partners for the project were [[Hewlett-Packard]] (and specifically the Hewlett-Packard Systems Security Lab in Bristol), the [[Warwick Manufacturing Group]] at the [[University of Warwick]], [[QinetiQ]], [https://www.hwcomms.com/ HW Communications], [https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/research/centre-for-health-law-and-emerging-technologies-helex HeLEX] from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[London School of Economics]].

The project's aim was to give individuals more control over any personal data they disclose to organisations, with an overall vision to make giving and revoking consent as reliable and easy as turning a tap on and off. This was an attempt to tackle the lack of any legal requirement for organisations to obtain consent before using personal data about individuals. EnCoRe aimed to enable people to determine what their information is used for, who it is shared with and for how long and where it is stored.

Three case studies were carried out as part of the EnCore project, each with different requirements for consent and revocation. A technical architecture was produced for each scenario, setting out all the functions needed for the management (including capture and revocation) and enforcement of individuals' consents. The three reports are publicly available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public deliverables, papers and other publications|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/breweb/encoreproject/deliverables.html|website=EnCoRe|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the EnCoRe project that the term 'dynamic consent' was coined by Professor Jane Kaye's team at the University of Oxford and become one of the outputs of the EnCoRe project. It is now used to describe this new way of obtaining consent.

=== InBank ===
Over time, the focus of dynamic consent has shifted from simply enabling participants to change their consent preferences to incorporating it as part of a larger apparatus that facilitates communication between participants and researchers or health professionals. The InBank team at the [[University of Manchester]] looked at dynamic consent as a way of collecting and sharing [[electronic health records]]. The work was UK-focused, considering dynamic consent in the context of the [[NHS]] and positioning it as a device to increase or restore public trust. The public scandal over the [[care.data]] initiative was positioned as evidence of a deficit in trust, and equally that it showed a lack of transparent and accountable governance of people's personal medical records in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Hawys|last2=Spencer|first2=Karen|last3=Sanders|first3=Caroline|last4=Lund|first4=David|last5=Whitley|first5=Edgar|last6=Kaye|first6=Jane|last7=Dixon|first7=William|title=Viewpoint.

== Dynamic consent in practice ==
There are a number of examples across Europe of where dynamic consent is being used in research projects. One of these is the [https://research.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/rudy/ RUDY] Study - a study of rare diseases led by researchers at the [http://www.ox.ac.uk/ University of Oxford].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teare|first=Harriet J.

In the USA, the Platform for Engaging Everyone Responsibly ([http://www.geneticalliance.org/programs/biotrust/peer/ PEER]) has been set up by non-profit health advocacy organisation [[Genetic Alliance]] and software company [https://www.privateaccess.info/ Private Access]. Not only can participants choose to consent to only some aspects of research and not to others, but they can also specify preferences for types of data access by third parties and consent to other activities that are offered, such as the use of their biological samples after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Platform for Engaging Everyone Responsibly|url=http://www.geneticalliance.org/programs/biotrust/peer/|website=Genetic Alliance|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges to dynamic consent ==
Criticisms have been made about dynamic consent including that it is unnecessary. A number of empirical studies that were carried out before dynamic consent was developed, suggested that people are happy to give broad or 'one-off' consent for some kinds of research. For example, a face-to face interview study of 1001 Scottish adults as part of the prospective Scottish Family Health Study genetic database carried out in 2009 found that respondents preferred 'scenarios where consent is only asked for at the start of the study' over options to renew consent every 5 or 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haddow|first1=Gill|last2=Cunningham-Burley|first2=Sarah|last3=Murray|first3=Lorraine|title=Can the governance of a population genetic data bank effect recruitment? Evidence from the public consultation of Generation Scotland|journal=Public Understanding of Science|date=April 2010|volume=20|issue=117|doi=10.1177/0963662510361655|url=http://pus.sagepub.com/content/20/1/117|accessdate=24 January 2017|pages=117–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a survey of US adults published in 2010, reported a preference for a broad, 'one off' consent at the time of donation to a biobank over giving specific consent for each new study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=Christian|last2=L'Heureux|first2=Jamie|last3=Murray|first3=Jeffrey|last4=Winokur|first4=Patricia|last5=Weiner|first5=George|last6=Newbury|first6=Elizabeth|last7=Shinkunas|first7=Laura|last8=Zimmerman|first8=Bridget|journal=Genetics in Medicine|date=2011|volume=13|issue=9|page=821|doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31821d2f88|title=Active choice but not too active: Public perspectives on biobank consent models|pmc=3658114}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of the qualitative sociological literature on public and patient attitudes to biobanking published 2002-9 reached a similar conclusion: 'few people demanded recurrent, project-specific consent and few wished to place limits on the uses to which their tissue could be put'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipworth|first1=Wendy|last2=Forsyth|first2=Rowena|last3=Kerridge|first3=Ian|title=Tissue donation to biobanks: a review of sociological studies|journal=Sociology of Health and Illness|date=2011|volume=33|issue=5|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9566.2011.01342.x|pages=792–811}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, these studies did not present dynamic consent to their respondents as an alternative to a broad consent.

There have been some criticism of dynamic consent by a Norwegian team of researchers, who argued that dynamic consent would be an unwanted burden on participants and a waste of time for researchers. 'In a dynamic consent model, participants will be asked for consent continuously, simply because each new project is a new project. Thus, they will be asked to re-consent both for trivial and essential reasons, and often the former'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristin Solum|first1=Steinsbekk|last2=Myskja|first2=Bjørn Ka°re|last3=Solberg|first3=Berge|title=Broad consent versus dynamic consent in biobank research: Is passive participation an ethical problem?|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=2013|volume=21|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2012.282|pages=897–902|pmc=3746258}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this opinion was based on an erroneous understanding of dynamic consent as requiring consent for each new study, rather being able to be tailored to the needs and ethical requirements of a particular study.

Steinsbekk et al. in their publication criticising dynamic consent also argued that rather than increasing the number of people taking part in research, dynamic consent may have the opposite effect. 'Being confronted with the detailed complexity of biomedical research, and being asked again and again for an 'opinion' (a consent), it is likely that at least some people will struggle with feelings of falling short – that their own competence or knowledge do not suffice. This could easily be interpreted as a 'lack of respect' for the passive participant, and result in lower participation as people would rather choose to stay away from such studies than face shortcomings.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristin Solum|first1=Steinsbekk|last2=Myskja|first2=Bjørn Ka°re|last3=Solberg|first3=Berge|title=Broad consent versus dynamic consent in biobank research: Is passive participation an ethical problem?|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=2013|volume=21|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2012.282|pages=897–902|pmc=3746258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers raise concerns about the impact of consent withdrawal (more easily facilitated by dynamic consent) on the integrity of their research data sets. 

=== Rebuttals ===
There are a number of important limitations to consider when evaluating the results of studies of consent practices. In many cases, while a statistically significant preference for one form of consent over another can be found, this is not necessarily indicative of a clear majority preference. For example, Haddow et al., 2011, characterised their reported consent preferences as 'not strong'. Another study reported that while 58% of respondents described re-consent as 'a waste of time', 51% also felt that being asked for it was an indication that they were 'respected and involved' participants in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Master|first1=Zubin|last2=Claudio|first2=Jaime|last3=Rachul|first3=Christen|last4=Jean|first4=Wang|last5=Minden|first5=Mark|last6=Caulfield|first6=Timothy|title=Cancer patient perceptions on the ethical and legal issues related to biobanking|journal=BMC Medical Genomics|date=2013|volume=6|issue=8|doi=10.1186/1755-8794-6-8|url=http://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1755-8794-6-8|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of prospective public attitude surveys on biobanking, of which there are many in the existing literature, Johnsson et al., 2010, found that reported willingness to share data and tissue for research was prone to both overestimating and underestimating recorded participation levels in different cases, leading to questions about the usefulness of this type of research in making predictions of future behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnsson|first1=Linus|last2=Helgesson|first2=Gert|last3=Rafnar|first3=Thorunn|last4=Halldorsdottir|first4=Ingibjorg|last5=Chia|first5=Kee-Seng|last6=Eriksson|first6=Stefan|last7=Hansson|first7=Mats G|title=Hypothetical and factual willingness to participate in biobank research|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=2010|volume=18|issue=11|page=1261|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.106|pmc=2987483|pmid=20648060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">{{about|the narrative device}}
A '''flashforward''' (also spelled '''flash-forward''') is a scene that temporarily takes the [[narrative]] forward in time from the current point of the story in literature, film, television and other media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flash-forward&lt;/ref&gt; Flashforwards are often used to represent events expected, projected, or imagined to occur in the future. They may also reveal significant parts of the story that have not yet occurred, but soon will in greater detail. It is similar to [[foreshadowing]], in which future events are not shown but rather implicitly hinted at. It is primarily a [[postmodern literature|postmodern]] [[narrative device]], named by analogy to the more traditional [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], which reveals events that occurred in the past.

== Examples in literature ==
An early example of prolepsis which predates the postmodern period is [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', in which the protagonist [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] is shown the future following his death. The subsequent events of the story imply that this future will be averted by this foreknowledge.

[[Terry Brooks]]' ''[[Word &amp; Void]]'' series features a [[protagonist]] who, when he sleeps, moves forwards and backwards through time to before and after a great cataclysm. This is both [[analepsis]] and prolepsis.

[[Muriel Spark]] makes extensive use of prolepsis in her novel ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]''.

== Examples in television ==
Every season of ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' makes an extensive use of flashforwards, revealing the outcome of the season to the viewer. The whole season then revolves around discovering the circumstances that led to this outcome. For instance, the first season starts with a flashforward of the protagonist, Ellen Parsons, running in the streets of New York, covered in blood. 6 months earlier, she was only a naive young woman who had just become a lawyer in the firm of a powerful attorney, Patty Hewes. What led Ellen to the situation presented in the flashforwards is revealed little by little throughout the season. Furthermore, the series is known for its misleading use of flashforwards, which are often examples of the [[red herring]] device.

After making extensive use of flashbacks in the first two seasons, the TV series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' used flashforwards throughout the remainder of the series. The first use of this was in the third-season finale: what appeared to be a flashback to before the characters were stranded on the island, was revealed at the end to be a flashforward of them returned to civilization. A later episode featured what appeared to be flashforwards involving the couple Jin and Sun, showing them safely returned home and awaiting the birth of their baby, but it is then revealed that Jin's scenes were flashbacks and only Sun's were flashforwards.

The series finale of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', "[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]", uses a technique similar to a flashforward. It depicts a future in which the U.S.S. ''Voyager'' has returned home after decades lost in deep space with various personal tragedies, prompting the ship's captain to use [[time travel]] to return to the timeframe of the series and return the crew home more directly.

The U.S. [[Science fiction film|sci-fi]] TV series ''[[FlashForward]]'' revolves around everyone on Earth losing consciousness for 137 seconds, during which each person experiences a glimpse of events 6 months in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441135&lt;/ref&gt;  The series was itself based loosely on the novel [[Flashforward (novel)|Flashforward]] by [[Robert J. Sawyer]].

British soap opera ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' flashed forward six months in May 2010 for a special episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a191387/hollyoaks-to-air-flashforward-episode.html|title=Hollyoaks to air flashforward episode|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last episode of ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' has an extensive flashforward depicting the deaths of all the central characters for several decades in the future.

''[[Breaking Bad]]'' uses flashforwards throughout its second season showing a mystery regarding debris and corpses in Walter White's house and neighborhood, revealed to be the result of two planes crashing overhead. The first half of the fifth season begins with a flashforward one year into the future where Walter is fifty-two years old, and the second half begins with a continuation of the story, where he returns to his abandoned home. The plot of these flashforwards is resumed in the [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|series finale]].

''[[How to Get Away with Murder]]'' uses in every episode flashforwards of scenes from future episodes until episode 9.

''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]'' used flashforwards in order to unravel the future events that have occurred in the first and second season.

== Examples in film ==
Midway through the film ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'', there is an abrupt flashforward when Robert, the character played by [[Michael Sarrazin]], is seen being thrust into a jail cell by a police officer, even though he has done nothing to provoke such treatment. The audience is notified, later in the story, that Sarrazin's character would have indeed made choices that warrant his arrest.

The film ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'' relies extensively on prolepsis throughout the movie. The main character gains this ability after learning the language of the aliens, and proceeds to use it to prevent the outbreak of war. She uses information revealed to her in the future to convince an important official not to attack the aliens, and to give her said information in the future.

== Examples in video games ==
In ''[[Until Dawn]]'', players may find artifacts left by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe who lived on the mountain that show premonitions of possible future events. Whether they come true is dependent on player actions; for example, one shows another character's death in a scene that can be avoided.

In [[physics]], specifically for [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]], a '''four-tensor''' is an abbreviation for a [[tensor]] in a four-dimensional [[spacetime]].&lt;ref name=Lambourne_2010&gt;Lambourne, Robert J A. Relativity, Gravitation and Cosmology. Cambridge University Press. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalities==

General four-tensors are usually written in [[tensor index notation]] as

:&lt;math&gt;A^{\mu_1,\mu_2,...,\mu_n}_{\;\nu_1,\nu_2,...,\nu_m}&lt;/math&gt;

with the indices taking integer values from 0 to 3, with 0 for the timelike components and 1, 2, 3 for spacelike components. There are ''n'' [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] indices and ''m'' [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] indices.&lt;ref name=Lambourne_2010/&gt;

In special and general relativity, many four-tensors of interest are first order ([[four-vector]]s) or second order, but higher order tensors occur. Examples are listed next.

In special relativity, the vector basis can be restricted to being orthonormal, in which case all four-tensors transform under [[Lorentz transformations]]. In general relativity, more general coordinate transformations are necessary since such a restriction is not in general possible.

==Examples==

===First order tensors===

{{main|Four-vector}}

In special relativity, one of the simplest non-trivial examples of a four-tensor is the four-displacement

:&lt;math&gt;x^\mu= (x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3 ) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

a four-tensor with contravariant rank 1 and covariant rank 0. Four-tensors of this kind are usually known as [[four-vectors]]. Here the component ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ct'' gives the displacement of a body in time (coordinate time ''t'' is multiplied by the [[speed of light]] ''c'' so that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; has dimensions of length). The remaining components of the four-displacement form the spatial displacement vector '''x''' = (''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Lambourne_2010/&gt;

The [[four-momentum]] for massive or [[massless particle]]s is

:&lt;math&gt;p^\mu = \left(E/c,p_x,p_y,p_z\right)&lt;/math&gt;

combines its energy (divided by ''c'') ''p''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''E''/''c'' and 3-[[momentum]] '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Lambourne_2010/&gt;

For a particle with [[relativistic mass]] ''m'', four momentum is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;p^\mu = m \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''τ'' the [[proper time]] of the particle.

===Second order tensors===

The [[Minkowski metric]] tensor with an orthonormal basis for the (−+++) convention is

:&lt;math&gt;\eta^{\mu \nu}=\begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;

used for calculating the [[line element]] and [[raising and lowering indices]]. The above applies to Cartesian coordinates. In general relativity, the metric tensor is given by much more general expressions for curvilinear coordinates.

The [[angular momentum]] {{nowrap|1='''L''' = '''x''' ∧ '''p'''}} of a particle with [[relativistic mass]] ''m'' and [[relativistic momentum]] '''p''' (as measured by an observer in a [[lab frame]]) combines with another vector quantity {{nowrap|1='''N''' = ''m'''''x''' − '''p'''''t''}} (without a standard name) in the [[relativistic angular momentum]] tensor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= vintage books|pages=437–438, 566–569| year=2005 | isbn=978-0-09-944068-0}} '''Note:''' Some authors, including Penrose, use ''Latin'' letters in this definition, even though it is conventional to use Greek indices for vectors and tensors in spacetime.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Special Relativity and How it Works|author=M.

:&lt;math&gt; M^{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
    0     &amp; -N^1 c  &amp; -N^2 c  &amp; -N^3 c \\ 
    N^1 c &amp;  0      &amp;  L^{12} &amp; -L^{31} \\
    N^2 c &amp; -L^{12} &amp;  0      &amp;  L^{23} \\
    N^3 c &amp;  L^{31} &amp; -L^{23} &amp;  0 
  \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

with components

:&lt;math&gt;M^{\alpha\beta} = X^\alpha P^\beta - X^\beta P^\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

The [[stress–energy tensor]] of a continuum or field generally takes the form of a second order tensor, and usually denoted by ''T''. The timelike component corresponds to [[energy density]] (energy per unit volume), the mixed spacetime components to [[momentum density]] (momentum per unit volume), and the purely spacelike parts to 3d stress tensors.

The [[electromagnetic field tensor]] combines the [[electric field]] and '''E''' and magnetic field '''B'''&lt;ref name=Vanderlinde&gt;{{Citation

   D_zc &amp; - H_y   &amp; H_x    &amp; 0       
  \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[magnetization]]-[[polarization (waves)|polarization]] tensor combines the '''P''' and '''M''' fields&lt;ref name=Vanderlinde/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathcal{M}^{\mu\nu} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
   0     &amp; P_xc &amp; P_yc &amp; P_zc \\

   -  P_zc &amp; - M_y   &amp; M_x    &amp; 0       
  \end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

The three field tensors are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} F^{\mu \nu} - \mathcal{M}^{\mu \nu} \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the definitions of the '''D''' and '''H''' fields.

The [[electric dipole moment]] '''d''' and [[magnetic dipole moment]] '''μ''' of a particle are unified into a single tensor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.O.|last=Barut|title=Electrodynamics and the Classical theory of particles and fields|page=73|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-64038-9}} No factor of ''c'' appears in the tensor in this book because different conventions for the EM field tensor.&lt;/ref&gt;

  \sigma^{\mu\nu} =
  \begin{pmatrix}

   -  d_x &amp; 0      &amp; \mu_z / c  &amp;   - \mu_y/c    \\
   -  d_y &amp; - \mu_z / c  &amp; 0      &amp; \mu_x /c  \\
   -  d_z &amp; \mu_y / c  &amp; - \mu_x /c  &amp; 0       
  \end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Ricci curvature tensor]] is another second order tensor.

===Higher order tensors===

In general relativity, there are curvature tensors which tend to be higher order, such as the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] and [[Weyl curvature tensor]] which are both fourth order tensors.

'''Gaussian units''' constitute a [[metric system]] of [[units of measurement|physical units]]. This system is the most common of the several electromagnetic unit systems based on [[Centimetre gram second system of units|cgs (centimetre–gram–second) units]]. It is also called the '''Gaussian unit system''', '''Gaussian-cgs units''', or often just '''cgs units'''.&lt;ref&gt;One of many examples of using the term "cgs units" to refer to Gaussian units is: [http://nlpc.stanford.edu/nleht/Science/reference/conversion.pdf Lecture notes from Stanford University]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cgs units" is ambiguous and therefore to be avoided if possible: cgs contains within it several conflicting sets of electromagnetism units, not just Gaussian units, as described below.

The most common alternative to Gaussian units are [[International System of Units|SI units]]. SI units are predominant in most fields, and continue to increase in popularity at the expense of Gaussian units.&lt;ref name=Rowlett/&gt;&lt;ref name=JacksonEditions/&gt; (Other alternative unit systems also exist, as discussed below.) Conversions between Gaussian units and SI units are not as simple as normal unit conversions. For example, the ''formulas'' for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses. As another example, quantities that are [[dimensionless]] (loosely "unitless") in one system may have dimension in another.

==History==
Gaussian units existed before the CGS system.  The British Association report of 1873 that proposed the CGS contains gaussian units derived from the foot–grain–second and metre–gram–second as well.  There are also references to foot–pound–second gaussian units.

==Alternative unit systems==
{{main|Centimetre gram second system of units#Alternate derivations of CGS units in electromagnetism|l1=Alternative CGS units in electromagnetism}}
The main alternative to the Gaussian unit system is [[International System of Units|SI units]], historically also called the [[MKS system of units|MKSA system of units]] for metre–kilogram–second–ampere.&lt;ref name=Rowlett/&gt;

The Gaussian unit system is just one of several electromagnetic unit systems within CGS. Others include "[[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electrostatic units (ESU)|electrostatic units]]", "[[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electromagnetic units (EMU)|electromagnetic units]]", and [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]].

Some other unit systems are called "[[natural units]]", a category that includes [[atomic units]], [[Planck units]], and others.

SI units are by far the most common today. In [[engineering]] and practical areas, SI is nearly universal and has been for decades.&lt;ref name=Rowlett&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/cgsmks.html "CGS"], in ''How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement'', by Russ Rowlett and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/ref&gt; In technical, scientific literature (such as [[theoretical physics]] and [[astronomy]]), Gaussian units were predominant until recent decades, but are now getting progressively less so.&lt;ref name=Rowlett/&gt;&lt;ref name=JacksonEditions&gt;For example, one widely used graduate electromagnetism textbook is ''Classical Electrodynamics'' by J.D. Jackson. The second edition, published in 1975, used Gaussian units exclusively, but the third edition, published in 1998, uses mostly SI units. Similarly, ''Electricity and Magnetism'' by Edward Purcell is a popular undergraduate textbook. The second edition, published in 1984, used Gaussian units, while the third edition, published in 2013, switched to SI units.&lt;/ref&gt; The CGS-Gaussian unit system is recognized as having advantages in [[classical electromagnetism|classical]] and [[relativistic electromagnetism|relativistic electrodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural units are most common in more theoretical and abstract fields of physics, particularly [[particle physics]] and [[string theory]].

==Major differences between Gaussian and SI units==

==="Rationalized" unit systems===

One difference between Gaussian and SI units is in the factors of 4π in various formulas. SI electromagnetic units are called "rationalized",&lt;ref name=Littlejohn&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1112/notes/emunits.pdf | format=PDF | title=Gaussian, SI and Other Systems of Units in Electromagnetic Theory | work=Physics 221A, University of California, Berkeley lecture notes | author=Littlejohn, Robert | date=Fall 2017 | accessdate=2018-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kowalski&gt;Kowalski, Ludwik, 1986, "[http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML A Short History of the SI Units in Electricity,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429035624/http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML |date=2009-04-29 }}"  ''The Physics Teacher'' 24(2): 97–99. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.2341955 Alternate web link (subscription required)]&lt;/ref&gt; because [[Maxwell's equations]] have no explicit factors of 4''π'' in the formulae. On the other hand, the [[inverse-square law|inverse-square]] force laws &amp;ndash; [[Coulomb's law]] and the [[Biot–Savart law]] &amp;ndash; ''do'' have a factor of 4''π'' attached to the ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In ''unrationalized'' Gaussian units (not [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]]) the situation is reversed: Two of Maxwell's equations have factors of 4''π'' in the formulas, while both of the inverse-square force laws, Coulomb's law and the Biot–Savart law, have no factor of 4''π'' attached to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the denominator.

(The quantity 4''π'' appears because 4''πr''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the surface area of the sphere of radius ''r''. For details, see the articles [[Gauss's law#Relation to Coulomb's law|Relation between Gauss's law and Coulomb's law]] and [[Inverse-square law]].)

===Unit of charge===

A major difference between Gaussian and SI units is in the definition of the unit of charge. In SI, a separate base unit (the [[ampere]]) is associated with electromagnetic phenomena, with the consequence that something like electrical charge (1 [[coulomb]] = 1 ampere × 1 second) is a unique dimension of physical quantity and is not expressed purely in terms of the mechanical units (kilogram, metre, second). On the other hand, in Gaussian units, the unit of electrical charge (the [[statcoulomb]], statC) ''can'' be written entirely as a dimensional combination of the mechanical units (gram, centimetre, second), as:
:1 statC = 1 g&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

For example, [[Coulomb's law]] in Gaussian units is simple:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is the repulsive force between two electrical charges, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the two charges in question, and ''r'' is the distance separating them. If ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are expressed in [[statC]] and ''r'' in [[centimetre|cm]], then ''F'' will come out expressed in [[dyne]].

By contrast, the same law in SI units is:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2} = k_\text{e} \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]], a quantity with ''dimension'', namely ([[electric charge|charge]])&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[time]])&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[mass]])&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ([[length]])&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Coulomb's constant]]. Without ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the two sides could not have consistent dimensions in SI, and in fact the quantity ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; does not even exist in Gaussian units.  This is an example of how some dimensional [[physical constant]]s can be eliminated from the expressions of [[physical law]] simply by the judicious choice of units.  In SI, 1/''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, converts or scales [[Electric displacement field|flux density]], '''D''', to [[electric field]], '''E''' (the latter has dimension of [[force]] per [[electric charge|charge]]), while in ''rationalized'' Gaussian units, flux density ''is'' the very same as electric field in [[free space]], not just a scaled copy.

Since the unit of charge is built out of mechanical units (mass, length, time), the relation between mechanical units and  electromagnetic phenomena is clearer in Gaussian units than in SI. In particular, in Gaussian units, the [[speed of light]] ''c'' shows up directly in electromagnetic formulas like [[Maxwell's equations]] (see below), whereas in SI it only shows up implicitly via the relation &lt;math&gt;\mu_0 \varepsilon_0=1/c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Units for magnetism===

In Gaussian units, unlike SI units, the electric field '''E''' and the [[magnetic field|magnetic field '''B''']] have the same dimension. This amounts to a factor of ''[[speed of light|c]]'' difference between how '''B''' is defined in the two unit systems, on top of the other differences.&lt;ref name=Littlejohn/&gt; (The same factor applies to other magnetic quantities such as '''[[magnetic field|H]]''' and '''[[magnetization|M]]'''.) For example, in a [[Sinusoidal plane-wave solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation|planar light wave in vacuum]], {{nowrap|1={{abs|'''E'''('''r''', ''t'')}} = {{abs|'''B'''('''r''', ''t'')}}}} in Gaussian units, while {{nowrap|1={{abs|'''E'''('''r''', ''t'')}} = ''c''{{abs|'''B'''('''r''', ''t'')}}}} in SI units.

===Polarization, magnetization===

There are further differences between Gaussian and SI units in how quantities related to polarization and magnetization are defined. For one thing, in Gaussian units, ''all'' of the following quantities have the same dimension: '''[[electric field|E]]''', '''[[electric displacement field|D]]''', '''[[polarization density|P]]''', [[magnetic field|'''B''', '''H''']], and '''[[magnetization|M]]'''. Another important point is that the [[electric susceptibility|electric]] and [[magnetic susceptibility]] of a material is dimensionless in both Gaussian and SI units, but a given material will have a different numerical susceptibility in the two systems. (Equation is given below.)

==List of equations==

This section has a list of the basic formulae of electromagnetism, given in both Gaussian and SI units. Most symbol names are not given; for complete explanations and definitions, please click to the appropriate dedicated article for each equation. A simple conversion scheme for use when tables are not available may be found in

All formulas except otherwise noted are from Ref.&lt;ref name=Littlejohn/&gt;

===Maxwell's equations===

Here are Maxwell's equations, both in macroscopic and microscopic forms. Only the "differential form" of the equations is given, not the "integral form"; to get the integral forms apply the [[divergence theorem]] or [[Stokes' theorem|Kelvin–Stokes theorem]].

===Dielectric and magnetic materials===

Below are the expressions for the various fields in a dielectric medium. It is assumed here for simplicity that the medium is homogeneous, linear, isotropic, and nondispersive, so that the [[permittivity]] is a simple constant.

Next, here are the expressions for the various fields in a magnetic medium. Again, it is assumed that the medium is homogeneous, linear, isotropic, and nondispersive, so that the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] is a simple constant.

::Note: The SI quantities &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_0^{\text{SI}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}\mu_0^{\text{SI}} = 1/c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The conversion factors are written both symbolically and numerically. The numerical conversion factors can be derived from the symbolic conversion factors by [[dimensional analysis]]. For example, the top row says &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}}} = \frac{2.998 \times 10^9 \, \text{Fr}}{1\, \text{C}}&lt;/math&gt;, a relation which can be verified with dimensional analysis, by expanding &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}&lt;/math&gt; and C in [[SI base units]], and expanding Fr in Gaussian base units.

It is surprising to think of measuring capacitance in centimetres. One useful example is that a centimetre of capacitance is the capacitance between a sphere of radius 1&amp;nbsp;cm in vacuum and infinity.

Another surprising unit is measuring [[resistivity]] in units of seconds. A physical example is: Take a [[parallel-plate capacitor]], which has a "leaky" dielectric with permittivity 1 but a finite resistivity. After charging it up, the capacitor will discharge itself over time, due to current leaking through the dielectric. If the resistivity of the dielectric is "X" seconds, the half-life of the discharge is ~0.05X seconds.&lt;!-- 0.05 ~ ln(2)/(4pi) --&gt; This result is independent of the size, shape, and charge of the capacitor, and therefore this example illuminates the fundamental connection between resistivity and time units.

===Dimensionally equivalent units===
A number of the units defined by the table have different names but are in fact dimensionally equivalent—i.e., they have the same expression in terms of the base units cm, g, s. (This is analogous to the distinction in SI between [[becquerel]] and [[Hertz|Hz]], or between [[newton metre]] and [[joule]].) The different names help avoid ambiguities and misunderstandings as to what physical quantity is being measured. In particular, ''all'' of the following quantities are dimensionally equivalent in Gaussian units, but they are nevertheless given different unit names as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQMsK5xW1DcC&amp;pg=PA155 |title='&amp;#39;Demystifying Electromagnetic Equations'&amp;#39;|page=155|publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General rules to translate a formula==

Any formula can be converted between Gaussian and SI units by using the symbolic conversion factors from Table 1 above.

For example, the [[Coulomb's law|electric field of a stationary point charge]] has the SI formula
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{\text{SI}} = \frac{q_{\text{SI}}}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is distance, and the "SI" subscripts indicate that the electric field and charge are defined using SI definitions. If we want the formula to instead use the Gaussian definitions of electric field and charge, we look up how these are related using Table 1, which says:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{E}_{\text{G}}}{\mathbf{E}_{\text{SI}}} = \sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}} \quad , \quad \frac{q_{\text{G}}}{q_\text{SI}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}}}&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, after substituting and simplifying, we get the Gaussian-units formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{\text{G}} = \frac{q_{\text{G}}}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
which is the correct Gaussian-units formula, as mentioned in a previous section.

For convenience, the table below has a compilation of the symbolic conversion factors from Table 1. To convert any formula from Gaussian units to SI units using this table, replace each symbol in the Gaussian column by the corresponding expression in the SI column (vice versa to convert the other way). This will reproduce any of the specific formulas given in the list above, such as Maxwell's equations, as well as any other formula not listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Бредов М.М. |author2=Румянцев В.В. |author3=Топтыгин И.Н. | title=Классическая электродинамика| publisher=[[Nauka (publisher)|Nauka]] |year=1985  | chapter=Appendix 5: Units transform (p.385)}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some examples of how to use this table, see:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/g4cnn/units/units.htm Units in Electricity and Magnetism].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2931">'''Graphesthesia''' is the ability to recognize writing on the skin purely by the sensation of [[touch]]. Its name derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''graphē'' ("writing") and ''aisthēsis'' ("perception").  Graphesthesia tests combined cortical sensation; therefore, it is necessary that primary sensation be intact.&lt;ref name="Blumenfeld"&gt;Blumenfeld, H. (2010). 'Neuroanatomy Through Clinical Cases' (2nd Edition ed.). Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

During medical or [[neurological examination]] graphesthesia is tested in order to test for certain neurological conditions such as; [[lesions]] in [[brainstem]], [[spinal cord]], [[sensory cortex]] or [[thalamus]].  An examiner writes single numbers or simple letters on the skin (usually the palm) with something that will provide a clear stimulus, such as a broken tongue depressor, pen cap etc.   Prior to the start of testing, an agreement may be reached between the examiner and the patient as to the orientation of the letters, although this is often unnecessary, since orientation and size of the figures are rarely an issue. The crucial aspect of testing graphesthesia, as with any sensory testing, is to establish that the patient understands the test, hence the test is commenced, in the hemiplegic patient, on the normal, intact hand. This also allows the examiner to establish the patient's numeracy, since semi-numerate patients may have difficulties performing the task.

The patient provides a verbal response identifying the figure that was drawn.  If the patient has a speech or language impairment that prevents them from verbalizing an answer, the answer can be selected from a series of images shown to them.&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;O'Sullivan, S. B., &amp; Schmitz, T. J. (2007). 'Physical Rehabilitation' (5th Edition ed.). Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Loss of graphesthesia indicates either parietal lobe damage on the side opposite the hand tested or damage to the [[Posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway|dorsal columns pathway]] at any point between the tested point and the contralateral parietal lobe. 
The major clinical utility of the test in the 21st century is in the condition, cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration, where, in addition to evidence of basal ganglia dysfunction, the presence of cortical sensory loss is likely to have reasonably high specificity for the diagnosis.

Testing graphesthesia can be substituted for [[stereognosis]] if a patient is unable to grasp an object.&lt;ref name="OS"/&gt;

The '''International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism''' was established by the [[United Nations]] General Assembly in 2017. It designated 21 August as the International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism in order to honor the victims and survivors of terrorism. In 2017 alone, nearly three-quarters of all deaths caused by terrorism were in just five countries: [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Nigeria]], [[Somalia]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/ce2c29cc-764d-46e6-99c3-55e966503679 UN to mark International Day of Remembrance for victims of terror on Tuesday]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a statement by the UN, the day is meant to allow victims of terrorism to have their needs supported and their rights upheld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/events/victimsofterrorismday/index.shtml International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism, 21 August]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lateral violence''' is [[displacement (psychology)|displaced]] violence directed against one's peers rather than adversaries.  This construct is one way of explaining minority-on-minority violence in [[developed nations]].{{uncited|date=October 2018}}  Those experiencing and those committing lateral violence more likely to be involved in crime [[Race and crime in the United States|in the United States]], [[Race and crime in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], and elsewhere.{{uncited|date=October 2018}}  In Australia and Canada, lateral violence is widely seen as an intergenerational learned pattern and major social problem in indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="nwac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwac.ca/sites/default/files/reports/AboriginalLateralViolence%20-%20web%20version.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811190226/http://www.nwac.ca/sites/default/files/reports/AboriginalLateralViolence%20-%20web%20version.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia surveys have reported that up to 95% of Aboriginal youth had witnessed lateral violence in the home, and that 95% of the bullying experienced by Aboriginals was perpetrated by other Aboriginals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/people/bullying-lateral-violence|title=Bullying &amp; lateral violence|first=Jens Korff, Creative|last=Spirits|website=Creative Spirits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Lateral Violence occurs within marginalized groups where members strike out at each other as a result of being oppressed. The oppressed become the oppressors of themselves and each other. Common behaviours that prevent positive change from occurring include gossiping, bullying, finger-pointing, backstabbing and shunning.|Kweykway Consulting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kweykway.ca/lateral-violence-in-first-nations-communities|title=Lateral Violence in First Nations Communities – Kwey Kway Consulting|website=www.kweykway.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Near-synonyms include '''horizontal violence''', '''intra-racial conflict''', and '''internalized colonialism'''

An example of inter-generational trauma would be the Corey and Cody Manyshots case involving two Aboriginal youth kidnapping and sexually assaulting a teen.&lt;ref name="calgarysun.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgarysun.com/2014/11/17/calgary-police-charge-brothers-in-taradale-sex-attack-on-teen|title=Calgary police charge brothers in Taradale sex attack on teen|website=Calgary Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The father of the teens was involved in animal cruelty cases involving a [[Bichon Frise]] and elastic bands. Furthermore, the father threatened to attack reporters at his sons' trials.&lt;ref name="calgarysun.com"/&gt;  Corey Manyshots was on bail for defacing the Dashmesh Cultural Centre, a Sikh temple in [[Calgary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgarysun.com/2014/11/24/calgary-brothers-accused-in-teens-sexual-assault-still-need-lawyers|title=Calgary brothers accused in teen's sexual assault still need lawyers|website=Calgary Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This interpretation through an intergenerational trauma perspective would understand that both Corey and Cody Manyshots were the subject of collective trauma from the colonial injustices passed down from generation to generation and have less of a responsibility for criminal acts and reprehensible behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Bombay, Matheson, Anisman. ''Intergenerational Trauma: Convergence of Multiple Processes among First Nations peoples in Canada''.

'''Lean services''' is the application of the [[lean manufacturing]] concept to service operations. It is distinct in that ''Lean services'' are not concerned with the making of ‘hard’ products.

To date, Lean principles of [[Continuous Improvement Process|Continuous Improvement]] and Respect for People have been applied to all manner of services including call center services, health care,&lt;ref&gt;Ker, J. I., Wang, Y., Hajli, M. N., Song, J., &amp; Ker, C. W. (2014). Deploying lean in healthcare: Evaluating information technology effectiveness in US hospital pharmacies. International Journal of Information Management, 34(4), 556-560.&lt;/ref&gt; higher education, software development, and public and professional services. Conceptually, these implementations follow very similar routes to those in manufacturing settings, and often use some of the same tools and techniques. There are, however, many significant distinctions and the same tools can be applied in different ways.

==Definition of "service"==
"Service" in this context is not limited to the office or administration, but also wider service situations that are not necessarily repetitive, where task time is not applicable, and where task times may be both long and variable. Service in this context could mean anything from a hospital to a university, from an office process to a consultancy, and from a warehouse to field service maintenance. "Service" refers to the service concept or product service bundle, which are all the activities that provide value to the customer along a value stream.

==Aspects of Lean service==
Lean Service has its origin in the [[Toyota Production System]] (see [[Lean manufacturing]]). Lean in the Service sector is subject itself to continuous improvement, and as such there are an increasing number of concepts that may or may not be included as part of Lean Service.

===The service wastes===
The original seven wastes (''[[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]'') were defined by [[Taiichi Ohno]], the father of the [[Toyota Production System]]. These wastes have been often redefined to better fit new organisations, industries, or external pressures.

One redefinition of these wastes for service operations by Bicheno and Holweg (2009) is as follows:

* 1. ''Delay'' on the part of customers waiting for service, for delivery, in queues, for response, not arriving as promised. The customer’s time may seem free to the provider, but when she takes custom elsewhere the pain begins.
* 2. ''Duplication''. Having to re-enter data, repeat details on forms, copy information across, answer queries from several sources within the same organisation.
* 3. ''Unnecessary Movement''. Queuing several times, lack of one-stop, poor ergonomics in the service encounter.
* 4.'' Unclear communication'', and the wastes of seeking clarification, confusion over product or service use, wasting time finding a location that may result in misuse or duplication.
* 5. ''Incorrect inventory''. Being out-of-stock, unable to get exactly what was required, substitute products or services.
* 6. ''An opportunity lost to retain or win customers'', a failure to establish rapport, ignoring customers, unfriendliness, and rudeness.
* 7. ''Errors in the service transaction'', product defects in the product-service bundle, lost or damaged goods.
* 8. ''Service quality errors'', lack of quality in service processes.

===Value Demand and Failure Demand===
One of the central concepts that distinguishes lean services from lean manufacturing is the distinction between ''Value Demand'' and ''Failure Demand'' (Seddon, 2003).

''Value Demand'' is the demand for service from customers, while Failure Demand is the demand caused by a failure to do something right for the customer. Failure demand is thus demand that only exists because initial demand was not satisfied properly. For example, a large proportion of calls that call centers receive are either chasing down enquiries made earlier, or to correct earlier work that was not done properly. As one of the key aims of "Lean" is to eliminate waste, Failure Demand represents an obvious type of waste in service organizations.

[[Failure demand]] can also be defined as "the delivery or production of products and services downstream as a result of defects in the system upstream."(Shillingburg, 2011)  This would include administrative rework, audits, inspections and enquires.  This non value-added work can account for the majority of administrative work performed.

By treating failure and value demand alike in statistical analysis, failure demand can give the quite false impression of greater productivity. This merely reinforces the need to look at what is really going on, and ask why the service is being rendered.

===Lean Six Sigma===
In recent years, some practitioners have combined Lean and Six Sigma principles to yield a methodology commonly known as [[Lean Six Sigma]]. One of the earliest adopters of this is [[Honeywell]], which calls its program [[Honeywell#Six Sigma Plus|Six Sigma Plus]]. Like some other practitioners, GE has developed a very rigorous Lean Six Sigma training program in which certain employees are chosen to become certified in this area.

==Criticisms of Lean service==

More recently it is being argued that the application of lean manufacturing tools and techniques have seriously damaged the service organizations that Lean has been applied to. [[John Seddon]] (visiting professor Sheffield University) has been especially vocal and critical of lean in his paper "Rethinking Lean Service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rethinking Lean Service|date=July 2009|first1=John|last1=Seldon|first2=Brendan|last2=O'Donovan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of Lean Tools and techniques has led to serious problems in many service organisations, including Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and even Starbucks.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===5S in the office===
[[5S (methodology)|5S]] has been widely and successfully applied in office environments, however this has received some criticism for resulting in workplaces that are too clinical or impersonal.

===Application of Lean in creative environments===
Critics of Lean Service have suggested that problems arise when companies try to apply "Lean principles" to areas where creativity, ability to react to rapid external changes, need to spend an extensive amount of time to convince external parties (typically lobbying) or ability to successfully negotiate are needed; and that the downsides of Lean are reduced / eliminated creativity and ability to cope with the unexpected.

Proponents of Lean Service, however, suggest that these criticisms are a response to Lean implementations that have failed to properly understand Lean as a holistic, action based management and implementation system to provide enhanced customer value, a "Tools" mentality instead of an outcomes orientation and an inadequate knowledge of how to utilize and adapt Lean Manufacturing methods to the service environment.

This triple jump of environmental, social and economical orientation makes MFM a tool of high importance in the field of [[Sustainable development|sustainable development (SD)]] and [[circular economy]] (CE). 
Seen historically, material flow management is a relatively new tool that can be understood as an implementation-orientated advancement of the methodology of [[Material flow analysis|material flow analysis (MFA)]]. MFM was established as a policy tool after the UN conference in [[Rio de Janeiro]] 1992. The German "Bundestag" outlined the targets and specific goals of MFM in a special report by an Enquete Commission.

'''Mathematical diagrams''' are [[diagram]]s in the field of [[mathematics]], and diagrams using mathematics such as [[chart]]s and [[graph of a function|graphs]], that are mainly designed to convey mathematical relationships, for example, comparisons over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=2993&amp;topic=all Working with diagrams] at LearningSpace.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific types of mathematical diagrams ==

=== Argand diagram ===
[[Image:Complex number illustration.svg|thumb|120px|Argand diagram.]]
A [[complex number]] can be visually represented as a pair of numbers forming a vector on a diagram called an [[Argand diagram]]
The [[complex plane]] is sometimes called the ''Argand plane'' because it is used in ''Argand diagrams''. These are named after [[Jean-Robert Argand]] (1768–1822), although they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and mathematician [[Caspar Wessel]] (1745–1818).&lt;ref&gt;Wessel's memoir was presented to the Danish Academy in 1797; Argand's paper was published in 1806.&lt;br/&gt;({{cite book |first1=Edmund Taylor |last1=Whittaker |first2=G.N. |last2=Watson |title=A Course of Modern Analysis: An Introduction to the General Theory of Infinite Processes and of Analytic Functions, with an Account of the Principal Transcendental Functions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULVdGZmi9VcC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=1927 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-58807-2 |page=9}})&lt;/ref&gt; Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[root of a function|zeroes]] of a [[mathematical function|function]] in the complex plane.

The concept of the complex plane allows a [[geometric]] interpretation of complex numbers. Under [[addition]], they add like [[vector (spatial)|vector]]s. The [[multiplication]] of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in [[polar coordinates]] — the magnitude or ''modulus'' of the product is the product of the two [[absolute value]]s, or moduli, and the angle or ''argument'' of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.

[[Image:Butterfly-FFT.png|thumb|120px|left|Butterfly diagram]]

=== Butterfly diagram ===
In the context of [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms, a [[Butterfly diagram|butterfly]] is a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller [[discrete Fourier transform]]s (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms). The name "butterfly" comes from the shape of the data-flow diagram in the radix-2 case, as described below. The same structure can also be found in the [[Viterbi algorithm]], used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.

The [[butterfly diagram]] show a data-flow diagram connecting the inputs ''x'' (left) to the outputs ''y'' that depend on them (right) for a "butterfly" step of a radix-2 [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]]. This diagram resembles a [[butterfly]] as in the [[morpho|morpho butterfly]] shown for comparison), hence the name.

[[Image:5 lemma.svg|thumb|300px|A commutative diagram depicting the [[five lemma]]]]

=== Commutative diagram ===
{{Main|Commutative diagram}}

In mathematics, and especially in [[category theory]], a commutative diagram is a diagram of [[Object (category theory)|objects]], also known as vertices, and [[morphism]]s, also known as arrows or edges, such that when selecting two objects any directed path through the diagram leads to the same result by composition.

Commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in algebra.

[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|left|120px|Hasse diagram.]]

=== Hasse diagrams ===
A [[Hasse diagram]] is a simple picture of a finite [[partially ordered set]], forming a [[Graph drawing|drawing]] of the partial order's [[transitive reduction]]. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from ''x'' to ''y'' precisely when ''x'' &lt; ''y'' and there is no ''z'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''. In this case, we say y [[covering relation|covers]] x, or y is an immediate successor of x. In a Hasse diagram, it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.

[[Image:TrefoilKnot 01.svg|right|thumb|120px|Knot diagram.]]

=== Knot diagrams ===
In [[Knot theory]] a useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane—;think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small perturbation in the choice of projection will ensure that it is [[Injective function|one-to-one]] except at the double points, called ''crossings'', where the "shadow" of the knot crosses itself once transversely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Rolfsen |title=Knots and links |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFLvAAAAMAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Publish or Perish |isbn=978-0-914098-16-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each crossing we must indicate which section is "over" and which is "under", so as to be able to recreate the original knot. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. If by following the diagram the knot alternately crosses itself "over" and "under", then the diagram represents a particularly well-studied class of knot, [[alternating knot]]s.

[[Image:Venn diagram cmyk.svg|thumb|120px|right|Venn diagram.]]

=== Venn diagram ===
A [[Venn diagram]] is a representation of mathematical sets: a mathematical diagram representing sets as circles, with their relationships to each other expressed through their overlapping positions, so that all possible relationships between the sets are shown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861733754/venn_diagram.html "Venn diagram"], Encarta World English Dictionary, North American Edition 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5ZATal Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is notnull.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Irving Lewis]] (1918). [https://archive.org/details/asurveyofsymboli00lewiuoft ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'']. Republished in part by Dover in 1960. p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Voronoi centerlines skeleton.gif|left|thumb|120px|Voronoi centerlines.]]

=== Voronoi diagram ===
A [[Voronoi diagram]] is a special kind of decomposition of a [[metric space]] determined by distances to a specified discrete set of objects in the space, e.g., by a [[discrete set]] of points. This diagram is named after [[Georgy Voronoi]], also called a Voronoi [[tessellation]], a Voronoi decomposition, or a Dirichlet tessellation after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

In the simplest case, we are given a set of points S in the plane, which are the Voronoi sites. Each site s has a Voronoi cell V(s) consisting of all points closer to s than to any other site. The segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to two sites. The Voronoi nodes are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites

[[Image:Wallpaper group diagram p4m square.svg|thumb|120px|right|Wallpaper group diagram.]]

=== Wallpaper group diagrams ===
A [[wallpaper group]] or ''plane symmetry group'' or ''plane crystallographic group'' is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. There are 17 possible distinct [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

Wallpaper groups are two-dimensional [[symmetry groups]], intermediate in complexity between the simpler [[frieze group]]s and the three-dimensional [[crystallographic group]]s, also called [[space group]]s. Wallpaper groups categorize patterns by their symmetries. Subtle differences may place similar patterns in different groups, while patterns which are very different in style, color, scale or orientation may belong to the same group.

=== Young diagram ===
A ''Young diagram'' or [[Young tableau]], also called [[Ferrers diagram]], is a finite collection of boxes, or cells, arranged in left-justified rows, with the row sizes weakly decreasing (each row has the same or shorter length than its predecessor). 
[[Image:Young diagram for 541 partition.svg|thumb|120px|left|Young diagram.]]
Listing the number of boxes in each row gives a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of a positive integer ''n'', the total number of boxes of the diagram. The Young diagram is said to be of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and it carries the same information as that partition. Listing the number of boxes in each column gives another partition, the '''conjugate''' or ''transpose'' partition of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;; one obtains a Young diagram of that shape by reflecting the original diagram along its main diagonal.

Young tableaux were introduced by [[Alfred Young]], a [[mathematician]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], in 1900. They were then applied to the study of symmetric group by [[Georg Frobenius]] in 1903. Their theory was further developed by many mathematicians.

'''''Meaning and Necessity: A Study in Semantics and Modal Logic''''' is a 1947 book about [[logic]] by the philosopher [[Rudolf Carnap]].

==Background==
''Meaning and Necessity'' was the culmination of Carnap's concern with the [[semantics]] of natural and [[formal language]]s, which developed subsequent to his publication of ''The Logical Syntax of Language'' in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low05|Lowe 2005]]. pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Carnap attempts to develop a new method for analyzing the meanings of linguistic expressions as well as to lay a semantic foundation for modal logic. Carnap maintains that his new method consists in doing away with the traditional assumption that linguistic expressions name concrete or abstract entities and in replacing it with the ascription to them of intensions and extensions. He states that linguistic expressions designate their intensions and extensions: every designation refers to both an intension and an extension.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aye82|Ayer 1982]]. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intensional entities to which individual constants or descriptions, predicates, and declarative sentences are respectively said to refer are individual concepts, properties and propositions, the corresponding extensions being individuals, classes and truth-values. Carnap insists that intensions, including individual concepts, are objectively real, not mental concepts. However, he rejects the charge of hypostatization: individual concepts and properties and propositions must not be considered as things, but this does not prevent them from being genuine objective entities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aye82|Ayer 1982]]. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnap's method is an alternative to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s theory of sense and reference, which he refers to as the "method of extension and intension". Carnap holds that his method provides the most economical account of the logical behavior of expressions in modal contexts - for instance, the expressions '9' and '7' in the sentence '9 is necessarily greater than 7.' His criticism of Frege involves a rejection of the traditional category of names, conceived as a class of expressions each of which stands for a unique thing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low05|Lowe 2005]]. pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Meaning and Necessity'' was influential, and laid the foundations of much subsequent work in the semantics of [[modal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low05|Lowe 2005]]. pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is seen by the British philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]] as the most important of Carnap's three books on semantics, the other two being ''Introduction to Semantics'' (1942) and ''Formalization of Logic'' (1943). Ayer criticizes the book, on the grounds that since, according to Carnap, linguistic expressions designate their intensions and extensions, it is not clear that the difference between Carnap's view and what Carnap calls the traditional assumption that linguistic expressions name concrete or abstract entities is more than nominal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aye82|Ayer 1982]]. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

It thus stands opposed to the theory of [[direct reference]]. [[Gottlob Frege]] is a well-known advocate of mediated reference theories.&lt;ref name=Berezowski/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Fitch, ''Naming and Believing'', Springer, 2012, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar theories were widely held in the middle of the twentieth century by philosophers such as [[Peter Strawson]] and [[John Searle]].

Mediated reference theories are contrasted with [[Direct reference theory|theories of direct reference]].

[[Saul Kripke]], a proponent of direct reference theory, in his ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' dubbed mediated reference theory the '''Frege–Russell view'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; and criticized it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Kripke]], ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1972. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent scholarship refuted the claim that [[Bertrand Russell]]'s views on reference theory were the same as Frege's, since Russell was also a proponent of direct reference theory.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Wettstein, "Frege-Russell Semantics?", ''Dialectica'' '''44'''(1/2), 1990, pp. 113–135, esp. 115: "Russell maintains that when one is acquainted with something, say, a present sense datum or oneself, one can refer to it without the mediation of anything like a Fregean sense. One can refer to it, as we might say, ''directly''."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Steven Harper''' (March 18, 1938 &amp;ndash; May 7, 2016) was an American [[poet]] and English professor at [[Brown University]], who was the [[Poet Laureate]] of [[Rhode Island]] from 1988 to 1993.  His poetry was influenced by [[jazz]] and [[history]].&lt;ref name="msaap"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/277 | title=Michael S. Harper | publisher=Academy of American poets | accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the influences which shaped his writing, he said that the most important lesson he learned from musicians was phrasing, the authenticity of phrasing, and the transcendence and spiritual mastery. He published ten books of poetry, two of which—''Dear John, Dear Coltrane'' (1970) and ''Images of Kin'' (1977)—were nominated for the [[National Book Award]]. Many of his poems have been included as examples of [[African-American literature]] and [[jazz poetry]] in various anthologies.

Harper was born in Brooklyn as the first of three children&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=2551758 | title=Walter Warren Harper, obituary | work=Los Angeles Times | date=August 26, 2004 | accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; into a lower-middle-class black family. His maternal grandfather, Roland Johnson, was a well-respected Canadian physician and was the delivery doctor for Harper at their home.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6754&amp;context=iowareview|title=Office Hours: A Memoir and an Interview with Michael S. Harper|last=Treseler|first=Heather|date=2009|work=The Iowa Review|via=Iowa Research Online|volume=39|issue=3|&lt;!--archive-url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6754&amp;conia=text=iowareview|archive-date=|dead-url=|--&gt;access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the primary influence in his early decision to pursue pre-med at Los Angeles City College.

His father Walter (who went by his middle name, Warren) was the originator of "overnight" mail and worked as a post office supervisor. His mother Katherine Louise, née Johnson was a medical secretary. Of his parents Harper once remarked, "My parents did not have much money, but they had a great record collection."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.msu.idm.oclc.org/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE%7CA393210803&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=moreheadstu&amp;it=r&amp;p=LitRC&amp;sw=w#|title=Into the underworld with Michael S. Harper|last=Makari|first=George|date=|website=|work=The Worcester Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would of course later influence his work, blending poetry with jazz.

His younger brother Jonathan Paul was born in 1941 and died in a motorcycle accident in 1977. His younger sister, Katherine Winifred, was born in 1943. They grew up in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]], a north-central portion of Brooklyn, until his family moved in 1951 to their [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] in Los Angeles, where he attended [[Dorsey High School]].&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt; As a teenager, Harper was eager to get out of his father's house and into his own, marking his desire to work, create and learn on his own terms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1955, he attended [[Los Angeles City College]], initially enrolling in pre-med courses and later literature, graduating in 1959 with an associate of arts degree. At the Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences (now [[California State University, Los Angeles]], he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in English studies in 1961.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; While there he worked part-time in the post office and called this experience his "real education".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He joined the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]], where he largely resisted the movement of writing in syllabics, which he called "incredibly mechanical". During his time in Iowa City Harper said, "Most of the things I learned…had nothing to do with the Workshop"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; given the uprising of the Civil Rights Movement at that time. He earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="msaap" /&gt;

==Career==
He taught English at [[Contra Costa College]] in San Pablo, California and his poems appeared in small magazines. In 1968, he became poet in residence at [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] and taught at [[Reed College]] both in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Later that year, he entered a manuscript in the U.S. Poetry Prize Competition, submitted by Gwendolyn Brooks. Although he did not win, Brooks calls his work her “clear winner.” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harper said Brooks gave him his career. With Brooks behind him, his book was published by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and reviewed in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1970 with a cover essay by [[Ralph Ellison]]. In 1996 Brooks presented Harper with the George Kent Poetry Award for Honorable Amendments.

In 1970, he taught at [[California State University|California State College]] in [[Hayward, California]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He joined the English faculty at [[Brown University]], where he taught literature courses and poetry workshops to undergraduates. Students referred to him as "MSH", "the Chief", and "the Big Man".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He remained there until retiring in December 2013&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; and was the longest serving professor of English and Literary Arts at that institution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://brown.edu/academics/literary-arts/about/faculty/michael-harper/michael-harper Michael S. Harper, University Professor, Brown University.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2016}}

In 1993, [[Nathan Scott (composer)|Nathan A. Scott]] wrote in the ''Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' that "Harper has created a body of work which, though it has won much respect and admiration, deserves to be far more widely known than it is."&lt;ref name="naspe"&gt;{{cite web | title=Afro-American Poetry | publisher=Princeton University Press and MJF Books | work=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics | date=1993 | author=Nathan A. Scott Jr | editor1=Preminger, Alex|editor2=T. V. F. Brogan}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 25}}

Shortly after his retirement from Brown, former student George Makari remarked that Harper "deeply entered our personal lives, challenged us to rethink who we thought we were, [and] asked us to leave behind childhood and enter a kind of creative crisis."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Harper was married and had a daughter, Rachel, who is also a [http://rachelmharper.com writer], and two sons, Roland and Patrice. He later divorced.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He lived in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] until his death on May 7, 2016.&lt;ref name="msaap"/&gt;
Harper had two children who died at birth, which inspired several of his early poems, including the famous "Nightmare Begins Responsibility". .&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/arts/michael-s-harper-poet-with-a-jazz-pulse-dies-at-78.html?_r=1 |title=Michael S.

==Work==
Harper wrote about important and historically influential African-Americans, including [[Jackie Robinson]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] and [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. He said in a 2000 interview with [[Terry Gross]], that the most important thing he learned from musicians was phrasing, the authenticity of phrasing, and the transcendence and spiritual mastery.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=477927149 | title=Remembering Michael S. Harper, A Poet With An Ear For Jazz | publisher=NPR | date=May 13, 2016| people=David Bianculli, Terry Gross | medium=radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harper often wrote about his wife, Shirley (commonly referred to as "Shirl"), their children, and  their ancestors, as well as friends and various black historical and cultural figures.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}}  On poetry, Harper stated: "A good poem is a true poem. Often it cannot be distilled into a slogan, or an easy thesis."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This relates to much of his work, most notably "Blue Ruth: America" (1971) in which the nation is portrayed in a hospital bed. In a 2009 interview, he commented on the need for public rhetoric, noting that people had trouble with President Barack Obama because he spoke about consequential things when most were used to "sound bites".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mindfulness-based stress reduction''' ('''MBSR''') is a program that incorporates [[mindfulness]] to assist people with pain and a range of conditions and life issues that were initially difficult to treat in a hospital setting. Developed at the [[University of Massachusetts]] [[UMass Memorial Health Care|Medical Center]] in the 1970s by Professor [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]], MBSR uses a combination of mindfulness [[meditation]], body awareness, and [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]] to help people become more mindful.&lt;ref name="Time2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pickert K |title=The art of being mindful.

== History ==
In 1979 Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Clinic at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School|University of Massachusetts Medical Center]], and nearly twenty years later the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both these institutions supported the successful growth and implementation of MBSR into hospitals worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2015, MBSR is practiced as a complementary medicine, commonly in the field of oncology;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in the same year, 2015, close to 80% of medical schools are reported&lt;ref name="Buchholz"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Laura Buchholz|date=Oct 2015|title=Exploring the Promise of Mindfulness as Medicine|journal=JAMA|volume=314|issue=13|pages=1327–1329|doi=10.1001/jama.2015.7023|pmid=26441167}}&lt;/ref&gt; to offer some element of mindfulness training and research and education centers dedicated to mindfulness have proliferated.

==Overview==
MBSR has been described as "a group program that focuses upon the progressive acquisition of mindful awareness, of mindfulness".&lt;ref name="MBSR 2003 meta-analysis"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.2042-7166.2003.tb04008.x|title=Mindfulness-based stress reduction and health benefits: A meta-analysis|year=2010|last1=Grossman|first1=P|last2=Niemann|first2=L|last3=Schmidt|first3=S|last4=Walach|first4=H|journal=Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies|volume=8|issue=4|pages=500}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MBSR program is an eight-week workshop taught by certified trainers that entails weekly group meetings (two-hour classes) and a one-day retreat (six-hour mindfulness practice) between sessions six and seven, homework (45 minutes daily), and instruction in three formal techniques: mindfulness meditation, body scanning and simple yoga postures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Body scanning is the first prolonged formal mindfulness technique taught during the first four weeks of the workshop, and entails quietly lying on one's back and focusing one's attention on various regions of the body, starting with the toes and moving up slowly to the top of the head.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Ospina MB, Bond K, Karkhaneh M, etal |title=Meditation practices for health: state of the research |journal=Evid Rep Technol Assess (Full Rep) |volume=|issue=155 |pages=1–263|date=June 2007 |pmid=17764203 |pmc=4780968}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MBSR is based on the following tenets: non-judging, non-striving, acceptance, letting go, beginner’s mind, patience, trust, and non-centering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frewen PA, Evans EM, Maraj N, Dozois DJ, Partridge K |title=Letting go: Mindfulness and negative automatic thinking |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |volume=32 |pages=758–774 |date=2008 |doi=10.1007/s10608-007-9142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kabat-Zinn, the basis of MBSR is mindfulness, which he defined as "moment-to-moment, non-judgmental awareness."&lt;ref name=vid&gt;{{YouTube|id=rSU8ftmmhmw|title=Mindfulness Stress Reduction And Healing}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the program, participants are asked to focus on informal practice as well by incorporating mindfulness into their daily routines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Focusing on the present is thought to heighten sensitivity to the environment and one’s own reactions to it, consequently enhancing self-management and coping. It also provides an outlet from ruminating on the past or worrying about the future, breaking the cycle of these maladaptive cognitive processes.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Steven C.|last2=Villatte|first2=Matthieu|last3=Levin|first3=Michael|last4=Hildebrandt|first4=Mikaela|date=2011-01-01|title=Open, Aware, and Active: Contextual Approaches as an Emerging Trend in the Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104449|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=141–168|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104449|pmid=21219193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific evidence of the debilitating effects of stress on human body and its evolutionary origins were pinpointed by the ground-breaking work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sapolsky|first=Robert|date=1982|title=The endocrine stress-response and social status in the wild baboon|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0018506X82900277|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=16|pages=279–292|via=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/0018-506X(82)90027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Robert Sapolsky]], and explored for lay readers in the book "'''''[[Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers]]'''''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers|last=Sapolsky|first=Robert|publisher=Holt paperbacks|year=2004|isbn=978-0805073690|location=USA|pages=560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sapolsky's work consequently promotes mindfulness-based techniques for a better lifestyle and healthy stress management.

== Extent of practice ==
According to a 2014 article in ''Time'' magazine, mindfulness meditation is becoming popular among people who would not normally consider meditation.&lt;ref name="Time2014"/&gt;  The curriculum started by Kabat-Zinn at University of Massachusetts Medical Center has produced nearly 1,000 
certified MBSR instructors who are in nearly every state in the US and more than 30 countries.  Corporations such as [[General Mills]] have made it available to their employees or set aside rooms for meditation. Democratic Congressman [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]] published a book in 2012 titled ''A Mindful Nation'' and he has helped organize regular group meditation periods on Capitol Hill.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Warren |last=Rojas |title=A Meditation on the Quiet Time Caucus |publisher=Roll Call |date=January 8, 2014 |url=http://hoh.rollcall.com/a-meditation-on-the-quiet-time-caucus/ |accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of practice ==
Mindfulness-based stress reduction classes and programs are offered by various facilities including hospitals, retreat centers, and various yoga facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elcaminohospital.org/stay-healthy/class/mindfulness-based-stress-reduction-program-free-introductory-session|title=Mindfulness based stress reduction at El Camino Hospital, Mountain View, CA (accessed on Nov, 2017).|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the programs focus on teaching,
* mind and body awareness to reduce the physiological effects of stress, pain or illness
* non-judgemental awareness in daily life
* promote serenity and clarity in each moment
* to experience more joyful life and access inner resources for healing and stress management
* [[progressive muscle relaxation]] 
* [[Mindfulness|mindfulness meditation]]

== Evaluation of effectiveness ==
Mindfulness-based approaches have been tested for a range of health problems including anxiety disorder, mood disorder, substance abuse disorder, eating disorders, chronic pain, ADHD, insomnia, coping with medical conditions, with many populations including children, adolescents, parents, teachers, therapists, and physicians.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; As a major subject of increasing research interest, 52 papers were published in 2003, rising to 477 by 2012.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt; Nearly 100 [[randomized controlled trial]]s had been published by early 2014.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2014&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Hurley |title=Breathing In vs. Spacing Out |date=January 14, 2014 |publisher=New York Times Magazine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/magazine/breathing-in-vs-spacing-out.html |accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests mindfulness training improves focus, attention, and ability to work under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 1361002 | pmid=16272874 | volume=16 | title=Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness | date=November 2005 | author=Lazar SW, Kerr CE, Wasserman RH, ''et al.'' | journal=NeuroReport | pages=1893–7 | doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000186598.66243.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2008914,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/CABN.7.2.109 | volume=7 | title=Mindfulness training modifies subsystems of attention | journal=Cognitive, Affective, &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience | pages=109–119 | year=2007 | author=Krompinger J., Baime M.

A 2013 statement from the [[American Heart Association]] on alternative approaches to lowering [[blood pressure]] concluded that MBSR was not recommended in clinical practice to lower blood pressure.&lt;ref name="aha"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brook |first=Robert D |author2=Lawrence J.

"'''Mississippi Goddam'''" is a song written and performed by American singer and pianist [[Nina Simone]], who later announced the anthem to be her "first civil rights song"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldstein|first=Ruth|authorlink=Ruth Feldstein|date=March 1, 2005|title="I Don't Trust You Anymore": Nina Simone, Culture, and Black Activism in the 1960s|url=|journal=Journal of American History|volume=|pages=1349|via=ignacio}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was released on her album ''[[Nina Simone in Concert]]'' in 1964. The album was based on recordings of three concerts she gave at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1964. The album was her first release for the Dutch label [[Philips Records]] and is indicative of the more political turn her recorded music took during this period.   

Simone composed "Mississippi Goddam" in less than an hour. Together with "[[Four Women (song)|Four Women]]" and "[[To Be Young, Gifted and Black]]", it is one of her most famous [[protest song]]s and self-written compositions.

==Interpretation==
The song captures Simone's response to the murder of [[Medgar Evers]] in Mississippi; and the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], killing four black children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Nina Simone's Time Is Now, Again|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/movies/nina-simones-time-is-now-again.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = June 19, 2015|access-date = 2015-07-05|issn = 0362-4331|first = Salamishah|last = Tillet}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the recording she cynically announces the song as "a [[show tune]], but the show hasn't been written for it yet." The song begins jauntily, with a show tune feel, but demonstrates its political focus early on with its refrain "Alabama's got me so upset, Tennessee's made me lose my rest, and everybody knows about Mississippi ''goddam.''" In the song she says: "Keep on sayin' 'go slow'...to do things gradually would bring more tragedy. Why don't you see it? Why don't you feel it? I don't know, I don't know. You don't have to live next to me, just give me my equality!''
"

== Reception ==
Simone first performed the song at the [[The Village Gate|Village Gate]] nightclub in [[Greenwich Village]], and shortly thereafter in March 1964 at Carnegie Hall, in front of a mostly white audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A raised voice: How Nina Simone turned the movement into music|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/raised-voice|website = The New Yorker|accessdate =July 5, 2015|date =August 11, 2014|last = Pierpont|first = Claudia Roth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carnegie Hall recording was subsequently released as a single and became an anthem during the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nina Simone Reveals 'Mississippi Goddam' Song 'Hurt My Career'|work=Jet|date=March 24, 1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22mississippi+goddam%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o_kDT6rhKIivgweo5_GfAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mississippi%20goddam%22&amp;f=false|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mississippi Goddam" was banned in several Southern states, ostensibly because of the word "goddam" in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2010/03/mississippi-goddam-nina-simone |title=Top 20 Political Songs: Mississippi Goddam – Nina Simone – 1964 |date=March 25, 2010 |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |first=Ian K. |last=Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boxes of promotional singles sent to radio stations around the country were returned with each record cracked in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How the Civil-Rights Era Made and Broke Nina Simone|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/nina-simone-and-mississippi-goddam/396923/|accessdate =July 5, 2015|date =June 27, 2015|website = The Atlantic|last = Chandler|first = Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simone performed the song in front of 10,000 people at the end of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] when she and other black activists, including [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and [[Harry Belafonte]] crossed police lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Almost Forgotten Selma March|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/20/the-forgotten-second-selma-march.html|website = The Daily Beast|date = March 20, 2015|accessdate =July 5, 2015|first = Gary|last = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2946">A '''moral imperative''' is a strongly-felt principle that compels that person to act. It is a kind of [[categorical imperative]], as defined by [[Immanuel Kant]].  Kant took the imperative to be a dictate of [[pure reason]], in its practical aspect. Not following the moral law was seen to be self-defeating and thus contrary to reason.  Later thinkers took the imperative to originate in conscience, as the divine voice speaking through the human spirit.  The dictates of conscience are simply right and often resist further justification.  Looked at another way, the experience of conscience is the basic experience of encountering the right.

An example of not following a moral imperative is making a promise that you do not intend to keep in order to get something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kant's Moral Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Economic Moral imperative ==
[[Toby Ord]] Explores a moral imperative driven by a utilitarian view in relation to  economics and global health. A hypothetical example he gives is that a group has $40,000 dollars to spend on blindness. The money could be spent to provide one U.S. person with a seeing eye dog and training or could be used to reverse the effects of 2,000 cases of trachoma in Africa through surgery. The utilitarian answer would be to help more people.

Toby also provides some real-world examples. Some real-world examples provide data on the cost to prevent or treat AIDS. Analyzing the cost-effectiveness of these methods of treatment and prevention is a moral imperative because the most effective use of funds can save more lives.&lt;ref name=toby&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ord|first1=Toby|title=The moral imperative towards cost-effectiveness|url=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/moral_imperative.pdf|website=www.givingwhatwecan.org|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Locke]] and [[José Ángel Gurría|Angel Gurria]] stated cases for economic moral imperatives related to corruption and anti-bribery laws. Water provides 40 percent of the world's food requirement and in developing countries there can be a 30 percent premium on water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Gary Locke|author2=Angel Gurría|title=A Global Economic and Moral Imperative|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sec-gary-locke/a-global-economic-and-mor_b_388009.html|website=www.huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=6 February 2015|date=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Thomas Pogge]] argues that this corruption is strongly encouraged by the existing international rules as the rulers of these countries have much to gain from these larger countries and corporations.

'''Neurocognitive''' functions are [[cognitive function]]s closely linked to the function of particular areas, [[neural pathway]]s, or [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] networks in the [[brain]] substrate layers of neurological matrix at the cellular molecular level. Therefore, their understanding is closely linked to the practice of [[neuropsychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], two disciplines that broadly seek to understand how the structure and function of the brain relate to cognition and behaviour.

A '''neurocognitive deficit''' is a reduction or impairment of cognitive function in one of these areas, but particularly when physical changes can be seen to have occurred in the brain, such as after [[neurological illness]], [[mental illness]], [[medication|drug]] use, or [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blazer|first1=Dan|title=Commentary: Neurocognitive Disorders in DSM-5|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=170|issue=6|pages=585–587|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13020179|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13020179|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clinical neuropsychologist may specialise in using [[neuropsychological test]]s to detect and understand such deficits, and may be involved in the [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] of an affected person. The discipline that studies neurocognitive deficits to infer normal psychological function is called [[cognitive neuropsychology]].

"'''Ought implies can'''" is an ethical formula ascribed to [[Immanuel Kant]] that claims an agent, if morally obliged to perform a certain action, must logically be able to perform it: {{quote|For if the moral law commands that we ought to be better human beings now, it inescapably follows that we must be capable of being better human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason''. 6:50. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|The action to which the "ought" applies must indeed be possible under natural conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason''. A548/B576. p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant believed this principle was a [[Categorical imperative#Freedom and autonomy|categorical freedom]], bound only by the [[free will]] as opposed to the [[David Hume|Humean]] hypothetical freedom ("Free to do otherwise if I had so chosen").&lt;ref&gt;"Ought implies can". The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy. Bunnin, Nicholas and Yu, Jiyuan (eds). Blackwell Publishing. 2004. Blackwell Reference Online. 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ways of deriving the formula—for example, the argument that it is wrong to blame people for things that they cannot control (essentially phrasing the formula as the contrapositive "'cannot' implies 'has no duty to'").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert|last=Stern|title=Does 'Ought' Imply 'Can'? And Did Kant Think It Does?|journal=[[Utilitas]]|volume=16|issue=1|pages=42–61|year=2004|doi=10.1017/S0953820803001055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petro-sexual politics''' is a lens used to better understand the relationships between [[petroleum]] and gender violence and the role [[colonial powers]] possess.  The underlying theme of petro-sexual politics is that gender violence is part of a larger [[political economy]] of violence.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turcotte|first=Heather|title=Contextualizing petro-sexual politics|journal=Alternatives: Global, Local, Political|date=June 2011|volume=3|issue=36|pages=200–220|doi=10.1177/0304375411418597}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Petro-sexual politics can yield new methods of theorizing [[global politics]],&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turcotte|first=Heather|title=Petro-sexual politics: global oil, legitimate violence and transnational justice|journal=Doctoral Dissertation|date=June 2008|pages=1–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as explained here for the [[Nigeria]]n case of the "[[natural resource curse]]". 
{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}

==Introduction==
[[File:Location Nigeria AU Africa.svg|thumbnail|Location of Nigeria (dark blue)]]

Typically petro-violence is lumped together with the term [[ethnic conflict]].  These conflicts have deep colonial roots driving them.  These colonial powers label conflicts with terms such as "[[terrorist activity]]" or "[[gang violence]]" in order to retain colonial power and maintain global [[hierarchies]] and inequality within a region.  As colonial powers control [[local politics]], occurrences of [[domestic violence]] and other forms of gender violence can be observed.  A Western view of domestic violence skews the ability of the population to see that this domestic violence is not simply occurring at the personal level.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011 /&gt;   
According to Turcotte, there is a common ground between [[petroleum]] production and gender-[[sexual violence]].&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt; These factors have been used as machines of war and the framework for [[nation building]].  Justification of sexual violence in times of war allows for the mutual existence of the [[Sovereign state|state]] and petroleum industry.  The state's growth is fueled solely by the growth of the [[petroleum industry]] in the region, thus leading to the existence of petro-sexual politics.

==Niger Delta==

[[Transnational feminism|Transnational]] and [[African feminism]] argues that the [[nation-state]] relies upon [[capitalist]] and colonial violence.&lt;ref name=Mudimbe&gt;{{cite book|last=Mudimbe|first=V|title=The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-20468-4|pages=1–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The production of petroleum in the [[Niger Delta]] is a direct result of colonial endeavors.  This colonization has directly imposed social arrangements and altered the pre-colonial population, creating a new population under colonial-imperial regulation.&lt;ref name=Mudimbe /&gt; According to Turcotte, gender violence, a precursor to [[colonization]], was vital to colonization itself.  The United Kingdom, controlling oil production in the area, was able to impose imperial rule onto the colony.  Once [[Nigeria]] gained its independence in 1960, colonial ideals were still held in place.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011 /&gt;

===Biafran War===
{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}

While the Nigerian Civil War (also known as the Biafran War) is often thought of as a [[civil war]], the colonial roots that caused much of the tension leading to the conflict cannot be ignored.  Scholars have suggested that this conflict illustrates the link between gender violence and petroleum. Emecheta depicts a war in which sexual violence was used as a tactic of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emecheta|first=Buchi|title=Destination Biafra|year=1988|publisher=Heinemann|location=Stockholm|isbn=978-0435909925|pages=1–256|translator-first=Olof|translator-last=Hoffsten}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulations shared a direct correlation to the protection of local oil investments.  Through this example, the Nigerian Civil War can be seen as a moment when sexual violence was ultimately utilized to protect the oil industry and is a prime example of petro-sexual political actions.

===Legitimate violence and transnational justice===

The Niger Delta was considered a [[terrorist]] region in 2000 by the United States State Department.  Following this declaration, [[US military]] funding to the region greatly increased to protect off-shore extraction and production of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerson|first=Joseph|title=U.S. foreign military bases &amp; military colonialism|url=http://www.zcommunications.org/u-s-foreign-military-bases-and-military-colonialism-by-joseph-gerson|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531231151/http://www.zcommunications.org/u-s-foreign-military-bases-and-military-colonialism-by-joseph-gerson|deadurl=unfit|publisher=ZNet|archivedate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action has raised questions of whether or not the U.S. intended to eradicate the terrorist threats or simply protect its oil investments. Turcotte suggests that this [[Conflict in the Niger Delta|violence in the Niger Delta region]] is brought about by the promotion of capitalist democracy through interstate systems.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt;
In the 1990s, the discourse around conflict in the Delta increasing focus on male youth groups activity against the industry as "militant attacks"; by 2000, these men were translated into terrorists by the interstate system.  The history of protests in Nigeria suggests that petro-protest developed from strategies of community justice within women's organizations often supported by male youth groups.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt;

===Petroleum extraction and violence===

According to Watts, oil has seven properties that aid in the explanation as to why violence is often found in areas of [[petroleum extraction]].&lt;ref name=Watts&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Michael J.|title=Violent Environments|chapter=Petro-violence: community, extraction, and political ecology of a mythic commodity|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|pages=189–212|editor1-first=Nancy Lee|editor1-last=Peluso|editor2-first=Michael J.|editor2-last=Watts|isbn=978-0801487118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Oil is money:  As a source of immediate wealth, the value of oil brings about an ambition and weakening of moral fiber that has been called the élan vital, vital force, of growth.
# Petro-State and Nation:  The presence of oil in a nation creates power within a state.  This power leads to the segregation of who will and will not have access to the resource and the revenue it generates in global markets.
# Petro-imperialism:  When oil is discovered, world powers become involved instantly.  A deal is soon formed between the oil nation and an imperial power.  This deal greatly hinders the oil nation's autonomy.
# Evacuative extraction: The extraction of oil leads to a variety of movement.  The oil flows from the land, but ecological repercussions and the relocation of indigenous populations are also observed.
# Hyper-centralization: The state becomes fully dependent on its oil commodity.  Political endeavors become intertwined with the business aspect of oil- petro-politics.
# The El Dorado effect:  The idea that oil leads to wealth without effort.  Oil and the revenue it will generate will propel the nation or state into the future.  Disregard of values and morals previously seen as vital are stereotypical.
# Valorization of territory:  Debate over who controls how the commodity of oil will be handled.  Disputes are often concerning issues of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], rights and [[citizenship]]. 
In the instance of the Niger Delta, constant exploitation from international oil companies distorted the pre-colonial views of the region.  This distortion has led to violence in the region.  Over 2,000 deaths have occurred as a direct result of this episode.&lt;ref name=Watts /&gt;

===Non-violent forms of activism===

"Blood may be thicker than water, but oil is thicker than both." —Perry Anderson, "Scurrying toward Bethlehem"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Perry|title=Scurrying towards Bethlehem|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/10/perry-anderson-scurrying-towards-bethlehem|journal=New Left Review|volume=10|date=July–August 2001|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to colonial institutions, females headed the Nigerian villages.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt;  Nigerian women were leaders of the palm oil industry that dominated the region prior to the conversion to petroleum.  Due to the fact that these women were seen as reproducers and heads of the family, if instance of abuse were seen, the women could threaten to leave.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt; However, once [[petroleum]] was taken as the region's main resource, the women rapidly lost this power.
Hanna exemplifies different types of protests commonly utilized by Nigerian women: dance, song and nakedness.&lt;ref name=Hanna&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=J|title=Dance, Protest, and Women's Wars: cases from Nigeria and the US|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195065176|editor=Guida West and Rhoda Blumberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Women's protests consist of storming en masse into the compounds of offending men and holding a man 'hostage' by dancing, singing and threatening their nakedness on him."&lt;ref name=Hanna /&gt;
Women's protest during the colonial era has been numerous given their social status prior to colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mba|first=N|title=Nigerian women mobilized|year=1982|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0877251484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with these protests, violence against women persisted as global oil initiatives grew in the region. The increasing oil economy of the Delta not only affected the physical well-being of the women in the area, but also affected their livelihoods. Local fishing industries and food staples have all been compromised due to oil-related pollution.&lt;ref name=Patch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patch|first=J.|title=Women and non-violent forms of activism in the Niger Delta oil resource conflict|journal=Undercurrent|year=2008|volume=5|issue=3|pages=39–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As instances of female-led non-violent protests increase, so does militant-based political activism among the male populace.  The variance in protest from violent and non-violent actions has called the legitimacy of the protests into question.  Ultimately, imperial labeling of these protests as "[[terrorist activities]]" perpetuates the existence of the oil companies and regional violence that accompanies the oil industry's presence.&lt;ref name=Patch /&gt;

It seems that these non-violent protests led by community women's organizations have been the most successful in bringing about awareness of the issue to the [[United Nations|UN]] and other [[grass-roots]] organizations.  Through continued use of non-violent protests, the women of the region have been able to establish credibility to their claims that had been previously disregarded as a result of violence and counter-violence in the area.&lt;ref name=Patch /&gt;

===MEND: violent protests of petro-sexual politics===

One source of violent protest to the petro-sexual politics that currently hold the Niger Delta under imperial power lies with the [[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta]] (MEND). The militant group is driven to violent protests by pollution, marginalization and political repression.&lt;ref name=Courson&gt;{{cite book|last=Courson|first=E|title=Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND)|year=2009|publisher=Nordiska Afrikainstitutet|location=Uppsala|isbn=978-91-7106-657-2|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As previously noted, the violence in the region between militant groups such as MEND and the government-controlled military can be attributed to [[economic inequality]], the legacy of colonialism, and the lack of a [[democratic government]]. Courson also notes that the gap in wealth in the Niger Delta has grown significantly since foreign oil companies have impacted the region.&lt;ref name=Courson /&gt; MEND emerged onto the resistance scene late in 2005 after attacking two Shell pipelines.  From the beginning, MEND attempted to make its intentions clear; it did not want to combat the people of the region or the oil companies, but the oppressive economy that held the people of the Delta in poverty.  To gain media attention, MEND took two western nationals hostage.  However, the retaliation by the government was not what the MEND resistance had hoped.  An increase in military presence led to human rights abuse, rape, and the destruction of communities, all in the name of fighting MEND, which has earned the title "terrorist" by the [[Nigerian government]]. However, Bushra states that labeling resistance efforts as terrorist acts does not look far enough into the reasons why groups such as MEND have been forced to take up arms.&lt;ref name=Bushra&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bushra|first=S.|title=Nigeria wages war for its own oil|journal=The Stanford Progressive|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bushra continues in saying that MEND's response was necessary due to the fact that previous peace negotiations had failed.&lt;ref name=Bushra /&gt;

Throughout this conflict, MEND has called for international intervention and refutes the terrorist tags that they have been labeled with, saying they fight for survival and equality.&lt;ref name=Courson /&gt; Individuals such as Brusha and Courson believe that military retaliation is not the answer to the problems that petro-sexual politics have imposed on the region. Further violence will lead to additional implications facing the marginalized women and youth that have been objectified as vessels of war in this conflict.&lt;ref name=Courson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bushra /&gt;

{{For|the film|Phenomenon (film)}}

A '''phenomenon''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: φαινόμενον, ''phainómenon'', from the verb ''phainein'', to show, shine, appear, to be manifest or manifest itself, plural '''phenomena''')&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/ashgtvd/phenomenon_phenomena |title=Phenomenon/Phenomena |publisher=Dictionary of Visual Discourse: A Dialectical Lexicon of Terms |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is any thing which manifests itself. Phenomena are often, but not always, understood as "things that appear" or "[[experience]]s" for a [[sentient]] being, or in principle may be so.

The term came into its modern philosophical usage through [[Immanuel Kant]], who contrasted it with the [[noumenon]]. In contrast to a phenomenon, a noumenon cannot be directly observed. Kant was heavily influenced by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in this part of his philosophy, in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated technical terms. Far predating this, the [[Ancient Greek Philosophy|ancient Greek]] [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] also used phenomenon and noumenon as interrelated technical terms.

[[File:Cloud chamber bionerd.jpg|thumb|[[Cloud chamber]] phenomena. Scientists use phenomena to refine some [[hypotheses]] and sometimes to disprove a [[theory]]. See also [[:Image:Cloud chamber ani bionerd.gif|animated version]].]]

==Modern philosophical usage==
In modern philosophical use, the term 'phenomena' has come to mean 'what is experienced is the basis of [[reality]]'.  In Immanuel Kant's ''Inaugural Dissertation, On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World'' (1770), Kant theorizes that the human mind is restricted to the logical world and thus can only interpret and understand occurrences according to their physical appearances.  He wrote that humans could infer only as much as their senses allowed, but not experience the actual object itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kant's Inaugural Dissertation of 1770]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the term phenomenon refers to any incident deserving of inquiry and investigation, especially events that are particularly unusual or of distinctive importance.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; According to The Columbia Encyclopedia, "Modern philosophers have used 'phenomenon' to designate what is apprehended before judgment is applied."&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/columency/phenomenon |title=Phenomenon |publisher=The Columbia Encyclopedia |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may not be possible if observation is [[theory-ladenness|theory laden]].

==Scientific==
{{See also|Phenomenalism}}
[[File:Space Fire.jpg|thumb|right|A comparison between a candle flame on Earth (left) and in a [[microgravity]] environment, such as that found on the [[International Space Station]] (right).&lt;br&gt;
The same ''burning'' phenomenon is [[observation|observed]], but different flame ''shape'' and ''colouring'' phenomena are also observed.]]
[[File:Streichholz.jpg|thumb|upright|The combustion of a match is an observable occurrence, or event, and therefore a phenomenon.]]

In scientific usage, a phenomenon is any event that is observable, however common it might be, even if it requires the use of instrumentation to observe, record, or compile data concerning it. For example, in [[physics]], a phenomenon may be described by a system of [[information]] related to [[matter]], [[energy]], or [[spacetime]], such as [[Isaac Newton]]'s observations of the [[moon]]'s orbit and of [[universal gravitation|gravity]], or [[Galileo Galilei]]'s observations of the motion of a [[pendulum]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bernstein, &lt;cite&gt;A Theory for Everything&lt;/cite&gt;, Copernicus, An imprint of Springer-Verlag, New York, 1996, hardback, {{ISBN|0-387-94700-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of scientific phenomena can be found in the experience of [[phantom limb]] sensations.  This occurrence, the sensation of feeling in amputated limbs, is reported by over 70% of amputees.  Although the limb is no longer present, they report still experiencing sensations. This is an extraordinary event that defies typical logic and has been a source of much curiosity within the medical and physiological fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montoyaa | first1 = Pedro | last2 = Larbiga | first2 = Wolfgang | last3 = Grulkea | first3 = Norbert | last4 = Florb | first4 = Herta | last5 = Taubc | first5 = Edward | last6 = Birbaumera | first6 = Niels | year = 1997 | title = The Relationship of Phantom Limb Pain to Other Phantom Limb Phenomena in Upper Extremity Amputees | url = | journal = Pain | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 87–93 | doi=10.1016/s0304-3959(97)00004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical==
A '''mechanical phenomenon''' is a physical phenomenon associated with the [[dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] or [[motion (physics)|motion]] of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.audioenglish.net/dictionary/mechanical_phenomenon.htm  |title=Mechanical phenomenon |publisher=Audioenglish.net |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples are [[Newton's cradle]], [[engine]]s, and [[double pendulum]]s.

==Group and social==
{{see also|Social phenomenon}}
Group phenomena concern the behavior of a particular group of individual entities, usually organisms and most especially people. The behavior of individuals often changes in a group setting in various ways, and a group may have its own behaviors not possible for an individual because of the [[herd mentality]].

Social phenomena apply especially to organisms and people in that subjective states are implicit in the term. Attitudes and events particular to a group may have effects beyond the group, and either be adapted by the larger society, or seen as aberrant, being punished or shunned.

==Popular usage==
In popular usage, a phenomenon often refers to an extraordinary [[Event (philosophy)|event]]. The term is most commonly used to refer to occurrences that at first defy explanation or baffle the observer. According to the ''Dictionary of Visual Discourse'', "In ordinary language 'phenomenon/phenomena' refer to any occurrence worthy of note and investigation, typically an untoward or unusual event, person or fact that is of special significance or otherwise notable."&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

'''''Pod''''' is the name of a 2002 [[Modern art|modern]] [[sculpture]] by American artist Pete Beeman,&lt;ref name=RACC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=2003.196|title=Public Art Search: Artist: Pete Beeman, American|accessdate=June 26, 2012|publisher=[[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently installed at Southwest 10th Avenue and West Burnside Street in [[Downtown Portland|downtown]] [[Portland, Oregon]]. The {{convert|30|foot|meter|adj=on}} sculpture, intended to represent the "infrastructure, energy, and vibrancy of Portland," is supported by its static [[tripod]] base with a {{convert|15|foot|meter|adj=on}} diameter.

''Pod'' was fabricated by Beeman and David Bermudez, and engineered by Beeman and Peterson Structural Engineers. It is considered [[Interactive art|interactive]] and [[Kinetic art|kinetic]], with a central, vertical [[pendulum]] that swings back and forth when pushed. The sculpture cost as much as $50,000 and was funded by the [[Portland Streetcar]] Project. ''Pod'' is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]].&lt;ref name=Culture&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturenow.org/entry&amp;permalink=06429|title=Pod, 2002|accessdate=June 25, 2012|publisher=cultureNOW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and history==
''Pod'' was designed by native Portland resident Pete Beeman as a [[public art]] project for the Portland Streetcar.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/print_story.php?story_id=115947972925067800|title=Stumptown Stumper|first=Jennifer|last=Anderson|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=[[Pamplin Media Group]]|accessdate=June 25, 2012|date=September 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Beeman and the Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council, the modern sculpture is designed to represent the "infrastructure, energy, and vibrancy of Portland".&lt;ref name=Culture/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name=LaMountain&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/opinion/story.php?story_id=17081|title=Out with the abstruse, in with relevance|first=Richard F.|last=LaMountain|date=May 16, 2003|accessdate=June 26, 2012|work=Portland Tribune|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Pamplin Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the work's design, Beeman said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was thinking about how Portland is designed and planned and built, and how the planning and infrastructure of Portland is really important in what makes Portland great.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potlatches are also a common feature of the peoples of the Interior and of the Subarctic adjoining the Northwest Coast, though mostly without the elaborate ritual and gift-giving economy of the coastal peoples (see [[Athabaskan potlatch]]).

Potlatches went through a history of [[Potlatch ban|rigorous ban]] by the Canadian federal government, continuing underground despite the risk of criminal punishment, and have been studied by many [[anthropologists]].  Since the practice was de-criminalized in the post-war years, the potlatch has re-emerged in some communities.

The word comes from the [[Chinook Jargon]], meaning "to give away" or "a gift"; originally from the [[Nuu-chah-nulth language|Nuu-chah-nulth]] word ''paɬaˑč'', to make a ceremonial gift in a potlatch.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Speaker Figure, 19th century, 05.588.7418.jpg|thumbnail|Speaker Figure, 19th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]], the figure represents a speaker at a potlatch. An orator standing behind the figure would have spoken through its mouth, announcing the names of arriving guests.]]
:''[[Nota bene|N.B.]] This overview concerns the Kwakwaka'wakw potlatch. Potlatch traditions and formalities and kinship systems in other cultures of the region differ, often substantially.''
A potlatch was held on the occasion of births, deaths, adoptions, weddings, and other major events.  Typically the potlatch was practiced more in the winter seasons as historically the warmer months were for procuring wealth for the family, clan, or village, then coming home and sharing that with neighbors and friends. The event was hosted by a ''numaym'',  or '[[House society|House]]', in [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] culture. A ''numaym'' was a complex [[cognatic]] kin group usually headed by aristocrats, but including commoners and occasional slaves. It had about one hundred members and several would be grouped together into a tribe. The House drew its identity from its ancestral founder, usually a mythical animal who descended to earth and removed his animal mask, thus becoming human. The mask became a family heirloom passed from father to son along with the name of the ancestor himself. This made him the leader of the ''numaym'', considered the living incarnation of the founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only rich people could host a potlatch. Tribal slaves were not allowed to attend a potlatch as a host or a guest. In some instances, it was possible to have multiple hosts at one potlatch ceremony (although when this occurred the hosts generally tended to be from the same family). If a member of a tribe had suffered an injury or indignity, hosting a potlatch could help to heal their tarnished reputation (or “cover his shame”, as anthropologist H.  G. Barnett worded it.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnett|first=H. G.|date=1938 |title=The Nature of the Potlatch |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/doi/10.1525/aa.1938.40.3.02a00010/epdf |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=40|pages=349–358|via= |doi=10.1525/aa.1938.40.3.02a00010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The potlatch was the occasion on which titles associated with masks and other objects were "fastened on" to a new office holder. Two kinds of titles were transferred on these occasions. Firstly, each ''numaym'' had a number of named positions of ranked "seats" (which gave them a seat at potlatches) transferred within itself. These ranked titles granted rights to hunting, fishing and berrying territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there were a number of titles that would be passed between numayma, usually to in-laws, which included feast names that gave one a role in the Winter Ceremonial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristocrats felt safe giving these titles to their out-marrying daughter's children because this daughter and her children would later be rejoined with her natal numaym and the titles returned with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any one individual might have several "seats" which allowed them to sit, in rank order, according to their title, as the host displayed and distributed wealth and made speeches. Besides the transfer of titles at a potlatch, the event was given "weight" by the distribution of other less important objects such as [[Chilkat weaving|Chilkat blankets]], animal skins (later Hudson Bay blankets) and ornamental "coppers". It is the distribution of large numbers of [[Hudson's Bay point blanket|Hudson Bay blankets]], and the destruction of valued coppers that first drew government attention (and censure) to the potlatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David |title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams |year=2001 |publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, preserved food was also given as a gift during a potlatch ceremony. Gifts known as ''sta-bigs'' consisted of preserved food that was wrapped in a mat or contained in a storage basket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Sally|date=April 1975|title=Quest for the Sacred in Northern Puget Sound: An Interpretation of Potlatch|url=https://www.jstor.org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/stable/3773086?sid=primo&amp;origin=crossref&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Ethnology|volume=14|pages=149–161|doi=10.2307/3773086}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Johansen describes the dynamic: "In the ''potlatch'', the host in effect challenged a guest chieftain to exceed him in his 'power' to give away or to destroy goods.  If the guest did not return 100 percent on the gifts received and destroy even more wealth in a bigger and better bonfire, he and his people lost face and so his 'power' was diminished."&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy O. Johansen, ''Empire of the Columbia: A History of the Pacific Northwest'', 2nd ed., (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchical relations within and between clans, villages, and nations, were observed and reinforced through the distribution or sometimes destruction of wealth, dance performances, and other ceremonies. The status of any given family is raised not by who has the most resources, but by who distributes the most resources. The hosts demonstrate their wealth and prominence through giving away goods.

Potlatch ceremonies were also used as coming-of-age rituals. When children were born, they would be given their first name at the time of their birth (which was usually associated with the location of their birthplace.) About a year later, the child's family would hold a potlatch and give gifts to the guests in attendance on behalf of the child. During this potlatch, the family would give the child their second name. Once the child reached about 12 years of age, they were expected to hold a potlatch of their own by giving out small gifts that they had collected to their family and tribe, at which point they would be able to receive their third name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indians of the North Pacific Coast|last=McFeat|first=Tom|publisher=McGill-Queen’s University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=72–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some cultures, such as [[Kwakwaka'wakw]], elaborate and theatrical dances are performed reflecting the hosts' genealogy and cultural wealth. Many of these dances are also sacred ceremonies of secret societies like the [[hamatsa]], or display of family origin from [[supernatural]] creatures such as the [[dzunukwa]].

Chief O'wax̱a̱laga̱lis of the [[Kwagu'ł]] describes the potlatch in his famous speech to anthropologist [[Franz Boas]],
{{quote|We will dance when our laws command us to dance, we will feast when our hearts desire to feast. Do we ask the white man, 'Do as the Indian does'? No, we do not. Why, then, will you ask us, 'Do as the white man does'? It is a strict law that bids us to dance. It is a strict law that bids us to distribute our property among our friends and neighbors. It is a good law. Let the white man observe his law; we shall observe ours. And now, if you are come to forbid us to dance, begone; if not, you will be welcome to us.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas, "The Indians of British Columbia," [https://books.google.com/books?id=pc4WAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA631 ''The Popular Science Monthly''], March 1888 (vol. 32), p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is important to note the differences and uniqueness among the different cultural groups and nations along the coast. Each nation, tribe, and sometimes clan has its own way of practicing the potlatch with diverse presentation and meaning. The Tlingit and Kwakiutl tribes of the Pacific Northwest, for example, held potlatch ceremonies for different occasions. The Tlingit potlatches occurred for succession (the granting of tribal titles or land) and funerals. The Kwakiutl potlatches, on the other hand, occurred for marriages and incorporating new people into the tribe (i.e. the birth of a new member of the tribe.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosman|first=Abraham|date=1972|title=The Potlatch: A Structural Analysis 1|url=|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=74|pages=658–671|via=|doi=10.1525/aa.1972.74.3.02a00280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potlatch, as an overarching term, is quite general, since some cultures have many words in their language for various specific types of gatherings. It is important to keep this variation in mind as most of our detailed knowledge of the potlatch was acquired from the Kwakwaka'wakw around Fort Rupert on Vancouver Island in the period 1849 to 1925, a period of great social transition in which many features became exaggerated in reaction to [[British colonialism]].&lt;ref name="Graeber 2001 188–208"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Klallam people at Port Townsend.jpg|thumb|right|Watercolor by [[James G. Swan]] depicting the [[Klallam]] people of chief [[Chetzemoka]] at [[Port Townsend]], with one of Chetzemoka's wives distributing potlatch]]
Before the arrival of the Europeans, gifts included storable food ([[oolichan]], or candlefish, oil or dried food), [[canoe]]s, [[Slavery among the indigenous people of the Americas|slaves]], and ornamental "coppers" among aristocrats, but not resource-generating assets such as hunting, fishing and berrying territories. Coppers were sheets of beaten copper, shield-like in appearance; they were about two feet long, wider on top, cruciform frame and schematic face on the top half. None of the copper used was ever of indigenous metal. A copper was considered the equivalent of a slave. They were only ever owned by individual aristocrats, and never by numaym, hence could circulate between groups. Coppers began to be produced in large numbers after the colonization of Vancouver Island in 1849 when war and slavery were ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aboriginal copper.jpg|thumb|right|Example of an ornamental copper used at a potlatch]]

The arrival of Europeans resulted in the introduction of numerous diseases against which indigenous peoples had no immunity, resulting in a massive population decline. Competition for the fixed number of potlatch titles grew as commoners began to seek titles from which they had previously been excluded by making their own remote or dubious claims validated by a potlatch. Aristocrats increased the size of their gifts in order to retain their titles and maintain social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;(1) Boyd (2) Cole &amp; Chaikin&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in massive inflation in gifting made possible by the introduction of mass-produced trade goods in the late 18th and earlier 19th centuries.

===Potlatch ban===
{{Main|Potlatch Ban}}
Potlatching was made illegal in Canada in 1884 in an amendment to the [[Indian Act]],&lt;ref&gt;An Act further to amend "The Indian Act, 1880,"  S.C. 1884 (47 Vict.), c. 27, s. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; largely at the urging of missionaries and government agents who considered it "a worse than useless custom" that was seen as wasteful, unproductive, and contrary to 'civilized values' of accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Sproat, quoted in Douglas Cole and Ira Chaikin, ''An Iron Hand upon the People: The Law against the Potlatch on the Northwest Coast'' (Vancouver and Toronto 1990), 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The potlatch was seen as a key target in assimilation policies and agendas. Missionary [[William Duncan (missionary)|William Duncan]] wrote in 1875 that the potlatch was "by far the most formidable of all obstacles in the way of Indians becoming Christians, or even civilized".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Fisher, ''Contact and Conflict: Indian-European Relations in British Columbia, 1774–1890'', Vancouver, University of British Columbia Press, 1977, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in 1884, the [[Indian Act]] was revised to include clauses [[The Potlatch Ban (Canada)|banning the Potlatch]] and making it illegal to practice. Section&amp;nbsp;3 of the Act read,
{{quote|Every Indian or other person who engages in or assists in celebrating the Indian festival known as the "Potlatch" or the Indian dance known as the "Tamanawas" is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not more than six nor less than two months in any gaol or other place of confinement; and, any Indian or other person who encourages, either directly or indirectly, an Indian or Indians to get up such a festival or dance, or to celebrate the same, or who shall assist in the celebration of same is guilty of a like offence, and shall be liable to the same punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act further to amend "The Indian Act, 1880,"'' S.C. 1884 (47 Vict.), c. 27, s. 3. Reproduced in n.41, {{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|chapter=Recovering from Colonization: Perspectives of Community Members on Protection and Repatriation of Kwakwaka'wakw Cultural Heritage|title=First Nations Cultural Heritage and Law: Case Studies, Voices, and Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=[[UBC Press]]|location=Vancouver|isbn=0-7748-1462-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avKUsA40Q0QC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89|editor=Bell, Catherine |editor2=Val Napoleon|accessdate=6 February 2011|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1888, the anthropologist [[Franz Boas]] described the potlatch ban as a failure:
{{quote|The second reason for the discontent among the Indians is a law that was passed, some time ago, forbidding the celebrations of festivals. The so-called ''potlatch'' of all these tribes hinders the single families from accumulating wealth. It is the great desire of every chief and even of every man to collect a large amount of property, and then to give a great ''potlatch'', a feast in which all is distributed among his friends, and, if possible, among the neighboring tribes. These feasts are so closely connected with the religious ideas of the natives, and regulate their mode of life to such an extent, that the Christian tribes near Victoria have not given them up. Every present received at a ''potlatch'' has to be returned at another ''potlatch'', and a man who would not give his feast in due time would be considered as not paying his debts. Therefore the law is not a good one, and can not be enforced without causing general discontent. Besides, the Government is unable to enforce it. The settlements are so numerous, and the Indian agencies so large, that there is nobody to prevent the Indians doing whatsoever they like.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Boas]], "The Indians of British Columbia," [https://books.google.com/books?id=pc4WAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA636 ''The Popular Science Monthly''], March 1888 (vol. 32), p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eventually the potlatch law, as it became known, was amended to be more inclusive and address technicalities that had led to dismissals of prosecutions by the court. Legislation included guests who participated in the ceremony. The indigenous people were too large to police and the law too difficult to enforce. [[Duncan Campbell Scott]] convinced Parliament to change the offence from criminal to summary, which meant "the agents, as justice of the peace, could try a case, convict, and sentence".&lt;ref&gt;Aldona Jonaitis, ''Chiefly Feasts: the Enduring Kwakiutl Potlatch'', Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1991, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, except in a few small areas, the law was generally perceived as harsh and untenable. Even the Indian agents employed to enforce the legislation considered it unnecessary to prosecute, convinced instead that the potlatch would diminish as younger, educated, and more "advanced" Indians took over from the older Indians, who clung tenaciously to the custom.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Cole and Ira Chaikin, ''An Iron Hand upon the People: The Law against the Potlatch on the Northwest Coast'' (Vancouver and Toronto 1990), Conclusion&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistence===
The potlatch ban was repealed in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gadacz |first=René R. |title=Potlatch |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=27 November 2013 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/potlatch/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustaining the customs and culture of their ancestors, indigenous people now openly hold potlatches to commit to the restoring of their ancestors' ways. Potlatches now occur frequently and increasingly more over the years as families reclaim their birthright. Anthropologist Sergei Kan was invited by the Tlingit tribe to attend several potlatch ceremonies between 1980 and 1987 and observed several similarities and differences between traditional and contemporary potlatch ceremonies. Kan notes that there was a language gap during the ceremonies between the older members of the tribe and the younger members of the tribe (age fifty and younger) due to the fact that most of the younger members of the tribe do not speak the Tlingit language. Kan also notes that unlike traditional potlatches, contemporary Tlingit potlatches are no longer obligatory, resulting in only about 30% of the adult tribal members opting to participate in the ceremonies that Kan attended between 1980 and 1987. Despite these differences, Kan stated that he believed that many of the essential elements and spirit of the traditional potlatch were still present in the contemporary Tlingit ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kan|first=Sergei|date=1989|title=Cohorts, Generations, and their Culture: The Tlingit Potlatch in the 1980’s|url=|journal=Anthropos: International Review of Anthropology and Linguistics|volume=84|pages=405–422|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropological theory==
In his book ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]'', the French ethnologist, [[Marcel Mauss]] used the term potlatch to refer to a whole set of exchange practices in tribal societies characterized by "total prestations", i.e., a system of gift giving with political, religious, kinship and economic implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1996|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=147–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These societies' economies are marked by the competitive exchange of gifts, in which gift-givers seek to out-give their competitors so as to capture important political, kinship and religious roles. Other examples of this "potlatch type" of [[gift economy]] include the [[Kula ring]] found in the [[Trobriand Islands]].&lt;ref name="Graeber 2001 188–208"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our own Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=188–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Restraint bias''' is the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control [[impulsivity|impulsive behavior]]. An inflated self-control belief may lead to greater exposure to temptation, and increased impulsiveness. Therefore, the restraint bias has bearing on [[addiction]]. For example, someone might experiment with drugs, simply because they believe they can resist any potential addiction.&lt;ref name="Nordgren2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordgren|first1=Loran F.|last2=van Harreveld|first2=Frenk|last3=van der Pligt|first3=Joop|title=The Restraint Bias: How the Illusion of Self-Restraint Promotes Impulsive Behavior|journal=Psychological Science|date=2009|volume=20|issue=12|pages=1523–1528|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02468.x|url=http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/The-Restraint-Bias_How-the-Illusion-of-Self-Restraint-Promotes-Impulsive-Behavior.pdf|pmid=19883487|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516101139/http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/The-Restraint-Bias_How-the-Illusion-of-Self-Restraint-Promotes-Impulsive-Behavior.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An individual's inability to control, or their temptation can come from several different [[visceral| visceral impulses]]. Visceral impulses can include hunger, sexual arousal, and fatigue. These impulses provide information about the current state and behavior needed to keep the body satisfied.&lt;ref name="Nordgren2009"/&gt;

'''Empathy Gap Effect:'''
The [[Empathy gap|Empathy Gap Effect]] deals with individuals having trouble appreciating the power that the impulse states have on their behavior. There is a cold-to-hot empathy gap that states when people are in a cold state, like not experiencing hunger, they tended to underestimate those influences in a hot state. The underestimation of the visceral impulses can be contributed to restricted memory for the visceral experience which means the individual can recall the impulsive state but cannot recreate the sensation of the impulsive state.&lt;ref name="Nordgren2009"/&gt;

'''Impulse Control and Attention:'''
Studies have concluded that when people believe that they have stronger sense of self-control over situations in their environment, they have greater control over their impulse control. Individuals also tend to overestimate their capacity for self-control when one is told that they have a high capacity for self-restraint.&lt;ref name="Nordgren2009"/&gt; The more someone is told that they have a high capacity for self-restraint, the more they believe it and display higher levels of impulse control. Attention has a lot to do with biases, self and impulse controls in our environment. The less attention an individual pays to something, the less control they have over whatever they are doing. Focusing attention to oneself can lead to successful self-control which can be helpful in many aspects of life. Self-control engages conflict between competing pressures, pressures that can be brought on by situational or internal prompts from the environment. Some of the cues make the individual act on or engage in that behavior or act to prevent the individual from taking action.&lt;ref name="Mann2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mann|first1=Traci|last2=Ward|first2=Andrew|title=Attention, Self-Control, and Health Behaviors|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=2007|volume=16|issue=5|pages=280–283|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00520.x|url=http://people.uncw.edu/tothj/Extra-Credit-Papers/Mann-Attention%20Self-Control%20and%20Health%20Behaviors-CDPS-2008.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221175422/http://people.uncw.edu/tothj/Extra-Credit-Papers/Mann-Attention%20Self-Control%20and%20Health%20Behaviors-CDPS-2008.pdf|archivedate=2016-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Risk and actuarial criminology''', unlike many other [[Criminology|theories of crime]], does not focus on the causality of crime. It believes the [[social]] world is too complex and interlocking to understand what causes a [[behaviour]] or [[Social actions|action]]. This theory seeks to understand the emerging forms of [[social control]] that may lead to [[crime]], and concentrates on assessing risk.
Major aspects of this theory are the norms and rules of a society that propel behaviour and private sectors getting involved in citizens lives. This theory does not revolve around issues of justice, the criminal code, or laws, it focuses on questions of how to minimize risk of entrenchments on private security for the general population. Power is a key concept within risk and actuarial [[criminology]]. Power is the highest most emergent form of social control, which contains many interlocking sets of networks such as schools, licensing agencies, organizations etc. This theory looks at the effect of these powers on risk, and the risk to our personal private [[security]].
Risk criminology studies changes such as the rise in private security. Risk criminology sees this change as the social institutions taking more and more interest in the private sector, as well as the public domain such as the government becoming less involved, leaving room for [[self-governance]]. This means that because of these changes in social control, individuals behaviour is understood and analyzed with actuary science, because agencies and organizations are taking an interest in the personal security and risk of their clients. 
Another change that risk assesses, is the blurring of the line between private and public policing. In recent times, private policing outnumbers public policing, which confuses and fragments policing, which explains some patterns of behaviour in our day.&lt;ref name="O'Grady"&gt;O’Grady, W. (2011). Classical Sociological Explanations of Crime. In Crime in Canadian Context. Canada: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corrections ==
Since risk and actuarial criminology does not focus on the causality of crime, which so many theories focus on, it suggests a different perspective and application to corrections. This theory suggests that we stop reacting and dealing with the aftermath of criminals, but look at pre-meditating factors such as why some groups have become dangerous? and what part of these societies do these groups threaten?
It tells us that we need to better prepare the society to understand the risk that offender's hold.&lt;ref name="O'Grady" /&gt;

A '''rotating biological contactor''' or '''RBC''' is a [[biological]] treatment process used in the treatment of [[wastewater]] following [[Sewage treatment#treatment stages|primary treatment]].&lt;ref name=Grady&gt;{{cite book|author=C.P.

Mba, School of Engineering, [[Cranfield University]]{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary treatment process means protection by removal of [[Gritstone|grit]] and sand and coarse material through a screening process, followed by a removal process of sediment by settling. The RBC process involves allowing the wastewater to come in contact with a biological medium in order to remove [[pollutant]]s in the wastewater  before discharge of the treated wastewater to the [[Natural environment|environment]], usually a body of water (river, lake or ocean). A rotating biological contactor is a type of secondary (Biological) treatment process. It  consists of a series of closely spaced, parallel discs mounted on a rotating shaft which is supported just above the surface of the waste water. Microorganisms grow on the surface of the discs where [[biological degradation]] of the wastewater pollutants takes place.

[[Image:RBC Media Cross-section.png|thumb|right|250px|A schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed media in a rotating biological contactor (RBC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] | edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=1967 | pages= 262| id= [[LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The rotating packs of disks (known as the media) are contained in a tank or trough and rotate at between 2 and 5 revolutions per minute. Commonly used plastics for the media are [[polyethylene]], [[PVC]] and expanded [[polystyrene]]. The shaft is aligned with the flow of wastewater so that the discs rotate at right angles to the flow, with several packs usually combined to make up a treatment train. About 40% of the disc area is immersed in the wastewater.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"&gt;{{cite book   | title = Fixed Biological Surfaces - Wastewater Treatment: The Rotating Biological Contactor | author= Ronald L. Antonie | publisher = CRC Press | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nLtHDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rotating+biological+contactor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU442JxsbZAhVGtlkKHUgUAO4Q6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Rotating%20biological%20contactor&amp;f=false | date = 2018 | page =   | isbn = 9781351088947  | accessdate = 27 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch 2}}

Biological growth is attached to the surface of the disc and forms a slime layer. The discs contact the wastewater with the atmospheric air for oxidation as it rotates. The rotation helps to slough off excess solids. The disc system can be staged in series to obtain nearly any detention time or degree of removal required. Since the systems are staged, the culture of the later stages can be acclimated to the slowly degraded materials.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"/&gt;{{rp|Ch 2}}

The discs consist of plastic sheets ranging from 2 to 4 m in diameter and are up to 10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Several modules may be arranged in parallel and/or in series to meet the flow and treatment requirements. The discs are submerged in waste water to about 40% of their diameter. Approximately 95% of the surface area is thus alternately submerged in waste water and then exposed to the atmosphere above the liquid. Carbonaceous substrate is removed in the initial stage of RBC. Carbon conversion may be completed in the first stage of a series of modules, with nitrification being completed after the 5th stage. Most design of RBC systems will include a minimum of 4 or 5 modules in series to obtain nitrification of waste water.

[[Biofilms]], which are biological growths that become attached to the discs, assimilate the organic materials in the wastewater. [[Aeration]] is provided by the rotating action, which exposes the media to the air after contacting them with the wastewater, facilitating the degradation of the pollutants being removed. The degree of wastewater treatment is related to the amount of media surface area and the quality and volume of the inflowing wastewater.

==History==
{{cleanup|reason=Requires citations, lacks flow and perhaps better in another section?|date=May 2016}}
The first RBC was installed in West Germany in 1959, later it was introduced in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"/&gt;{{rp|Ch 2:History}} In the United States, rotating biological contactors are used for industries producing wastewaters high in [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) (e.g., petroleum industry and dairy industry).

A properly designed RBC produced a very high quality final effluent. However both the organic and hydraulic loading had to be addressed. 

In the 1980's problems were encountered in the USA prompting the Environmental Agency to commission a number of reports.

These reports identified a number of issues and criticized the RBC process. One author suggested that since manufacturers were aware of the problem, the problems would be resolved and suggested that design engineers should specify a long life.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

However, this was only possible when the manufacturers became aware of the design problems and the stress to ensure a long life and since failures still occurred it was unlikely any design stresses were known.

Severn Trent Water Ltd, a large UK Water Company based in the Midlands, employed RBCs as the preferred process for their small works which amount to over 700 sites  Consequently, long life was essential to compliance.

This issue was successfully addressed by Eric Findlay C Eng when he was employed by Severn Trent Water Ltd in the UK following a period of failure of a number of plants. As a result, the issue of short life failure became fully understood in the early 1990s when the correct process and hydraulic issues had been identified to produce a high quality nitrified effluent. 


There are several other papers which address the whole issue of RBCs.
Findlay also developed a system for repairing defective RBCs enabling shaft and frame life to be extended up to 30 years based on the Cranfield designed frame. Where additional capacity was required intermediate  frames are used maximising minimising the need for duplication

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary clarification== 
Secondary clarifiers following RBCs are identical in design to conventional humus tanks, as used downstream of [[trickling filter]]s. Sludge is generally removed daily, or pumped automatically to the primary settlement tank for co-settlement. Regular sludge removal reduces the risk of  anaerobic conditions from developing within the sludge, with subsequent sludge flotation due to the release of gases.

'''Satyagraha''' ({{lang-sa|सत्याग्रह}}; satya: "''truth''", graha: "''insistence''" or "''holding firmly to''") or holding onto truth''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gandhifoundation.net/about%20gandhi6.htm “Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up the use of the phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha” itself or some other equivalent English phrase.”&lt;/ref&gt;'' or truth force – is a particular form of [[nonviolent resistance]] or [[civil resistance]].  Someone who practices satyagraha is a '''satyagrahi'''.

The term ''satyagraha'' was coined and developed by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948).&lt;ref name="Majmudar p38"&gt;{{cite book|author=Uma Majmudar|title=Gandhi's pilgrimage of faith: from darkness to light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xM4paHEq5oQC&amp;pg=PA138|year=2005|publisher=SUNY Press|page=138|isbn=9780791464052}}&lt;/ref&gt; He deployed satyagraha in the [[Indian independence movement]] and also during his earlier struggles in [[South Africa]] for Indian rights. Satyagraha theory influenced [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s and [[James Bevel]]'s campaigns  during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States, and many other social justice and similar movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/525247/satyagraha "Gandhi’s satyagraha became a major tool in the Indian struggle against British imperialism and has since been adopted by protest groups in other countries." Date accessed: 14 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=9165422 "In this respect Satyagraha or non-violent resistance, as conceived by Gandhiji, has an important lesson for pacifists and war-resisters of the West. Western pacifists have so far proved ineffective because they have thought that war can be resisted by mere propaganda, conscientious objection, and organization for settling disputes." Date accessed: 14 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and meaning of name ==
[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|250px|Gandhi leading the 1930 [[Salt March]], a notable example of satyagraha.]]

The term originated in a competition in the news-sheet ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' in [[South Africa]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="Majmudar p38" /&gt; Mr. Maganlal Gandhi, grandson of an uncle of Gandhi, came up with the word "Sadagraha" and won the prize. Subsequently, to make it clearer, Gandhi changed it to Satyagraha. "Satyagraha" is a [[tatpuruṣaya]] [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of the Sanskrit words ''[[satya]]'' (meaning "truth") and ''agraha'' ("polite insistence", or "holding firmly to"). Satya is derived from the word “sat”, which means “being”. Nothing is or exists in reality except Truth. In the context of satyagraha, Truth therefore includes a) Truth in speech, as opposed to falsehood, b) what is real, as opposed to nonexistent (asat) and c) good as opposed to evil, or bad.  This was critical to Gandhi’s understanding of and faith in nonviolence: "The world rests upon the bedrock of satya or truth. Asatya, meaning untruth, also means nonexistent, and satya or truth also means that which is. If untruth does not so much as exist, its victory is out of the question. And truth being that which is, can never be destroyed. This is the doctrine of satyagraha in a nutshell." &lt;ref&gt;Nagler, Michael N. The Nonviolence Handbook: A Guide for Practical Action. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere "passive resistance" and became strength in practising non-violent methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his words:
{{quote|Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or non-violence, and gave up the use of the phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha” itself or some other equivalent English phrase.&lt;ref&gt;M.K. Gandhi, ''Satyagraha in South Africa'', Navajivan, Ahmedabad, 1111, pp. 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 1935, a letter to P. K. Rao, Servants of India Society, Gandhi disputed the proposition that his idea of [[Civil Disobedience]] was adapted from the writings of [[Henry David Thoreau]] especially ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'' of 1849.
{{quote|The statement that I had derived my idea of civil disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong. The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay of Thoreau on civil disobedience. But the movement was then known as passive resistance. As it was incomplete, I had coined the word satyagraha for the Gujarati readers. When I saw the title of Thoreau’s great essay, I began the use of his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers. But I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance. Non-violence was always an integral part of our struggle."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], letter to P. Kodanda Rao, 10 September 1935; in ''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'', electronic edition, vol. 67, p. 400.[http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL067.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gandhi described it as follows:

{{quote|I have also called it love-force or soul-force. In the application of satyagraha, I discovered in the earliest stages that pursuit of truth did not admit of violence being inflicted on one’s opponent but that he must be weaned from error by patience and compassion. For what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the other. And patience means self-suffering. So the doctrine came to mean vindication of truth, not by infliction of suffering on the opponent, but on oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. ''Statement to Disorders Inquiry Committee'' January 5, 1920 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 19, p. 206)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contrast to "passive resistance" ==

Gandhi distinguished between satyagraha and passive resistance in the following letter:
{{quote|"I have drawn the distinction between passive resistance as understood and practised in the West and satyagraha before I had evolved the doctrine of the latter to its full logical and spiritual extent. I often used “passive resistance” and “satyagraha” as synonymous terms: but as the doctrine of satyagraha developed, the expression “passive resistance” ceases even to be synonymous, as passive resistance has admitted of violence as in the case of the [[suffragette]]s and has been universally acknowledged to be a weapon of the weak. Moreover, passive resistance does not necessarily involve complete adherence to truth under every circumstance. Therefore it is different from satyagraha in three essentials: Satyagraha is a weapon of the strong; it admits of no violence under any circumstance whatsoever; and it ever insists upon truth."&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Letter to Mr.&amp;nbsp;– ” 25 January 1920 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 19, p. 350)&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Ahimsa and satyagraha==
It is important to note the intrinsic connection between [[ahinsa]] and satyagraha. Satyagraha is sometimes used to refer to the whole principle of nonviolence, where it is essentially the same as ahimsa, and sometimes used in a “marked” meaning to refer specifically to [[direct action]] that is largely obstructive, for example in the form of civil disobedience.

Gandhi says:
{{quote|It is perhaps clear from the foregoing, that without ahinsa it is not possible to seek and find Truth. Ahimsa and Truth are so intertwined that it is practically impossible to disentangle and separate them. They are like the two sides of a coin, or rather of a smooth unstamped metallic disk. Nevertheless, ahimsa is the means; Truth is the end. Means to be means must always be within our reach, and so ahimsa is our supreme duty.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Mahatma. Non-violent Resistance (Satyagraha). Mineola, N.Y.: Dover, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Defining success ===
Assessing the extent to which Gandhi's ideas of satyagraha were or were not successful in the Indian independence struggle is a complex task. Judith Brown has suggested that "this is a political strategy and technique which, for its outcomes, depends of historical specificities."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Judith M., "Gandhi and Civil Resistance in India, 1917–47: Key Issues", in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt; The view taken by Gandhi differs from the idea that the goal in any conflict is necessarily to defeat the opponent or frustrate the opponent’s objectives, or to meet one’s own objectives despite the efforts of the opponent to obstruct these. In satyagraha, by contrast, “The Satyagrahi’s object is to convert, not to coerce, the wrong-doer.”&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Requisite Qualifications” ''Harijan'' 25 March 1939&lt;/ref&gt; The opponent must be converted, at least as far as to stop obstructing the just end, for this cooperation to take place. There are cases, to be sure, when an opponent, for e.g. a dictator, has to be unseated and one cannot wait to convert him. The satyagrahi would count this a partial success.

=== Means and ends ===
The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. The means used to obtain an end are wrapped up in and attached to that end. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use unjust means to obtain justice or to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: “They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end...”&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors; from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap45.htm “The Gospel Of Sarvodaya], of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi used an example to explain this:

{{quote|If I want to deprive you of your watch, I shall certainly have to fight for it; if I want to buy your watch, I shall have to pay for it; and if I want a gift, I shall have to plead for it; and, according to the means I employ, the watch is stolen property, my own property, or a donation.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Brute Force”, Chapter XVI of ''Hind Swaraj'', 1909 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 10, p. 287)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gandhi rejected the idea that injustice should, or even could, be fought against “by any means necessary”&amp;nbsp;– if you use violent, coercive, unjust means, whatever ends you produce will necessarily embed that injustice. To those who preached violence and called nonviolent actionists cowards, he replied: “I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence....I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonour....But I believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more manly than punishment.”&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors;  from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap28.htm “Between Cowardice and Violence,”] of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satyagraha versus duragraha ===
The essence of satyagraha is that it seeks to eliminate antagonisms without harming the antagonists themselves, as opposed to violent resistance, which is meant to cause harm to the antagonist. A satyagrahi therefore does not seek to end or destroy the relationship with the antagonist, but instead seeks to transform or “purify” it to a higher level. A euphemism sometimes used for satyagraha is that it is a “silent force” or a “soul force” (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous “[[I Have a Dream]]” speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a “universal force,” as it essentially “makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe.”&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Some Rules of Satyagraha” ''Young India (Navajivan)'' 23 February 1930 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 48, p. 340)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi contrasted satyagraha (holding on to truth) with “duragraha” (holding on by force), as in protest meant more to harass than enlighten opponents.  He wrote: “There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause.”&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors;  from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap34.htm “Power of Satyagraha,”] of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil disobedience and non-cooperation as practised under satyagraha are based on the “law of suffering”,&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “The Law of Suffering” ''Young India'' 16 June 1920&lt;/ref&gt; a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, the non-cooperation of satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent that is consistent with truth and justice.

== In large-scale conflict ==
{{main|Bardoli Satyagraha|Champaran Satyagraha|Kheda Satyagraha|Dharasana Satyagraha|Flag Satyagraha|Guruvayur Satyagraha|Non-cooperation movement|Quit India Movement|Salt Satyagraha|Vaikom Satyagraha}}

When using satyagraha in a large-scale political conflict involving civil disobedience, Gandhi believed that the satyagrahis must undergo training to ensure discipline.  He wrote that it is “only when people have proved their active loyalty by obeying the many laws of the State that they acquire the right of Civil Disobedience.”&lt;ref name="prereq" /&gt;

He therefore made part of the discipline that satyagrahis:
# Appreciate the other laws of the State and obey them voluntarily
# Tolerate these laws, even when they are inconvenient
# Be willing to undergo suffering, loss of property, and to endure the suffering that might be inflicted on family and friends&lt;ref name="prereq"&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Pre-requisites for Satyagraha” ''Young India'' 1 August 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

This obedience has to be not merely grudging, but extraordinary:
{{quote|...an honest, respectable man will not suddenly take to stealing whether there is a law against stealing or not, but this very man will not feel any remorse for failure to observe the rule about carrying headlights on bicycles after dark.... But he would observe any obligatory rule of this kind, if only to escape the inconvenience of facing a prosecution for a breach of the rule. Such compliance is not, however, the willing and spontaneous obedience that is required of a Satyagrahi.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “A Himalayan Miscalculation” in ''The Story of My Experiments with Truth'' Chapter 33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Principles ===
Gandhi envisioned satyagraha as not only a tactic to be used in acute political struggle, but as a universal solvent for injustice and harm.

He founded the [[Sabarmati Ashram]] to teach satyagraha.  He asked satyagrahis to follow the following principles (Yamas described in Yoga Sutra):&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. ''Non-violent Resistance (Satyagraha)'' (1961) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
# Nonviolence ([[ahimsa]])
# Truth – this includes honesty, but goes beyond it to mean living fully in accord with and in devotion to that which is true
# Not stealing
# [[Non-possession]] (not the same as poverty)
# Body-labor or bread-labor
# Control of desires (gluttony)
# Fearlessness
# Equal respect for all religions
# Economic strategy such as boycott of imported goods ([[swadeshi]])
On another occasion, he listed these rules as “essential for every Satyagrahi in India”:
# Must have a living faith in God
# Must be leading a chaste life, and be willing to die or lose all his possessions
# Must be a habitual khadi weaver and spinner
# Must abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants

=== Rules for satyagraha campaigns ===
Gandhi proposed a series of rules for satyagrahis to follow in a resistance campaign:&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt;
# Harbour no anger.
# Suffer the anger of the opponent.
# Never retaliate to assaults or punishment; but do not submit, out of fear of punishment or assault, to an order given in anger.
# Voluntarily submit to arrest or confiscation of your own property.
# If you are a trustee of property, defend that property (non-violently) from confiscation with your life.
# Do not curse or swear.
# Do not insult the opponent.
# Neither salute nor insult the flag of your opponent or your opponent’s leaders.
# If anyone attempts to insult or assault your opponent, defend your opponent (non-violently) with your life.
# As a prisoner, behave courteously and obey prison regulations (except any that are contrary to self-respect).
# As a prisoner, do not ask for special favourable treatment.
# As a prisoner, do not fast in an attempt to gain conveniences whose deprivation does not involve any injury to your self-respect.
# Joyfully obey the orders of the leaders of the civil disobedience action.

== American Civil Rights Movement ==
Satyagraha theory also influenced many other movements of nonviolence and civil resistance. For example, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] wrote in his autobiography about Gandhi's influence on his developing ideas regarding the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States:

{{quote|Like most people, I had heard of Gandhi, but I had never studied him seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was particularly moved by his [[Salt March]] to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of ''Satyagraha'' (''Satya'' is truth which equals love, and ''agraha'' is force; ''Satyagraha'', therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for the first time its potency in the area of social reform. ... It was in this Gandhian emphasis on love and nonviolence that I discovered the method for social reform that I had been seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Martin Luther King, Jr.|last= King, Jr. |first= Martin Luther | title= [[The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.]]| isbn=0-446-52412-3| year=1998 | editor1-first=Clayborne  |editor1-last=Carson | pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Satyagraha in relation to genocide ==
In view of the [[History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1930s-1940)|Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany]], Gandhi offered satyagraha as a method of combating oppression and genocide, stating:

{{quote|If I were a Jew and were born in Germany and earned my livelihood there, I would claim Germany as my home even as the tallest Gentile German might, and challenge him to shoot me or cast me in the dungeon; I would refuse to be expelled or to submit to discriminating treatment. And for doing this I should not wait for the fellow Jews to join me in civil resistance, but would have confidence that in the end the rest were bound to follow my example. If one Jew or all the Jews were to accept the prescription here offered, he or they cannot be worse off than now. And suffering voluntarily undergone will bring them an inner strength and joy [...] the calculated violence of [[Hitler]] may even result in a general massacre of the Jews by way of his first answer to the declaration of such hostilities. But if the Jewish mind could be prepared for voluntary suffering, even the massacre I have imagined could be turned into a day of thanksgiving and joy that Jehovah had wrought deliverance of the race even at the hands of the tyrant. For to the God-fearing, death has no terror.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “The Jews” ''Harijan'' 26 November 1938 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 74, p. 240)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Gandhi was criticized for these statements, he responded in another article entitled “Some Questions Answered”:

{{quote|Friends have sent me two newspaper cuttings criticizing my appeal to the Jews. The two critics suggest that in presenting non-violence to the Jews as a remedy against the wrong done to them, I have suggested nothing new... What I have pleaded for is renunciation of violence of the heart and consequent active exercise of the force generated by the great renunciation.”&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Some Questions Answered” ''Harijan'' 17 December 1938 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 74, pp. 297–98)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a similar vein, anticipating a possible attack on India by Japan during [[World War II]], Gandhi recommended satyagraha as a means of national defense (what is now sometimes called "Civilian Based Defense (CBD) or "[[social defence]]"):

{{quote|...there should be unadulterated non-violent non-cooperation, and if the whole of India responded and unanimously offered it, I should show that, without shedding a single drop of blood, Japanese arms – or any combination of arms – can be sterilized. That involves the determination of India not to give quarter on any point whatsoever and to be ready to risk loss of several million lives. But I would consider that cost very cheap and victory won at that cost glorious. That India may not be ready to pay that price may be true. I hope it is not true, but some such price must be paid by any country that wants to retain its independence. After all, the sacrifice made by the Russians and the Chinese is enormous, and they are ready to risk all. The same could be said of the other countries also, whether aggressors or defenders. The cost is enormous. Therefore, in the non-violent technique I am asking India to risk no more than other countries are risking and which India would have to risk even if she offered armed resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, M.K. “Non-violent Non-cooperation” ''Harijan'' 24 May 1942, p. 167 (''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' vol. 82, p. 286; interview conducted 16 May 1942)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are three variants of this torture. In the first, victims have their arms tied behind their backs; a large rope is then tied to the wrists and passed over a [[pulley]], [[Beam (structure)|beam]], or a hook on the roof. The torturer pulls on this rope until the victim is hanging from the arms. Since the hands are tied behind the victim's back, this will cause a very intense pain and possible [[dislocation (medicine)|dislocation]] of the arms.&lt;ref name="cassar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="illum2016-07-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maestrogianni"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Attard|first1=Christian|title=The sad end of Maestro Gianni - A Neapolitan Buonavoglia and Sculptor|journal=Treasures of Malta|date=2013|issue=56|volume=XIX|url=https://www.academia.edu/7166765/The_Sad_end_of_Giovanni_Puglisi_-_A_Neapolitan_Buonavoglia_and_Sculptor|page=49|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti|issn=1028-3013|oclc=	499647242|location=Valletta}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full weight of the subject's body is then supported by the extended and internally rotated shoulder sockets. While the technique shows no external injuries, it can cause long-term [[nerve]], [[ligament]], or [[tendon]] damage. The technique typically causes [[brachial plexus injury]], leading to [[paralysis]] or loss of sensation in the arms.

The second variation, known as squassation, is similar to the first, but a series of drops are added, meaning that the victim is allowed to drop until his or her fall is suddenly checked by the rope.&lt;ref name="borg-muscat"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borg-Muscat|first1=David|title=Prison life in Malta in the 18th century – Valletta's Gran Prigione|journal=Storja|date=2001|pages=48–49|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Storja/Storja2001/05s.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416102655/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Storja/Storja2001/05s.pdf|archivedate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the damage caused by the suspension, the painful jerk would cause major stress to the extended and vulnerable arms, leading to broken shoulders. It is believed that [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], during his 1513 imprisonment after allegedly conspiring against the [[Medici]] family in [[Florence]], was subjected to this form of strappado.

In the third variant, the victim's hands are tied to the front. The victim is also hung from the hands, but the ankles are tied and a heavy weight is attached to them. This will cause pain and possible damage not only to the arms, but also to the legs and hips.

==History==
According to [[William Godwin]], [[Girolamo Savonarola]] was tortured by strappado multiple times before being put to death in a [[trial by ordeal]] (fire); Savonarola, however, apparently renounced his confessions after being tortured, which eventually led to his sentence of [[Death by burning|burning at the stake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John Abraham|last=Heraud|author-link=John Abraham Heraud|title=The life and times of Girolamo Savonarola: illustrating the progress of the Reformation in Italy, during the fifteenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9wEAAAAYAAJ|year=1843|publisher=Whittaker|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This device was thought to be used during the [[Salem Witch Trials]] of Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 to torture accused witches.

==Modern instances==
[[File:Metallstange-zur-Folterung.jpg|thumb|upright|A sculpture depicting strappado]]
In the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], prisoners were punished by having their hands tied behind their back, and then being suspended on a pole with their feet just above the ground for half an hour. This was also systematically used in [[Dachau Concentration Camp]] for infringement of camp rules. Originally the punishment used tree branches, but it was moved into a shower room on special poles so that victims could not relieve the pain as they could by using the tree. Holocaust survivor [[Jean Améry]] writes of his own experiences of strappado when being tortured at the Nazi concentration camp of Fort Breendonk in occupied Belgium. Améry's analytical descriptions of the torture were included in a number of works by the writer [[W. G. Sebald]] (notably the novel ''Austerlitz'').

The "ropes" was one of several torture methods employed at the Hỏa Lò Prison, popularly known as the [[Hanoi Hilton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/magazine/25stockdale.html "The Prisoner"], ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was used by the [[North Vietnamese Army]] to house, torture and interrogate captured servicemen, mostly American [[airmen]] shot down during bombing raids (including [[USAF]] officer [[Joseph Kittinger]], and [[US Navy]] pilot [and later [[US Senator]]] [[John McCain#Prisoner of war|John McCain]]).&lt;ref name="karnow-655"&gt;{{cite book | last=Karnow | first=Stanley | authorlink=Stanley Karnow | title=Vietnam: A History | publisher=[[The Viking Press]] | year=1983 | isbn=0-670-74604-5}} p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the torture was usually not acquiring military information; rather, it was to break the will of the prisoners, both individually and as a group, and to get written or recorded statements from the prisoners who criticized U.S.&amp;nbsp;conduct of the war and praised how the [[North Vietnam]]ese treated them.&lt;ref name="afm-valor"&gt;Hubbell, ''P.O.W.'', pp. 288–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1997 [[Human Rights Watch]] report, this technique was "widely employed" by the security forces of [[Turkey]], where it is "usually used together with high-pressure water, electric shock, beating, or [[sexual molestation]] such as squeezing the [[testicle]]s or breast or placing a [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]] against or in the [[vagina]] or [[anus]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/turkey/Turkey-04.htm#P176_36663 TURKEY: TORTURE AND MISTREATMENT IN PRE-TRIAL DETENTION BY ANTI-TERROR POLICE - Techniques of Abuse]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found Turkey guilty of torture for its use of reverse hanging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrcr.org/safrica/freedom_security/aksoy_turkey.html ''Aksoy v.

In 2003, one of the Bulgarian nurses interrogated during the [[HIV trial in Libya]], Snezhana Dimitrova, stated that she had been tortured in this way.

&lt;blockquote&gt;They tied my hands behind my back. Then they hung me from a door. It feels like they are stretching you from all sides. My torso was twisted and my shoulders were dislocated from their joints from time to time. The pain cannot be described.

In November 2003, [[Manadel al-Jamadi]], a suspected terrorist, was tortured to death at [[Abu Ghraib Prison]] during a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] interrogation. It was revealed in February 2005 that he had died after 30 minutes of interrogation during which he was suspended by the wrist, bound behind his back.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/After-Saddam/US-troops-accused-of-Palestinian-hanging-torture/2005/02/18/1108609385820.html|title='Palestinian hanging' torture revealed - After Saddam|publisher=SMH|date=18 February 2005|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suing for peace''' is an act by a [[war]]ring nation to initiate a peace process. Suing for peace is usually initiated by the losing party in an attempt to stave off an unconditional surrender and may sometimes be favorable to the winning nation, as prosecuting a war to a complete or [[unconditional surrender]] may be costly. In this case, then, the word "sue" is being used in its original, now-obsolete meaning of "to make petition to or for", rather than the usual meaning of "to take legal action against".

Pressing for peace may sometimes, however, be started by the winning faction as a means to end the war for several reasons, such as where additional conflict would not be in the perceived best interest of the winning party. In this case, demands might be made, or the two nations may agree to a "white peace," or [[status quo ante bellum]].

==Examples==

The '''First Sino-Japanese War''' (1 August 1894&amp;nbsp;– 17 April 1895) was fought between the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] of China and the [[Empire of Japan]], primarily over influence of [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Chino-Japanese War |volume=6 |pages=233–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the Chinese port of [[Weihai]]wei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895.

The archives abound with attempts to halt World War I, but most attempts were unofficial and of no effect.  On 2 December 1916, prior to his coronation later that month, [[Charles I of Austria]] took over the title of Supreme Commander of the army from [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Frederick]]. In 1917, he secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma]], an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary.  The negotiations of the [[Sixtus Affair]] for a sued peace failed.

'''Sustainable architecture''' is [[architecture]] that seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings by efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, and development space and the ecosystem at large. Sustainable architecture uses a conscious approach to energy and ecological conservation in the design of the built environment.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Architecture and Simulation Modelling", Dublin Institute of Technology, [http://www.cebe.heacademy.ac.uk/learning/habitat/HABITAT4/beattie.html#_Toc397853444] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506035740/http://www.cebe.heacademy.ac.uk/learning/habitat/HABITAT4/beattie.html |date=2013-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of sustainability, or [[ecological design]], is to ensure that our actions and decisions today do not inhibit the opportunities of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Doerr Architecture, Definition of Sustainability and the Impacts of Buildings [http://www.doerr.org/services/sustainability.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable energy use==
{{Main|Low-energy house|Zero-energy building}}
[[File:K2 apartments windsor.jpg|thumb|K2 sustainable apartments in [[Windsor, Victoria]], Australia by DesignInc (2006) features [[passive solar building design|passive solar design]], recycled and sustainable materials, [[photovoltaic cells]], [[wastewater]] treatment, [[Rainwater harvesting|rainwater collection]] and [[solar hot water]].]]
[[File:Passivhaus section en.jpg|thumb|The [[passivhaus]] standard combines a variety of techniques and technologies to achieve ultra-low energy use.]]

Shown is the town's new art center, which integrates its own solar panels and wind generators for energy self-sufficiency.]]

[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] over the entire life cycle of a building is the most important goal of sustainable architecture. [[Architect]]s use many different passive and active techniques to reduce the energy needs of buildings and increase their ability to capture or generate their own energy.&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown"&gt;M. DeKay &amp; G.Z. Brown, Sun Wind &amp; Light, architectural design strategies, 3rd ed. ''Wiley'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One of the keys to exploit local environmental resources and influence energy-related factors such as daylight, solar heat gains and ventilation is the use of [[site analysis]].

===Heating, ventilation and cooling system efficiency===
Numerous passive architectural strategies have been developed over time. Examples of such strategies include the arrangement of rooms or the sizing and orientation of windows in a building,&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown" /&gt; and the orientation of facades and streets or the ratio between building heights and street widths for urban planning.&lt;ref name ="Montavon"&gt;M. Montavon, Optimization of Urban Form by the Evaluation of the Solar Potential, ''EPFL'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An important and [[Cost-effectiveness|cost-effective]] element of an efficient [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC)]] system is a [[Building insulation|well-insulated building]]. A more efficient building requires less heat generating or dissipating power, but may require more ventilation capacity to expel [[indoor air quality|polluted indoor air]].

Significant amounts of energy are flushed out of buildings in the water, air and [[compost]] streams. [[Commercial off-the-shelf|Off the shelf]], on-site energy recycling technologies can effectively recapture [[Waste-to-energy|energy from waste]] hot water and stale air and transfer that energy into incoming fresh cold water or fresh air. Recapture of energy for uses other than gardening from compost leaving buildings requires centralized [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digesters]].

HVAC systems are powered by motors. [[Copper]], versus other metal conductors, helps to improve the electrical energy efficiencies of motors, thereby enhancing the sustainability of electrical building components. 

Site and building orientation have some major effects on a building's HVAC efficiency.

[[Passive solar building design]] allows buildings to harness the energy of the sun efficiently without the use of any [[active solar]] mechanisms such as [[photovoltaic cell]]s or [[solar hot water|solar hot water panels]]. Typically [[passive solar]] building designs incorporate materials with high [[thermal mass]] that retain heat effectively and strong [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] that works to prevent heat escape. Low energy designs also requires the use of solar shading, by means of awnings, blinds or shutters, to relieve the solar heat gain in summer and to reduce the need for artificial cooling.  In addition, [[low energy building]]s typically have a very low surface area to volume ratio to minimize heat loss. This means that sprawling multi-winged building designs (often thought to look more "organic") are often avoided in favor of more centralized structures. Traditional cold climate buildings such as [[United States|American]] [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] [[saltbox]] designs provide a good historical model for centralized heat efficiency in a small-scale building.

Windows are placed to maximize the input of heat-creating light while minimizing the loss of heat through glass, a poor insulator. In the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]] this usually involves installing a large number of south-facing windows to collect direct sun and severely restricting the number of north-facing windows. Certain window types, such as double or triple glazed [[insulated glazing|insulated windows]] with gas filled spaces and [[Low-emissivity|low emissivity (low-E)]] coatings, provide much better insulation than single-pane glass windows. Preventing excess solar gain by means of solar shading devices in the summer months is important to reduce cooling needs.  [[Deciduous trees]] are often planted in front of windows to block excessive sun in summer with their leaves but allow light through in winter when their leaves fall off.  Louvers or light shelves are installed to allow the sunlight in during the winter (when the sun is lower in the sky) and keep it out in the summer (when the sun is high in the sky).  [[Coniferous]] or [[Evergreen|evergreen plants]] are often planted to the north of buildings to shield against cold north winds.

In colder climates, heating systems are a primary focus for sustainable architecture because they are typically one of the largest single energy drains in buildings.

In warmer climates where cooling is a primary concern, passive solar designs can also be very effective. Masonry [[building material]]s with [[high thermal mass]] are very valuable for retaining the cool temperatures of night throughout the day. In addition builders often opt for sprawling single story structures in order to maximize surface area and heat loss.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Buildings are often designed to capture and channel existing winds, particularly the especially cool winds coming from nearby [[Body of water|bodies of water]]. Many of these valuable strategies are employed in some way by the [[Vernacular architecture|traditional architecture]] of warm regions, such as south-western mission buildings.

In climates with four seasons, an integrated energy system will increase in efficiency: when the building is well insulated, when it is sited to work with the forces of nature, when heat is recaptured (to be used immediately or stored), when the heat plant relying on [[fossil fuel]]s or electricity is greater than 100% efficient, and when [[renewable energy]] is used.

===Renewable energy generation===

====Solar panels====
{{Main|Solar PV}}
[[Active solar]] devices such as [[photovoltaic]] [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s help to provide sustainable electricity for any use. Electrical output of a solar panel is dependent on orientation, efficiency, latitude, and climate—solar gain varies even at the same latitude. Typical efficiencies for commercially available PV panels range from 4% to 28%. The low efficiency of certain photovoltaic panels can significantly affect the payback period of their installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=shamilton |url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/Moduleprices.htm |title=Module Pricing |publisher=Solarbuzz |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low efficiency does not mean that solar panels are not a viable energy alternative. In Germany for example, Solar Panels are commonly installed in residential home construction.

Roofs are often angled toward the sun to allow photovoltaic panels to collect at maximum efficiency. In the northern hemisphere, a true-south facing orientation maximizes yield for solar panels. If true-south is not possible, solar panels can produce adequate energy if aligned within 30° of south. However, at higher latitudes, winter energy yield will be significantly reduced for non-south orientation.

To maximize efficiency in winter, the collector can be angled above horizontal Latitude +15°. To maximize efficiency in summer, the angle should be Latitude -15°. However, for an annual maximum production, the angle of the panel above horizontal should be equal to its latitude.&lt;ref&gt;G.Z. Brown, Mark DeKay. Sun, Wind &amp; Light. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind turbines====
{{Main|Wind power}}
The use of undersized wind turbines in energy production in sustainable structures requires the consideration of many factors. In considering costs, small wind systems are generally more expensive than larger wind turbines relative to the amount of energy they produce. For small wind turbines, maintenance costs can be a deciding factor at sites with marginal wind-harnessing capabilities. At low-wind sites, maintenance can consume much of a small wind turbine's revenue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brower, Michael; ''Cool Energy, The Renewable Solution to Global Warming''; Union of Concerned Scientists, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbines begin operating when winds reach 8&amp;nbsp;mph, achieve energy production capacity at speeds of 32-37&amp;nbsp;mph, and shut off to avoid damage at speeds exceeding 55&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The energy potential of a wind turbine is proportional to the square of the length of its blades and to the cube of the speed at which its blades spin. Though wind turbines are available that can supplement power for a single building, because of these factors, the efficiency of the wind turbine depends much upon the wind conditions at the building site. For these reasons, for wind turbines to be at all efficient, they must be installed at locations that are known to receive a constant amount of wind (with average wind speeds of more than 15&amp;nbsp;mph), rather than locations that receive wind sporadically.&lt;ref&gt;Gipe, Paul; ''Wind Power: Renewable Energy for Farm and Business''; Chelsea Green Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A small wind turbine can be installed on a roof. Installation issues then include the strength of the roof, vibration, and the turbulence caused by the roof ledge. Small-scale rooftop wind turbines have been known to be able to generate power from 10% to up to 25% of the electricity required of a regular domestic household dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article706123.ece The Sunday Times, "Home wind turbines dealt killer blow"], April 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Turbines for residential scale use are usually between 7 feet (2 m) to 25 feet (8 m) in diameter and produce electricity at a rate of 900 watts to 10,000 watts at their tested wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidcityjournal.com "Wind turbine, a powerful investment", Rapid City Journal], February 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Building integrated wind turbine performance can be enhanced with the addition of an aerofoil wing on top of a roof mounted turbine.&lt;ref&gt;Factors enhancing aerofoil wings for wind energy harnessing in buildings,7 November 2013 http://bse.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/11/07/0143624413509097.abstract?papetoc&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar water heating====
{{Main|Solar thermal power}}
[[Solar water heater]]s, also called solar domestic hot water systems, can be a cost-effective way to generate hot water for a home. They can be used in any climate, and the fuel they use—sunshine—is free.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Solar Water Heaters, March 24, 2009 [http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of solar water systems- active and passive. An active solar collector system can produce about 80 to 100 gallons of hot water per day. A passive system will have a lower capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/Plumbing/solar-water-heaters |title=Solar Water Heaters |publisher=Toolbase.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415230351/http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/Plumbing/solar-water-heaters |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also two types of circulation, direct circulation systems and indirect circulation systems. Direct circulation systems loop the domestic water through the panels. They should not be used in climates with temperatures below freezing. Indirect circulation loops glycol or some other fluid through the solar panels and uses a heat exchanger to heat up the domestic water.

The two most common types of collector panels are Flat-Plate and Evacuated-tube. The two work similarly except that evacuated tubes do not convectively lose heat, which greatly improves their efficiency (5%-25% more efficient). With these higher efficiencies, Evacuated-tube solar collectors can also produce higher-temperature space heating, and even higher temperatures for absorption cooling systems.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"&gt;John Randolph and Gilbert M. Masters, 2008. "Energy for Sustainability: Technology, Planning, Policy," Island Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric-resistance water heaters that are common in homes today have an electrical demand around 4500&amp;nbsp;kW·h/year. With the use of solar collectors, the energy use is cut in half. The up-front cost of installing solar collectors is high, but with the annual energy savings, payback periods are relatively short.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

====Heat pumps====
Air-source heat pumps (ASHP) can be thought of as reversible air conditioners. Like an air conditioner, an ASHP can take heat from a relatively cool space (e.g. a house at 70&amp;nbsp;°F) and dump it into a hot place (e.g. outside at 85&amp;nbsp;°F). However, unlike an air conditioner, the condenser and evaporator of an ASHP can switch roles and absorb heat from the cool outside air and dump it into a warm house.

Air-source heat pumps are inexpensive relative to other heat pump systems. However, the efficiency of air-source heat pumps decline when the outdoor temperature is very cold or very hot; therefore, they are only really applicable in temperate climates.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

For areas not located in temperate climates, ground-source (or geothermal) heat pumps provide an efficient alternative. The difference between the two heat pumps is that the ground-source has one of its heat exchangers placed underground—usually in a horizontal or vertical arrangement. Ground-source takes advantage of the relatively constant, mild temperatures underground, which means their efficiencies can be much greater than that of an air-source heat pump. The in-ground heat exchanger generally needs a considerable amount of area. Designers have placed them in an open area next to the building or underneath a parking lot.

Energy Star ground-source heat pumps can be 40% to 60% more efficient than their air-source counterparts. They are also quieter and can also be applied to other functions like domestic hot water heating.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

In terms of initial cost, the ground-source heat pump system costs about twice as much as a standard air-source heat pump to be installed. However, the up-front costs can be more than offset by the decrease in energy costs. The reduction in energy costs is especially apparent in areas with typically hot summers and cold winters.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

Other types of heat pumps are water-source and air-earth. If the building is located near a body of water, the pond or lake could be used as a heat source or sink. Air-earth heat pumps circulate the building's air through underground ducts. With higher fan power requirements and inefficient heat transfer, Air-earth heat pumps are generally not practical for major construction.

Some examples of sustainable building materials include recycled [[denim]] or blown-in fiber glass insulation, sustainably harvested wood, [[Trass]], [[Linoleum]],&lt;ref&gt;Duurzaam en Gezond Bouwen en Wonen by Hugo Vanderstadt,&lt;/ref&gt; sheep wool, [[concrete]] (high and ultra high performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1864315,00.html|title=Building Materials: Cementing the Future|first=PETER|last=GUMBEL|date=4 December 2008|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; roman self-healing concrete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6250-6_9|title=Self Healing Materials|first=Henk M.|last=Jonkers|date=23 March 2018|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|pages=195–204|via=link.springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), panels made from paper flakes, baked earth, rammed earth, clay, vermiculite, flax linnen, sisal, seegrass, expanded clay grains, coconut, wood fiber plates, calcium sand stone, locally obtained stone and rock, and [[bamboo]], which is one of the strongest and fastest growing [[woody plant]]s, and non-toxic low-[[Volatile Organic Compound|VOC]] glues and paints. Vegetative cover or shield over building envelopes also helps in the same. Paper which is fabricated or manufactured out of forest wood is supposedly hundred percent recyclable .thus it regenerates and saves almost all the forest wood that it takes during its manufacturing process.

===Recycled materials===

[[File:Discarded dreams 2 of 3.jpg|thumb|Recycling items for building]]
Sustainable architecture often incorporates the use of recycled or second hand materials, such as [[reclaimed lumber]] and [[Copper in architecture|recycled copper]]. The reduction in use of new materials creates a corresponding reduction in [[embodied energy]] (energy used in the production of materials). Often sustainable architects attempt to retrofit old structures to serve new needs in order to avoid unnecessary development.  Architectural salvage and reclaimed materials are used when appropriate. When older buildings are demolished, frequently any good wood is reclaimed, renewed, and sold as flooring. Any good [[dimension stone]] is similarly reclaimed.  Many other parts are reused as well, such as doors, windows, mantels, and hardware, thus reducing the consumption of new goods.  When new materials are employed, green designers look for materials that are rapidly replenished, such as [[bamboo]], which can be harvested for commercial use after only 6 years of growth, [[sorghum]] or wheat straw, both of which are waste material that can be pressed into panels, or [[cork oak]], in which only the outer bark is removed for use, thus preserving the tree.  When possible, building materials may be gleaned from the site itself; for example, if a new structure is being constructed in a wooded area, wood from the trees which were cut to make room for the building would be re-used as part of the building itself.

===Lower volatile organic compounds===

Low-impact building materials are used wherever feasible: for example, insulation may be made from low VOC ([[volatile organic compound]])-emitting materials such as [[Building insulation materials#Cotton batts (Blue Jean)|recycled denim]] or [[cellulose insulation]], rather than the [[building insulation materials]] that may contain carcinogenic or toxic materials such as formaldehyde. To discourage insect damage, these alternate insulation materials may be treated with [[boric acid]]. Organic or milk-based paints may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Information on low-emitting materials may be found at www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php [http://www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php IAQ links] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611163251/http://www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php |date=2008-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a common fallacy is that "green" materials are always better for the health of occupants or the environment. Many harmful substances (including formaldehyde, arsenic, and asbestos) are naturally occurring and are not without their histories of use with the best of intentions. A study of emissions from materials by the State of California has shown that there are some green materials that have substantial emissions whereas some more "traditional" materials actually were lower emitters. Thus, the subject of emissions must be carefully investigated before concluding that natural materials are always the healthiest alternatives for occupants and for the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Building Emissions Study accessed at [http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/GreenBuilding/Specs/Section01350/METStudy.htm California Integrated Waste Management web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) can be found in any indoor environment coming from a variety of different sources. VOCs have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility, and are suspected of causing [[sick building syndrome]] type symptoms. This is because many VOCs have been known to cause sensory irritation and central nervous system symptoms characteristic to sick building syndrome, indoor concentrations of VOCs are higher than in the outdoor atmosphere, and when there are many VOCs present, they can cause additive and multiplicative effects.

Green products are usually considered to contain fewer VOCs and be better for human and environmental health.   A case study conducted by the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the University of Miami that compared three green products and their non-green counterparts found that even though both the green products and the non-green counterparts both emitted levels of VOCs, the amount and intensity of the VOCs emitted from the green products were much safer and comfortable for human exposure.&lt;ref&gt;James, J.P., Yang, X.

===Materials sustainability standards===
Despite the importance of materials to overall building sustainability, quantifying and evaluating the sustainability of building materials has proven difficult. There is little coherence in the measurement and assessment of materials sustainability attributes, resulting in a landscape today that is littered with hundreds of competing, inconsistent and often imprecise eco-labels, [[Technical standard|standards]] and [[certifications]].  This discord has led both to confusion among consumers and commercial purchasers and to the incorporation of inconsistent sustainability criteria in larger building certification programs such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]].  Various proposals have been made regarding rationalization of the standardization landscape for sustainable building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1944523|title=Toward a Rational Framework for Sustainable Building Materials Standards|first1=Jorge L.|last1=Contreras|first2=Hannah|last2=Roth|first3=Meghan|last3=Lewis|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste management==
Waste takes the form of spent or useless materials generated from households and businesses, construction and demolition processes, and manufacturing and agricultural industries. These materials are loosely categorized as municipal solid waste, construction and demolition (C&amp;D) debris, and industrial or agricultural by-products.&lt;ref&gt;John Ringel., University of Michigan, Sustainable Architecture, Waste Prevention [http://www.umich.edu/~nppcpub/resources/compendia/ARCHpdfs/ARCHr&amp;rA.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainable architecture focuses on the on-site use of [[waste management]], incorporating things such as [[grey water]] systems for use on garden beds, and [[composting toilet]]s to reduce sewage. These methods, when combined with on-site food waste composting and off-site recycling, can reduce a house's waste to a small amount of packaging waste. 

==Building placement==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
One central and often ignored aspect of sustainable architecture is building placement. Although the ideal environmental home or office structure is often envisioned as an isolated place, this kind of placement is usually detrimental to the environment. First, such structures often serve as the unknowing frontlines of [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Second, they usually increase the [[energy consumption]] required for transportation and lead to unnecessary auto emissions. Ideally, most building should avoid suburban sprawl in favor of the kind of light [[Urban planning|urban development]] articulated by the [[New Urbanist]] movement. Careful mixed use zoning can make commercial, residential, and light industrial areas more accessible for those traveling by foot, bicycle, or public transit, as proposed in the [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]]. The study of [[Permaculture]], in its holistic application, can also greatly help in proper building placement that minimizes energy consumption and works with the surroundings rather than against them, especially in rural and forested zones.

==Sustainable building consulting==
A sustainable building consultant may be engaged early in the design process, to forecast the sustainability implications of [[building materials]], orientation, glazing and other physical factors, so as to identify a sustainable approach that meets the specific requirements of a project.

Norms and standards have been formalized by performance-based rating systems e.g. [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/?CategoryID=19|title=U.S. Green Building Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Energy Star]] for homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/|title=ENERGY STAR - The Simple Choice for Energy Efficiency|website=www.energystar.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; They define [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] to be met and provide [[Performance metric|metrics]] and testing to meet those benchmarks. It is up to the parties involved in the project to determine the best approach to meet those standards.

==Changing pedagogues==

Critics of the reductionism of modernism often noted the abandonment of the teaching of architectural history as a causal factor. The fact that a number of the major players in the shift away from modernism were trained at Princeton University's School of Architecture, where recourse to history continued to be a part of design training in the 1940s and 1950s, was significant. The increasing rise of interest in history had a profound impact on architectural education. History courses became more typical and regularized. With the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture, several PhD programs in schools of architecture arose in order to differentiate themselves from art history PhD programs, where architectural historians had previously trained. In the US, [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] were the first, created in the mid-1970s, followed by [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Among the founders of new architectural history programs were [[Bruno Zevi]] at the Institute for the History of Architecture in Venice, Stanford Anderson and Henry Millon at MIT, Alexander Tzonis at the [[Architectural Association]], Anthony Vidler at Princeton, [[Manfredo Tafuri]] at the University of Venice, [[Kenneth Frampton]] at [[Columbia University]], and Werner Oechslin and Kurt Forster at [[ETH Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]], “The Disciplinary Dislocations of Architectural History,” ''Journal of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]]'' 58/3 (September 1999), p. 489. See also other articles in that issue by Eve Blau, Stanford Anderson, Alina Payne, Daniel Bluestone, Jeon-Louis Cohen and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “sustainability” in relation to architecture has so far been mostly considered through the lens of building technology and its transformations. Going beyond the technical sphere of “green” design, invention and expertise, some scholars are starting to position architecture within a much broader cultural framework of the [[Nature#Human interrelationship|human interrelationship with nature]]. Adopting this framework allows tracing a rich history of cultural debates about our relationship to nature and the environment, from the point of view of different historical and geographical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Brian|title=Urban Design Ecologies: AD Reader|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-97405-6|pages=220–237|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470974052.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable urbanism and architecture==
Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=The Charter of the New Urbanism|first=|last=taotiadmin|date=20 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There are conflicting ethical, engineering, and political orientations depending on the viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Sustainability - Architecture: between Fuzzy Systems and Wicked Problems |author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Blueprints  | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/blueprints21_1.pdf | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt Green Technology has made its headway into the architectural community, the implementation of given technologies have changed the ways we see and perceive modern day architecture. While green architecture has been proven to show great improvements of ways of living both environmentally and technologically the question remains, is all this sustainable? Many building codes have been demeaned to international standards. "LEED" (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design) has been criticized for exercising flexible codes for building to follow. Contractors do this to save as much money as they possibly can. For example, a building may have solar paneling but if the infrastructure of the building's core doesn't support that over a long period of time improvements would have to be made on a constant basis and the building itself would be vulnerable to disasters or enhancements. With companies cutting paths to make shortcuts with sustainable architecture when building their structures it fuels to the irony that the "sustainable" architecture isn't sustainable at all. Sustainability comes in reference to longevity and effectiveness. 

Ethics and Politics also play into sustainable architecture and its ability to grow in urban environment. Conflicting viewpoints between engineering techniques and environmental impacts still are popular issues that resonate in the architectural community. With every revolutionary technology or innovation there comes criticisms of legitimacy and effectiveness when and how it is being utilized. Many of the criticisms of sustainable architecture do not reflect every aspect of it but rather a broader spectrum across the international community.

A '''treebog''' is a type of low-tech [[compost toilet]]. It consists of a raised platform above a compost pile surrounded by densely planted willow trees or other  nutrient-hungry vegetation.  It can be considered an example of [[permaculture]] design, as it functions as a system for converting urine and feces to [[biomass]], without the need to handle excreta. 

==Etymology==
The term "treebog" was coined Jay Abrahams of Biologic Design. ''[[wikt:bog|Bog]]'' is a [[British English]] slang word for [[toilet]], not to be confused with its other meaning of [[wetland]].

==History==
The treebog is a simple method of composting wastes. Abrahams claims that from 1995-2011, around 1500 treebogs may have been built in Britain.&lt;ref name="LivingWoods"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Making of a Biologic Treebog|journal=LivingWoods Magazine|date=January–February 2011|pages=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been on sites ranging from fruit farms, pick-your-own enterprises, campsites, an angling lake, festival sites, remote/low impact dwellings, holiday cottages, allotments, and church yards where there is no mains water supply.

In 2011, Abrahams claimed that the treebog had attracted the attention of NGOs and aid workers who hope to develop its potential for shanty towns or refugee camps - anywhere that water is scarce and the population pressure on resources is high.&lt;ref name="LivingWoods"/&gt;

==Plant growth==
A treebog is simply a controlled [[compost heap]] whose function has been enhanced by use of moisture or nutrient-hungry trees. They use no water, purify waste as they create a biomass resource, and also contain the organic waste material, thus preventing the spread of disease.

The main requirement is that the planted species should be nutrient-hungry. It is a bonus if they can be harvested or [[coppice]]d for productive uses, e.g. willow cultivars. Apart from willow coppice, [[soft fruit]] such as black currants and sweet-smelling herbs such as mint will thrive around a treebog. If left unmanaged, a treebog will soon be surrounded by weed species such as nettles, but a little management and conscious planting can create a fertile and productive [[bog garden]].

Both the solids and liquids are deposited within the treebog base, where the solids compost and the liquids soak through the soil. The associated dense root zone enables the nitrogen to be rapidly absorbed and metabolized by the mycorhyzal species. The feces are contained within the treebog base, which is well ventilated to allow aerobic decomposition to occur, the mineralized material feeding the trees around it. 

==Construction==
A seating platform/cubicle is mounted at least one meter high.  The area beneath the seating platform is enclosed by a double-layer of chicken wire; this acts as an effective child-proof barrier and allows air to circulate through the compost heap.This allows for optimum plant growing conditions.

Sawdust, straw, woodchip, ash or other high-carbon matter is used to balance the high-nitrogen content of the urine. One design used Effective Micro-organism bran, which helped keep the treebog virtually odour free.&lt;ref name="PCMag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/loo-view-build-your-own-treebog | title=A Loo with a View - Build your own Treebog | author=Tim Green | date=18 May 2011 | publisher=Permaculture Magazine | accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The space between the wire is stuffed with straw, which acts as a wick to help sop up excess urine, preventing the likelihood of odour problems due to incomplete biological absorption of the nitrogen from the urine.  The straw-filled wire also enables the pile to be well-aerated whilst acting as a visual screen for the first year’s use.

The structure is surrounded by two closely planted rows of [[Salix viminalis|osier]] or [[Willow#Other|biomass willow]] cuttings; this [[Green wall|living wall]] of willow can then be woven into a hurdle-like structure and its annual growth can be harvested.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12631">'''Variance-based sensitivity analysis''' (often referred to as the '''Sobol method''' or '''Sobol indices''', after [[Ilya M. Sobol]]) is a form of global [[sensitivity analysis]].&lt;ref name="Sobol2001"&gt;Sobol,I.M. (2001), Global sensitivity indices for nonlinear mathematical models and their Monte Carlo estimates. ''MATH COMPUT SIMULAT'',55(1–3),271-280, DOI:10.1016/S0378-4754(00)00270-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Primer"&gt;Saltelli, A., Ratto, M., Andres, T., Campolongo, F., Cariboni, J., Gatelli, D. Saisana, M., and Tarantola, S., 2008, ''Global Sensitivity Analysis. The Primer'', John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Working within a [[probability|probabilistic]] framework, it decomposes the [[variance]] of the output of the model or system into fractions which can be attributed to inputs or sets of inputs. For example, given a model with two inputs and one output, one might find that 70% of the output variance is caused by the variance in the first input, 20% by the variance in the second, and 10% due to [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] between the two. These percentages are directly interpreted as measures of sensitivity. Variance-based measures of sensitivity are attractive because they measure sensitivity across the whole input space (i.e. it is a global method), they can deal with [[nonlinear]] responses, and they can measure the effect of interactions in non-[[Additive map|additive]] systems.&lt;ref name="OAT"&gt;Saltelli, A., Annoni, P., 2010, How to avoid a perfunctory sensitivity analysis, ''Environmental Modeling and Software'' '''25''', 1508–1517.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decomposition of variance==
From a [[black box]] perspective, any [[mathematical model|model]] may be viewed as a function ''Y''=''f''('''X'''), where '''X''' is a vector of ''d'' uncertain model inputs {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;}, and ''Y'' is a chosen univariate model output (note that this approach examines scalar model outputs, but multiple outputs can be analysed by multiple independent sensitivity analyses). Furthermore, it will be assumed that the inputs are [[Independence (probability theory)|independently]] and [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly]] distributed within the unit hypercube, i.e. &lt;math&gt; X_i \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; i=1,2,...,d &lt;/math&gt;. This incurs no loss of generality because any input space can be transformed onto this unit hypercube. ''f''('''X''') may be decomposed in the following way,&lt;ref name="Sob1"&gt;Sobol’, I. (1990). Sensitivity estimates for nonlinear mathematical models. ''Matematicheskoe Modelirovanie'' '''2''', 112–118. in Russian, translated in English in Sobol’ , I. (1993). Sensitivity analysis for non-linear mathematical models. ''Mathematical Modeling &amp; Computational Experiment (Engl. Transl.)'', 1993, '''1''', 407–414.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Y = f_0 + \sum_{i=1}^d f_i(X_i) + \sum_{i&lt;j}^{d} f_{ij}(X_i,X_j) + \cdots + f_{1,2,\dots,d}(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a function of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; a function of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. A condition of this decomposition is that,

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 f_{i_1 i_2 \dots i_s}(X_{i_1},X_{i_2},\dots,X_{i_s}) dX_{k}=0, \text{ for } k = i_1,...,i_s &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. all the terms in the functional decomposition are [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]. This leads to definitions of the terms of the functional decomposition in terms of conditional expected values,

:&lt;math&gt; f_0 = E(Y) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f_i(X_i) = E(Y|X_i) - f_0 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f_{ij}(X_i,X_j) = E(Y|X_i,X_j) - f_0 - f_i - f_j &lt;/math&gt;

From which it can be seen that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the effect of varying ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; alone (known as the [[main effect]] of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the effect of varying ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously, ''additional to the effect of their individual variations''. This is known as a second-order [[Interaction (statistics)|interaction]]. Higher-order terms have analogous definitions.

Now, further assuming that the ''f''('''X''') is [[Square-integrable function|square-integrable]], the functional decomposition may be squared and integrated to give,

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 f^2(\mathbf{X}) d\mathbf{X} - f_0^2 = \sum_{s=1}^d \sum_{i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_s}^d \int f_{i_1 \dots i_s}^2 dX_{i_1} \dots dX_{i_s} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the left hand side is equal to the variance of ''Y'', and the terms of the right hand side are variance terms, now decomposed with respect to sets of the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. This finally leads to the decomposition of variance expression,

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^d V_i + \sum_{i&lt;j}^{d} V_{ij} + \cdots + V_{12 \dots d}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; V_{i} = \operatorname{Var}_{X_i} \left( E_{\textbf{X}_{\sim i}} (Y \mid X_{i}) \right) &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; V_{ij} = \operatorname{Var}_{X_{ij}} \left( E_{\textbf{X}_{\sim ij}} \left( Y \mid X_i, X_j\right)\right) - \operatorname{V}_{i} - \operatorname{V}_{j} &lt;/math&gt;

and so on. The ''X''&lt;sub&gt;~''i''&lt;/sub&gt; notation indicates the set of all variables ''except'' ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The above variance decomposition shows how the variance of the model output can be decomposed into terms attributable to each input, as well as the interaction effects between them. Together, all terms sum to the total variance of the model output.

==First-order indices==

A direct variance-based measure of sensitivity ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, called the "first-order sensitivity index", or "main effect index" is stated as follows,&lt;ref name="Sob1" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; S_i = \frac{V_i}{\operatorname{Var}(Y)} &lt;/math&gt;

This is the contribution to the output variance of the main effect of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, therefore it measures the effect of varying ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''alone'', but averaged over variations in other input parameters. It is standardised by the total variance to provide a fractional contribution. Higher-order interaction indices ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; and so on can be formed by dividing other terms in the variance decomposition by Var(''Y''). Note that this has the implication that,

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^d S_i + \sum_{i&lt;j}^{d} S_{ij} + \cdots + S_{12 \dots d} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

==Total-effect index==
Using the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; and higher-order indices given above, one can build a picture of the importance of each variable in determining the output variance. However, when the number of variables is large, this requires the evaluation of 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;-1 indices, which can be too computationally demanding. For this reason, a measure known as the "Total-effect index" or "Total-order index", ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Ti''&lt;/sub&gt;, is used.&lt;ref&gt;Homma, T. and A. Saltelli (1996). Importance measures in global sensitivity analysis of nonlinear models. ''Reliability Engineering and System Safety'', '''52''', 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; This measures the contribution to the output variance of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''including'' all variance caused by its interactions, of any order, with any other input variables. It is given as,

:&lt;math&gt; S_{Ti} = \frac{E_{\textbf{X}_{\sim i}} \left(\operatorname{Var}_{X_i} (Y \mid \mathbf{X}_{\sim i}) \right)}{\operatorname{Var}(Y)} = 1 - \frac{\operatorname{Var}_{\textbf{X}_{\sim i}} \left(E_{X_i} (Y \mid \mathbf{X}_{\sim i}) \right)}{\operatorname{Var}(Y)} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that unlike the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^d S_{Ti} \geq 1 &lt;/math&gt;

due to the fact that the interaction effect between e.g. ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is counted in both ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Ti''&lt;/sub&gt; ''and'' ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Tj''&lt;/sub&gt; In fact, the sum of the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Ti''&lt;/sub&gt; will only be equal to 1 when the model is purely [[Additive map|additive]].

==Calculation of indices==
For analytically tractable functions, the indices above may be calculated analytically by evaluating the integrals in the decomposition. However, in the vast majority of cases they are estimated – this is usually done by the [[Monte Carlo method]].

===Sampling sequences===
[[File:Construction of ABi matrices in monte carlo estimation of sensitivity indices.png|thumb | right | 500px | An example of construction of '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; matrices with ''d''=3 and ''N''=4.]]
The Monte Carlo approach involves generating a sequence of randomly distributed points inside the unit hypercube (strictly speaking these will be [[Pseudorandom number generator|pseudorandom]]). In practice, it is common to substitute random sequences with [[low-discrepancy sequence]]s to improve the efficiency of the estimators. This is then known as the [[quasi-Monte Carlo method]]. Some low-discrepancy sequences commonly used in sensitivity analysis include the [[Sobol sequence]] and the [[Latin hypercube sampling|Latin hypercube]] design.

===Procedure===
To calculate the indices using the (quasi) Monte Carlo method, the following steps are used:&lt;ref name="Sobol2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Primer" /&gt;

# Generate an ''N''×2''d'' sample matrix, i.e. each row is a sample point in the hyperspace of 2''d'' dimensions. This should be done with respect to the probability distributions of the input variables.
# Use the first ''d'' columns of the matrix as matrix '''A''', and the remaining ''d'' columns as matrix '''B'''. This effectively gives two independent samples of ''N'' points in the ''d''-dimensional unit hypercube.
# Build ''d'' further ''N''×''d'' matrices '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, for ''i'' = 1,2,...,d, such that the ''i''th column of '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to the ''i''th column of '''B''', and the remaining columns are from '''A'''.
# The '''A''', '''B''', and the ''d'' '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; matrices in total specify ''N''(''d''+2) points in the input space (one for each row). Run the model at each design point in the '''A''', '''B''', and '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; matrices, giving a total of ''N''(''d''+2) model evaluations –  the corresponding f('''A'''), f('''B''') and f('''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;) values.
# Calculate the sensitivity indices using the estimators below.

The accuracy of the estimators is of course dependent on ''N''. The value of ''N'' can be chosen by sequentially adding points and calculating the indices until the estimated values reach some acceptable convergence. For this reason, when using low-discrepancy sequences, it can be advantageous to use those that allow sequential addition of points (such as the Sobol sequence), as compared to those that do not (such as Latin hypercube sequences).

===Estimators===
There are a number of possible Monte Carlo estimators available for both indices. Two that are currently in general use are,&lt;ref name="Sobol2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Saltelli, Paola Annoni, Ivano Azzini, Francesca Campolongo, Marco Ratto, and Stefano Tarantola. Variance based sensitivity analysis of model output. Design and estimator for the total sensitivity index. ''Computer Physics Communications'', 181(2):259{270, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}_{X_i}(E_{\mathbf{X}_{\sim i}}(Y|X_i)) \approx
  { \frac {1}{N}  \sum_{j=1}^{N}  f \left (  \mathbf{B} \right )_{j}  \left ( f   \left ( \mathbf{A}^i_B \right )_{j} -   f \left ( \mathbf{A} \right )_{j}  \right ) } &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt; E_{\mathbf{X}_{\sim i}}\left(\operatorname{Var}_{X_i}\left(Y \mid \mathbf{X}_{\sim i} \right) \right) \approx {\frac {1}{2N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}
\left( f   \left ( \mathbf{A} \right )_{j} - f  \left (\mathbf{A}^i_B \right )_{j}\right )^2
} &lt;/math&gt;

for the estimation of the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Ti''&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.

===Computational expense===
For the estimation of the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Ti''&lt;/sub&gt; for all input variables, ''N''(''d''+2) model runs are required. Since ''N'' is often of the order of hundreds or thousands of runs, computational expense can quickly become a problem when the model takes a significant amount of time for a single run. In such cases, there are a number of techniques available to reduce the computational cost of estimating sensitivity indices, such as [[Sensitivity analysis#Emulators|emulators]], [[Sensitivity analysis#High-Dimensional Model Representations (HDMR)|HDMR]] and [[Sensitivity analysis#Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST)|FAST]].

'''''Verstehen''''' ({{IPA-de|fɛɐˈʃteːən}}, literally: "to understand"), in the context of German philosophy and [[social science]]s in general, has been used since the late 19th century – in English as in German – with the particular sense of the "interpretive or participatory" examination of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Weber/Whome.htm |title=Verstehen: The Sociology of Max Weber |access-date=2011-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307133502/http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Weber/Whome.htm |archive-date=2011-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is closely associated with the work of the German [[sociologist]], [[Max Weber]], whose [[antipositivism]] established an alternative to prior [[sociological positivism]] and [[economic determinism]], rooted in the analysis of [[social action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/anti_positivism.htm "Anti-positivism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403001519/http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/anti_positivism.htm |date=April 3, 2012 }} at Historylearningsite.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; In [[anthropology]], ''Verstehen'' has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture attempts to relate to it and understand others. 

''Verstehen'' is now seen as a concept and a method central to a rejection of positivistic social science (although Weber appeared to think that the two could be united). ''Verstehen'' refers to understanding the [[Meaning-making|meaning]] of action from the actor's point of view. It is entering into the shoes of the other, and adopting this research stance requires treating the actor as a subject, rather than an object of your observations. It also implies that unlike objects in the natural world human actors are not simply the product of the pulls and pushes of external forces. Individuals are seen to create the world by organizing their own understanding of it and giving it meaning. To do research on actors without taking into account the meanings they attribute to their actions or environment is to treat them like objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitbucket.icaap.org/dict.pl?term=VERSTEHEN "Verstehen"]: entry in the ''Online Dictionary of the Social Sciences''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning&lt;!--'Interpretative sociology', 'Interpretative sociology' and 'Verstehende Soziologie' redirect here--&gt;==
'''Interpretative sociology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''verstehende Soziologie'') is the study of society that concentrates on the meanings people associate to their social world.&lt;ref name="Sociology"&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretative sociology strives to show that reality is constructed by people themselves in their daily lives.&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt;

''Verstehen'' roughly translates to "meaningful understanding" or "putting yourself in the shoes of others to see things from their perspective". Interpretive sociology differs from positivist sociology in three ways:
#Interpretive sociology deals with the meaning attached to behavior, unlike positivist sociology which focuses on action. 
#Interpretive sociology sees reality as being constructed by people, unlike positivist sociology which sees an objective reality "out there". 
#Interpretive sociology relies on qualitative data, unlike positivist sociology which tends to make use of quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt;

==Dilthey and hermeneutics==
''Verstehen'' was introduced into philosophy and the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaften]]'') by the German [[Historism|historist]] philosopher [[Johann Gustav Droysen]]. He first made a distinction between nature and history in terms of the categories of space and time. The method of the [[natural sciences]] (''Naturwissenschaften'') is explanation (''[[wikt:erklären|erklären]]&lt;!--German verb--&gt;''), while that of history is understanding (''verstehen&lt;!--German verb--&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droyen, ''Historik: Vorlesungen über Enzyklopädie und Methodologie der Geschichte''. Stuttgart: Fromann-Holzboog, [1858] 1977: 22, 150f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droyen, ''Grundriss der Historik'', Berlin 1862, p. 4 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droysen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7_lrAAAAIAAJ&amp;hl= ''Grundriss der Historik''], Verlag von Veit &amp; Comp., 1868, p. 11: §14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lars Udehn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lu4rCkENQvcC&amp;dq= ''Methodological Individualism: Background, History and Meaning''], Routledge, 2001, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Verstehen'' was later used by the German philosopher [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Ideen über eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologie'', Berlin 1894, p. 1314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Introduction to the Human Sciences''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the first-person participatory perspective that agents have on their individual experience as well as their culture, history, and society. In this sense, it is developed in the context of the theory and practice of ''interpretation'' (as understood in the context of [[hermeneutics]]) and contrasted with the external objectivating third-person perspective of ''explanation'' (''das Erklären'') in which human agency, subjectivity, and its products are analyzed as effects of impersonal natural forces in the natural sciences and social structures in sociology.

Twentieth-century philosophers such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Gadamer, ''[[Truth and method]]'', Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; have been critical of what they considered to be the romantic and subjective character of ''Verstehen'' in Dilthey, although both Dilthey and the early Heidegger were interested in the "[[facticity]]" and "life-context" of understanding, and sought to universalize it as the way humans exist through language on the basis of [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bcOjTiSNFZoC&amp;dq= ''Ontology: The Hermeneutics of Facticity''], Indiana University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Bambach, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xaWALY0raiEC&amp;dq= ''Heidegger, Dilthey, and the crisis of historicism''], Cornell University Press, 1995, p. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verstehen'' also played a role in [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Alfred Schutz]]'s analysis of the "[[lifeworld]]." [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Karl-Otto Apel]] further transformed the concept of ''Verstehen'', reformulating it on the basis of a transcendental-pragmatic philosophy of language and the theory of communicative action.

==Weber and the social sciences==
[[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]]&lt;ref&gt;Georg Simmel, ''Die probleme der Gechichtsphilosophie. Eine erkentnistheoretische Studie''. Munich: Verlag von Dunker und Humboldt, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced interpretive understanding (''Verstehen'') into [[sociology]], where it has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture (such as an [[anthropologist]] or [[sociologist]]) relates to an indigenous people or sub-cultural group on their own terms and from their own point of view, rather than interpreting them in terms of his or her own culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verstehen'' can mean either a kind of [[Empathy|empathic]] or participatory understanding of social phenomena. In anthropological terms this is sometimes described as [[cultural relativism]], especially by those that have a tendency to argue toward universal ideals. In sociology it is an aspect of the comparative-historical approach, where the context of a society like twelfth century "France" can be potentially better understood (''Besserverstehen'') by the sociologist than it could have been by people living in a village in Burgundy. It relates to how people in life give meaning to the social world around them and how the [[social scientist]] accesses and evaluates this "first-person perspective". This concept has been both expanded and criticized by later social scientists. Proponents laud this concept as the only means by which researchers from one culture can examine and explain behaviors in another. While the exercise of ''Verstehen'' has been more popular among social scientists in [[Europe]], such as Habermas, ''Verstehen'' was introduced into the practice of [[sociology]] in the [[United States]] by [[Talcott Parsons]], an American follower of [[Max Weber]]. Parsons used his [[structural functionalism]] to incorporate this concept into his 1937 work, ''The Structure of Social Action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerber|first=John J. Macionis, Linda M.|title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|edition=7th Canadian|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber had more specific beliefs than Marx where he put value to understanding and meaning of key elements—not just with intuition or sympathy with the individual but also the product of "systematic and rigorous research". The goal is to identify human actions and interpreting them as observable events leading us to believe that it not only provides for a good explanation for individual actions but also for group interactions. The meaning attached needs to include constraints and limitations and analyze the motivation for action. Weber believed that this gives the sociologist an advantage over a natural scientist because "We can accomplish something which is never attainable in the natural sciences, namely the subjective understanding of the action of the component individuals" (Weber, Economy and Society, p.&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gingrich|first=Paul|title=Max Weber|url=http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/s30f99.htm|work=Sociology 250|publisher=University of Regina, Department of Sociology and Social Studies|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the social scientific concept of ''Verstehen'' such as [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] and [[Dean MacCannell]] counter that it is simply impossible for a person born of one culture to ever completely understand another culture, and that it is arrogant and conceited to attempt to interpret the significance of one culture's [[symbol]]s through the terms of another (supposedly superior) culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Such criticisms do not necessarily allow for the possibility that ''Verstehen'' does not involve "complete" understanding.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Just as in physical science all knowledge is asymptotic to the full explanation, a high degree of cross-cultural understanding is very valuable. The opposite of ''Verstehen'' would seem to be ignorance of all but that which is immediately observable, meaning that we would not be able to understand any time and place but our own. A certain level of interpretive understanding is necessary for our own cultural setting, however, and it can easily be argued that even the full participant in a culture does not fully understand it in every regard.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Critics also believe that it is the sociologist's job to not just observe people and what people do but also share in their world of meaning and come to appreciate why they act as they do. Subjective thoughts and feelings regarded as bias in the sciences is an important aspect to be controlled for while doing sociological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yun Posun''' ({{korean|hangul=윤보선|hanja=尹潽善}}; {{IPA-ko|jun.bo.sʌn}} or {{IPA-ko|jun|}} {{IPA-ko|po.sʌn|}}; August 26, 1897 – July 18, 1990) was a [[Korea]]n independence activist and politician, who served as [[President of South Korea]] from 1960 to 1962 before being replaced by the long-serving [[Park Chung-hee]] as a result of the [[May 16 coup]] in 1961.

Having entered politics after [[World War II]], Yun served as Secretary to Korea's [[Chief of Staff]] in 1947; and was [[Mayor of Seoul]] in 1948. He served as [[Commerce Minister]] for the newly liberated Korea from 1949–1950. In 1955 Yun helped establish the South Korean Democratic Party.

==Early life==
Yun Posun was born in Dunpo-myeon, [[Asan]], [[South Chungcheong Province]] in 1897. He was a son of Yun Chiso (윤치소, 1871–1944) and Lady Yi Beomsuk (이범숙, 1876–1969). Yun studied in the [[United Kingdom]], graduating with a [[Master of Arts]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1930. He returned to Korea in 1932.

==Political career==
Yun entered politics in 1945 following [[Gwangbokjeol]] (Liberation Day). The first [[Doctor of Philosophy]] from Princeton University in Korea, as well as first President of South Korea, Dr. [[Syngman Rhee]], was his [[mentor]]. By 1947, Yun was serving as Secretary to the Korean Chief of Staff. In 1948, Rhee appointed Yun to the position of mayor of [[Seoul]]. A year later, he was made Minister of Commerce and Industry. However, Yun soon began to disagree with Rhee's authoritarian policies.

While serving as president of the [[Red Cross Society]], he was elected to the National Assembly in 1954. A year later, he co-founded the opposition South Korean Democratic Party. In 1959, he became a representative to the Supreme Council of the Democratic Party.

==Short term presidency==
Rhee's government was ousted by a student-led, pro-democracy uprising in 1960; and Yun was elected president on August 13, and appointed [[Chang Myon]] as First Minister. In response to the authoritarian excesses of Rhee's regime, South Korea had switched to a parliamentary system; so in fact Yun served merely as a figurehead.

Following [[Park Chung Hee]]'s coup in 1961, Yun stayed in his post in order to provide some legitimacy to the new regime, but resigned on March 22, 1962. In the following years, Yun received suspended sentences several times for anti-government activities. He opposed Park's authoritarian rule&lt;ref name="Yun Bo-Seon criticizes US policy towards Korea."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Japan-Korea Normalization Process and Korean Anti-Americanism|url=https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0004-4687(196604)6%3A4%3C241%3ATJNPAK%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ran for president twice, in 1963 and 1967, losing each time.

Yun retired from active politics in 1980 and focused his life on cultural activities until his death on July 18, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yun Po Sun, 92, Dies; Ex-President of Korea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/19/obituaries/yun-po-sun-92-dies-ex-president-of-korea.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 19, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
