      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10888">'''African Consensus''' is an [[Economics|economic]] [[paradigm]] proposed in 2011 for [[sustainable development]] in [[Africa]]. It is built on practical experiences across the African continent together with shared experiences from other regions facing similar challenges. It merges existing efforts of [[civil society]] in such areas as [[renewable energy]], community finance and empowerment, [[Organic farming|organic agriculture]] and [[water resource management]], [[Environmental protection|environmental]] and [[endangered species]] protection. It couples these with the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] experiences of business and finance in an attempt to scale these efforts into viable [[economic model]]s. Seeking a pragmatic path for development, it emphasizes the importance of heritage, cultural and identity protection with the need for economic advancement.&lt;ref name="Rio20"&gt;{{cite web|title=AFRICA CONSENSUS STATEMENT TO RIO+20 |url=http://www.nepad.org/system/files/COncensus-english.pdf |website=The Africa Regional Preparatory Conference for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) |publisher=The New Partnership For Africa's Development |accessdate=15 November 2014 |location=Addis Ababa, Ethiopia |date=25 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127144827/http://www.nepad.org/system/files/COncensus-english.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--the misspelling is embedded in the document filename only--&gt;

==African Consensus Forum==
The African Consensus Forum is proposed as an annual event, chaired by [[Tanzania]]'s president [[Jakaya Kikwete]], to convene stakeholders from civil society, government, business and finance. It is intended to address major challenges of development and present a range of concrete experiences, as well as to outline practical solutions that are economically viable and scalable. The annual meeting will initially be held in [[Dar Es Salaam]] with plans for breakout meetings alternating in the five regional zones during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forum Charter|url=http://africanconsensus.org/foundation-documents/forum-charter/|website=African Consensus|publisher=African Consensus Forum|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Consensus Crisis Prevention Center==
The African Consensus Crisis Prevention Center is an anticipated outcome of the Africa Consensus Forum to address crises of violence, which may arise over allocation of resources and resource benefits. African Consensus Forum will seek to anticipate crisis situations and offer a [[Track II diplomacy|second track dialogue process]] toward economic solutions to prevent crisis. The center's work will be hosted by the secretariat. It should coordinate efforts with those initiatives ongoing in the [[African Union]], and other initiatives active on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Onuoha|first1=B|title=Power, conflict and consensus building in Africa: Ideology revisited|journal=African Journal on Conflict Resolution|date=2011|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajcr/article/view/69829|accessdate=15 November 2014|issn=1562-6997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The African Consensus concept emerged during the 2011 [[World Social Forum]] held in [[Dakar]], Senegal. Drafting of the African Consensus Resolution was undertaken by [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] leaders working throughout the event (late January and throughout February 2011). Key spokespersons of the process were West African celebrity rapper [[Didier Awadi]] who is known for his outspoken activism, and Alioune Tine who has been a peace mediator in both [[Darfur]] and [[Ivory Coast]]. Leaders of the African branch of the World Social Forum were also deeply involved in the process.&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"&gt;{{cite web|title=African Consensus Resolution|url=http://www.himalayanconsensus.org/african+resolution|website=Action for Ethnic Diversity and Cultural Sustainable Development|publisher=Himalayan Consensus|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurence Brahm]] was invited by these activists to help articulate the concepts and draft the original African Consensus Declaration that was tabled before the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR) NGO Forum two months later. The African Consensus Declaration was adopted by the ACHPR Forum in [[Gambia]], in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|url=http://www.achpr.org|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2014}}

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] picked up on the ideas in the declaration and held a drafting session in October 2011 to draft a document called "African Consensus Statement to Rio+20". It was presented at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Rio+20) during the conference summer 2012, incorporating the vision into the ideas of inclusive sustainability promoted by the UN system. The two documents – ''African Consensus Declaration'' and the ''African Consensus Statement to Rio+20''&lt;ref name="Rio20"/&gt; – underpin the economic paradigm by building a body of internationally recognized documentation.

In summer 2014, Tanzania's president Jakaya Kikwete summoned Laurence Brahm (the original drafter of the African Consensus Declaration) together with John Masuka (Tanzania's "father of inclusive finance") to the northern State House in [[Dodoma]]. There President Kikwete explained his own intention to convene the African Consensus Forum as a multi-stakeholder process between civil society, business-finance and government. Kikwete was one of the original conveners of the Helsinki Process, in his previous role as Tanzania's foreign minister. The [[Helsinki Process on Globalisation and Democracy]] calls for multi-stakeholder participation in resolving political and leadership challenges. By convening the African Consensus Forum as an extension of the Helsinki Process, Kikwete extended that process from the realm of governance to economics. The Uongozi Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UONGOZI Institute|url=http://www.uongozi.or.tz/|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a leadership organization that is an outcome of the original Helsinki Process, is the body where the African Consensus Institute is to be located. Expectations are for the African Consensus to convene each year in early December.

There is increasing recognition of the notion that Africa must have its own unique economic development paradigm created by Africans themselves. The view has increasingly shifted from the NGO and civil society networks to the mainstream. Books such as ''African Consensus'' by [[Ludger Kühnhardt]], published in 2014, and articles by Kwame Marfo in ''Neo-African Consensus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MARFO|first1=KWAME|title=DEAR GOD: Why are we so poor?|url=http://neoafricanconsensus.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/dear-god-why-are-we-so-poor/|website=Neo-African Consensus|publisher=Neo-African Consensus|accessdate=15 November 2014|date=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Towards a just and sustainable world'' by CIDSE further attest to a global paradigm shift in the development narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nnaemeka|first1=Abonyi Nichodemus|title=Towards an Alternative Development Paradigm for Africa|journal=J Soc Sci|date=2009|volume=21|issue=1|pages=39–48|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JSS/JSS-21-0-000-09-Web/JSS-21-1-000-09-Abst-PDF/JSS-21-1-039-09-707-Nnaemeka-A-N/JSS-21-1-039-09-707-Nnaemeka-A-N-Tt.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core principles and rights==
The African Consensus economic paradigm is based on three core principles:&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;
#Protect [[Multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]], [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous identity]], endangered species and environment; 
#Through community empowerment involving local financing for sustainable and [[socially responsible business]]es; 
#Prioritizing environmental protection and community advancement.

African Consensus seeks to protect three core [[rights]]:&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;
#The right to ethnic diversity 
#The right to culturally sustainable development 
#The right to water, food security and the protection of our natural environment.

African Consensus can be a framework for preventing [[violence]] and [[terrorism]], which are often rooted in both economic and social marginalization of people from different identity groups.&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;

==Core theme==
It is proposed that African Consensus will be built upon the pan-African visions articulated by Mwalimu [[Julius Nyerere]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shivji|first1=Issa G|title=Nyerere, nationalism and Pan-Africanism|url=http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category/features/71793|website=Pambazuka News|publisher=Fahamu|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the global context the challenges of [[global warming|climate change]] and [[Resource depletion|diminishing resources]] as they relate to [[Developing country|developing countries]]. It is intended that it will adopt the multi-stakeholder approach of the Helsinki Process, and hopefully extending that process from politics and governance into the realms of economics, business and finance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Foundation documents==
African Consensus is established as an economic paradigm based on two documents:
#''The African Consensus Declaration'' adopted by the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights NGO Forum convened in Banjul, Gambia, April 2011{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
#''The African Consensus Statement to Rio+20'' submitted by the Economic Commission on Africa jointly with the African Union, African Development Bank, UN ECOSOC, UNDEP and UNEP to the Rio+20 conference in Brazil, July 2012.&lt;ref name="Rio20"/&gt;

On the basis of these two documents African Consensus is intended to evolve during future African Consensus Forum meetings where stakeholders in the African continent – from civil society, business, finance, and government – will convene each year, with regional break-out meetings throughout the year, to define and articulate the aspirations and pathways to African development based on pragmatism, and experiences shared between stakeholders.

The African Consensus Forum "Green-print" will be the annual outcome document of each African Consensus Forum to serve as a [[green growth]] blueprint of development and a continuing reference of best practices articulated by the stakeholders each year.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2601">'''Karl Albert August Ludwig Eichhorn''' (1 October 1856, [[Garlstorf]] – 3 August 1926, [[Braunschweig]]) was a German [[Protestant theologian]]. He was the author of ''Das Abendmahl im Neuen Testament'' and one of the founders of the [[history of religions school]], an approach that sought to understand all religions, including [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], as socio-cultural phenomena that developed in comparable ways. His pioneering work on the role of the contemporary needs, beliefs, and culture that shaped the [[New Testament]] reports of the [[Last Supper]] argued that this early Christian sacramental meal reflected the influence of Near Eastern [[gnostic]] ideas.

[[File:Wiki-anilingus.png|thumb|Depiction of anilingus]]
'''Anilingus''' (from the Latin ''anus'' + ''-lingus'', from ''lingere'', "to lick", variantly  spelled "'''analingus'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms|author =Jordan Tate|year=2007|publisher=DSt. Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-36298-6|pages=8–9, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anal Pleasure &amp; Health: A Guide for Men and Women|author =Jack Morin|year=2000|publisher=Down There Press|isbn=0-940208-20-2|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] act in which a person stimulates the [[human anus|anus]] of another by using the mouth, including lips, tongue, or teeth. It is also called '''anal–oral contact''' and '''anal–oral sex'''; colloquial names include '''rimming''' and '''rim job'''. It may be performed by and on persons of any [[sexual orientation]] for pleasure or as a form of [[erotic humiliation]]. Health risks include [[fecal–oral route|fecal–oral transmission]].
==Etymology==
The term ''anilingus'' entered English through the 1899 F. J. Rebman translation or Edition 10 of [[sexologist]] [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s 1886 book ''[[Psychopathia sexualis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Forsyth. ''The Etymologicon: A Circular Stroll through the Hidden Connections of the English Language''. Icon Books, 2011, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|anilingus|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
===General===
Pleasure for the giver during anilingus is usually based more on the principle of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The anus has a relatively high concentration of [[Nerve|nerve ending]]s and can be an [[erogenous zone]], and the receiver may receive pleasure from external anal stimulation. The person receiving anilingus is regarded as the passive partner in the act, and the person performing anilingus is the active partner. People may engage in anilingus for its own sake, before anal [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] or penetration, or as part of [[foreplay]]. Studies indicate that anilingus is a rare [[Lesbian sexual practices|sexual practice between women]].&lt;ref name="Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"&gt;{{cite book | title = Sexually Transmitted Infections: Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment| publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]] | year = 2011 | pages = 329–330 | accessdate = 14 May 2014 |isbn = 0495812943| url = https://books.google.com/?id=lO5BND02eBwC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=|quote= |author1=Jonathan Zenilman |author2=Mohsen Shahmanesh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Diamant AL, Lever J, Schuster M |title=Lesbians' Sexual Activities and Efforts to Reduce Risks for Sexually Transmitted Diseases |journal=J Gay Lesbian Med Assoc. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=41–8 |date=Jun 2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1009513623365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technique===
Anilingus can involve a variety of techniques to stimulate the anus, including [[kissing]] or licking; it may also involve the tongue moving around the edge of the anus or up and down the insides of the cheeks of the [[buttock]]s, and in and out of the anus.

Anilingus can be performed in a number of [[sex position]]s including:

* the passive partner is on all fours in the [[doggy position]] with the active partner performing anilingus from behind.
* the passive partner is on their back in the [[missionary position]] with their legs raised high with the knees drawn towards their chest, and with some sort of support (such as a pillow) under their hips for comfort and to raise their buttocks. With the partner's anus exposed, the active partner kneels between the partner's legs to perform anilingus.
* the passive partner on top in the [[69 (sex position)|69]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaylifeuk.com/gay-sex-guide/rimming.html|title=Rimming - GayLifeUK|author =Adam Cowell|date=|work=gaylifeuk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morin, J. (1998). Anal pleasure and Health. Oakland, CA: Down there press.&lt;/ref&gt; The passive partner may lie down on the active partner in the missionary position, with legs raised high, from the front to raise the partner's buttocks to perform anilingus on the exposed anus.
* often used in combination with the 69 position detailed above, another position has the active partner lying on their back with the passive partner [[Facesitting|sitting on their face]]. This position allows the "passive" partner to become more active or even completely dominant as they can now easily gyrate their hips and thrust their pelvis.
* the ''[[rusty trombone]]'', in which a male stands while the active partner performs both anilingus from behind, generally from a kneeling position, and also performs [[masturbation]] on the standing partner, thus somewhat resembling someone playing the [[trombone]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;Tate, Jordan.

==Health risks and prevention==

===Health risk===
{{Main|Fecal–oral route}}
Anilingus has potential health risks arising from the oral contact with [[human feces]]. Diseases which may be transmitted by contact with feces include: bacterial diseases including [[shigellosis]] (bacillary dysentery); viral systemic diseases including [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) and [[herpes simplex virus]]; parasites including [[intestinal parasite]]s; and infections and inflammations [[chlamydia infection]], [[gastroenteritis]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[gonorrhea]], [[lymphogranuloma venereum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lgbt.foundation/get-support/for-men/think-you-have-an-sti-/Lymphogranuloma-Venereum|title=Lymphogranuloma Venereum - LGBT Foundation|author =LGBT Foundation|date=|work=lgbt.foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Applying the mouth to the genitals immediately after applying it to the anus can introduce the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' ("''E. coli''") into the [[urethra]], leading to a [[urinary tract infection]]. [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] is not believed to be easily transmitted through anilingus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anilingus with a number of casual partners increases the health risks associated with the practice. Generally, people carrying infections that may be passed on during anilingus appear healthy. [[Intestinal parasite|Parasites]] may be in the feces if undercooked meat was consumed. The feces contain traces of [[hepatitis A]] only if the infected person has eaten contaminated food.

Another recent study suggests a [[correlation]] between [[oral sex]] and [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV because this virus has been implicated in most [[cervical cancer]]s. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral-sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity. Those with more than five oral-sex partners had a 250% increased risk compared with those who never engaged in this activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Prevention===
[[Safe sex]] practices may include thorough washing of the anal region before anilingus to wash away most external fecal particles and reduce the risk of contraction of fecal-sourced infection. An [[enema]] can also reduce the risk of direct fecal contact.&lt;ref name="Castleman"&gt;{{cite web |last = Castleman |first = Michael |date=27 April 2010 |title = Rimming: The curious couple's guide to oral-anal play  |publisher = ''Psychology Today'' |accessdate=23 November 2012 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201004/rimming-the-curious-couples-guide-oral-anal-play}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[dental dam]] may also be used, and another safe sex practice is to avoid unprotected sex which involves [[fellatio]] after anal intercourse.

If the receiving partner has wounds or open sores on the genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in the mouth, or bleeding gums, this poses an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work, and eating crunchy foods (such as potato chips) relatively soon before or after performing anilingus also increases the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and palate. These wounds, even when they are [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting sexually transmitted infections that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.

==As punishment==
Forced and mostly public anilingus was used as a form of humiliation and punishment, usually of prisoners. The use of the practice in the [[Thirty Years' War]] was described by [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]] in ''[[Simplicius Simplicissimus]]'' (1668).&lt;ref&gt;''Simplicissimus, The German Adventurer'', trans. John C. Osborne, Newfound Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-9797292-5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is commonly referred to as "arse licking", and the term is still at times applied to the behaviour of someone who is overly respectful or helpful to someone in authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/arse-licking|title=arse-licking definition and synonyms - Macmillan Dictionary|date=|work=macmillandictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Incarceration in the United States|United States prison system]], anilingus is one of the ways one prisoner pays his dues to another inmate. In [[prison slang]], this activity is known as "tossing a salad".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Byrne | first1 = J. | last2 = Hummer | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1016/j.avb.2007.02.001 | title = In search of the "Tossed Salad Man" (and others involved in prison violence): New strategies for predicting and controlling violence in prison | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 531 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Levin]] for HBO (1996).

'''Antitheism''' (sometimes '''anti-theism''') is the opposition to [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismatheiststheism/a/AntiTheism.htm |title=Atheism and Anti-Theism: What's the Difference? What is Anti-Theism? |author=Austin Cline |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/antitheism |title=antitheism |publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has had a range of applications.  In [[secularism|secular]] contexts, it typically refers to direct opposition to the belief in any [[deity]].

==Opposition to theism==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''antitheist'' as "One opposed to belief in the existence of a god". The earliest citation given for this meaning dates from 1833.&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter OED (1970 reprint) page 78&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Antitheism'' has been adopted as a label by those who regard theism as dangerous, destructive, or encouraging of harmful behavior. [[Christopher Hitchens]] offers an example of this approach in ''[[Letters to a Young Contrarian]]'' (2001), in which he writes: "I'm not even an [[Atheism|atheist]] so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://commonwealthclub.org/archive/01/01-12hitchens-excerpt.html | title = Christopher Hitchens – Book Excerpt | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090915172725/http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/01/01-12hitchens-excerpt.html | archivedate = 2009-09-15 | deadurl = yes}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the idea of God==

Other definitions of antitheism include that of the French Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] (1953) for whom it is "an active struggle against everything that reminds us of God" (p.&amp;nbsp;104), and that of [[Robert Flint]] (1877), Professor of Divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Flint's [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877 was entitled ''Anti-Theistic Theories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Flint| first=Robert| title=Anti-Theistic Theories: Being the [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877| edition=5| year=1894| location=London| publisher=William Blackwood and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it as a very general [[umbrella term]] for all opposition to his own form of theism, which he defined as the "belief that the heavens and the earth and all that they contain owe their existence and continuance to the wisdom and will of a supreme, self-existent, omnipotent, omniscient, righteous, and benevolent Being, who is distinct from, and independent of, what He has created."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In dealing with theories which have nothing in common except that they are antagonistic to theism, it is necessary to have a general term to designate them. Anti-theism appears to be the appropriate word. It is, of course, much more comprehensive in meaning than the term atheism. It applies to all systems which are opposed to theism. It includes, therefore, atheism, but short of atheism there are anti-theistic theories. Polytheism is not atheism, for it does not deny that there is a deity; but it is anti-theistic since it denies that there is only one. Pantheism is not atheism, for it asserts that there is a god; but it is anti-theism, for it denies that god is a being distinct from creation and possessed of such attributes as wisdom, and holiness, and love. Every theory which refuses to ascribe to a god an attribute which is essential to a worthy conception of its character is anti-theistic. Only those theories which refuse to acknowledge that there is evidence even for the existence of a god are atheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Flint also acknowledges that antitheism is typically understood differently from how he defines it. In particular, he notes that it has been used as a subdivision of atheism, descriptive of the view that theism has been disproven, rather than as the more general term that Flint prefers. He rejects ''[[nontheism|non-theistic]]'' as an alternative, "not merely because of its hybrid origin and character, but also because it is far too comprehensive. Theories of physical and mental science are non-theistic, even when in no degree, directly or indirectly, antagonistic to theism."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the existence of a god or gods is frequently referred to as [[dystheism]] (which means "belief in a deity that is not benevolent") or [[misotheism]] (strictly speaking, this means "hatred of God"). Examples of belief systems founded on the principle of opposition to the existence of a god or gods include some forms of [[Atheistic Satanism]] and [[maltheism]].

==Other uses==
{{see also|Misotheism#Terminology}}
Another use of the term ''antitheism'' was coined by [[Christopher New]] in a thought experiment published in 1993. In his article, he imagines what arguments for the existence of an evil god would look like: "Antitheists, like theists, would have believed in an omnipotent, omniscient, eternal creator; but whereas theists in fact believe that the supreme being is also perfectly good, antitheists would have believed that he was perfectly evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=New| first=Christopher|date=June 1993| title=Antitheism – A Reflection| journal=Ratio| volume=6| issue=1| pages=36–43| doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.1993.tb00051.x}}. See also: Daniels, Charles B. (1997). "God, demon, good, evil", ''The Journal of Value Inquiry'', Vol. 31 (2), June, pp.177–181.&lt;/ref&gt; New's usage has reappeared in the work of Wallace A. Murphree.&lt;ref&gt;Murphree, Wallace A. (1997). "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/n458676824862657/ Natural Theology: theism or antitheism]", ''Sophia'', Vol.36 (1), March, pp.75–83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "antitheism" (or the hyphenated "anti-theism") has been recorded in English since 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=antitheism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=antitheism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology|etymological]] roots of the word are the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:ἀντί|anti]]'' and ''[[wikt:θεός#Ancient Greek|theos]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16492">'''Artstor''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that builds and distributes the Digital Library, an online resource of more than 2 million images in the arts, architecture, humanities, and sciences, and Shared Shelf, a Web-based cataloging and image management software service that allows institutions to catalog, edit, store, and share local collections.

== History ==
[[File:Artstor_logo.png|thumb|right|Artstor logo]]
Since 2003, the organization has been an independent non-profit 501(C)(3) organization based in New York. Starting in 2016, it joined in a strategic alliance with [[Ithaka Harbors]], which currently operates the services [[JSTOR]], Portico, and Ithaka S+R.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://artstor.wordpress.com/2016/01/28/artstor-and-ithaka-join-forces/|title=Artstor and ITHAKA join forces. |accessdate=2017-08-04 | work=The Artstor Blog | date=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, as universities and libraries began to convert their slide libraries into local digital image databases, Artstor was created to address the growing need for a shared online image library that would be accessible to educational institutions worldwide. The Artstor Digital Library is intended to reduce redundant efforts of scanning and cataloging thousands of the same images from multiple repositories, and also to enable new digital image collections to be shared for teaching and research. The initiative paired innovative digital image and online technologies with Mellon Foundation’s ongoing mission to support higher education, museums, the arts, and art conservation to “bring about a substantial transformation in art-related teaching, learning, and research.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/05/technology/05MELL.html|title=Departing Harvard Leader to Organize Digital Art. |accessdate=2010-12-29 | work=The New York Times | first=Karen W. | last=Arenson | date=2001-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artstor's primary goals as an organization are: to assemble image collections from across many time periods and cultures; to create an organized, central, and reliable digital resource that supports strictly non-commercial use of images for research, teaching and learning; and to work with the arts and educational communities to develop collective solutions for building, managing and sharing digital images for educational use. Like many non-profits, Artstor has a mixed business model; some services are provided on a fee basis (geared toward the size of the subscribing institution) and others are provided free of charge to the community.

== Digital Library ==
The Artstor Digital Library includes a set of software tools to view, present, and manage images for research and teaching purposes.   There are currently more than 1,500 Artstor institutional subscribers in over 40 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artstor.org/interested-in-participation/i-html/current-participants.shtml|title=Current Participating institutions|accessdate=2010-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101226020135/http://www.artstor.org/interested-in-participation/i-html/current-participants.shtml| archivedate= 26 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[college]]s and [[University|universities]], [[museum]]s, [[Library|libraries]], primary and secondary [[school]]s, and other non-profit organizations.
The Artstor Digital Library offers a wide range of images needed for interdisciplinary teaching and research, including contributions from the leading museums, photo archives, libraries, scholars, photographers, artists, and artists’ estates. These diverse collections include: [[Magnum Photos]], Carnegie Arts of the United States, [[Adam Bartsch|The Illustrated Bartsch]], the Mellon International [[Dunhuang]] Archive, The Huntington Archive of Asian Art, and The [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) Architecture and Design Collection, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Bodleian Library]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artstor.org/what-is-artstor/w-html/collection-status.shtml|title=ARTstor Collection descriptions &amp; status |accessdate=2010-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101226003016/http://www.artstor.org/what-is-artstor/w-html/collection-status.shtml| archivedate= 26 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Library comprises more than one million images from hundreds of collections worldwide. The Digital Library is continually expanded by new contributions such as: Mark Rothko Estate; Latin American Art (Cisneros Collection); [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (SFMOMA); Christopher Roy: African Art and Architecture; [[Berlin State Museums]]; the Gernsheim Corpus of Master Drawings (185,000 images of old master drawings); [[Larry Qualls]] Archive (100,000 images documenting 30 years of [[New York City]] gallery exhibitions); architectural photography from Esto, Canyonlights and ART on FILE; university collections from Harvard and Yale; and historical photo archives such as the [[National Gallery of Art]] and [[Frick Art Reference Library]], among many others.

'''Tools and features'''

Artstor users have the ability to search, organize, present, upload, and share images.  In addition to keyword and advanced searching, users may browse works by geography, classification, or collection name.  Users can zoom in on high-resolution images in the image viewer and review related information in image data records. They can also export images for use in classroom presentations and other non-commercial, educational uses, either as [[JPEG]]s, or presentations for [[PowerPoint]] 2007. Artstor has also developed the Offline Image Viewer (OIV), an alternative tool for giving offline classroom presentations. OIV allows users to download much larger images from Artstor, combine Artstor images with their own content to create digital slide show presentations that feature side-by-side comparisons, zooming and panning, and the ability to customize text on the slides. OIV enables instructors to give reliable classroom presentations using both high-resolution Artstor images and local content without being connected to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artstor.org/using-artstor/u-html/remote-access.shtml|title=Access Artstor-anywhere, anytime|accessdate=2010-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101226013819/http://www.artstor.org/using-artstor/u-html/remote-access.shtml| archivedate= 26 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Artstor Digital Library is accessible through Apple iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, and Android-powered devices, providing read-only features such as searching and browsing, zooming, and viewing saved image groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.artstor.org/wiki/index.php/ARTstor_Mobile|title=ARTstor Mobile-Artstor Help|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shared Shelf ==
Artstor also provides Shared Shelf, a Web-based cataloging and digital media management software service that allows institutions to catalog, edit, store, and share local collections. Shared Shelf was launched in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.middlebury.edu/lis/2011/04/08/shared-shelf-is-launched/|title=Shared Shelf is Launched!|accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artstor worked with ten institutional partners to develop this service: [[Bard College]], [[Colby College]], [[Cornell University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Middlebury College]], [[New York University]], [[Society of Architectural Historians]], [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]], [[University of Miami]], and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://illinoispixels.wordpress.com/2010/07/25/beta-testing-of-shared-shelf/|title=Beta testing of Shared Shelf software|accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other initiatives ==

As part of Artstor's mission of using digital technologies to further education, scholarship, and research worldwide, the organization collaborates with other institutions in the community to offer a number of services, many of them free.

'''Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)'''

Through a collaboration with Artstor, the [[Digital Public Library of America]] (DPLA) is providing free access to more than 10,000 high-quality images and data records from six leading museums: the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], the [[Samuel H. Kress Collection]] at the [[National Gallery of Art]], the [[Walters Art Museum]], the [[Yale Center for British Art]] and the [[Yale University Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artstor.org/news/n-pdf/pr_2013_ARTstorDPLA.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305211317/http://www.artstor.org/news/n-pdf/pr_2013_ARTstorDPLA.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-05 |title=ARTstor to Help Launch the Digital Public Library of America |accessdate=2013-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Images for Academic Publishing (IAP)'''

Artstor’s Images for Academic Publishing (IAP) program makes available publication-quality images for use in scholarly publications free of charge. The IAP program was initiated by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 2007 and is now available as an optional service to all museums who contribute images to the Artstor Digital Library. Scholars can access these images through the Artstor Digital Library at subscribing institutions or can request free access to IAP by contacting Artstor.

Current IAP contributors include Frank Cancian ([[University of California, Irvine]]) (forthcoming), [[Dallas Museum of Art]], [[Getty Research Institute]], [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], Mellink Archive ([[Bryn Mawr College]]), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[Northwestern University Library]], [[Princeton University Art Museum]] (forthcoming), the [[Walters Art Museum]], and the [[Yale University Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artstor.org/what-is-artstor/w-html/services-publishing.shtml|title=Images for Academic Publishing (IAP)|accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Built Works Registry (BWR)'''

Artstor and the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library]] at Columbia University are collaborating on the creation of the Built Works Registry (BWR), a community-generated data resource for architectural works and the built environment. The BWR’s goal is to create the system and tools to enable the gathering and widespread dissemination of a large and growing body of built works information. It will serve scholars, students, educators, librarians, and catalogers from academic and cultural heritage organizations worldwide, and will be openly accessible to the general public. The project is supported by a three-year National Leadership grant awarded by the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] (IMLS).

The [[Getty Research Institute]] (GRI), nine other institutions, and an international advisory board will also participate throughout the three-year project development cycle. BWR data will be contributed to the [[Getty Vocabulary Program]]’s [[Cultural Objects Name Authority]] (CONA) and will be a critical component to the controlled vocabulary warehouse in Shared Shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.columbia.edu/news/libraries/2010/20101001_imls.html|title=Avery Architectural &amp; Fine Arts Library and Artstor Awarded IMLS National Leadership Grant For Built Works Registry|accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Society of Architectural Historians Architecture Resources Archive (SAHARA)'''

The SAH Architecture Resources Archive (SAHARA), an online library of architectural and landscape images for research and teaching, is a collaboration among The [[Society of Architectural Historians]] (SAH), scholars of architectural history, librarians, and Artstor, funded by a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sah.org/publications-and-research/sahara|title=Society of Architectural Historians - SAHARA|accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EMET (Embedded Metadata Extraction Tool)'''

The longest-serving faculty member of the [[University of Maine at Presque Isle]], she joined the staff in 1946 and developed the curriculum for the physical education department. She continued as a classroom instructor until her retirement in 2005. She also made the largest-ever gift to the university, a $500,000 donation toward the establishment of a health and physical education complex which was named in her honor. She was inducted into the [[Maine Women's Hall of Fame]] in 2000 and the Maine Sports Legends Hall of Honors in 2003.

==Early life and education==
Caroline Doris Gentile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/graduationexerci1942unse/graduationexerci1942unse_djvu.txt|title=Graduation Exercises: Newton High School|date=6 June 1942|accessdate=27 February 2016|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Newton, Massachusetts]] to Gerardo Gentile and his wife, Donata Bucchelli Gentile, both immigrants from Italy. She had four brothers and four sisters.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

At Newton High School, she played [[field hockey]], [[soccer]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[tennis]], [[badminton]], and [[bowling]], and was named "most athletic" in her high school [[yearbook]].&lt;ref name=ton&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/newtonian1942newt/newtonian1942newt_djvu.txt|title=Newtonian|publisher=Internet Archive|year=1942|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned her B.S. from [[Boston University College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (Sargent College)|Sargent College]], a unit of [[Boston University]], in 1946, and her M.A. from [[New York University]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=uma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uma.edu/community/maine-womens-hall-of-fame/|title=Maine Women's Hall of Fame Honorees – Caroline Gentile|publisher=[[University of Maine at Augusta]]|year=2016|accessdate=27 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306082338/http://www.uma.edu/community/maine-womens-hall-of-fame/|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also pursued graduate studies at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=uma/&gt;

==Career==
In 1946 she was hired by the Aroostook State Normal School as an instructor for its Health, Physical Education and Recreation (HPER) program, at a starting yearly salary of $1,800.&lt;ref name=natural&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19951025&amp;id=CahJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ig4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4101,2617933&amp;hl=en|title=Veteran gym teacher is a natural educator|first=Gloria|last=Flannery|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=25 October 1995|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gentile was one of seven staff instructors who revived the school, which had been closed during World War II. She developed the curriculum for the physical education department, which began offering a teaching degree in health, physical education, and recreation in 1949.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt; The school went through various name changes until becoming known as the University of Maine at Presque Isle.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt;

In addition to her teaching responsibilities, Gentile assumed leadership roles on campus. She helped establish the faculty union and served as its president on two different occasions; she also twice served as president of the university senate. She chaired the HPER division for two decades. She directed the university's [[Graduation|commencement exercises]] for more than 50 years.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=natural/&gt; She retired on July 1, 2005 with the title of associate professor emeritus of education.&lt;ref name=bene&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2008/09/23/news/down-east/longtime-umpi-benefactor-faculty-member-dies/|title= Long-time UMPI benefactor, faculty member dies|first=Jen|last=Lynds|date=23 September 2008|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the longest-serving faculty member at the University of Maine at Presque Isle.&lt;ref name=bene/&gt;

'''ChIP-on-chip''' (also known as '''ChIP-chip''') is a technology that combines [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] ('ChIP') with [[DNA microarray]] (''"chip"''). Like regular [[Ch-IP|ChIP]], ChIP-on-chip is used to investigate interactions between [[protein]]s and [[DNA]] ''[[in vivo]]''. Specifically, it allows the identification of the [[cistrome]], the sum of [[binding site]]s, for DNA-binding proteins on a genome-wide basis.&lt;ref name="Alpha"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aparicio |first1=O |last2=Geisberg |first2=JV |last3=Struhl |first3=K |year=2004 |title=Chromatin immunoprecipitation for determining the association of proteins with specific genomic sequences ''in vivo'' |journal=Current Protocols in Cell Biology|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |location=University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA |volume=Chapter 17 |issue=2004 |pages=Unit 17.7 |issn=1934-2616 |doi=10.1002/0471143030.cb1707s23  |pmid=18228445 |isbn=978-0-471-14303-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whole-genome analysis can be performed to determine the locations of binding sites for almost any protein of interest.&lt;ref name="Alpha" /&gt; As the name of the technique suggests, such proteins are generally those operating in the context of [[chromatin]]. The most prominent representatives of this class are [[transcription factor]]s, [[DNA replication|replication]]-related proteins, like Origin Recognition Complex Protein ([[Origin Recognition Complex Protein|ORC]]), [[histone]]s, their variants, and histone modifications.

The goal of ChIP-on-chip is to locate protein binding sites that may help identify functional elements in the [[genome]]. For example, in the case of a transcription factor as a protein of interest, one can determine its transcription factor binding sites throughout the genome. Other proteins allow the identification of [[Promoter (biology)|promoter regions]], [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], [[repressors]] and [[Silencer (DNA)|silencing elements]], [[Chromatin insulation|insulators]], boundary elements&lt;!-- Insert Link --&gt;, and sequences that control DNA replication.&lt;ref name="M.J. Buck, J.D. Lieb 2004"&gt;M.J. Buck, J.D. Lieb, ChIP-chip: considerations for the design, analysis, and application of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, Genomics 83 (2004) 349-360.&lt;/ref&gt; If histones are subject of interest, it is believed that the distribution of modifications and their localizations may offer new insights into the mechanisms of [[Gene regulation|regulation]].

One of the long-term goals ChIP-on-chip was designed for is to establish a catalogue of (selected) organisms that lists all [[protein-DNA interaction]]s under various physiological conditions. This knowledge would ultimately help in the understanding of the machinery behind gene regulation, [[cell proliferation]], and disease progression. Hence, ChIP-on-chip offers both potential to complement our knowledge about the orchestration of the genome on the nucleotide level and information on higher levels of information and regulation as it is propagated by research on [[epigenetics]].

== Technological platforms ==
{{See also|DNA microarray|Immunoprecipitation}}

The technical platforms to conduct ChIP-on-chip experiments are [[DNA microarray]]s, or ''"chips"''. They can be classified and distinguished according to various characteristics:

''Probe type'': DNA arrays can comprise either mechanically spotted [[cDNA]]s or [[PCR|PCR-products]], mechanically spotted [[oligonucleotide]]s, or oligonucleotides that are synthesized ''[[in situ]]''. The early versions of microarrays were designed to detect [[RNA]]s from expressed genomic regions ([[open reading frame]]s aka ORFs). Although such arrays are perfectly suited to study [[Expression profiling|gene expression profiles]], they have limited importance in ChIP experiments since most "interesting" proteins with respect to this technique bind in [[intergenic region]]s. Nowadays, even custom-made arrays can be designed and fine-tuned to match the requirements of an experiment. Also, any sequence of nucleotides can be synthesized to cover genic as well as intergenic regions.

''Probe size'': Early version of cDNA arrays had a probe length of about 200bp. Latest array versions use oligos as short as 70- (Microarrays, Inc.) to 25-mers ([[Affymetrix]]). (Feb 2007)

''Probe composition'': There are tiled and non-tiled DNA arrays. Non-tiled arrays use probes selected according to non-spatial criteria, i.e., the DNA sequences used as probes have no fixed distances in the genome. Tiled arrays, however, select a genomic region (or even a whole genome) and divide it into equal chunks. Such a region is called tiled path. The average distance between each pair of neighboring chunks (measured from the center of each chunk) gives the resolution of the tiled path. A path can be overlapping, end-to-end or spaced.&lt;ref&gt;Royce TE, Rozowsky JS, Bertone P, Samanta M, Stolc V, Weissman S, Snyder M, Gerstein M. Related Articles. Issues in the analysis of oligonucleotide tiling microarrays for transcript mapping. Trends Genet. 2005 Aug;21(8):466-75. Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Array size'': The first microarrays used for ChIP-on-Chip contained about 13,000 spotted DNA segments representing all ORFs and intergenic regions from the yeast genome.&lt;ref name="M.J. Buck, J.D. Lieb 2004" /&gt; Nowadays, Affymetrix offers whole-genome tiled yeast arrays with a resolution of 5bp (all in all 3.2 million probes). Tiled arrays for the human genome become more and more powerful, too. Just to name example, Affymetrix offers a set of seven arrays with about 90 million probes, spanning the complete non-repetitive part of the human genome with about 35bp spacing. (Feb 2007)
Besides the actual microarray, other hard- and software equipment is necessary to run ChIP-on-chip experiments. It is generally the case that one company’s microarrays can not be analyzed by another company’s processing hardware. Hence, buying an array requires also buying the associated workflow equipment. The most important elements are, among others, hybridization ovens, chip scanners, and software packages for subsequent numerical analysis of the raw data.

== Workflow of a ChIP-on-chip experiment ==
Starting with a biological question, a ChIP-on-chip experiment can be divided into three major steps: The first is to set up and design the experiment by selecting the appropriate array and probe type. Second, the actual experiment is performed in the wet-lab. Last, during the dry-lab portion of the cycle, gathered data are analyzed to either answer the initial question or lead to new questions so that the cycle can start again.

=== Wet-lab portion of the workflow ===
[[File:ChIP-on-chip wet-lab.png|thumb|400px|Workflow overview of the wet-lab portion of a ChIP-on-chip experiment.]]
In the first step, the protein of interest (POI) is [[cross-link]]ed with the DNA site it binds to in an ''[[in vitro]]'' environment. Usually this is done by a gentle [[formaldehyde]] fixation that is reversible with heat.

Then, the cells are [[Lysis|lysed]] and the DNA is sheared by [[sonication]] or using [[micrococcal nuclease]]. This results in double-stranded chunks of DNA fragments, normally 1 kb or less in length. Those that were [[cross-link]]ed to the POI form a POI-DNA complex.

In the next step, only these complexes are filtered out of the set of DNA fragments, using an [[antibody]] specific to the POI. The antibodies may be attached to a solid surface, may have a magnetic bead, or some other physical property that allows separation of cross-linked complexes and unbound fragments. This procedure is essentially an [[immunoprecipitation]] (IP) of the protein.  This can be done either by using a tagged protein with an antibody against the tag (ex. [[FLAG-tag|FLAG]], [[Hemagglutinin|HA]], c-myc) or with an antibody to the native protein.

The cross-linking of POI-DNA complexes is reversed (usually by heating) and the DNA strands are purified. For the rest of the workflow, the POI is no longer necessary.

After an amplification and [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] step, the single-stranded DNA fragments are labeled with a [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] tag such as Cy5 or Alexa 647.

Finally, the fragments are poured over the surface of the DNA microarray, which is spotted with short, single-stranded sequences that cover the genomic portion of interest. Whenever a labeled fragment "finds" a complementary fragment on the array, they will [[DNA hybridization|hybridize]] and form again a double-stranded DNA fragment.

=== Dry-lab portion of the workflow ===
{{See also|DNA microarray}}
[[File:ChIP-on-chip dry-lab.png|thumb|400px|Workflow overview of the dry-lab portion of a ChIP-on-chip experiment.]]
After a sufficiently large time frame to allow hybridization, the array is illuminated with fluorescent light. Those probes on the array that are hybridized to one of the labeled fragments emit a light signal that is captured by a camera. This image contains all raw data for the remaining part of the workflow.

This raw data, encoded as [[False-color|false-color image]], needs to be converted to numerical values before the actual analysis can be done. The analysis and information extraction of the raw data often remains the most challenging part for ChIP-on-chip experiments. Problems arise throughout this portion of the workflow, ranging from the initial chip read-out, to suitable methods to subtract background noise, and finally to appropriate [[algorithm]]s that [[Normalization (statistics)|normalize]] the data and make it available for subsequent [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], which then hopefully lead to a better understanding of the biological question that the experiment seeks to address. Furthermore, due to the different array platforms and lack of standardization between them, data storage and exchange is a huge problem. Generally speaking, the data analysis can be divided into three major steps:

During the first step, the captured fluorescence signals from the array are normalized, using control signals derived from the same or a second chip. Such control signals tell which probes on the array were hybridized correctly and which bound nonspecifically.

In the second step, numerical and statistical tests are applied to control data and IP fraction data to identify POI-enriched regions along the genome. The following three methods are used widely: [[Median percentile rank]], [[Single-array error]], and [[Sliding-window]]. These methods generally differ in how low-intensity signals are handled, how much background noise is accepted, and which trait for the data is emphasized during the computation. In the recent past, the sliding-window approach seems to be favored and is often described as most powerful.

In the third step, these regions are analyzed further. If, for example, the POI was a transcription factor, such regions would represent its binding sites. Subsequent analysis then may want to infer nucleotide motifs and other patterns to allow functional annotation of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genomics.nchresearch.org/gene_regulation_analysis.html Biomedical Genomics Core - The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
Using [[Tiling array|tiled arrays]], [[ChIP]]-on-chip allows for high resolution of genome-wide maps. These maps can determine the binding sites of many DNA-binding proteins like transcription factors and also chromatin modifications.

Although ChIP-on-chip can be a powerful technique in the area of genomics, it is very expensive. Most published studies using ChIP-on-chip repeat their experiments at least three times to ensure biologically meaningful maps. The cost of the DNA microarrays is often a limiting factor to whether a laboratory should proceed with a ChIP-on-chip experiment. Another limitation is the size of DNA fragments that can be achieved. Most ChIP-on-chip protocols utilize sonication as a method of breaking up DNA into small pieces. However, sonication is limited to a minimal fragment size of 200 bp. For higher resolution maps, this limitation should be overcome to achieve smaller fragments, preferably to single [[nucleosome]] resolution. As mentioned previously, the statistical analysis of the huge amount of data generated from arrays is a challenge and normalization procedures should aim to minimize artifacts and determine what is really biologically significant. So far, application to mammalian genomes has been a major limitation, for example, due to the significant percentage of the genome that is occupied by repeats. However, as ChIP-on-chip technology advances, high resolution whole mammalian genome maps should become achievable.

[[Antibody|Antibodies]] used for [[ChIP]]-on-chip can be an important limiting factor. [[ChIP]]-on-chip requires highly specific antibodies that must recognize its [[epitope]] in free solution and also under fixed conditions. If it is demonstrated to successfully [[immunoprecipitate]] cross-linked [[chromatin]], it is termed "[[ChIP-grade]]". Companies that provide ChIP-grade antibodies include [[Abcam plc|Abcam]], [[Cell Signaling Technology]], Santa Cruz, and Upstate. To overcome the problem of specificity, the protein of interest can be fused to a tag like [[FLAG-tag|FLAG]] or [[Hemagglutinin|HA]] that are recognized by antibodies. An alternative to ChIP-on-chip that does not require antibodies is [[DamID]].

Also available are antibodies against a specific histone modification like [[Histone H3|H3]] tri methyl K4. As mentioned before, the combination of these antibodies and ChIP-on-chip has become extremely powerful in determining whole genome analysis of histone modification patterns and will contribute tremendously to our understanding of the [[histone code]] and epigenetics.

A study demonstrating the non-specific nature of DNA binding proteins has been published in PLoS Biology. This indicates that alternate confirmation of functional relevancy is a necessary step in any ChIP-chip experiment.&lt;ref name="X-Y Li et al., 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transcription Factors Bind Thousands of Active and Inactive Regions in the Drosophila Blastoderm |journal= PLOS Biology|volume= 6|issue= 2|pages= e27|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060027 |pmid= 18271625|pmc= 2235902|year = 2008|last1 = Li|first1 = Xiao-Yong|last2= MacArthur|first2= Stewart|last3= Bourgon|first3= Richard|last4= Nix|first4= David|last5= Pollard|first5= Daniel A.|last6= Iyer|first6= Venky N.|last7= Hechmer|first7= Aaron|last8= Simirenko|first8= Lisa|last9= Stapleton|first9= Mark|last10= Hendriks|first10= Cris L.

== History ==
A first ChIP-on-chip experiment was performed in 1999 to analyze the  distribution of cohesin along [[budding]] [[yeast]] chromosome III.&lt;ref&gt;Blat Y, Kleckner N., Cohesins bind to preferential sites along yeast chromosome III, with differential regulation along arms versus the centric region, Cell (1999) Jul 23;98(2):249-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the genome was not completely represented, the protocol in this study remains equivalent as those used in later studies. The ChIP-on-chip technique using all of the ORFs of the genome (that nevertheless remains incomplete, missing intergenic regions) was then applied successfully in three papers published in 2000 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Lieb, X. Liu, D. Botstein, P.O. Brown, Promoter-specific binding of Rap1 revealed by genome-wide maps of protein-DNA association, Nat. Genet. 28 (2001) 327-334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Ren, F. Robert, J.J. Wyrick, O. Aparicio, E.G. Jennings, I. Simon, J. Zeitlinger, J. Schreiber, N. Nannett, E. Kanin, T.L. Volkert, C.J. Wilson, S.R. Bell, R.A. Young, Genome-wide location and function of DNA binding proteins, Science 290 (2000) 2306-2309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.R. Iyer, C.E. Horak, C.S. Scafe, D. Botstein, M. Snyder, P.O. Brown, Genomic binding sites of the yeast cell-cycle transcription factors SBF and MBF, Nature 409 (2001) 533-538.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors identified binding sites for individual transcription factors in the [[budding]] [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. In 2002, Richard Young’s group &lt;ref&gt;T.I. Lee, N.J. Rinaldi, F. Robert, D.T. Odom, Z. Bar-Joseph, G.K. Gerber, N.M. Hannett, C.T. Harbison, C.M. Thompson, I. Simon, J. Zeitlinger, E.G. Jennings, H.L. Murray, D.B. Gordon, B. Ren, J.J. Wyrick, J.B Tagne, T.L. Volkert, E. Fraenkel, D.K. Gifford, R.A Young, Transcriptional regulatory networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Science 298 (2002) 799-804.&lt;/ref&gt; determined the genome-wide positions of 106 transcription factors using a c-Myc tagging system in yeast. The first demonstration of  the mammalian ChIp-on-chip technique reported the isolation of nine chromatin fragments containing weak and strong E2F binding site was done by Peggy Farnham's lab in collaboration with Michael Zhang's lab and published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Weinmann AS, Bartley SM, Zhang T, Zhang MQ, Farnham PJ. Use of chromatin immunoprecipation to clone novel E2F target promoters., Molecular and Cell Biology 20 (2001)6820-32.&lt;/ref&gt;   This study was followed several months later in a collaboration between the Young lab with the laboratory of Brian Dynlacht which used the ChIP-on-chip technique to show for the first time that E2F targets encode components of the DNA damage checkpoint and repair pathways, as well as factors involved in chromatin assembly/condensation, chromosome segregation, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint&lt;ref&gt;Ren B, Cam H, Takahashi Y, Volkert T, Terragni J, Young RA, Dynlacht BD. E2F integrates cell cycle progression with DNA repair, and G2(M) checkpoints., Genes and Development 16 (2002) 245-56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other applications for ChIP-on-chip include [[DNA replication]], [[genetic recombination|recombination]], and chromatin structure. Since then, ChIP-on-chip has become a powerful tool in determining genome-wide maps of histone modifications and many more transcription factors. ChIP-on-chip in mammalian systems has been difficult due to the large and repetitive genomes. Thus, many studies in mammalian cells have focused on select promoter regions that are predicted to bind transcription factors and have not analyzed the entire genome. However, whole mammalian genome arrays have recently become commercially available from companies like Nimblegen. In the future, as ChIP-on-chip arrays become more and more advanced, high resolution whole genome maps of DNA-binding proteins and chromatin components for mammals will be analyzed in more detail.

==Alternatives==
[[Chip-Sequencing]] is a recently developed technology that still uses chromatin immunoprecipitation to crosslink the proteins of interest to the DNA but then instead of using a micro-array, it uses the more accurate, higher throughput method of sequencing to localize interaction points.

[[DamID]] is an alternative method that does not require antibodies.

[[ChIP-exo]] uses exonuclease treatment to achieve up to single base pair resolution.

A '''change request''' is a [[document]] containing a call for an adjustment of a [[system]]; it is of great importance in the [[change management process]].

[[Image:Example change request.png|right|350px|'''Figure 1''': Example change request for the car industry|alt=]]

A change request is declarative, i.e. it states what needs to be accomplished, but leaves out how the change should be carried out. Important elements of a change request are an ID, the customer (ID), the [[Deadline (time limit)|deadline]] (if applicable), an indication whether the change is required or optional, the change type (often chosen from a domain-specific [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]) and a change [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], which is a piece of narrative (Keller, 2005). An example of a change request can be found in Figure 1 on the right.

Change requests typically originate from one of five sources: 
# problem reports that identify [[Software bug|bugs]] that must be fixed, which forms the most common source
# system enhancement requests from [[User (computing)|users]]
# events in the development of other systems
# changes in underlying structure and or standards (e.g. in software development this could be a new operating system)
# demands from senior management (Dennis, Wixom &amp; Tegarden, 2002).
Additionally, in [[Project Management]], change requests may also originate from an unclear understanding of the goals and the objectives of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Dave. [http://www.pmhut.com/how-to-control-change-requests "How to Control Change Requests"], ''PM Hut'', November 15, 2009. Retrieved on March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Change requests have many different names, which essentially describe the same concept:
* Request For Change (RFC) by Rajlich (1999); RFC is also a common term in [[ITIL]] (Keller, 2005) and [[PRINCE2]] (Onna &amp; Koning, 2003).
* Engineering Change (EC) by Huang and Mak (1999);
* Engineering Change Request (ECR) at Aero (Helms, 2002);
* Engineering Change Order (ECO) by Loch and Terwiesch (1999) and Pikosz and Malmqvist (1998). Engineering Change Order is a separate step after ECR. After ECR is approved by Engineering Department then an ECO is made for making the change;
* Change Notice at Chemical (Helms, 2002);
* Action Request (AR) at ABB Robotics AB (Kajko-Mattson, 1999);
* Change Request (CR) is, among others, used by Lam (1998), Mäkäräinen (2000), Dennis, et al. (2002), Crnkovic, Asklund and Persson-Dahlqvist (2003) and at ABB Automation Products AB (Kajko-Mattsson, 1999).
* Operational Change Request (OCR).
* Enterprise Change Request (ECR).

'''Classical music''' is [[art music]] produced or rooted in the traditions of [[Western culture]], including both [[Religious music|liturgical]] (religious) and [[secular music|secular]] music. While a more precise term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]), this article is about the broad span of time from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"&gt;"Classical", ''The Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music'', ed. Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2007), ''Oxford Reference Online''. Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the [[common practice period|common-practice period]]. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:
* the [[ancient music]] period, before 500 AD
* the [[early music]] period, which includes
** the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] (500–1400) including

European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European classical and some [[popular music]]al forms by its system of [[musical notation|staff notation]], in use since about the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Notation, §III, 1(vi): Plainchant: Pitch-specific notations, 13th–16th centuries|author1=Geoffrey Chew|author2=Richard Rastall|last-author-amp=yes|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--Says absolutely nothing at all about European art music, let alone what may or may not distinguish it from other types of music. Moreover, III, 1(vi) is specifically addressed to developments in the 13th-to-16th centuries, saying nothing about the origins of staff notation.--&gt; Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] (which form the [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[Chord (music)|chords]]), [[tempo]], [[Metre (music)|metre]] and [[rhythm]]s for a piece of music.{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=Staff notation merely indicates pitches and durations. It does not by itself indicate whether these result in melody, bassline, chords}} This can leave less room for practices such as [[musical improvisation|improvisation]] and ''[[ad libitum]]'' [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]], which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Japan, §III, 1: Notation systems: Introduction|author=Malm, W.P.|author2=Hughes, David W.|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=The article states that improvisation "hardly exists in Japanese music."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Notation, §I: General|author=Ian D.

Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song ([[strophic]]) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[fugue]], [[sonata]], and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as [[opera]], [[cantata]], and [[Mass (music)|mass]].&lt;ref name="Julian Johnson 2002 p. 63"&gt;Julian Johnson (2002) ''Who Needs Classical Music?: Cultural Choice and Musical Value'': p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as a golden age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rushton, Julian]], ''Classical Music'', (London, 1994), 10&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from about 1829.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED_Online_Classical"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=The OED Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50040930?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=classical&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|accessdate=May 10, 2007|title=classical, a.|year=2007|quote=1829   V.

Novello Mozart Pilgrimage (1955) 181   This is the place I should come to every Sunday when I wished to hear classical music correctly and judiciously performed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
Given the wide range of styles in European classical music, from Medieval [[plainchant]] sung by monks to Classical and Romantic symphonies for orchestra from the 1700s and 1800s to avant-garde [[atonal]] compositions for solo piano from the 1900s, it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type. However, there are characteristics that classical music contains that few or no other genres of music contain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; such as the use of [[music notation]]{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=If "classical music" began in 500, then at least five centuries of it were without notation.}} and the performance of complex forms of solo instrumental works (e.g., the [[fugue]]). Furthermore, while the symphony did not exist prior to the late 18th century, the [[Orchestra|symphony ensemble]]—and the [[Symphony|works written for it]]—have become a defining feature of classical music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Literature===
The key characteristic of European classical music that distinguishes it from [[popular music]] and [[folk music]] is that the repertoire tends to be written down in [[musical notation]], creating a musical part or [[Sheet music|score]]. This score typically determines details of rhythm, pitch, and, where two or more musicians (whether singers or instrumentalists) are involved, how the various parts are coordinated. The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them: [[fugue]]s, for instance, achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in [[counterpoint]] yet creating a coherent [[Diatonic function|harmonic logic]] that would be difficult to achieve in the heat of live improvisation.&lt;ref name="Knud Jeppesen 2007"&gt;[[Knud Jeppesen]]: "Bach's music grows out of an ideally harmonic background, against which the voices develop with a bold independence that is often breath-taking." Quoted from Adele Katz (1946; reprinted 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=Jeppesen says this as a comparison between Palestrina's contrapuntal writing and Bach's harmonic conception, but this has nothing to do with improvisation, nor with notation.}} The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago. Musical notation enables 2000s-era performers to sing a choral work from the 1300s Renaissance era or a 1700s Baroque concerto with many of the features of the music (the melodies, lyrics, forms, and rhythms) being reproduced.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

That said, the score does allow the interpreter to make choices on how to perform a historical work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} For example, if the tempo is written with an Italian instruction (e.g., Allegro), it is not known exactly how fast the piece should be played. As well, in the Baroque era, many works that were designed for [[basso continuo]] accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument (harpsichord, lute, etc.) should play the chords, which are not notated in the part{{clarify|date=April 2017|reason=Does this uncertainty determine whether the music is "classical" or not?}} (only a [[figured bass]] symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer). The performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece, including the phrasing of melodies, the time taken during [[fermata]]s (held notes) or pauses, and the use (or choice not to use) of effects such as vibrato or glissando (these effects are possible on various stringed, brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice).

Although Classical music in the 2000s has lost most of its tradition for [[musical improvisation]], from the Baroque era to the Romantic era, there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era. In the Baroque era, organ performers would improvise [[prelude (music)|preludes]], keyboard performers playing [[harpsichord]] would improvise [[chord (music)|chords]] from the [[figured bass]] symbols beneath the bass notes of the basso continuo part and both vocal and instrumental performers would improvise [[musical ornament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Solis, Bruno Nettl. ''Musical Improvisation: Art, Education, and Society.'' University of Illinois Press, 2009. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Sebastian Bach was particularly noted for his complex improvisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/MusicPapers/baroque.html |title=On Baroque Improvisation |publisher=Community.middlebury.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classical era, the composer-performer Mozart was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles.&lt;ref&gt;David Grayson. Mozart: Piano Concertos Nos. 20 and 21. Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classical era, some virtuoso soloists would improvise the [[cadenza]] sections of a concerto. During the Romantic era, Beethoven would improvise at the piano.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Skowroneck. ''Beethoven the Pianist''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see [[#Improvisation|Improvisation]].

===Instrumentation and vocal practices===
{{See also|Woodwind section|Brass section|String section|Percussion section|Keyboard section}}
The instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-19th century (often much earlier) and systematised in the 18th and 19th centuries. They consist of the instruments found in an [[orchestra]] or in a [[concert band]], together with several other solo instruments (such as the [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], and [[organ (music)|organ]]). The symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music&lt;ref name="Kirgiss" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--There is no mention of orchestras at all on this page.--&gt; and includes members of the [[string instrument|string]], [[woodwind]], [[brass instrument|brass]], and [[percussion]] families of instruments. The concert band consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families. It generally has a larger variety and number of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section. However, many concert bands use a [[double bass]]. The vocal practices changed over the classical period, from the single line monophonic [[Gregorian chant]] done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, [[polyphonic]] choral works of the Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time.

====Medieval music====
Many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist, but in different forms. Medieval instruments included the [[flute]], the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]]. As well, early versions of the [[Organ (music)|organ]] and [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]) existed. Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly, often self accompanied with a [[drone (music)|drone]] note, or occasionally in parts. From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into ''haut'' (loud, shrill, outdoor instruments) and ''bas'' (quieter, more intimate instruments).{{sfn|Bowles|1954|loc=119 et passim}} During the [[Early Middle Ages|earlier medieval period]], the vocal music from the [[liturgy|liturgical]] genre, predominantly [[Gregorian chant]], was [[Monophony|monophonic]], using a single, unaccompanied vocal melody line.&lt;ref name="Hoppin57"&gt;Hoppin (1978) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] vocal genres, which used multiple independent vocal melodies, began to develop during the [[High Middle Ages|high medieval era]], becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century.

====Renaissance music====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared, only to be re-created in order to perform music on period instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were members of [[Guild]]s and they included the [[slide trumpet]], the wooden [[cornet]], the valveless [[trumpet]] and the [[sackbut]]. Stringed instruments included the [[viol]], the [[rebec]], the harp-like [[lyre]], the [[hurdy-gurdy]], the [[lute]], the [[guitar]], the [[cittern]], the [[Bandora (instrument)|bandora]], and the [[orpharion]]. Keyboard instruments with strings included the [[harpsichord]] and the [[virginal]]s.{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Isn't the virginals a type of harpichord? If not, then the dedicated article linked here needs to be corrected.--&gt; Percussion instruments include the [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], the [[Jew's harp]], the [[tambourine]], the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums. Woodwind instruments included the double reed [[shawm]], the [[reed pipe]], the [[bagpipe]], the [[transverse flute]], the [[Recorder (instrument)|recorder]], the [[dulcian]], and the [[crumhorn]]. Vocal music in the Renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style. The principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms (such as the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]) for their own designs. Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the [[madrigal comedy]], and the [[intermedio]] are seen. Around 1597, Italian composer [[Jacopo Peri]] wrote ''[[Dafne]]'', the first work to be called an [[opera]] today. He also composed [[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]], the first opera to have survived to the present day.

====Baroque music====
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}
Baroque instruments included some instruments from the earlier periods (e.g., the hurdy-gurdy and recorder) and a number of new instruments (e.g, the oboe, bassoon, cello, contrabass and fortepiano). Some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse, such as the shawm and the wooden cornet. The key Baroque instruments for strings included the [[Baroque violin|violin]], [[viol]], [[viola]], [[viola d'amore]], [[cello]], [[contrabass]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]] (which often played the [[basso continuo]] parts), [[mandolin]], [[cittern]], [[Baroque guitar]], [[harp]] and hurdy-gurdy. Woodwinds included the [[Baroque flute]], [[Baroque oboe]], [[rackett]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and the [[bassoon]]. Brass instruments included the [[cornett]], [[natural horn]], [[Baroque trumpet]], [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]] and the [[trombone]]. Keyboard instruments included the [[clavichord]]&lt;!--the [[tangent piano]] --&gt;, the [[harpsichord]], the [[Organ (music)|pipe organ]], and, later in the period, the [[fortepiano]] (an early version of the piano). Percussion instruments included the [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[tambourine]] and the [[castanets]].

One major difference between Baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in Baroque ensembles were much less standardized. Whereas a classical era [[string quartet]] consists almost exclusively of two violins, a viola and a cello, a Baroque or Classical-era group accompanying a soloist or opera{{non sequitur |date=June 2018 |reason=comparing a Classical-era string quartet with an orchestra from the same period makes nonsense of the comparison of Baroque and Classical usage of instruments}} could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments (e.g., pipe organ, harpsichord, or clavichord),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--Who claims that clavichords could be used to accompany soloists or operas?--&gt; additional stringed chordal instruments (e.g., a lute) and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo, including bowed strings, woodwinds and brass instruments (e.g., a cello, contrabass, viol, bassoon, serpent, etc.).

Vocal developments in the Baroque era included the development of [[opera]] types such as [[opera seria]] and [[opéra comique]], and related forms such as [[oratorio]]s and [[cantata]]s.&lt;ref name="BritannicaCantata"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cantata|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/cantata-music|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BritannicaOratorio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oratorio|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/oratorio|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical music====
{{or-section|date=April 2017}}
The term "classical music" has two meanings: the broader meaning includes all Western art music from the Medieval era to the 2000s, and the specific meaning refers to the [[art music]] from the 1750s to the early 1820s—the period of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. This section is about the more specific meaning. Classical era musicians continued to use many of instruments from the Baroque era, such as the cello, contrabass, recorder, trombone, timpani, fortepiano (the precursor to the modern [[piano]]) and organ. While some Baroque instruments fell into disuse (e.g., the theorbo and rackett), many Baroque instruments were changed into the versions that are still in use today, such as the Baroque violin (which became the [[violin]]), the Baroque oboe (which became the [[oboe]]) and the Baroque trumpet, which transitioned to the regular valved trumpet. During the Classical era, the stringed instruments used in orchestra and [[chamber music]] such as [[string quartet]]s were standardized as the four instruments which form the [[string section]] of the [[orchestra]]: the violin, viola, cello and double bass. Baroque-era stringed instruments such as fretted, bowed [[viol]]s were phased out. Woodwinds included the [[basset clarinet]], [[basset horn]], [[clarinette d'amour]], the Classical [[clarinet]], the [[chalumeau]], the flute, oboe and bassoon. Keyboard instruments included the [[clavichord]] and the [[fortepiano]]. While the [[harpsichord]] was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the 1750s and 1760s, it fell out of use in the end of the century. Brass instruments included the [[buccin]], the [[ophicleide]] (a replacement for the bass [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], which was the precursor of the [[tuba]]) and the [[natural horn]].

====Romantic music====
In the Romantic era, the modern [[piano]], with a more powerful, sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate-sounding fortepiano. In the orchestra, the existing Classical instruments and sections were retained ([[string section]], woodwinds, brass and percussion), but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller, bigger sound. For example, while a Baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players, a Romantic orchestra could have as many as ten. "As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers." &lt;ref name="classicfm.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/discover/periods/romantic/romantic-music-beginners-guide/#FaXJhIVlfVSph9bq.97 |title=Romantic music: a beginner's guide – Music Periods |publisher=Classic FM |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; New woodwind instruments were added, such as the [[contrabassoon]], [[bass clarinet]] and [[piccolo]] and new percussion instruments were added, including [[xylophone]]s, [[snare drum]]s, [[celesta]]s (a bell-like keyboard instrument), [[bell]]s, and [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]],&lt;ref name="classicfm.com"/&gt; large [[orchestral harp]]s, and even [[wind machine]]s for [[sound effect]]s. [[Saxophone]]s appear in some scores from the late 19th century onwards. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]] and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The [[euphonium]] is featured in a few late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|20th-century]] works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''.

The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornets appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Why single out these composers in particular? Cornets appear regularly in 19th-century scores, alongside trumpets which were regarded as less agile, at least until the end of the century.--&gt; Unless these instruments are played by members doubling on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium for a certain passage), orchestras will use [[freelance]] musicians to augment their regular rosters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Modernist music====

[[Modernism (music)|Modernism in music]] is a philosophical and aesthetic stance underlying the period of change and development in musical language that occurred from 1890 to 1930, a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music, innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic, melodic, sonic, and rhythmic aspects of music, and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of [[modernism]] in the arts of the time. The operative word most associated with it is "innovation".{{sfn|Metzer|2009|loc=3}} Its leading feature is a "linguistic plurality", which is to say that no single [[music genre]] ever assumed a dominant position.{{sfn|Morgan|1984|loc=443}}

==== Contemporary classical music ====
[[Contemporary classical music]] is the period that came into prominence in the mid-1970s.  It includes different variations of [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].&lt;ref&gt;Botstein "[http://www.grovemusic.com Modernism]" §9: The Late 20th Century (subscription access).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.&lt;ref&gt;"Contemporary" in Du Noyer 2003, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Postmodern music ====
&lt;!--Everything in this sections is at odds with the linked article on Postmodern music.--&gt;
[[Postmodern music]] is a period of music that began around 1930.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{harvnb|Karolyi|1994|loc=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|1994|loc=331–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares characteristics with [[postmodern art|postmodernist art]] – that is, art that comes after and reacts against [[modernism]].

==== Post-postmodern instrumentation ====
Many instruments that in the 2010s are associated with popular music filled important roles in early music, such as [[bagpipes]], [[theorbo]]s, [[vihuela]]s, [[hurdy-gurdy|hurdy-gurdies]] (hand-cranked string instruments), [[accordion]]s, [[alphorn]]s, [[Water organ#Hydraulis|hydraulises]], [[Calliope (music)|calliopes]], [[sistrum]]s, and some woodwind instruments such as [[tin whistle]]s, [[panpipes]], [[shawms]] and [[crumhorn]]s. On the other hand, instruments such as the [[acoustic guitar]], once associated mainly with popular music, gained prominence in classical music in the 19th and 20th centuries in the form of the [[classical guitar]] and [[banjo]]. While [[equal temperament]] gradually became accepted as the dominant [[musical temperament]] during the 19th century, different historical temperaments are often used for music from earlier periods. For instance, music of the [[English Renaissance]] is often performed in [[meantone temperament]]. As well, while professional [[orchestra]]s and pop bands all around the world have tuned to an A fixed at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz since the late 19th century, there was historically a great variety in the tuning pitch, as attested to in historical pipe organs that still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of "A:" More about Baroque pitch|url=http://pbosf.blogspot.ca/2010/01/story-of-more-about-baroque-pitch.html|website=Philadelphia Baroque Orchestra|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable source|date=November 2017}}

===Performance===
[[File:Concertband.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Youth [[concert band]] in performance]]

Performers who have studied classical music extensively are said to be "classically trained". This training may come from private lessons from instrument or voice teachers or from completion of a formal program offered by a Conservatory, college or university, such as a [[Bachelor of Music]] or [[Master of Music]] degree (which includes individual lessons from professors). In classical music, "...extensive formal music education and training, often to postgraduate [Master's degree] level" is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inputyouth.co.uk/jobguides/job-classicalmusician.html |title=Job Guide – Classical Musician |publisher=Inputyouth.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance of classical music repertoire requires a proficiency in [[sight-reading]] and [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] playing, [[Harmony|harmonic]] principles, strong [[ear training]] (to correct and adjust pitches by ear), knowledge of [[performance practice]] (e.g., Baroque ornamentation), and a familiarity with the style/musical idiom expected for a given composer or musical work (e.g., a Brahms symphony or a Mozart concerto).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Some "popular" genre musicians have had significant classical training, such as [[Billy Joel]], [[Elton John]], the [[Van Halen]] brothers, [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Ritchie Blackmore]], and [[Dream Theater]] members.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Moreover, formal training is not unique to the classical genre. Many rock and pop musicians have completed degrees in [[Pop music|commercial music]] programs such as those offered by the [[Berklee College of Music]] and many [[jazz]] musicians have completed degrees in music from universities with jazz programs, such as the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and [[McGill University]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Gender of performers====
{{Main article|Women in music}}
Historically, major professional [[orchestra]]s have been mostly or entirely composed of musicians who are men. Some of the earliest cases of [[women in music|women being hired in professional orchestras]] was in the position of [[harp]]ist. The [[Vienna Philharmonic]], for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="The world's greatest orchestras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= 2012-10-24|accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As late as February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute, Dieter Flury, told ''[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".&lt;ref name=WDR5&gt;Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] would be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=1996-02-25 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and the [[International Alliance for Women in Music]]. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony"], ''The New York Times'', February 28, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-albena-danailova-first-female-concertmaster-austria&amp;navi= Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[France 24]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership.

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that while "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists", the [[double bass]], brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras "...are still predominantly male."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 BBC article stated that the "...introduction of [[Blind audition|'blind' auditions]], where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture – Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity===
Works of classical repertoire often exhibit complexity in their use of [[orchestration]], [[counterpoint]], [[harmony]], [[musical development]], [[rhythm]], [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[Texture (music)|texture]], and [[musical form|form]]. Whereas most popular styles are usually written in [[Ternary form|song form]], classical music is noted for its development of highly sophisticated instrumental musical forms,&lt;ref name="Julian Johnson 2002 p. 63"/&gt; like the [[concerto]], [[symphony]] and [[sonata]]. Classical music is also noted for its use of sophisticated vocal/instrumental forms, such as [[opera]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--Who claims opera is a "sophisticated" form?--&gt; In opera, vocal soloists and choirs perform staged dramatic works with an orchestra providing accompaniment. Longer instrumental works are often divided into self-contained pieces, called [[movement (music)|movements]], often with contrasting characters or moods. For instance, symphonies written during the Classical period are usually divided into four movements: (1) an opening Allegro in [[sonata form]], (2) a slow movement, (3) a minuet or scherzo (in a [[triple metre]], such as 3/4), and (4) a final Allegro. These movements can then be further broken down into a hierarchy of smaller units: first [[Section (music)|sections]], then [[Period (music)|periods]], and finally [[Phrase (music)|phrases]].

{{History of Western art music}}
{{Main article|History of music}}
The major time divisions of classical music up to 1900 are the [[Early music]] period, which includes [[Medieval music|Medieval]] (500–1400) and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] (1400–1600) eras, and the [[Common practice period]], which includes the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] (1600–1750), [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] (1750–1820) and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] (1810–1910) eras.} The current period encompasses the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] (1901–2000) and includes most of the Early [[modernism (music)|modern]] musical era (1890–1930), the entire [[high modernism|High modern]] (mid 20th-century), and the first part of the [[Contemporary classical music|Contemporary]] (1945 or 1975–current) or [[postmodern music|Postmodern]] musical era (1930–current). The [[21st-century classical music|21st century]] has so far been a continuation of the same period and the same Contemporary/Postmodern musical era which both began mostly in the 20th-century.

The dates are [[Dates of classical music eras|generalizations]], since the periods and eras overlap and the categories are somewhat arbitrary, to the point that some authorities reverse terminologies and refer to a common practice "era" comprising baroque, classical, and romantic "periods".&lt;ref name="Mode and tempo"&gt;{{cite web |author= Vladimir J. Konecni|title= Mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era |year=2009 |url= https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/36604/1/EMR000064b_Konecni.pdf|accessdate= 17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the use of [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]], which is considered characteristic of the Baroque era (or period), was continued by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], who is classified as typical of the Classical era. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who is often described as a founder of the Romantic era, and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], who is classified as Romantic, also used counterpoint and fugue, but the romantic and sometimes yearning qualities of their music define their era.

The prefix ''neo-'' is used to describe a 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century composition written in the style of an earlier era, such as Classical or Romantic. [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's]] ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'', for example, is a [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] composition because it is stylistically similar to works of the Baroque era.{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--So a "Neo-medieval" work might be so-called because it resembles Renaissance music??--&gt;

===Roots===
{{Main article|Ancient music}}

Burgh (2006), suggests that the roots of Western classical music ultimately lie in ancient Egyptian art music via [[cheironomy]] and the ancient Egyptian orchestra, which dates to 2695 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Listening to Artifacts: Music Culture in Ancient Israel/Palestine|first=Theodore W.|last=Burgh|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark Ltd.|year=2006|isbn=978-0567025524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of individual tones and scales was made by ancient Greeks such as [[Aristoxenus]] and [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref name="Grout73p28"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify [[musical notation]]. Ancient Greek instruments such as the [[aulos]] (a [[reed instrument]]) and the [[lyre]] (a stringed instrument similar to a small harp) eventually led to the modern-day instruments of a classical orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grout88|Grout (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The antecedent to the early period was the era of [[ancient music]] before the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] (476 AD).

===Early period===
{{Main article|Medieval music|Renaissance music}}
{{See also|List of Medieval composers|List of Renaissance composers}}

[[File:Vielle.jpg|thumb|Musician playing the [[vielle]] (fourteenth-century [[Medieval]] [[manuscript]])]]

The Medieval period includes music from after the fall of Rome to about 1400. [[Monophony|Monophonic]] chant, also called plainsong or [[Gregorian chant]], was the dominant form until about 1100.&lt;ref name="Grout73p75"/&gt; Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church.{{sfn|Hall, Neitz, and Battani|2003|p=99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=3fExcE3ouRYC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;vq=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;dq=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;pg=PA173#v=snippet&amp;q=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;f=false |title = Making Music and Having a Blast!: A Guide for All Music Students|first1= Bonnie |last1= Blanchard |first2= Cynthia |last2=Blanchard Acree |publisher = Indiana University Press|date = 2009|isbn = 9780-253003355 |page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fnu0BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=catholic+monks+classical+music#v=onepage&amp;q=catholic+monks+classical+music&amp;f=false|title=The Rough Guide to Classical Music|first=Rough|last=Guides|date=May 3, 2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|accessdate=June 21, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1848366770}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic chant throughout the late [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], including the more complex voicings of [[motet]]s. The Renaissance era was from 1400 to 1600. It was characterized by greater use of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], multiple interweaving melodic lines, and the use of the first [[Bass (sound)|bass instruments]]. Social dancing became more widespread, so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize. It is in this time that the notation of music on a [[staff (music)|staff]] and other elements of [[musical notation]] began to take shape.&lt;ref name="Grout73p61"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; This invention made possible the separation of the [[Musical composition|composition]] of a piece of music from its ''transmission''; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted. With a [[Sheet music|musical score]], a work of music could be performed without the composer's presence.&lt;ref name="Grout73p75"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the movable-type [[printing press]] in the 15th century had far-reaching consequences on the preservation and transmission of music.&lt;ref name="Grout73p175"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 175–76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:white mensural notation.gif|thumb|left|[[Johannes Ockeghem]], Kyrie "Au travail suis" excerpt]]

Typical stringed instruments of the early period include the harp, [[lute]], [[vielle]], and [[psaltery]], while wind instruments included the [[flute]] family (including [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]), [[shawm]] (an early member of the [[oboe]] family), trumpet, and the [[bagpipes]]. Simple [[pipe organ]]s existed, but were largely confined to churches, although there were portable varieties.&lt;ref name="Grout73p72"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the period, early versions of [[keyboard (music)|keyboard]] instruments like the [[clavichord]] and [[harpsichord]] began to appear. Stringed instruments such as the [[viol]] had emerged by the 16th century, as had a wider variety of brass and reed instruments. Printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments, as well as instruction in their use.&lt;ref name="Grout73p222"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 222–225&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Medieval composers include [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Francesco Landini]], and [[Johannes Ciconia]].

Notable Renaissance composers include [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[John Dunstaple]], [[Johannes Ockeghem]], [[Orlande de Lassus]], [[Guillaume Du Fay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Thomas Tallis]], [[William Byrd]], [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]], [[John Dowland]], [[Jacob Obrecht]], [[Adrian Willaert]], [[Jacques Arcadelt]], and [[Cipriano de Rore]].

===Common-practice period===
The [[common practice period]] is usually defined as the era between the formation and the dissolution of the hegemony{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} of common-practice [[tonality]].&lt;!-- sentence copied in part from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_practice_period&amp;oldid=799911529--&gt;  The term usually spans roughly two-and-a-half centuries, encompassing the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods.

====Baroque music====
{{Main article|Baroque music}}
{{See also|List of Baroque composers}}

[[File:Baschenis - Musical Instruments.jpg|thumb|Baroque instruments including [[hurdy-gurdy]], [[harpsichord]], [[bass viol]], [[lute]], [[baroque violin|violin]], and [[baroque guitar]]]]

Baroque music is characterized by the use of complex tonal [[counterpoint]] and the use of a [[basso continuo]], a continuous bass line. Music became more complex in comparison with the simple songs of all previous periods.&lt;ref name=Kirgiss&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirgiss|first=Crystal|title=Classical Music|year=2004|page=6|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|isbn=978-1583406748}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of the [[sonata form]] took shape in the [[canzona]], as did a more formalized notion of [[theme and variations]]. The tonalities of [[major and minor]] as means for managing dissonance and [[chromaticism]] in music took full shape.&lt;ref name="Grout73p300"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 300–32&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Baroque era, keyboard music played on the [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] became increasingly popular, and the violin family of stringed instruments took the form generally seen today. Opera as a staged musical drama began to differentiate itself from earlier musical and dramatic forms, and vocal forms like the [[cantata]] and [[oratorio]] became more common.&lt;ref name="Grout73p341"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 341–55&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalists for the first time began adding extra notes to the music.&lt;ref name=Kirgiss/&gt; Instrumental ensembles began to distinguish and standardize by size{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=as far as I know, instrumental ensembles were far from being standardized in size by Bach's time}}, giving rise to the early orchestra for larger ensembles, with [[chamber music]] being written for smaller groups of instruments where parts are played by individual (instead of massed) instruments. The [[concerto]] as a vehicle for solo performance{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=and what of the concerto grosso?}} accompanied by an orchestra became widespread.

The theories surrounding [[equal temperament]] began to be put in wider practice, especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments. Although Bach did not use equal temperament, as a modern piano is generally tuned, changes in the temperaments from the [[meantone|meantone system]], common at the time, to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable, made possible Bach's ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.&lt;ref name="Grout73p378"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

Important composers of this era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], and [[Heinrich Schütz]].

====Classical-era (or -period) music====
{{Main article|Classical period (music)}}
{{See also|List of Classical-era composers}}

[[File:Haydnportrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809) c.&amp;nbsp;1770]]

The Classical era, from about 1750 to 1820, established many of the norms of composition, presentation, and style, and was also when the piano became the predominant keyboard instrument. The ''basic'' forces required for an [[orchestra]] became somewhat standardized (although they would grow as the potential of a wider array of instruments was developed in the following centuries). Chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8 to 10 performers for [[serenade#Classical and Romantic eras|serenades]]. [[Opera]] continued to develop, with regional styles in Italy, France, and German-speaking lands. The ''[[opera buffa]]'', a form of comic opera, rose in popularity. The [[symphony]] came into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill. Orchestras no longer required a [[harpsichord]] (which had been part of the traditional ''continuo'' in the Baroque style), and were often led by the lead violinist (now called the [[concertmaster]]).&lt;ref name="Grout73p463"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind instruments became more refined in the Classical era. While [[double reed|double-reed]] instruments like the [[oboe]] and [[bassoon]] became somewhat standardized in the Baroque, the [[clarinet]] family of [[single reed]]s was not widely used until [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] expanded its role in orchestral, chamber, and concerto settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward Kingdon|first1=Martha|title=Mozart and the clarinet|issue=2|pages=126–153|url=https://academic.oup.com/ml/article-abstract/XXVIII/2/126/1375956?redirectedFrom=PDF|journal=Music and Letters|volume=XXVIII|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en|doi=10.1093/ml/XXVIII.2.126|date=1 April 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major composers of this period include [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Muzio Clementi]], [[Antonio Salieri]], and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]].

====Romantic-era music====
{{Main article|Romantic music}}
{{See also|List of Romantic-era composers}}

The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling [[romanticism]] in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like [[nocturne]]s, [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]], and [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized.&lt;ref name="Swafford200"&gt;[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"&gt;[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; The [[art song]] (or ''Lied'') came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of [[grand opera]], ultimately transcended by [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring cycle]].&lt;ref name="Grout73p595"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 595–612&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, musical institutions emerged from the control of wealthy patrons, as composers and musicians could construct lives independent of the nobility. Increasing interest in music by the growing middle classes throughout western Europe spurred the creation of organizations for the teaching, performance, and preservation of music. The piano, which achieved its modern construction in this era (in part due to industrial advances in [[metallurgy]]) became widely popular with the middle class, whose demands for the instrument spurred a large number of piano builders. Many symphony orchestras date their founding to this era.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"/&gt; Some musicians and composers were the stars of the day; some, like [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Niccolò Paganini]], fulfilled both roles.&lt;ref name="Grout73p543"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

The family of instruments used, especially in orchestras, grew. A wider array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger roles, as the introduction of [[rotary valve]]s made it possible for them to play a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"/&gt; [[Gustav Mahler]]'s 1906 [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 8]], for example, has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pitcher|first=John|date=January 2013|title=Nashville Symphony|url=|journal=American Record Guide|volume=76, no. 1|pages=8–10|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world. There was also a rise, especially toward the end of the era, of [[nationalism in music]] (echoing, in some cases, political sentiments of the time), as composers such as [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], and [[Antonín Dvořák]] echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions.&lt;ref name="Grout73p634"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 634, 641–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent composers of this era include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Johann Strauss II]].

Prominent composers of the early 20th century include [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Aram Khachaturian]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Edvard Grieg]], and [[Béla Bartók]]. Although composers of this time can be considered Romantic, usually their works are not in the style of the period.{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}

{{See also| High modernism|List of 20th-century classical composers|List of 21st-century classical composers}}

Encompassing a wide variety of [[Post-romanticism|post-Romantic]] styles composed through the year 2000, 20th-century classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, neoclassical, neoromantic, neomedieval, and postmodern styles of composition. [[Modernism (music)|Modernism]] (1890–1930) marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the common practice period, such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. The high-modern era saw the emergence of neo-classical and [[serial music]]. A few authorities have claimed high-modernism as the beginning of [[postmodern music]] from about 1930.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Karolyi says nothing at all about high modernism, let along equate it with the postmodern era, the beginning of which he plants firmly in 1930.--&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Meyer does not equate high modernism with post-modernism.--&gt; Others have more or less equated postmodern music with the "contemporary music" composed from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 1995, 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beard and Gloag|2005|loc=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in classical music===
{{see also|Women in classical music}}
Almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the [[Western canon|standard concert repertoire]] are male composers, even though there has been a [[List of female composers|large number of women composers]] throughout the classical music period. Musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is [[Women in music|music composed by women]] so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name=Citron&gt;Citron, Marcia J. "Gender and the Musical Canon." CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name=Citron /&gt; In the "...''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann|Clara S[c]humann]] is one of the only{{sic}} female composers mentioned."&lt;ref name=rvanews&gt;{{cite web|author=Abbey Philips|url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992|title=The history of women and gender roles in music|publisher=Rvanews.com|date=2011-09-01|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbey Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name=rvanews /&gt;

==Significance of written notation==

===Literalist view of the significance of the score===
While there are differences between particular performances of a classical work, a piece of classical music is generally held to transcend any interpretation of it. The use of musical notation is an effective method for transmitting classical music, since the written music contains the technical instructions for performing the work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The written [[sheet music|score]], however, does not usually contain explicit instructions as to how to interpret the piece in terms of production or performance, apart from directions for [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[tempo]] and expression (to a certain extent). This is left to the discretion of the performers, who are guided by their personal experience and musical education, their knowledge of the work's idiom, their personal artistic tastes, and the accumulated body of historic performance practices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Criticism of the literalist view===
All critics express the opinion that it is only from the mid-19th century, and especially in the 20th century, that the score began to hold such a high significance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Previously, improvisation (in preludes, cadenzas and ornaments), rhythmic flexibility (e.g., [[tempo rubato]]), improvisatory deviation from the score and [[oral tradition]] of playing was integral to the style.{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Which "style"? The "Neoromanticism" of Berlioz? The Romanticism of Schubert? Notre Dame organum?--&gt; Classical musicians tend to use scores and the parts extracted from them to play music. Yet, even with notation providing the key elements of the music, there is considerable latitude in the performance of the works. Some of this latitude results from the inherent limitations of musical notation, though attempts to supplement traditional notation with signs and annotations indicating more subtle nuances tend to overwhelm and paralyse the performer.

Some quotes that highlight a criticism of overvaluing of the score:
* "... one of the most stubborn modern misconceptions concerning baroque music is that a metronomic regularity was intended" (Baroque Interpretation in [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|''Grove'' 5th edition]] by [[Robert Donington]])
* "Too many teachers, conditioned to 20th century ideas, teach Bach and other Baroque music exactly the wrong way. This leads to what musicologist [[Sol Babitz]] calls 'sewing machine Bach'."{{clarify|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--What has this quote to do with over-valuing scores?--&gt;&lt;ref name=conservatories_kill_expression /&gt;
* "... tendency to look alike, sound alike and think alike. The conservatories are at fault and they have been at fault for many years now. Any sensitive musician going around the World has noted the same thing. The conservatories, from Moscow and Leningrad to Juilliard, Curtis and Indiana, are producing a standardized product.&lt;br /&gt;[...] clarity, undeviating rhythm, easy technique, 'musicianship'. I put the word musicianship in quotes, because as often as not, it is a false kind of musicianship—a musicianship that sees the tree and not the forest, that takes care of the detail but ignores the big picture; a musicianship that is tied to the printed note rather than to emotional meaning of a piece.&lt;br /&gt;The fact remains that there is a dreadful uniformity today and also an appalling lack of knowledge about the culture and performance traditions of the past." ("Music Schools Turning out Robots?"&lt;ref name=conservatories_kill_expression&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19691019&amp;id=dpMeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ncsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=874,4160516 "Music Schools Turning out Robots?"] by [[Harold C. Schonberg]]; ''Daytona Beach Morning Journal'' – October 19, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Harold C. Schonberg]])

===Improvisation===
{{Essay|section|date=July 2016}}
[[musical improvisation|Improvisation]] once played an important role in classical music. A remnant of this improvisatory tradition in classical music can be heard in the [[cadenza]], a passage found mostly in concertos and solo works, designed to allow skilled performers to exhibit their virtuoso skills on the instrument. Traditionally this was improvised by the performer; however, it is often written for (or occasionally by) the performer beforehand. Improvisation is also an important aspect in authentic performances of operas of Baroque era and of bel canto (especially operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]), and is best exemplified by the ''[[da capo aria]]'', a form by which famous singers typically perform variations of the thematic matter of the aria in the recapitulation section ('B section' / the 'da capo' part). An example is [[Beverly Sills]]' complex, albeit pre-written, variation of "Da tempeste il legno infranto" from Händel's ''[[Giulio Cesare]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Its{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--This seems to be referring to improvisation, but that seems contradictory.--&gt; written transmission, along with the veneration bestowed on certain classical works, has led to the expectation that performers will play a work in a way that realizes in detail the original intentions of the composer. During the 19th century the details that composers put in their scores generally increased. Yet the opposite trend—admiration of performers for new "interpretations" of the composer's work—can be seen, and it is not unknown for a composer to praise a performer for achieving a better realization of the original intent than the composer was able to imagine. Thus, classical performers often achieve high reputations for their musicianship, even if they do not compose themselves. Generally however, it is the composers who are remembered more than the performers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The primacy of the composer's written score has also led, today, to a relatively minor role played by improvisation in classical music, in sharp contrast to the practice of musicians who lived during the medieval, renaissance, baroque and early romantic eras. Improvisation in classical music performance was common during both the Baroque and early romantic eras, yet lessened strongly during the second half of the 20th century. During the classical era, Mozart and Beethoven often improvised the cadenzas to their [[piano concerto]]s (and thereby encouraged others to do so), but for violin concertos they provided written cadenzas for use by other soloists.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--The quotation from Maria Callas does not support this claim.--&gt; In opera, the practice of singing strictly by the score, i.e. ''come scritto'', was famously propagated by soprano [[Maria Callas]], who called this practice 'straitjacketing' and implied that it allows the intention of the composer to be understood better, especially during studying the music for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;"In other words, exactly as it's written, nothing more and nothing less, which is what I call straitjacketing." quoted in [[Arianna Huffington|Huffington, Arianna]] (2002). ''Maria Callas: The Woman behind the Legend'', p. 76. Cooper Square. {{ISBN|978-1461624295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other music traditions==

===Popular music===
Classical music has often incorporated elements or material from popular music of the composer's time. Examples include occasional music such as Brahms' use of student drinking songs in his ''[[Academic Festival Overture]]'', genres exemplified by [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', and the influence of jazz on early and mid-20th-century composers including [[Maurice Ravel]], exemplified by the movement entitled "Blues" in his sonata for violin and piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Ravel, Maurice, §3: 1918–37|author=Kelly, Barbara L.|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] and [[Postminimalism|postminimalist]] classical composers acknowledge a debt to popular music.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{GroveOnline|title=Nyman, Michael|author=Siôn, Pwyll Ap|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--A single instance cannot verify a broader claim.--&gt;

Numerous examples show influence in the opposite direction, including popular songs based on classical music, the use to which ''[[Pachelbel's Canon#Pachelbel's canon in popular culture|Pachelbel's Canon]]'' has been put since the 1970s, and the musical [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] phenomenon, where classical musicians have achieved success in the popular music arena.&lt;ref&gt;Notable examples are the ''[[Hooked on Classics]]'' series of recordings made by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] in the early 1980s and the classical crossover violinists [[Vanessa Mae]] and [[Catya Maré]].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], a number of [[lead guitarist]]s (playing [[electric guitar]]), including [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[Randy Rhoads]], modeled their playing styles on Baroque or Classical-era instrumental music.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Folk music===
Composers of classical music have often made use of [[folk music]] (music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained, often from a purely oral tradition). Some composers, like [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] and [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]],&lt;ref name="Yeomans2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeomans|first=David|title=Piano Music of the Czech Romantics: A Performer's Guide|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0253218452|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others like [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins.&lt;ref name="Stevens129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Haley|author2=Gillies, Malcolm|title=The Life and Music of Béla Bartók|year=1993|isbn=978-0198163497|page=129|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercialization==
Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks). In television commercials, several passages have become [[cliché]]d, particularly the opening of [[Richard Strauss]]' ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') and the opening section "[[O Fortuna]]" of [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]''; other examples include the "[[Dies irae]]" from the [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]], [[Edvard Grieg]]'s "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]" from ''[[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|Peer Gynt]]'', the opening bars of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s "[[Ride of the Valkyries]]" from ''[[Die Walküre]]'', [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s "[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]", and excerpts of [[Aaron Copland]]'s ''[[Rodeo (ballet)|Rodeo]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Several works from the [[Golden age of American animation|Golden Age of Animation]] matched the action to classical music. Notable examples are [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', [[Tom and Jerry]]'s ''[[Johann Mouse]]'', and [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Rabbit of Seville]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''

Similarly, movies and television often revert to standard, clichéd excerpts of classical music to convey refinement or opulence: some of the most-often heard pieces in this category include [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]´s [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suite No. 1]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'', [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' (as orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov), and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s "[[William Tell Overture|''William Tell'' Overture]]". The same passages are often used by telephone call centres to induce a sense of calm in customers waiting in a queue.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Shawn Vancour argues that the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century may have harmed the music industry through inadequate representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vancour|first=Shawn|title=Popularizing the Classics: Radio's Role in the Music Appreciation Movement 1922–34.|journal=Media, Culture and Society|date=March 2009|volume=31|issue=2|page=19|doi=10.1177/0163443708100319|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=15&amp;sid=44993088-138c-40ef-9fd0-95f42cce6fce%40sessionmgr14&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&amp;AN=37178702|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the range of production of classical music is from the 14th century to 21st century, most of this music (14th to early 20th century) belongs to the [[public domain]], mainly [[sheet music]] and [[tablature]]s. Some projects like [[Musopen]] and [[Open Goldberg Variations]] were created to produce musical audio files of high quality and release them into the public domain, most of them are available at the [[Internet Archive]] website.

The Open Goldberg Variations project released a [[braille]] format into the public domain that can be used to produce paper or electronic scores, [[Braille e-book]]s, for blind people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/braille-edition-open-goldberg-variations Braille edition of the Open Goldberg Variations] ny robertDouglass, Open Goldberg Variations, 23 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, several research papers and popular books wrote on what came to be called the "[[Mozart effect]]": an observed temporary, small elevation of scores on certain tests as a result of listening to Mozart's works. The approach has been popularized in a book by Don Campbell, and is based on an experiment published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted students' [[IQ]] by 8 to 9 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6747/abs/400827a0.html Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'?] ''Nature'' '''400''' (August 26, 1999): 827.&lt;/ref&gt; This popularized version of the theory was expressed succinctly by the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' music columnist [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]]: "researchers... have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Ross (music critic)|Ross, Alex]]. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EFDF1239F93BA1575BC0A962958260 "Classical View; Listening To Prozac... Er, Mozart"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 28, 1994. Retrieved on May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Promoters marketed CDs claimed to induce the effect. Florida passed a law requiring toddlers in state-run schools to listen to classical music every day, and in 1998 the governor of Georgia budgeted $105,000 per year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. One of the co-authors of the original studies of the Mozart effect commented "I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on [[music education]] programs."&lt;ref&gt;Goode, Erica. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D81131F930A3575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3 "Mozart for Baby? Some Say, Maybe Not"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 3, 1999. Retrieved on May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996/97, a research study was conducted on a population of preschool through college students in the [[Cherry Creek School District]] in Denver, Colorado, US. The study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores. The research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores. Students who listened to [[rock-and-roll]] or [[Country music]] had moderately lower scores. The study further indicated that students who used classical music during the course of study had a significant leap in their academic performance; whereas, those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores. The research was conducted over several schools within the Cherry Creek School District and was conducted through the [[University of Colorado]]. This study is reflective of several recent studies (i.e. Mike Manthei and Steve N. Kelly of the University of Nebraska at Omaha; Donald A. Hodges and Debra S. O'Connell of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; etc.) and others{{Full citation needed|date=September 2016}} who had significant results through the [[discourse]] of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/documents/highschool/Schedule/Arts/Achievement.pdf |title=The Impact of Music Education on Academic Achievement |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916075557/http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/documents/highschool/Schedule/Arts/Achievement.pdf |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Conservation Plan''''' is an important publication written by [[James Semple Kerr]] in 1982, and revised many times. It was a landmark in Australian conservation. The document "...outlines the logical processes of the Burra Charter, and how to prepare a Conservation Plan to guide and manage change to a heritage item appropriately''. Subtitled, "a guide to the preparation of conservation plans for places of European cultural significance'' it has guided building conservation in Australia and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/the-conservation-plan/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; Publications &gt; The Conservation Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservation Plan is widely used by heritage practitioners and property owners in Australia, and worldwide as a primary guide to the process of researching, documenting and managing historic places in accordance with the [[Burra Charter]], through a logical process. First published by the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW) in 1982, it has subsequently been reprinted in expanded form over seven editions and twelve printing impressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kerr, James Semple | author2=Hanna, Bronwyn J.

'''Decalage''' on a [[fixed-wing aircraft]] is the angle difference between the upper and lower wings of a [[biplane]], i.e. the acute angle contained between the [[Chord (aircraft)|chords]] of the wings in question.

Decalage is said to be positive when the upper wing has a higher [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]] than the lower wing, and negative when the lower wing's incidence is greater than that of the upper wing. Positive decalage results in greater lift from the upper wing than the lower wing, the difference increasing with the amount of decalage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aerade.cranfield.ac.uk/ara/1927/naca-tn-269.pdf NACA technical report No.269] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716225431/http://aerade.cranfield.ac.uk/ara/1927/naca-tn-269.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }} ''The Distribution of Loads Between the Wings of a Biplane Having Decalage'' (November 1927), p.18. Retrieved on 9 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [http://a.moirier.free.fr/Conception/Formules%20sp%E9ciales/Biplans/The%20fine%20old%20art%20of%20rigging%20a%20biplane%2002.pdf survey of representative biplanes], real-life design decalage is typically zero, with both wings having equal incidence.  A notable exception is the Stearman PT-17, which has 4&amp;deg; of incidence in the lower wing, and 3&amp;deg; in the upper wing.  Considered from an aerodynamic perspective, it is desirable to have the forward-most wing stall first, which will induce a pitch-down moment, aiding in stall recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780123973085/content/APP-C1-DESIGN_OF_CONVENTIONAL_AIRCRAFT.pdf Appendix C1 to "General Aviation Aircraft Design" by Snorri Gudmundson; section C1.2, p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;  Biplane designers may use incidence to control stalling behavior, but may also use airfoil selection or other means to accomplish correct behavior.

Decalage angle can also refer to the difference in angle of the chord line of the wing and the chord line of the horizontal stabilizer. This is different from the [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]], which refers to the angle of the wing chord to the longitudinal axis of the fuselage, without reference to the horizontal stabilizer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5418">A '''deliberatorium''' or '''collaboratorium''' is a form of online collaborative [[argument mapping]]. It was first deployed as the [[MIT]] Collaboratorium, and directed at the question of [[climate change]]. 

==History==

In December 2008,  Center for Collective Intelligence at the [[MIT]] Mark Klein tested a prototype of the collaboratorium at the [[University of Naples]] featuring a 200 student debate on biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bringing order to online discussions about climate change |url=http://blogs.nature.com/boston/2008/04/10/bringing-order-to-online-discussions-about-climate-change |website=Nature.com |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Features==

Deleiberatoriums work by deploying a website which allows the public to post the latest scientific results about climate change. Once done, people can debate how to get rid of carbon emissions which is how politicians get feedback on public opinion.  

The site operates similar to [[Wikipedia]] for authoritative reports but with a more structured, organized debate featuring an argument tree. These reports for the site come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

__NOTOC__
'''Diary studies''' is a [[research method]] that collects [[qualitative property|qualitative information]] by having participants record entries about their every day lives in a log, diary or journal about the activity or experience being studied. This collection of data uses a&amp;nbsp;[[longitudinal study|longitudinal technique]], meaning that it is reported by the participants over a period of time ranging from some days to more a few months, meaning that it studies the same [[variable (research)|variables]] over a period of time. This research tool, although not being able to provide results as detailed as a true [[field study]], can still offer a vast amount of contextual information without the costs of a true field study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigdesignevents.com/2012/08/5-methods-to-collect-data-with-diary-studies/|title=5 methods to collect data with diary studies|last=Sullivan|first=Brian K.|date=August 9, 2012|website=Big Design|publisher=|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nngroup.com/articles/diary-studies/|title=Diary Studies: Understanding Long-Term User Behavior and Experiences|last=Flaherty|first=Kim|date=June 5, 2016|website=Nielsen Norman Group|publisher=|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diary studies are also known as [[Experience sampling method|experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment (EMA)]] methodology.  

Traditionally diary studies involved participants keeping a written diary of events. However the emergence of smartphones now enables participants to diary with photos, videos and text using a variety of online, mobile or offline apps and tools. 

There are two types of diary studies:

# '''Elicitation studies''', where participants capture media that are then used as prompts for discussion in interviews. The method is a way to trigger the participant's memory. This type of diary study is sometimes referred to by Researchers as pre-task or pre-work and typically is carried out before an in-person interview such as a [[Focus group|Focus Group]] or an In-depth interview.
# '''Feedback studies''', where participants answer predefined questions about events. This is a way of getting immediate answers from the participants.&lt;ref name="CarterMankoff"&gt;Carter and Mankoff (2005). When participants do the capturing: the role of media in diary studies. ''CHI '05 Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems''.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
An early example of a diary study was "How Workingmen Spend Their Time" (Bevans, 1913) which went unpublished by George Esdras Bevans.&lt;ref&gt;"Bevans, G.E. (1913). How Workingmen Spend Their Time (Unpublished Doctoral Thesis). Columbia University, New York, NY"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Diary studies originate from the fields of [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]]. In the field of [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI), diary studies have been adopted as one method of learning about user needs towards designing more appropriate technologies.&lt;ref name="CarterMankoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PalenSalzman"&gt;Palen, L., &amp; Salzman, M. (2002). Voice-mail diary studies for naturalistic data capture under mobile conditions. In ''Proceedings of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW '02)'', pp. 87–95. New York: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Advantages of diary studies are numerous.&lt;ref&gt;Lallemand, C. (2012). [http://uxpamagazine.org/dear-diary-using-diaries-to-study-user-experience/ Dear Diary: Using Diaries to Study User Experience][http://uxpamagazine.org/issue/11-3/ UX Magazine 11.3, August 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;
They allow:

* collecting longitudinal and temporal information;
* reporting events and experiences in context and in-the-moment;
* participants to diary their behaviours, thoughts and feelings in-the-moment thereby minimising the potential for post rationalisation;
* determining the antecedents, correlations, and consequences of daily experiences and behaviors.

==Limitations==
Diary studies might generate inaccurate [[recall (memory)|recall]], especially if using the elicitation type of diary studies, because of the use of memory triggers (e.g. taking a photo and writing about it later). There is low control, low participation and there is a risk of disturbing the action. 
In feedback studies, there is also low control, and it can be troubling and disturbing to write everything down.&lt;ref&gt;Kuniavsky, Observing the User Experience, A Practitioner's Guide to User Research September 21, 2012, {{ISBN|0123848695}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matmos - Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast - Martin mics cows.jpg|thumb|M. C. Schmidt of [[Matmos]] recording cow [[audio samples]] for [[The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast|their 2006 album]]]]

'''Field recording''' is the term used for an [[Sound recording|audio recording]] produced outside a [[recording studio]], and the term applies to recordings of both natural and human-produced sounds.

Field recording of natural sounds, also called '''phonography''' (a term chosen to illustrate its similarities to [[photography]]), was originally developed as a documentary adjunct to research work [[field work|in the field]], and [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley]] work for film.  With the introduction of high-quality, portable recording equipment, it has subsequently become an evocative artform in itself.  In the 1970s, both processed and natural phonographic recordings, (pioneered by Irv Teibel's [[Environments (series)|''Environments'' series]]), became popular.

"Field recordings" may also refer to simple monaural or stereo recordings taken of musicians in familiar and casual surroundings, such as the [[ethnomusicology]] recordings pioneered by [[John Lomax]], [[Nonesuch Records]], and [[Vanguard Records]].

==Techniques==

[[File:Ecoacoustics recording in Rural Illinois, USA.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Two individuals recording [[ecoacoustics]] in the field. ]]

Field recording often involves the capture of ambient noises that are low level and complex, and, in response, the requirements from the field recordist have often pushed the technical limits of recording equipment, that is, demanding low noise and extended frequency response in a portable, battery-powered unit. For this reason, field recordists have favoured high-quality (usually professional) recorders, microphones, and microphone [[pre-amplifiers]]. The history of the equipment used in this area closely tracks the development of professional portable audio recording technology.

Field recording is typically recorded in the same channel format as the desired result, for instance, stereo recording equipment will yield a stereo product. In contrast, a [[multitrack recording|multitrack]] [[remote recording]] captures many microphones on multiple channels, later to be creatively modified, augmented, and mixed down to a specific consumer format.

Field recording experienced a rapid increase in popularity during the early 1960s, with the introduction of high-quality, portable recording equipment, (e.g., the [[Uher (brand)|Uher]], and [[Nagra]] portable reel-to-reel decks). The arrival of the [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] (Digital Audio Tape) in the 1980s introduced a new level of audio recording [[Fidelity#Audio|fidelity]] with extended frequency response and low [[Microphone#Measurements and specifications|self-noise]]. In addition to these technologies, other popular means for field recording have included the [[compact audio cassette|analog cassette]] (CAC), the [[Digital Compact Cassette|DCC]] (Digital Compact Cassette), and the [[MiniDisc]]. The latest generation of recorders are completely digital-based (hard disk/[[Flash Memory|Flash]]). It is also possible to use personal electronic devices, (e.g., a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet]]), with software, to do field recording and editing.

Newly developed techniques include the creative placement of microphones, (including [[contact microphones]] and [[hydrophones]], for example), the diffusion of captured sounds, and individual approaches.

==Research==

===Ethnomusicology===
Field recording was originally a way to document oral presentations, and [[ethnomusicology]] projects (pioneered by [[Charles Seeger]], [[John Lomax]] and [[Béla Bartók]]).

===Bioacoustics===
Field recording is an important tool in [[bioacoustics]] and [[biomusicology]], most commonly in research on [[bird song]].  Animals in the wild can display very different vocalizations from those in captivity.

==Art==

===Music===
The use of field recordings in [[avant-garde]], [[musique concrète]], [[Experimental music|experimental]], and, more recently, [[ambient music]] was evident almost from the birth of recording technology. Most noteworthy for pioneering the conceptual and theoretical framework with art music that most openly embraced the use of raw sound material and field recordings was [[Pierre Schaeffer]], who was developing musique concrète as early as 1940. Further impetus was provided by the [[World Soundscape Project]], initiated by Canadian composer [[R. Murray Schafer]] in the 1970s; this work involved studying the [[acoustic ecology]] of a particular location by the use of field recordings.

Field recordings are now a common source material for a range of musical results, from contemporary musique concrète compositions to film soundtracks, video game soundtracks, and effects. [[Chris Watson (musician)|Chris Watson]], formerly of [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], is now perhaps the world's leading exponent of this art, with his recordings used for [[David Attenborough filmography|David Attenborough's series]] for the [[BBC]], programmes for [[BBC Radio]], and many other outlets. Another notable application of field recordings as of contemporary music is its inclusion in some [[vaporwave]] tracks, commonly recordings of public areas such as malls or grocery stores to add atmosphere.

The sounds recorded by any device, and then transferred to digital format, are used by some musicians through their performance with [[MIDI]]-interfaced instruments. A contemporary artist with great success for his compositions is [[Christian Fennesz]]. In addition, electronic musicians, such as DJ Throwing Shade, have been using field recordings to create music that has "someone actually playing an instrument in real life, something which cannot be re-created in the same way through synthesised sounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_uk/article/between-worlds-how-field-recordings-can-challenge-our-perceptions-of-electronic-music|title=Between Worlds: How Field Recordings Can Challenge Our Perceptions of Electronic Music {{!}} Thump|last=Darton|first=James|date=January 19, 2017|work=|newspaper=Thump|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-01-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier innovators who are noted for the importance and boldness of their projects are [[Luigi Russolo]], who, in 1913, with his manifesto, ''L'arte dei rumori'' (''[[The Art of Noises]]''), gave musical value to [[environmental noise]]. He also designed and built the [[Intonarumori]]—the first instruments for making noise. [[Francesco Balilla Pratella]] utilized the Intonarumori in his opera, ''L'aviatore Dro'', which was written in close collaboration with [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], (the founder of the [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement).

===Radio documentary===
[[Radio documentary|Radio documentaries]] often use recordings from the field, e.g., a locomotive engine running, for evocative effect.  This type of sound functions as the non-fictional counterpart to the [[sound effect]].

===Politics===
During the early years of commercial recordings, the speeches of politicians sold well, since few people had radios. The [http://www.worldcat.org/title/gramophone-records-of-the-first-world-war-an-hmv-catalogue-1914-1918/oclc/1938531 HMV ("His Master's Voice") catalogue for 1914–1918] lists over a dozen such records. Probably the last time such records sold well was in 1965, when the [[LP record|LP]], ''The Voice of Churchill'', reached number 7 in the UK album charts. This was immediately after [[Winston Churchill|Churchill's]] death.

In [[computer architecture]], '''frequency scaling''' (also known as '''frequency ramping''') is the technique of increasing a processor's [[frequency]] so as to enhance the performance of the system containing the processor in question. Frequency ramping was the dominant force in commodity processor performance increases from the mid-1980s until roughly the end of 2004. 

The effect of processor [[frequency]] on computer speed can be seen by looking at the equation for computer program runtime: 
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Run time} = \frac{\mathrm{Instructions}}{\mathrm{Program}} \times \frac{\mathrm{Cycles}}{\mathrm{Instruction}} \times \frac {\mathrm{Time}}{\mathrm{Cycle}},&lt;/math&gt;
where instructions per program is the total instructions being executed in a given program, cycles per instruction is a program-dependent, architecture-dependent average value, and time per cycle is by definition the inverse of processor frequency.&lt;ref&gt;[[John L. Hennessy]] and [[David A. Patterson (scientist)|David A. Patterson]]. Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach. 3rd edition, 2002. Morgan Kaufmann, {{ISBN|1-55860-724-2}}. Page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime. 

However, [[power consumption]] in a chip is given by the equation 
: &lt;math&gt;P = C \times V^2 \times F,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is power consumption, ''C'' is the [[capacitance]] being switched per clock cycle, ''V'' is [[voltage]], and ''F'' is the processor frequency (cycles per second).&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Rabaey. Digital Integrated Circuits. Prentice Hall, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in frequency thus increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor [[power consumption]] led ultimately to [[Intel]]'s May 2004 cancellation of its [[Tejas and Jayhawk]] processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie J. Flynn. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/08/business/08chip.html?ex=1399348800&amp;en=98cc44ca97b1a562&amp;ei=5007 Intel Halts Development of 2 New Microprocessors]. ''New York Times'', May 8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Moore's Law]] was&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/moores-law-really-is-dead-this-time/&lt;/ref&gt; still in effect when frequency scaling ended. Despite power issues, transistor densities were still doubling every 18 to 24 months. With the end of frequency scaling, new transistors (which are no longer needed to facilitate frequency scaling) are used to add extra hardware, such as additional cores, to facilitate parallel computing - a technique that is being referred to as [[parallel scaling]].

The end of frequency scaling as the dominant cause of processor performance gains has caused an industry-wide shift to [[parallel computing]] in the form of [[Multi-core (computing)|multicore processors]].

'''Fructose''', or '''fruit sugar''', is a simple [[Ketose|ketonic]] [[monosaccharide]] found in many plants, where it is often bonded to [[glucose]] to form the [[disaccharide]] [[sucrose]]. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and [[galactose]], that are absorbed directly into blood during [[digestion]]. Fructose was discovered by French chemist [[Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut]] in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Dubrunfaut (1847) [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJ45AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Sur une propriété analytique des fermentations alcoolique et lactique, et sur leur application à l’étude des sucres"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627013828/http://books.google.com/books?id=PJ45AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA169 |date=2014-06-27 }} (On an analytic property of alcoholic and lactic fermentations, and on their application to the study of sugars), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', '''21''' :  169–178.  On page 174, Dubrunfaut relates the discovery and properties of fructose.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, J.S. Molecules of Life 1972, Wiley-Interscience&lt;/ref&gt;  The name "fructose" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist [[William Allen Miller]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Allen Miller|title=Elements of Chemistry:  Theoretical and Practical'', Part III.

Fructose is found in [[honey]], tree and vine fruits, flowers, [[Berry|berries]], and most [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]].

Commercially, fructose is derived from [[sugar cane]], [[sugar beet]]s, and [[maize]]. Crystalline fructose is the monosaccharide, dried, ground, and of high purity. [[High-fructose corn syrup]] is a [[mixture]] of glucose and fructose as monosaccharides. Sucrose is a [[Chemical compound|compound]] with one molecule of glucose covalently linked to one molecule of fructose. All forms of fructose, including fruits and juices, are commonly added to foods and drinks for [[palatability]] and [[taste]] enhancement, and for browning of some foods, such as baked goods. About 240,000 [[tonne]]s of crystalline fructose are produced annually.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Wach "Fructose" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.{{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a12_047.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive consumption of fructose may contribute to [[insulin resistance]], [[obesity]], elevated [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]] and [[triglyceride]]s, leading to [[metabolic syndrome]],&lt;ref name=MalikHu2015/&gt; [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] and [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fructose-containing sugars and cardiovascular disease|journal = Advances in Nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)|date = 2015-07-01|issn = 2156-5376|pmc = 4496738|pmid = 26178027|pages = 430–439|volume = 6|issue = 4|doi = 10.3945/an.114.008177|first = James M.|last = Rippe|first2 = Theodore J.|last2 = Angelopoulos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] stated that fructose is preferable over sucrose and glucose in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages because of its lower effect on [[postprandial]] [[blood sugar]] levels, and also noted that "high intakes of fructose may lead to metabolic complications such as [[dyslipidaemia]], insulin resistance, and increased visceral adiposity".&lt;ref name="efsa11"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2223 | title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to fructose and reduction of post-prandial glycaemic responses (ID 558) pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 | author=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies | journal=EFSA Journal | year=2011 | volume=9 | issue=6 | pages=2223 | doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2223 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625065601/http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/scientific_output/files/main_documents/2223.pdf | archivedate=2016-06-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the UK’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in 2015 disputed the claims of fructose causing metabolic disorders, stating that "there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that fructose intake leads to adverse health outcomes independent of any effects related to its presence as a component of total and free sugars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/445503/SACN_Carbohydrates_and_Health.pdf|title=Carbohydrates and Health|publisher=UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, Public Health England, TSO, Williams Lea, Norwich, UK|date=2015|accessdate=1 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319190958/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/445503/SACN_Carbohydrates_and_Health.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "fructose" was coined in 1857 from the Latin for ''fructus'' (fruit) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars, ''[[-ose]]''.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fructose. Origin and meaning of fructose|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/fructose|date=2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225092022/https://www.etymonline.com/word/fructose|archivedate=25 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called fruit sugar and levulose.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

Fructose is a 6-carbon polyhydroxyketone. Crystalline fructose adopts a cyclic six-membered structure owing to the stability of its [[hemiketal]] and internal hydrogen-bonding. This form is formally called &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-fructopyranose. In solution, fructose exists as an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]]  mixture of 70% fructo[[pyranose]] and about 22% fructo[[furanose]], as well as small amounts of three other forms, including the acyclic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Institute of Organic Chemistry| url=http://www.oci.unizh.ch/edu/lectures/material/AC_BII/Kap14/kap14.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416050839/http://www.oci.unizh.ch/edu/lectures/material/AC_BII/Kap14/kap14.html| archivedate=2008-04-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions ===

==== Fructose and fermentation ====
Fructose may be anaerobically [[Ethanol fermentation|fermented]] by [[yeast]] or [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McWilliams | first=Margaret | title=Foods: Experimental Perspectives, 4th Edition | isbn=0-13-021282-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeast enzymes convert sugar (glucose, or fructose) to [[ethanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. The carbon dioxide released during fermentation will remain dissolved in water, where it will reach equilibrium with carbonic acid, unless the fermentation chamber is left open to the air. The dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid produce the carbonation in bottled fermented beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keusch |first=P |title=Yeast and Sugar- the Chemistry must be right |url=http://www.chemie.uni-regensburg.de/Organische_Chemie/Didaktik/Keusch/D-fermentation_sugar-e.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220064304/http://www.chemie.uni-regensburg.de/Organische_Chemie/Didaktik/Keusch/D-fermentation_sugar-e.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fructose and Maillard reaction ====
Fructose undergoes the [[Maillard reaction]], non-enzymatic browning, with [[amino acids]]. Because fructose exists to a greater extent in the open-chain form than does glucose, the initial stages of the Maillard reaction occur more rapidly than with glucose. Therefore, fructose has potential to contribute to changes in food [[palatability]], as well as other nutritional effects, such as excessive browning, volume and tenderness reduction during cake preparation, and formation of [[mutagenic]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dills | first=WL | title=Protein fructosylation: Fructose and the Maillard reaction | year=1993 | journal=Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume=58 | pages=779–787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dehydration ====
Fructose readily dehydrates to give [[hydroxymethylfurfural]] ("HMF").
This process, in the future, may become part of a low-cost, carbon-neutral system to produce replacements for petrol and diesel from plants.&lt;ref&gt;Huber, G. W.; Iborra, S.; Corma, A. Chem.  Rev. 2006, 106, 4044 – 4098. {{DOI|10.1021/cr068360d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical and functional properties ==

=== Sweetness of fructose ===
{{See also|Sweetness#Examples of sweet substances}}
The primary reason that fructose is used commercially in foods and beverages, besides its low cost, is its high relative sweetness. It is the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates. The relative sweetness of fructose has been reported in the range of 1.2–1.8 times that of sucrose.&lt;ref name=Hanover&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanover|first1=L. M.|last2=White|first2=J.

Warming fructose leads to formation of the 5-membered ring form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Taste Chemistry| last=Shallenberger| first=R.S.| year=1994| publisher=Chapman and Hall | isbn=978-0-7514-0150-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the relative sweetness decreases with increasing temperature. However it has been observed that the absolute sweetness of fructose is identical at 5&amp;nbsp;°C as 50&amp;nbsp;°C and thus the relative sweetness to sucrose is not due to [[anomeric]] distribution but a decrease in the absolute sweetness of sucrose at lower temperatures.&lt;ref name="Kirk-Othmer"/&gt;

[[File:relativesweetness.png|thumb|center|400px|'''Figure 2:''' Relative sweetness of sugars and sweeteners]]

The sweetness of fructose is perceived earlier than that of sucrose or glucose, and the taste sensation reaches a peak (higher than that of sucrose) and diminishes more quickly than that of sucrose. Fructose can also enhance other flavors in the system.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirk-Othmer"/&gt;

Fructose exhibits a sweetness synergy effect when used in combination with other sweeteners. The relative sweetness of fructose blended with sucrose, aspartame, or saccharin is perceived to be greater than the sweetness calculated from individual components.&lt;ref name=Nabors&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nabors  | first=LO | title =American Sweeteners | year=2001 | pages=374–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirk-Othmer"/&gt;

=== Fructose solubility and crystallization ===
Fructose has higher solubility than other sugars as well as other sugar alcohols. Fructose is, therefore, difficult to crystallize from an aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt; Sugar mixes containing fructose, such as candies, are softer than those containing other sugars because of the greater solubility of fructose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Foods: Experimental Perspectives, 4th Edition| last=McWilliams| first=Margaret| year=2001| publisher=Upper Saddle River, NJ : Prentice Hall | isbn=0-13-021282-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fructose hygroscopicity and humectancy ===
Fructose is quicker to absorb moisture and slower to release it to the environment than sucrose, glucose, or other nutritive sweeteners.&lt;ref name=Nabors /&gt; Fructose is an excellent humectant and retains moisture for a long period of time even at low [[relative humidity]] (RH). Therefore, fructose can contribute a more palatable texture, and longer shelf life to the food products in which it is used.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt;

=== Freezing point ===
Fructose has a greater effect on freezing point depression than disaccharides or oligosaccharides, which may protect the integrity of cell walls of fruit by reducing ice crystal formation. However, this characteristic may be undesirable in soft-serve or hard-frozen dairy desserts.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt;

=== Fructose and starch functionality in food systems ===
Fructose increases starch viscosity more rapidly and achieves a higher final viscosity than sucrose because fructose lowers the temperature required during [[starch gelatinization|gelatinizing of starch]], causing a greater final viscosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=White | first=DC |author2=Lauer GN | title=Predicting gelatinization temperature of starch/sweetener system for cake formulation by differential scanning calorimetry I. Development of a model | year=1990 | journal=Cereal Foods World | volume=35 | pages=728–731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some artificial sweeteners are not suitable for home-baking, many traditional recipes use fructose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Good Food: Essential Ingredients for Cooking and Eating Well.

Natural sources of fructose include fruits, vegetables (including sugar cane), and honey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Park | first=KY |author2=Yetley AE | title=Intakes and food sources of fructose in the United States | year = 1993 | volume = 58 | issue=5 Suppl | pages = 737S–747S | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | pmid=8213605}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fructose is often further concentrated from these sources. The highest dietary sources of fructose, besides pure crystalline fructose, are foods containing [[table sugar]] (sucrose), [[high-fructose corn syrup]], [[agave nectar]], [[honey]], [[molasses]], [[maple syrup]], fruit and fruit [[juice]]s, as these have the highest percentages of fructose (including fructose in sucrose) per serving compared to other common foods and ingredients. Fructose exists in foods either as a free [[monosaccharide]] or bound to glucose as [[sucrose]], a [[disaccharide]]. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose may all be present in a food; however, different foods will have varying levels of each of these three sugars.

The sugar contents of common fruits and vegetables are presented in Table 1. In general, in foods that contain free fructose, the ratio of fructose to glucose is approximately 1:1; that is, foods with fructose usually contain about an equal amount of free glucose. A value that is above 1 indicates a higher proportion of fructose to glucose, and below 1 a lower proportion. Some fruits have larger proportions of fructose to glucose compared to others. For example, [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s contain more than twice as much free fructose as glucose, while for [[apricot]]s the proportion is less than half as much fructose as glucose.

Apple and pear juices are of particular interest to [[pediatrics|pediatricians]] because the high concentrations of free fructose in these juices can cause [[diarrhea]] in children. The cells ([[enterocyte]]s) that line children's [[small intestine]]s have less affinity for fructose [[Small Intestine#Absorptions|absorption]] than for glucose and sucrose.&lt;ref name="AJCN fructose absorption"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riby|first=JE|author2=Fujisawa T |author3=Kretchmer N |title=Fructose absorption|year=1993|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=58|pages=748S–753S|pmid=8213606|issue=5 Suppl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unabsorbed fructose creates higher [[osmolarity]] in the small intestine, which draws water into the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in osmotic diarrhea. This phenomenon is discussed in greater detail in the [[#Potential health effects|Health Effects]] section.

Table 1 also shows the amount of sucrose found in common fruits and vegetables. [[Sugarcane]] and [[sugar beet]] have a high concentration of sucrose, and are used for commercial preparation of pure sucrose. Extracted cane or beet juice is clarified, removing impurities; and concentrated by removing excess water. The end-product is 99.9%-pure sucrose. Sucrose-containing sugars include common table [[sugar|white granulated sugar]] and [[powdered sugar]], as well as [[brown sugar]].&lt;ref name=Kretchmer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kretchmer|first=N|author2=Hollenbeck CB|title=Sugars and Sweeteners|year=1991|publisher=CRC Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data obtained from Kretchmer, N. &amp; Hollenbeck, CB (1991). Sugars and Sweeteners, Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, Inc.&lt;ref name=Kretchmer /&gt; for HFCS, and USDA for fruits and vegetables and the other refined sugars.&lt;ref name="www.nal.usda.gov" /&gt;

Cane and beet sugars have been used as the major sweetener in food manufacturing for centuries. However, with the development of HFCS, a significant shift occurred in the type of sweetener consumption in certain countries, particularly the United States.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19064536|year=2008|author1=White|first1=J. S|title=Straight talk about high-fructose corn syrup: What it is and what it ain't|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=88|issue=6|pages=1716S–1721S|doi=10.3945/ajcn.2008.25825B|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/88/6/1716S.full|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412095458/http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/88/6/1716S.full|archivedate=2016-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the popular belief, however, with the increase of HFCS consumption, the total fructose intake relative to the total glucose intake has not dramatically changed. Granulated sugar is 99.9%-pure sucrose, which means that it has equal ratio of fructose to glucose. The most commonly used forms of HFCS, HFCS-42, and HFCS-55, have a roughly equal ratio of fructose to glucose, with minor differences. HFCS has simply replaced sucrose as a sweetener. Therefore, despite the changes in the sweetener consumption, the ratio of glucose to fructose intake has remained relatively constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Guthrie | first=FJ |author2=Morton FJ | title=Food sources of added sweeteners in the diets of Americans | year=2000 | journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume=100 | pages=43–51 | doi=10.1016/S0002-8223(00)00018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fructose digestion and absorption in humans ==
[[File:sucrase.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure 4:''' Hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose by sucrase]]
[[File:fructosetransporter.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure 5:''' Intestinal sugar transport proteins]]
Fructose exists in foods either as a monosaccharide (free fructose) or as a unit of a disaccharide (sucrose). Free fructose is absorbed directly by the intestine. When fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose, it is digested (broken down) and then absorbed as free fructose. As sucrose comes into contact with the membrane of the small intestine, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the cleavage of sucrose to yield one glucose unit and one fructose unit, which are then each absorbed. After absorption, it enters the [[hepatic portal vein]] and is directed toward the liver.

The mechanism of fructose absorption in the small intestine is not completely understood. Some evidence suggests [[active transport]], because fructose uptake has been shown to occur against a concentration gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stipanuk | first=Marsha H | title=Biochemical, Physiological, and Molecular Aspects of Human Nutrition, 2nd Edition | publisher=W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of research supports the claim that fructose absorption occurs on the mucosal membrane via [[facilitated diffusion|facilitated transport]] involving [[GLUT5]] transport proteins. Since the concentration of fructose is higher in the lumen, fructose is able to flow down a concentration gradient into the [[enterocytes]], assisted by transport proteins. Fructose may be transported out of the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane by either [[GLUT2]] or GLUT5, although the GLUT2 transporter has a greater capacity for transporting fructose, and, therefore, the majority of fructose is transported out of the enterocyte through GLUT2.

=== Capacity and rate of absorption ===
The absorption capacity for fructose in monosaccharide form ranges from less than 5&amp;nbsp;g to 50&amp;nbsp;g (per individual serving) and adapts with changes in dietary fructose intake.&lt;ref name=fuji /&gt; Studies show the greatest absorption rate occurs when glucose and fructose are administered in equal quantities.&lt;ref name=fuji&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fujisawa | first=T |author2=Riby J |author3=Kretchmer N  | title=Intestinal absorption of fructose in the rat | year=1991 | journal=Gastroenterology | volume=101 | pages=360–367 | pmid=2065911 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When fructose is ingested as part of the disaccharide [[sucrose]], absorption capacity is much higher because fructose exists in a 1:1 ratio with glucose. It appears that the [[GLUT5]] transfer rate may be saturated at low levels, and absorption is increased through joint absorption with glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ushijima | first=K |author2=Fujisawa T |author3=Riby J |author4=Kretchmer N  | title= Absorption of fructose by isolated small intestine of rats is via a specific saturable carrier in the absence of glucose and by the disaccharidase-related transport system in the presence of glucose | year=1991 | journal= Journal of Nutrition | volume=125 | pages=2156–2164 | pmid=7643250 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is a glucose-dependent [[cotransport]] of fructose.
In addition, fructose transfer activity increases with dietary fructose intake. The presence of fructose in the lumen causes increased mRNA transcription of GLUT5, leading to increased transport proteins. High-fructose diets (&gt;2.4 g/kg body wt) increase transport proteins within three days of intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ferraris | first=R | title= Dietary and developmental regulation of intestinal sugar transport | year=2001 | journal= Journal of Biochemistry | volume=360 | pages=265–276 | pmid=11716754 | doi= 10.1042/0264-6021:3600265 | issue=Pt 2 | pmc=1222226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malabsorption ===
{{Main|Fructose malabsorption}}

Several studies have measured the intestinal absorption of fructose using the [[hydrogen breath test]].&lt;ref name=Beyer&gt;{{cite journal | last=Beyer | first=PL |author2=Caviar EM |author3=McCallum RW  | title=Fructose intake at current levels in the United States may cause gastrointestinal distress in normal adults | year=2005 | journal=J.

When fructose is not absorbed in the small intestine, it is transported into the large intestine, where it is fermented by the colonic flora. Hydrogen is produced during the [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] process and dissolves into the blood of the [[portal vein]]. This hydrogen is transported to the lungs, where it is exchanged across the lungs and is measurable by the hydrogen breath test. The colonic flora also produces carbon dioxide, [[short-chain fatty acid]]s, organic acids, and trace gases in the presence of unabsorbed fructose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Skoog | first=SM |author2=Bharucha AE | title= Dietary fructose and gastrointestinal symptoms: a review | year=2004 | journal=Am.

== Fructose metabolism ==

All three dietary monosaccharides are transported into the liver by the GLUT2 transporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=R | last=Quezada-Calvillo | title=Carbohydrate Digestion and Absorption | place=Missouri | publisher=Saunders, Elsevier | year=2006 | isbn=1-4160-0209-X | pages=182–185 |author2=Robayo CC |author3=Nichols BL }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fructose and [[galactose]] are [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] in the liver by [[fructokinase]] (K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;= 0.5 mM) and galactokinase (K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.8 mM), respectively. By contrast, glucose tends to pass through the liver (K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of hepatic glucokinase = 10 mM) and can be metabolised anywhere in the body. Uptake of fructose by the liver is not regulated by insulin. However, insulin is capable of increasing the abundance and functional activity of GLUT5 in skeletal muscle cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hajduch|author2=Litherland GJ |author3=Turban S |author4=Brot-Laroche E |author5=Hundal HS |title=Insulin regulates the expression of the GLUT5 transporter in L6 skeletal muscle cells|date=Aug 2003|pmid=12914929|first1=E|volume=549|issue=1–3|pages=77–82|journal=FEBS Letters|doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00773-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fructolysis ===
{{Main|Fructolysis}}

The initial [[catabolism]] of fructose is sometimes referred to as [[fructolysis]], in analogy with [[glycolysis]], the catabolism of [[glucose]]. In fructolysis, the enzyme [[fructokinase]] initially produces [[fructose 1-phosphate]], which is split by [[aldolase B]] to produce the [[triose]]s [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] (DHAP) and [[glyceraldehyde]] [http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content-nw/full/76/5/911/F3]. Unlike [[glycolysis]], in fructolysis the triose [[glyceraldehyde]] lacks a [[phosphate group]]. A third enzyme, [[triokinase]], is therefore required to phosphorylate glyceraldehyde, producing [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]]. The resulting trioses are identical to those obtained in glycolysis and can enter the [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic]] pathway for glucose or glycogen synthesis, or be further catabolized through the lower [[glycolytic]] pathway to [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]].

=== Metabolism of fructose to DHAP and glyceraldehyde ===
The first step in the metabolism of fructose is the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose 1-phosphate by fructokinase, thus trapping fructose for metabolism in the liver. Fructose 1-phosphate then undergoes [[hydrolysis]] by [[aldolase B]] to form DHAP and glyceraldehydes; DHAP can either be [[isomerization|isomerized]] to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by triosephosphate isomerase or undergo reduction to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The glyceraldehyde produced may also be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by glyceraldehyde kinase or further converted to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.  The metabolism of fructose at this point yields intermediates in the gluconeogenic pathway leading to glycogen synthesis as well as fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis.

=== Synthesis of glycogen from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ===
The resultant glyceraldehyde formed by aldolase B then undergoes phosphorylation to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Increased concentrations of DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the liver drive the gluconeogenic pathway toward glucose and subsequent glycogen synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=MA Parniak |author2=Kalant N | title= Enhancement of glycogen concentrations in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes exposed to glucose and fructose | year=1988 | journal=Biochemical Journal | volume=251 | pages=795–802 | pmid=3415647 | issue=3 | pmc=1149073 | doi=10.1042/bj2510795}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that fructose is a better substrate for glycogen synthesis than glucose and that glycogen replenishment takes precedence over triglyceride formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Once liver glycogen is replenished, the intermediates of fructose metabolism are primarily directed toward triglyceride synthesis.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Synthesis of triglyceride from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ===
Carbons from dietary fructose are found in both the [[free fatty acid]] and glycerol [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] of plasma triglycerides. High fructose consumption can lead to excess pyruvate production, causing a buildup of Krebs cycle intermediates.&lt;ref name=McGrane&gt;{{cite book | first=MM | last=McGrane | title=Carbohydrate metabolism: Synthesis and oxidation | place=Missouri | publisher=Saunders, Elsevier | year=2006 | isbn=1-4160-0209-X | pages=258–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accumulated citrate can be transported from the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] into the [[cytosol]] of [[hepatocytes]], converted to [[acetyl CoA]] by citrate lyase and directed toward fatty acid synthesis.&lt;ref name=McGrane /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sul&gt;{{cite book | first=HS | last=Sul | title=Metabolism of Fatty Acids, Acylglycerols, and Sphingolipids | place=Missouri | publisher=Saunders, Elsevier | year=2006 | isbn=1-4160-0209-X | pages=450–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, DHAP can be converted to glycerol 3-phosphate, providing the glycerol backbone for the triglyceride molecule.&lt;ref name=Sul /&gt; Triglycerides are incorporated into [[very-low-density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL), which are released from the liver destined toward peripheral tissues for storage in both fat and muscle cells.

=== Weight gain ===
In a [[meta-analysis]] of [[clinical trial]]s with controlled feeding — where test subjects were fed a fixed amount of energy rather than being allowed to choose the amount they ate — fructose was not an independent factor for weight gain; however, fructose consumption was associated with weight gain when the fructose provided excess calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sievenpiper JL, de Souza RJ, Mirrahimi A, Yu ME, Carleton AJ, Beyene J, Chiavaroli L, Di Buono M, Jenkins AL, Leiter LA, Wolever TM, Kendall CW, Jenkins DJ |title=Effect of Fructose on Body Weight in Controlled Feeding Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|journal=Ann Intern Med|date=Feb 21, 2012|volume=156 | issue = 4 |pages=291–304|pmid=22351714|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-156-4-201202210-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An expert panel of the [[European Food Safety Authority]] concluded that fructose is preferred in food and beverage manufacturing to replace sucrose and glucose due to the lower effect of fructose on blood glucose levels following a meal.&lt;ref name=efsa11/&gt; However, as a common sweetening agent for foods and beverages, fructose has been associated with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders that are part of [[metabolic syndrome]].&lt;ref name=MalikHu2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malik|first1=Vasanti S.|last2=Hu|first2=Frank B.|title=Fructose and Cardiometabolic Health: What the Evidence from Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tells Us|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|volume=66|issue=14|year=2015|pages=1615–1624|issn=0735-1097|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2015.08.025|pmid=26429086|pmc=4592517}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clinical research]] has provided no or only limited direct evidence that fructose itself is associated with elevated [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]] and [[triglyceride]]s leading to metabolic syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of dietary fructose on plasma lipids in healthy subjects|journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date = 2000-11-01|issn = 0002-9165|pmid = 11063439|pages = 1128–1134|volume = 72|issue = 5|first = J.

The '''Grand Ducal Crown of Tuscany''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''corona del Granducato di Toscana'') was a [[Crown (heraldry)|ducal crown]] created by the [[Medici|Medicean]] [[List of rulers of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]].

== The old crown ==
[[File:Ströhl-Regentenkronen-Fig. 36.png|thumb|left|The old grand ducal crown in an engraving.]]
[[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], [[duke]] of [[Florence]], sought to achieve a title which removed him from his status as a [[feudatory]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and gave him more political independence. Getting nothing from the Emperor, he turned to the [[Papacy]]. Already he had attempted to get [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] to give him the title of [[king]] or [[archduke]] with no success. Finally in 1569, after many favours and dealings of differing levels of legitimacy, [[Pope Pius V]] released a [[Papal bull]] which conferred the style of ''[[Serene Highness|Altezza Serenissima]]'' and the title of [[Grand Duke]], a very rare title ranked him above a [[Duke]], but below a [[Prince]].

In January 1570 Cosimo I was crowned by Pius himself at [[Rome]], though by rights such a move was the prerogative of the Emperor. For this reason, [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] refused to recognise the new title, though [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] immediately recognised its validity. With time all Europe came around.

The crown of the Grand Duke of Tuscany was clearly distinct from both princely and ducal crowns. It was a gold circlet decorated with [[emerald]]s, [[ruby|rubies]] and [[pearl]]s with rays projecting from the top.

Uniquely the crown had a large [[fleur de lis]] at the front in the centre.

== The new crown ==
[[File:Giangastonecoronation.jpg|thumb|Gian Gastone with the new grand ducal crown, modified from the previous.]]
When [[Cosimo III de' Medici|Cosimo III]], Grand Duke of Tuscany (1670-1723) received the "right to royal rank" from [[Vienna]] added arches and a globe to the top of the grand ducal crown, as these were the typical elements of a royal crown. The new status of the Grand Duchy included among other things a change of style from ''Altezza Serenissima'' to ''[[Royal Highness|Altezza Reale]]''.

The Grand Ducal Crown is only known from drawings and paintings, since it was lost during the Napoleonic Occupation. A copy of the crown was placed in the coffin of each of the Grand Dukes at their funerals. One of these, which belonged to [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]] (r. 1723-1737) was recovered during a survey of the corpse and is now conserved in Florence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3314">'''Hierarchy theory''' is a means of studying [[ecological systems]] in which the relationship between all of the components is of great complexity. Hierarchy theory focuses on levels of organization and issues of [[Scale (analytical tool)|scale]], with a specific focus on the role of the observer in the definition of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Allen |first=Timothy F. H. |date=2001 |title=A summary of the principles of hierarchy theory |url=http://isss.org/hierarchy.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011218001638/http://isss.org/hierarchy.htm |archivedate=2001-12-18 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complexity in this context does not refer to an intrinsic property of the system but to the possibility of representing the systems in a plurality of non-equivalent ways depending on the pre-analytical choices of the observer. Instead of analyzing the whole structure, hierarchy theory refers to the analysis of hierarchical levels, and the interactions between them.

'''Human uses of plants''' include both practical uses, such as for [[food]], [[clothing]], and [[medicine]], and symbolic uses, such as in [[art]], [[mythology]] and [[literature]]. The reliable provision of food through [[agriculture]] is the basis of [[civilization]]. The study of plant uses by native peoples is [[ethnobotany]], while [[economic botany]] focuses on modern cultivated plants. Plants are used in medicine, providing many drugs from the earliest times to the present, and as the feedstock for many industrial products including [[timber]] and [[paper]] as well as a wide range of chemicals. Plants give millions of people pleasure through [[gardening]].

In art, mythology, [[religion]], literature and [[film]], plants play important roles, symbolising themes such as [[fertility]], growth, purity, and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. In [[architecture]] and the [[decorative arts]], plants provide many themes, such as [[Islamic art|Islamic]] [[arabesque]]s and the [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] forms carved on to classical [[Corinthian order]] column capitals.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the many roles played by plants in human culture.&lt;ref name="Shoemaker pp. 3–7"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shoemaker | first=Candice A. | title=Plants and Human Culture | journal=Journal of Home &amp; Consumer Horticulture | volume=1 | issue=2-3 | date=1994-08-02 | doi=10.1300/j280v01n02_02 | pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical uses==

===As food===
{{Main article|History of agriculture|Agriculture}}
[[File:Harvest Time - geograph.org.uk - 747095.jpg|thumb|Harvesting [[oat]]s]]

Humans depend on plants for [[food]], either directly or as feed for [[domestic animal]]s. [[Agriculture]] deals with the production of food crops, and has [[History of agriculture|played a key role in the history of world civilizations]]. Agriculture includes [[agronomy]] for arable crops, [[horticulture]] for vegetables and fruit, and [[forestry]] for timber.&lt;ref name=NatGeogAgriculture&gt;{{cite web |title=The Development of Agriculture |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/ |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=20 June 2016 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major [[staple crop|staples]] include [[cereal]]s such as [[rice]] and [[wheat]], starchy roots and tubers such as [[cassava]] and [[potato]], and [[legume]]s such as [[peas]] and [[bean]]s. [[Vegetable oil]]s such as [[olive oil]] provide [[lipids]], while [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s contribute [[vitamin]]s and minerals to the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Food and drink |url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/food-drink |publisher=[[Kew Gardens]] |accessdate=1 October 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328124344/http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/food-drink |archivedate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In industry===
{{main article|Industrial crop}}
[[File:Timber DonnellyMills2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|left|[[Timber]]]]

Plants grown as [[industrial crop]]s are the source of a wide range of products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Industrial Crop Production |url=http://www.sustainabletable.org/804/industrial-crop-production |publisher=Grace Communications Foundation |accessdate=20 June 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonfood products include [[essential oil]]s, [[natural dye]]s, pigments, waxes, [[resin]]s, [[tannin]]s, alkaloids, amber and [[Cork material|cork]]. Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, [[latex]], lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and [[Gum (botany)|gums]]. Renewable fuels from plants include [[firewood]], [[peat]] and other [[biofuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS An International Journal |url=https://www.elsevier.com/journals/industrial-crops-and-products/0926-6690?generatepdf=true |publisher=Elsevier |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruzDierig2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cruz |first1=Von Mark V. |last2=Dierig |first2=David A. |title=Industrial Crops: Breeding for BioEnergy and Bioproducts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIFxBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9 |year=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4939-1447-0 |pages=9 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fossil fuel]]s [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including [[phytoplankton]] in [[geological time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sato |first1=Motoaki |title=Thermochemistry of the formation of fossil fuels |work=Fluid-Mineral Interactions: A Tribute to H.

Thousands of plant species are cultivated for aesthetic purposes as well as to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to [[garden tourism|historic gardens]], [[national park]]s, [[rainforest]]s, [[forest]]s with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as [[Hanami|Japan's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=T2blg2Kw_zcC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=hanami#v=onepage&amp;q=hanami&amp;f=false |page=12 |title=Introduction to Japanese culture |first=Daniel |last=Sosnoski |publisher=Tuttle |year=1996 |isbn=0-8048-2056-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Cherry Blossom Festival|America's cherry blossom festivals]].&lt;ref name="NCBF"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314055554/http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/about/history/ |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url=http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/about/history/ |title=History of the Cherry Blossom Trees and Festival |work=National Cherry Blossom Festival: About |publisher=National Cherry Blossom Festival |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some [[garden]]s are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. [[Arboretum]]s and [[botanical garden]]s are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with [[topiary]] or [[espalier]]. [[Gardening]] is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or [[horticulture therapy]] is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as [[houseplant]]s, or in specialized buildings such as [[greenhouse]]s that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. [[Venus Flytrap]], [[sensitive plant]] and [[resurrection plant]] are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as [[bonsai]], [[ikebana]], and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. [[Ornamental plant]]s have sometimes changed the course of history, as in [[tulip mania|tulipomania]].&lt;ref name="Lambert"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Tim|title=A Brief History of Gardening|url=http://www.localhistories.org/gardening.html|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=21 June 2016|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific advances in [[genetic engineering]] led to developments in crops. [[Genetically modified crops]] introduce new traits to plants which they do not have naturally. These can bring benefits such as a decrease in the use of harmful pesticides, by building in qualities such as insect resistance and herbicide tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wolfenbarger|first=L.

The '''Fire Mummies''' of the [[Philippines]], also known as the''' [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]] Mummies''', [[Benguet]] Mummies, or [[Ibaloi]] Mummies, are a group of [[mummies]] found along the mountain slopes of  [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], a town in the northern part of the Philippines. They were made from as early as 2000 BC until the 16th century, when [[Spain]] [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colonized the Philippines]]. Today, they remain in natural [[caves]] and a museum in [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]].

== Description ==

[[Scientists]] believe that the Fire Mummies were created by the [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]] between 1200 and 1500 [[AD]] in five towns in [[Benguet]] and buried in [[caves]]. Others believe that the process of [[mummification]] began at 2000 [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="made"/&gt; What makes the Fire Mummies unique is their process of [[mummification]]. That mummification began shortly before a person [[death|died]], where he would [[digestion|digest]] a very salty drink. After his death, his [[corpse]] was washed and set over a [[fire]] in a seated position, thus drying the fluids. [[Smoke]] from [[tobacco]] was blown into the [[mouth]] to dry the body's inside and [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]]. Eventually, herbs were rubbed into the body.&lt;ref name="making"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fire-mummies-of-the-philippines |title=Fire Mummies of the Philippines |author=Dylan |author2=Treeswithknees |author3=Nicholas Jackson |website=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mummified bodies are then placed in a coffin made of pinewood and laid to rest in rock shelters, natural caves or man made burial niches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2070/|title = Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves|date = |accessdate = September 13, 2014|website = |publisher = UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of that mummification ended, since [[Spaniards]] [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colonized the Philippines]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="made"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/kabayan.htm |title=Kabayan Mummies |at=When were they made |website=Mummy Tombs |accessdate=21 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001028161032/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/kabayan.htm |archivedate=28 October 2000 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery ===

When the Fire Mummies were 'discovered' in the early 20th century by Westerners (the mummies have been known to local communities for hundreds of years), many of them were [[Grave robbery|stolen]], because the [[caves]] were mostly unprotected. Because of this, Monument Watch, a [[nonprofit organization]], declared the site as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paperdue.com/essay/Fire-Mummies-of-the-6468 |title=Fire Mummies of the Philippines |author=Paperdue |date=November 2010 |website=PaperDue.com |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==

After [[logging]] operations intensified in the area, the location of many [[caves]] became known. Unfortunately this has led to [[looting]], as unconscientious visitors have been eager to leave their mark, including [[graffiti]], on the Kabayan mummies. The Kabayan Mummies were listed in the [[1998 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. Funding through [[American Express]] was used for emergency conservation and the creation of a comprehensive management plan. Additionally, local authorities from surrounding municipalities collaborated in cultural awareness campaign to introduce the Mummies to [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]. [[tourism|Tourist]] facilities were also constructed in order to control visitation and prevent harmful intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmf.org/project/kabayan-mummy-caves |website=World Monuments Fund |title=Kabayan Mummy Caves |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fire Mummies remain in natural [[caves]] with relatively small security and have been designated as one of the 100 world's most endangered heritage sites. Officials know 50-80 other mummies, but they will not give their locations because of their fear of [[vandalism]]. A small museum in [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], [[Benguet]] also displays a few mummies.&lt;ref name="making"/&gt;

== Declarations ==
The Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves are listed as National Cultural Treasures by the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 374. It is also under consideration as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Scholars are also pushing for the inclusion of the mummy burial caves in neighboring [[Buguias, Benguet|Buguias]] town in the ''Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves'' nomination of the Philippines in the UNESCO Tentative List. The caves in Buguias is home to one of Benguet's folk hero, Apo Anno. The burial caves in Kabayan and Buguias will collectively be called as the Benguet Mummy Burial Caves or Mummy Burial Caves in Kabayan and Buguias.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Assistants and George Frederic Watts - Hope - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'', [[George Frederic Watts]], 1886. Cover of ''On Kitsch'' by Odd Nerdrum and others.&lt;ref group=note name="on kitsch" /&gt;|alt=Image shows man on a spherical object hunched over.]]
'''Kitsch painting''' is an international movement of [[Classical tradition|classical painters]] founded upon a 24 September 1998 speech and philosophy by the Norwegian artist, [[Odd Nerdrum]],&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Pettinger [http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/the-kitsch-campaign/Content?oid=926148] "The Kitsch Campaign" [Boise Weekly], December 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; later clarified in his book ''[[On Kitsch]]''&lt;ref&gt;Dag Solhjell and Odd Nerdrum [https://www.amazon.com/Kitsch-Jan-Erik-Ebbestad-Hansen/dp/8248901238] "On Kitsch" Kagge Publishing, August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; with Jan-Ove Tuv and others.&lt;ref group=note name="on kitsch"&gt;Odd Nerdrum, Sindre Mekjan, Jan-Erik Ebbestad Hansen, Jan-Ove Tuv, and Dag Solhjell&lt;/ref&gt; The movement incorporates the techniques of the [[Old Masters]] with narrative, [[romanticism]], and emotionally charged imagery. The movement defines [[Kitsch]] as synonymous with the [[art]]s of ancient Rome or the [[techne]] of ancient Greece. Kitsch painters embrace kitsch as a positive term not in opposition to "[[art]]", but as its own independent superstructure. Kitsch painters assert that Kitsch is not an art movement, but a philosophical movement separate from [[art]]. The Kitsch movement has been considered an indirect criticism of the contemporary art world, but according to Nerdrum and many Kitsch painters, this is not their expressed intention.&lt;ref&gt;Signy Norendal, "Interview with Robert Dale Williams" [Aktuell Kunst] September 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Scott [http://artbabel.blogspot.com/2010/04/philosophy-of-kitsch-kant-kunst-and.html] The Philosophy of Kitsch.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://janovetuv.com/bruker/articles/Defence%20of%20kich_E%2038-39.pdf Jan-Ove Tuv]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of kitsch painting philosophy==
The philosophy originated by Nerdrum first manifested into a group among Nerdrum's circle of students&lt;ref&gt;Kristiane Larssen "Skolemesteren" [D2/DagensNaeringsliv] November 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Jan-Ove Tuv, Helene Knoop, Hege Elizabeth Haugen, Monika Helgesen, [[Jeremy Caniglia]], Kjetil Jul, Brad Silverstein, Carlos Madrid, Stefan Boulter, Brandon Kralik, Nanne Nyander, and soon expanded. Many kitsch painters were featured in and contributed essays to Nerdrum's book ''Kitsch: More than Art''&lt;ref&gt;Odd Nerdrum [https://www.amazon.com/Odd-Nerdrum-Kitsch-More-than/dp/8251636388] Schibsted Forlag, September 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ljungström air preheater''' is an [[air preheater]] invented by the Swedish engineer [[Fredrik Ljungström]] (1875-1964). The patent was achieved in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[https://patents.google.com/patent/US1746598 Patent USPTO No. 1746598, 11 February 1930]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in a modern utility boiler provides up to 20 percent of the total heat transfer in the boiler process, but only represents 2 percent of the investment.&lt;ref name="ASME, preheater" &gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The factory and workshop activities and laboratories in Lidingö would remain throughout the 1920s, with some 70 personnel. In the 1930s it was used a film studio, and was finally demolished in the 1970s to give space for new industry premises.

With Fredrik Ljungström's technology of the air preheater implemented in a vast amount of modern [[power station]]s around the world until this day with total attributed worldwide [[fuel savings]] estimated to 4,960,000,000 [[ton]]s of [[oil]], "few inventions have been as successful in saving fuel as the Ljungström Air Preheater".

In 1995, the Ljungström air preheater was distinguished as the 44th [[International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/getmedia/c7cf3d83-508f-4946-b476-9399c390fc83/185-Ljungstrom-Air-Preheater.aspx |title=The Ljungström Air Preheater 1920|date=June 21, 1995 |website=asme.org |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Needs analysis''' is the formal process that sits alongside [[Requirements analysis]] and focuses on the human elements of the requirements.

==Introduction==

[[User-centered design]], according to Katz-Haas, is really about defining who the users are, defining their tasks and goals, their experience levels, what functions they want and need from a system, what information they want and need and understanding how the users think the system should work. [[User-centered design]] has also been linked to the identification of required job performance skills, the assessment of prospective trainees’ skills and the development of objectives.

The first step in any user centered design process is to understand the user’s needs.

Put simply, whereas [[requirements analysis]] focuses on the elements needed to be represented in the system, needs analysis focuses on the requirements related to the goals, aspirations and needs of the users and/or the user community and feeds them into the system requirement analysis process. The main purpose of needs analysis is the user’s satisfaction.

As it focuses on the needs of the human, needs analysis is not limited to addressing the requirements of just software, but can be applied to any domain, such as automotive, consumer product or services such as banking. Although it is not a business development tool, it can be used to help in the development of a business case.

We can identify the customers needs by three ways:
# Client request,
# Modification of an existing design,
# Generation of new product.

==Underlying principles of needs analysis==
The following list gives the principles of needs analysis as originally defined.
*	User’s need-based requirements are complex and can conflict
*	User’s need-based requirements build a bridge from the business case to the design
*	User’s need-based requirements help to identify trade-offs that need to happen in the design process (i.e., where a design cannot resolve the user’s need-based requirement conflicts)
*	User’s need-based requirements are there to unify the multi-disciplinary design team; enabling them to meet their business case.
*	Formulate and ask questions to do with the business plan that provide an indication of the human aspects of the system, including the relative merit of functionality.
*	Always express these findings from the user’s perspective.
*	Cross-relate these requirements to each other and to the impactors on the activity.
*	Allocate sufficient time during the development process to check and validate your user’s need-based requirements.
*	Ensure that all user’s need based requirements are derived as low level user requirements before being transposed into system requirements.
*	Word your requirements precisely and ensure that you cover all categories of human-related requirements.
*	Create test statements to validate the user’s need-based requirements, the concept and the implementation.
*	Prior to freezing your design, validate your user’s need-based requirements with users.
*	Accept that there still may be contradictory requirements.
*	Understand the nuances of the requirements and ensure that these are reflected in the precise wording of the requirements.
*	Keep asking your users until you have a true understanding of their requirements.
*	Elegant design can only be created from understanding the nuances of the requirements sharing ideas and fact toward feasibility of work.

{{See also|epistemological break}}

A '''paradigm shift''', a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], is a fundamental change in the basic [[concept]]s and [[experiment]]al practices of a [[:Category:Scientific disciplines|scientific discipline]]. Kuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a [[scientific revolution]], to the activity of [[normal science]], which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework (or paradigm). In this context, the word "paradigm" is used in its original [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning, as "example".

The nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by [[Modern Philosophy|modern philosophy]] since [[Immanuel Kant]] used the phrase in the preface to the second edition of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787). Kant used the phrase "revolution of the way of thinking" ({{lang|de|Revolution der Denkart}}) to refer to [[Greek mathematics]] and [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of [[Foundations of mathematics#Foundational crisis|mathematics]], [[Theory of relativity|physics]], and [[Life#Biology|biology]] revitalized interest in the question among scholars.

Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). As one commentator summarizes:

{{quote|text=Kuhn acknowledges having used the term "paradigm" in two different meanings. In the first one, "paradigm" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton’s Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls "normal science". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term "paradigm", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxvanmanen.com/files/2014/03/Agamben-What-is-a-paradigm1.pdf |author= Agamben, Giorgio |authorlink= Giorgio Agamben |title=What is a Paradigm? |accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.

== Kuhnian paradigm shifts ==
[[File:Duck-Rabbit illusion.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kuhn used the [[Rabbit–duck illusion|duck-rabbit optical illusion]], made famous by [[Wittgenstein]], to demonstrate the way in which a paradigm shift could cause one to see the same information in an entirely different way.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An [[epistemology|epistemological]] paradigm shift  was called a "scientific revolution" by epistemologist and [[history of science|historian of science]] Thomas Kuhn in his book ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.

A scientific revolution occurs, according to Kuhn, when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is not simply the current theory, but the entire [[World view|worldview]] in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it. This is based on features of landscape of knowledge that scientists can identify around them.

There are anomalies for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, that are brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject [[Karl Popper]]'s model of [[falsifiability]] as the key force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To put it in the context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|Mercury's perihelion]] more troubling than the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, from that of the [[logical positivists]] in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.

When enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm, the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of ''crisis,'' according to Kuhn. During this crisis, new ideas, perhaps ones previously discarded, are tried. Eventually a ''new'' paradigm is formed, which gains its own new followers, and an intellectual "battle" takes place between the followers of the new paradigm and the hold-outs of the old paradigm. Again, for early 20th century physics, the transition between the [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwellian]] [[Maxwell's equations|electromagnetic worldview]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] worldview was neither instantaneous nor calm, and instead involved a protracted set of "attacks," both with empirical data as well as rhetorical or philosophical arguments, by both sides, with the Einsteinian theory winning out in the long run. Again, the weighing of evidence and importance of new data was fit through the human sieve: some scientists found the simplicity of Einstein's equations to be most compelling, while some found them more complicated than the notion of Maxwell's aether which they banished. Some found [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of light bending around the sun to be compelling, while some questioned their accuracy and meaning. Sometimes the convincing force is just time itself and the human toll it takes, Kuhn said, using a quote from [[Max Planck]]: "a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a given discipline has changed from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a ''scientific revolution'' or a ''paradigm shift''. It is often this final conclusion, the result of the long process, that is meant when the term ''paradigm shift'' is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.

In a 2015 retrospective on Kuhn,&lt;ref&gt;''Paradigm Shift: How Expert Opinions Keep Changing on Life, the Universe and Everything'', Imprint Academic 2015, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; the philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] describes the notion of the paradigm shift as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, [[Paul Feyerabend]], accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.

== Science and paradigm shift ==

A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sankey, Howard (1997) "Kuhn's ontological relativism," in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305–20. {{ISBN|0792344448}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal.  Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (3rd ed.): p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.

These claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another—that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes—so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the [[philosopher]] [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published a highly regarded essay in 1974, "''On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme''" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973–1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}.)

Paradigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system. 

In ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn wrote, "Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science." (p.&amp;nbsp;12) Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time, as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a "paradigm shift" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.

Philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} {{See also|Science and Theosophy#New paradigm}}

== Examples of paradigm shifts ==

=== Natural sciences ===
Some of the "classical cases" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are:

* 1543 – The transition in [[cosmology]] from a [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic cosmology]] to a [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] one.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 154 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1543 – The acceptance of the work of [[Andreas Vesalius]], whose work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' corrected the numerous errors in the previously-held system created by [[Galen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=[Vesalius and De humani corporis fabrica: Galen's errors and the change of anatomy in the sixteenth century] | pmid=11625189 | journal=Hippokrates (Helsinki) | pages=98–112 | last1 = Joutsivuo | first1 = T| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1687 – The transition in [[mechanics]] from [[Aristotelian mechanics]] to [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 148 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1783 – The acceptance of [[Lavoisier]]'s theory of chemical reactions and combustion in place of [[phlogiston theory]], known as the [[chemical revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Paradigm Shifts: Technology &amp; Culture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
* The transition in [[optics]] from [[geometrical optics]] to [[physical optics]] with [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s wave theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1826 – The discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trudeau|first1=Richard J|title=The non-Euclidean revolution|date=1987|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3311-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1859 – The revolution in [[evolution]] from goal-directed change to [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1880 - The [[germ theory of disease]] began overtaking Galen's [[miasma theory]].
* 1905 – The development of [[quantum mechanics]], which replaced [[classical mechanics]] at microscopic scales.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 83–84, 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1887 to 1905 – The transition from the [[luminiferous aether]] present in [[space]] to [[electromagnetic radiation]] in [[spacetime]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1919 – The transition between the worldview of [[Newtonian gravity]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[General Relativity]].

=== Social sciences ===
In Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a "tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kuhn | first= Thomas N. |authorlink= Thomas Kuhn |editor1-last= Lakatos |editor1-first= Imre |editor2-last= Musgrave |editor2-first= Alan |editor1-link= Imre Lakatos |editor2-link= Alan Musgrave |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |edition= second |origyear= 1970 |year= 1972 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-09623-2 |page= 6 |chapter= Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have applied Kuhn's concept of paradigm shift to the social sciences.

* The movement known as the [[cognitive revolution]] moved away from [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]] approaches to [[Psychology|psychological]] study and the acceptance of [[cognition]] as central to studying human behaviour.
* The [[Keynesian revolution]] is typically viewed as a major shift in [[macroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Laidler]]. ''Fabricating the Keynesian Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Say's Law]] dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century, and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult. Economists who contradicted the law, which implied that underemployment and underinvestment (coupled with oversaving) were virtually impossible, risked losing their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbraith |first=John Kenneth |year=1975 |title=Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went |page=223 |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-395-19843-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzdkAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his magnum opus, Keynes cited one of his predecessors, [[John A. Hobson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money |page=366 |quote=Mr. Hobson has flung himself with unflagging, but almost unavailing, ardour and courage against the ranks of orthodoxy. Though it is so completely forgotten to-day, the publication of this book marks, in a sense, an epoch in economic thought. }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was repeatedly denied positions at universities for his heretical theory.
* Later, the movement for [[monetarism]] over [[Keynesian]]ism marked a second divisive shift. Monetarists held that fiscal policy was not effective for stabilizing [[inflation]], that it was solely a monetary phenomenon, in contrast to the [[Keynesian]] view of the time was that both fiscal and monetary policy were important.  Keynesians later adopted much of the monetarists' view of the [[quantity theory of money]] and shifting [[Phillips curve]], theories they initially rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Michael D., Schwartz, Anna J. (2008). [https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/08/09/Bordo.pdf Monetary Economic Research at the St. Louis Fed During Ted Balbach's Tenure as Research Director]. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ''Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* First proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] in 1879, the [[laryngeal theory]] in [[Indo-European linguistics]] postulated the existence of "laryngeal" consonants in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE), a theory that was confirmed by the discovery of the [[Hittite language]] in the early 20th century. The theory has since been accepted by the vast majority of linguists, paving the way for the [[internal reconstruction]] of the syntax and grammatical rules of PIE and is considered one of the most significant developments in linguistics since the initial discovery of the [[Indo-European language family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indo European Linguistics: An Introduction|author=James Clackson|publisher=[[Cambridge University]]|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied sciences ===
More recently, paradigm shifts are also recognisable in applied sciences:
* In medicine, the transition from "clinical judgment" to [[evidence-based medicine]]
* In software engineering, the transition from the Rational Paradigm to the Empirical Paradigm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=Paul|title=The two paradigms of software development research|journal=Science of Computer Programming|date=January 2018|volume=156|pages=68–89|doi=10.1016/j.scico.2018.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==
In the later part of the 1990s, 'paradigm shift' emerged as a [[buzzword]], popularized as [[marketing speak]] and appearing more frequently in print and publication.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Fulford, Globe and Mail (June 5, 1999). http://www.robertfulford.com/Paradigm.html Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''Mind The Gaffe'', author [[Larry Trask]] advises readers to refrain from using it, and to use caution when reading anything that contains the phrase.  It is referred to in several articles and books&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6275610-1.html Cnet.com's Top 10 Buzzwords]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Complete Idiot's Guide to A Smart Vocabulary"&gt;[http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp "The Complete Idiot's Guide to a Smart Vocabulary" pp. 142–43, author: Paul McFedries publisher: Alpha; 1st edition (May 7, 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215012026/http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp |date=December 15, 2007 }} {{ISBN|978-0-02-863997-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as abused and overused to the point of becoming meaningless.

== Other uses ==
The term "paradigm shift" has found uses in other contexts, representing the notion of a major change in a certain thought-pattern—a radical change in personal beliefs, complex systems or organizations, replacing the former way of thinking or organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing:
* M. L. Handa, a professor of sociology in education at O.I.S.E. [[University of Toronto]], Canada, developed the concept of a paradigm within the context of social sciences. He defines what he means by "paradigm" and introduces the idea of a "social paradigm". In addition, he identifies the basic component of any social paradigm. Like Kuhn, he addresses the issue of changing paradigms, the process popularly known as "paradigm shift". In this respect, he focuses on the social circumstances which precipitate such a shift. Relatedly, he addresses how that shift affects social institutions, including the institution of education.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* The concept has been developed for technology and economics in the identification of new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological systems that have a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy ([[Carlota Perez]]; earlier work only on technological paradigms by [[Giovanni Dosi]]). This concept is linked to [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s idea of [[creative destruction]]. Examples include the move to mass production and the introduction of microelectronics.&lt;ref http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/4/779.full.pdf&gt;2009. "Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms", Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 34, No.1, pp. 185–202&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two photographs of the Earth from space, "[[Earthrise]]" (1968) and "[[The Blue Marble]]" (1972), are thought to have helped to usher in the [[environmentalist]] movement which gained great prominence in the years immediately following distribution of those images.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Christopher H. "Global Warming and the Problem of Policy Innovation: Lessons from the Early Environmental Movement". 2009. http://www.lclark.edu/org/envtl/objects/39-2_Schroeder.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Stewart Brand#NASA image of Earth]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hans Küng]] applies Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm change to the entire history of Christian thought and theology. He identifies six historical "macromodels": 1) the apocalyptic paradigm of primitive Christianity, 2) the Hellenistic paradigm of the patristic period, 3) the medieval Roman Catholic paradigm, 4) the Protestant (Reformation) paradigm, 5) the modern Enlightenment paradigm, and 6) the emerging ecumenical paradigm. He also discusses five analogies between natural science and theology in relation to paradigm shifts. Küng addresses paradigm change in his books, Paradigm Change in Theology&lt;ref&gt;Kung, Hans &amp; Tracy, David (ed). ''Paradigm Change in Theology''. New York: Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''.&lt;ref&gt;Küng, Hans. ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''. New York: Anchor Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Projexity''' is a Canadian company that offers online audience engagement tools to groups, organizations and municipalities. Projexity's tools have predominantly been used by organizations with strong social impact mandates like the David Suzuki Foundation.

Projexity's tools aim to make it easy for the public to submit content such as events and initiatives to organizations directly through their own websites, effectively transforming any website into a dynamic community hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://projexity.com/ |title=About |publisher=Projexity |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The platform was originally created by designers [[Nicolas Koff]] and [[Marisa Bernstein]], and computer programmer [[Jonathan Koff]] as a means to bring more public engagement and transparency to the often exclusive city building process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/episodes/2013/04/04/crowd-sourcing/ |title=Metro Morning &amp;#124; Crowdsourcing |publisher=CBC.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39485">'''Proletarian literature''' refers here to the literature created by [[working-class]] writers mainly for the [[class-consciousness|class-conscious]] [[proletariat]]. Though the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' states that because it "is essentially an intended device of revolution", it is therefore often published by the [[Communist Party]] or left wing sympathizers,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; the proletarian novel has also been categorized without any emphasis on revolution, as a novel "about the working classes and working-class life; perhaps with the intention of making propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Criticism''. (London: Penguin Books, 1999, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; This different emphasis may reflect a difference between Russian, American and other traditions of working-class writing, with that of Britain. The British tradition was not especially inspired by the Communist Party, but had its roots in the [[Chartist movement]], and [[socialism]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hayward, ''Working-Class Fiction: from Chartism to ''Trainspotting''. (London: Northcote House, 1997), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, writing about the British working-class writers, H Gustav Klaus, in ''The Socialist Novel: Towards the Recovery of a Tradition'' (1982) suggested that "the once current [term] 'proletarian' is, internationally, on the retreat, while the competing concepts of 'working-class' and 'socialist' continue to command about equal adherence".&lt;ref&gt;Brighton: Harvest Press, 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word proletarian is also used to describe works about the working class by working-class authors, to distinguish them from works by middle-class authors such as [[Charles Dickens]] (''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]''), [[John Steinbeck]] (''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''), and [[Henry Green]] (''[[Living (novel)|Living]]'').&lt;ref name="Fordham-p71"&gt;John Fordham, "'A Strange Field’: Region and Class in the Novels of Harold Heslop" in ''Intermodernism: Literary Culture in Mid-Twentieth-Century Britain'', ed. Kristin Bluemel. Published 2009 :Edinburgh University Press, note no.1, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, though some of poet [[William Blake]]'s (1757–1827) works are early examples of working-class literature, including the two "The Chimney Sweeper" poems, published in ''[[Songs of Innocence]]'' in 1789 and ''[[Songs of Experience]]'' in 1794, which deal with the subject of child labour,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://asms.k12.ar.us/classes/humanities/britlit/97-98/blake/POEMS.htm William Blake Page]", The Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, &amp; the Arts&lt;/ref&gt; Blake, whose father was a tradesman, was not a proletarian writer.

==Proletarian novel==
The [[proletariat]] are members of the [[working class]]. The proletarian novel is a subgenre of the [[novel]], written by workers mainly for other workers. It overlaps and sometimes is synonymous with the working-class novel,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gustav Klaus, ''The Socialist Novel in Britain: Towards the Recovery of a Tradition''. ( Brighton: Harvester Press, 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; socialist novel,&lt;ref&gt;H.

The proletarian novel may [[Political commentary|comment]] on [[political]] events, systems and theories, and is frequently seen as an instrument to promote social reform or political revolution among the working classes. Proletarian literature is created especially by [[communist]], [[socialist]] and [[anarchist]] authors. It is about the lives of poor, and the period 1930 to 1945 in particular produced many such novels. However, there were works before and after these dates. In Britain the term [[working class]] literature, novel ''etc''. is more generally used. The intention of the writers of proletarian literature is to lift the workers from the slums, by inspiring them to embrace the possibilities of social change or a political revolution. As such it is a form of [[political fiction]].

==United States==
The most important American working-class writers gathered in the First American Writers Congress of 1935. The [[League of American Writers]] was backed by the [[Communist Party USA]]. Among the famous international writers who attended the Congress were Georg Fink (pseudonym of the German writer [[:de:Kurt Münzer|Kurt Münzer]]), [[Mike Gold]] of New York (both of whom were Jewish), [[José Revueltas]] of Mexico,  [[:es:Nicomedes Guzmán|Nicomedes Guzmán]] of Chile, [[Jorge Icaza Coronel|Jorge Icaza]] of Ecuador, and numerous others.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In the United States, [[Mike Gold]], author of  ''[[Jews Without Money]]'', was the first to promote proletarian literature in [[Max Eastman]]'s magazine ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]]'' and later in ''[[The New Masses]]''. The Communist party newspaper, ''[[The Daily Worker]]'' also published some literature, as did numerous other magazines, including ''The Anvil'', edited by [[Jack Conroy]], ''Blast'', and ''[[Partisan Review]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Other examples of American proletarian writing include [[B. Traven]], ''[[The Death Ship]]'' (1926) (though it is presumed that Traven was born in Germany); [[Agnes Smedley]], ''[[Daughter of Earth]]'' (1929); [[Edward Dahlberg]], ''Bottom Dogs'' (1929);  [[Jack Conroy]], ''[[The Disinherited]]'' (1933); [[James T. Farrell]], ''[[Studs Lonigan]]'' (a trilogy, 1932-5); [[Robert Cantwell]], ''The Land of Plenty'' (1934); [[Henry Roth]], ''[[Call It Sleep]]'' (1934); [[Meridel Le Sueur]], ''Salute to Spring'' (1940) and [[Tillie Olsen]], ''[[Yonnondio: From the Thirties|Yonnondio]]'' (1930s, published 1974).

Writers like [[John Steinbeck]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[John Dos Passos]], who wrote about the working class, but who came from more well-to-do backgrounds, are not included here.

==Soviet Russia==
An important movement In the first years of the [[Russian Revolution]], [[Proletkult]], was an effort to encourage literacy. This was something quite different from the later, traditional and realist proletarian novel of the [[Stalin]] years.

In the 1930s [[Socialist realism]] became the predominant trend in Russia. Its leading figure was [[Maxim Gorky]], who had laid the foundations of this style with his works ''[[The Mother (1906 novel)|The Mother]]'' and his play ''The Enemies'' (both 1906). Gorky described the lives of people in the lowest strata and on the margins of society, revealing their hardships, humiliations, and brutalization.&lt;ref name="kirjasto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/gorki.htm |title=Maxim Gorky |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706084924/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/gorki.htm |archivedate=6 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not come from a working-class family and neither did another prominent writer in the early years after the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, [[Alexander Ostrovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;"Maxim Gorky", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' http://www.britannica.com/biography/Maksim-Gorky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Revyakin&lt; A.I. A.N. Ostrovsky. Life and Works. Moscow, 1949, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Nikolay Ostrovsky]] is an important writer, of the early Soviet era, from a working-class family. His novel ''[[How the Steel Was Tempered]]'' (1932) has been among the most successful works of [[Russian literature]], with tens of millions of copies printed in many languages around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/e2008/e200804/p28.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="compuart"&gt;http://www.compuart.ru/article.aspx?id=8496&amp;iid=346&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a fictionalized autobiography of Ostrovsky's life, who had a difficult working-class childhood and became a [[Komsomol]] member in July 1919 and went to the front as a volunteer. The novel's protagonist, Pavel Korchagin, represented the "young hero" of Russian literature: he is dedicated to his political causes, which help him to overcome his tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;Soviet literature: problems and people K. Zelinsky, Progress Publishers. Moscow. 1970. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonid Leonov]]  (1899 — 1994) was a Soviet novelist and playwright. His novel ''The Russian Forest'' (1953) was acclaimed by the authorities as a model Soviet book on [[World War II]] and received the [[Lenin Prize]], but its implication that the Soviet regime had cut down "the symbol of Old Russian culture" caused some nervousness, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reminded the author that "not all trees are useful ... from time to time the forest must be thinned."&lt;ref&gt;James H. Billington, ''The Icon and the Axe: An Interpretive History of Russian Culture'' (Knopf, 1966), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==

===19th century===
[[Image:Tressell.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Tressell banner]]
Poet [[John Clare]] (1793–1864) was an important early British working-class writer. Clare was the son of a farm labourer, and came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation of its disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Summerfield, in introduction to ''John Clare: Selected Poems'', Penguin Books 1990, pp 13–22.  {{ISBN|0-14-043724-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry underwent a major re-evaluation in the late 20th century and he is now considered to be among the most important 19th-century poets.&lt;ref&gt;Sales, Roger  (2002) ''John Clare: A Literary Life''; Palgrave Macmillan {{ISBN|0-333-65270-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer [[Jonathan Bate]] states that Clare was "the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bate, John Clare: A biography; Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] example of a working-class novel is [[Chartism|chartist]] Thomas Martin Wheeler's ''Sunshine and Shadows'', which was serialized in the ''Northern Star'' 1849-50.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Haywood, ''Working-Class Fiction: from Chartism to 'Trainspotting' ''. (Plymouth: Nortcote House, 1997), p7&lt;/ref&gt; Another chartist writer was the shoemaker poet [[Thomas Cooper (poet)|Thomas Cooper]], who, while in prison for making an inflammatory speech, "followed in the footsteps of [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]] and other radicals and wrote imaginatively about the themes of oppression and emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Haywood, ''Working-Class Fiction'', pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[Walter Greenwood]]'s ''[[Love on the Dole]]'' (1933) has been described as an "excellent example" of an English proletarian novel.&lt;ref&gt;J. A Cuddon, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written during the early 1930s as a response to the crisis of unemployment, which was being felt locally, nationally, and internationally. It is set in Hanky Park, the industrial slum in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] where Greenwood was born and brought up. The story begins around the time of the [[General Strike]] of 1926, but its main action takes place in 1931.

Several working-class writers  wrote about their experience of life in the [[merchant navy]], including  [[James Hanley (novelist)|James Hanley]], [[Jim Phelan (Irish writer)|Jim Phelan]], [[George Garrett (activist)|George Garrett]], and [[John Sommerfield]]. Liverpool-Irish writer James Hanley wrote a number of works based on his experiences at sea as well as a member of a working-class seafaring family. An early example is the novella ''The Last Voyage'' (1931), in which stoker John Reilly, who is still working only because he lied about his age, now faces his last voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Reilly is in his mid-sixties he has a young family, who will have to live in future on his inadequate pension.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In another sense this is Reilly's last voyage, because despairing of the future he throws himself into the ship’s furnace: “Saw all his life illuminated in those flames. ‘Not much for us. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Sign on. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Finish. Ah, well!’”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Binding, "Man Against Fate", a review of James Hanley's ''Last Voyage and Other Stories''. ''Times Literary Supplement'', 5 December 1997, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Last Voyage and Other Stories'' (London: Harvill Press, 1997, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other works by Hanley are ''[[Boy (novel)|Boy]]'' (1931) and ''[[The Furys Chronicle|The Furys]]'' (1935).

There were a number of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] writers who wrote works based on their experiences as coal miners, including novelist (and playwright) [[Jack Jones (novelist)|Jack Jones]] (1884–1970), novelists [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)|Gwyn Thomas]] (1913–1981). [[Lewis Jones (writer)|Lewis Jones]] (1897–1939), and [[Gwyn Jones (author)|Gwyn Jones]] (1907–1999), and poet [[Idris Davies]] (1905–53). Jack Jones was a miner's son from [[Merthyr Tydfil]] who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the [[CPGB|Communist Party]], but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are ''[[Rhondda Roundabout]]'' (1935) and ''Bidden to the Feast'' (1938). The political development of a young miner is the subject of ''Cwmardy'' (1937), [[Lewis Jones (writer)|Lewis Jones]]'s (1897–1939) largely autobiographical novel. [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)|Gwyn Thomas]] (1913–81) was also a coalminer's son from the Rhondda, but won a scholarship to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and then became a schoolmaster. He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the [[Rhondda Valley]] in the 1930s. Thomas's first accepted book was a collection of short stories, ''Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh'', which appeared in 1946. Another writer who escaped from his proletarian background was [[Gwyn Jones (author)|Gwyn Jones]] (1907–1999). He wrote about this world in novels and short stories, including ''Times Like These'' (1936) which explores the life of a working-class family during the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 miners' strike]]. The mining valleys produced a significant working-class poet in [[Idris Davies]] (1905–53), who worked as a coal miner before qualifying as a teacher. He initially wrote in Welsh "but rebellion against chapel religion", along with the "inspirational influence of English" poets, led him to write in English. ''Gwalia Deserta'' (1938) is about the [[Great Depression]], while the subject of ''The Angry Summer'' (1943) is the 1926 miners' strike. [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]], author of ''A Time To Laugh'' (1937), and [[Menna Gallie]], author of ''Strike for a Kingdom'' (1959) and ''The Small Mine'' (1962), while not working class, also wrote about life in the mining valleys of [[South Wales]]. [[Harold Heslop]], author of the novel ''The Earth Beneath'' (1946) was another coal miner, but from the north-east of [[England]], as was [[Sid Chaplin]], who wrote ''The Thin Seam'' (1949).

Both [[Alan Sillitoe]], ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'' (1958) and [[Stan Barstow]], ''[[A Kind of Loving]]'' (1960), were working class writers associated with the so-called [[Angry young men]]; they were also linked with [[Kitchen sink realism]], a literary movement that used a style of social realism. This often depicted the domestic situations of working class Britons living in cramped rented accommodation and spending their off-hours drinking in grimy pubs, to explore social issues and political controversies. However, some of the writers also associated with these two movements, like [[John Osborne]] and [[John Braine]], did not come from the working-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heilpern|2006|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Braine "John Braine", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' ;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some other important twentieth-century British working class novelists and novels: [[Robert Tressell]], ''[[The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists]]'' (1914); [[James C. Welsh]], ''The Underworld'' (1920); [[Ethel Carnie Holdsworth]], ''This Slavery'' (1925); [[Ellen Wilkinson]], ''[[Clash (novel)|Clash]]'' (1929);  [[Lewis Grassic Gibbon]] ''[[A Scots Quair]]'' (trilogy, 1932-4); [[Barry Hines]], ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'' (1968); [[William McIlvanney]], ''[[Docherty (novel)|Docherty]]'' (1975); [[Pat Barker]], ''[[Union Street (book)|Union Street]]'' (1982); [[James Kelman]], ''[[The Busconductor Hines]]'' (1984); [[Irvine Welsh]], ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Haywood, ''Working-Class Fiction'', pp. 170–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Bond]] is an important working-class dramatist and his play ''[[Saved (play)|Saved]]'' (1965) became one of the best known [[cause célèbre]]s in 20th century British theatre history. ''Saved'' delves into the lives of a selection of South London working class youths suppressed – as Bond would see it – by a brutal economic system and unable to give their lives meaning, who drift eventually into barbarous mutual violence.&lt;ref&gt;''Saved'', Student Edition, with Commentary and Notes by David Davis, London, Methuen Drama, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
Two leading French writers who were born into the working class were [[Jean Giono]] (1895–1970) and [[Henry Poulaille]] (1896–1980).

[[Jean Giono]] was the son of a cobbler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daudin|first1=Claire|title=Jean Giono, "Colline"|date=1999|publisher=Bréal|location=Rosny|page=17|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=-d-pH8ZRQIoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  a laundry woman, who spent most of his life in [[Manosque]], [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]. He was a voracious reader but had to leave school at sixteen to work in a bank to help support his family. He published his first novel ''Colline'' in 1929, which won him the [[Prix Brentano]] and $1000, and an English translation of the book,&lt;ref name=fay&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fay|first=Eliot G.|year=1930|title=Prix Brentano|journal=[[The French Review]]|volume=3|issue=3|pages=169–73|jstor=380090}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left the bank in 1930 to devote himself to writing on a full-time basis.&lt;ref name="alalettre1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alalettre.com/giono-bio.php |title=Jean Giono (Biographie) |publisher=aLaLettre |date= |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novels Giono published during the nineteen-thirties are set in [[Provence]], with peasants as protagonists, and displaying a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref name="infinit1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.infinit.net/poibru/giono/gionobib.htm |title=Jean Giono: bibliographie |publisher=Pages.infinit.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Pagnol]] based three of his films on Giono's work of this period: ''Regain'', with [[Fernandel]] and music by [[Honegger]], ''Angèle'', and ''La Femme du boulanger'', with [[Raimu]].&lt;ref name="infinit1"/&gt;

After World War II he planned on writing a sequence of ten novels inspired by [[Balzac]]’s [[La Comédie humaine]], in which he would depict characters from all strata of society rather than peasants, and contrast different moments in history by depicting the experiences of members of the same family a hundred years apart. But Giono only completed the four Hussard novels, ''Mort d’un personnage'' (1948)), ''Le Hussard sur le Toit'' (1951), ''Le Bonheur fou'' (1957),  ''Angelo'' (1958).&lt;ref name="infinit1"/&gt;

[[Henry Poulaille]] was the son of a carpenter and cane worker, who was orphaned at fourteen. In addition to writing novels Poulaille was active in encouraging working class writing in France from the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Burin André and Jean Rousselot, ''Dictionary of Contemporary French Literature''. Paris: Larousse, 1966. See especially [[Michel Ragon]], ''History of Proletarian Literature in France''. Paris: Albin Michel, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of numerous novels, essays on the cinema, literature, and popular traditions. Amongst the novels that he wrote are autobiographical works: ''There were four'' (1925); ''Daily Bread'' (1931); ''The Wretched of the Earth'' (1935); ''Soldier of Pain'' (1937); ''The Survivors: Soldier of Pain 2'' (1938); ''Alone in life to 14 years'' (published posthumously in 1980). In these novels, based on his own life, Poulaiile depicts a working-class family, the Magneux.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Ragon, ''History of proletarian literature in France''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korea==
{{main|Korean_literature#Modern_literature|date=April 2018}}
The proletarian literature movement in Korea was initially driven by the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 and the state of conditions that followed within the country.&lt;ref name="Floyd, Nikki"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bridging the Colonial Divide: Japanese-Korean Solidarity in the International Proletarian Literature Movement |publisher=Yale University |author= Floyd, Nikki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proletarian literature acted as a movement that attempted to unify Korea against the shift into imperialism and capitalism that was brought forth by colonial Japan and its government that occupied Korea from the point of annexation until the end of World War II in 1945.&lt;ref name="Floyd, Nikki"/&gt; The Korean proletarian literature movement became most prominent in the late 1920s and early 1930s, with the formation of multiple social and cultural groups that created, discussed, and revolved around proletarian arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Important Dates in China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan in Proletarian Art |publisher=Duke University Press | author= Author, Unknown }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Floyd, Nikki"/&gt;

Works of Korean proletarian literature written before 1927 revolved around reconstructing and reforming social issues. One such example would be the short story "Starvation and Slaughter" ("Kia wa Saryuk", 1925) by author Ch'oe Sŏ-hae, which detailed problems like discrimination between the wealthy and the poor classes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yun-Sik|first=Kim|date=Fall 2006|title=KAPF Literature in Modern Korea Literary History|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202393|journal=Duke University Press|volume=14|pages=415–416|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1927, Korean proletarian literature started to revolve around ideas that involved intellectuals rather than focus on the struggles between the rich and poor. Examples of these works include ''The Peasant Cho˘ng To-ryong'' by Yi Ki-yo˘ng, ''A Transitional Period'' by Han So˘r-ya, ''Rat Fire'' by So˘hwa, and ''Hometown'' by Kohyang.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cultural movements, especially those of left-wing politics, were fundamental in driving the proletarian genre and movement in Korea. Yŏmgunsa, meaning Torch of the Masses, was a group and movement formed in 1922 that was led by the writer [[Song Yŏng]], and built on a focus towards literature pertaining to social issues and class politics. PASKYULA was a group that reacted to and discussed commonplace literature and art, with more of a focus on the cultural aspects of the materials. These groups were two largely important circles in the movement of unification that represented the mix of proletarian and bourgeois ideals that initially propelled the genre of proletarian literature in Japan-occupied Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Japanese-Korean Exchange within the Proletarian Visual Arts Movement |publisher=Duke University Press |author= Kida, Emiko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite we |title=Proletarian Sensibilities: The Body Politics of New Tendency Literature (1924–27) |publisher=Duke University Press  |author= Chung, Kimberly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader of Yŏmgunsa, and a key author in KAPF's circle, Song Yŏng primarily wrote with the intention of forming a solidarity within Korea as well as with Japan through his writing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridging the Colonial Divide: Japanese-Korean Solidarity in the International Proletarian Literature Movement |publisher=Yale University  |author= Floyd, Nikki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two works, "Our Love" in 1929, and "Shift Change" in 1930 highlight Yŏng's ideology of unification within his writing, as well as the idea of moving away from cultural nostalgia and an idyllic past.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In "Our Love", the process of industrialization and its resulting urban cities are portrayed as locales of potential opportunity rather than iniquitous environments, depicting a contrasting opinion to other works produced within KAPF. This is first shown through Yong-hee, a primary character within the story who eventually leaves the Korean countryside and travels to Tokyo, in pursuit of escaping her hometown's oppressive patriarchal culture and finding unity, independence, and equality in urban Japan's workforce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Set in Japan, "Shift Change" focuses more on the working class movement itself through a group of feuding Korean and Japanese workers. The resolution results in a reconciliation through combined effort, encouraging a combined effort from both the Japanese and Korean proletariat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the Proletarian Movement, there was an urge from Japanese colonialists to “convert” Koreans away from communism. This conversion system was called ''cho˘nhyang.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of Minjung: Democracy and the Politics of Representation in South Korea|last=Namhee|first=Lee|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=0801445663|location=|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Cho˘nhyang'' sparked numerous works from various authors such as ''The Mire'' by Han So˘r-ya, ''New Year’s Day'' by Yi Kiyo˘ng, ''A Prospect'' by Paek Ch’o˘l, ''Barley'' by Kim Nam-ch’o˘n, and ''Management'' by Kim Nam-ch’o˘n, all published between the years 1939 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yun-Sik|first=Kim|date=Fall 2006|title=KAPF Literature in Modern Korean Literary History|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202393|journal=Duke University Press|volume=14|pages=418–419|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
The proletarian literature movement in Japan emerged from a trend in the latter half of the 1910s of literature about working conditions by authors who had experienced them, later called Taisho workers literature. Representative works from this period include Sukeo Miyajima's ''Miners'' (坑夫) and Karoku Miyachi's ''Tomizō the Vagrant'' (放浪者富蔵), as well as works dealing with military experiences which were also associated with the [[Taishō period#Japan after World War I: Taishō Democracy|Taishō democracy]], the emergence of which allowed for the development of proletarian literature in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} In 1921, [[Ōmi Komaki]] and Hirofumi Kaneko founded the literary magazine ''The Sowers'' (種蒔く人), which aimed to reform both the current literary scene and society. ''The Sowers'' attracted attention for recording tragedies that occurred in the wake of the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].

In 1924, ''Literary Front'' (文芸戦線) magazine was launched by Hatsunosuke Hirabayashi and Suekichi Aono, becoming the main magazine of the Japanese proletarian literature movement. New writing such as [[Yoshiki Hayama]]'s ''The Prostitute'' (淫売婦) and [[Denji Kuroshima]]'s ''A Herd of Pigs'' (豚群) also began to appear in the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 1928, the Japanese Proletarian Arts Federation (全日本無産者芸術連盟, Nippona Artista Proleta Federacio, known as '''NAPF''') was founded, bringing together the Japan Proletarian Artists Union (日本プロレタリア芸術連盟), the Labor-Farmers Artists Union (労農芸術家連盟), and the Vanguard Artists Union (前衛芸術家同盟). NAPF was largely the responsibility of two up-and-coming writers called [[Takiji Kobayashi]] and Sunao Tokunaga, and the organization's newsletter ''Battleflag'' (戦旗) published many influential works such as Kobayashi's ''[[Kanikōsen|The Crab Cannery Ship]]'' (蟹工船) and ''March 15, 1928'' (一九二八年三月十五日) and Tokunaga's ''A Street Without Sun'' (太陽のない街). Another important magazine was ''Reconstruction'' (改造) which published writings from [[Ryunosuke Akutagawa]] and [[Yuriko Miyamoto]], who had just returned from the [[Soviet Union]]. Other more renowned publishers like ''Chūo Kōron'' (Central Review), ''Kaizō'' (Reconstruction), and ''Miyako Shinbun'' also published works by proletarian authors, even those who were members of the Communist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recasting Red Culture in Proletarian Japan: Childhood, Korea, and the Historical Avant-Garde|last=Perry|first=Samuel|publisher=University of Hawaii|year=2014|isbn=9780824838935|location=Honolulu|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Korehito Kurehara traveled secretly to the Soviet Union in 1930 for the [[Profintern]] conference, and upon his return in 1931, he started agitating for the democratization of literary organizations. This sparked the drive to organize literary circles in factories and rural areas, creating a new source of readers and writers there.

In 1931, the NAPF became the Union of Japanese Proletarian Cultural Organizations (日本プロレタリア文化連盟, Federacio de Proletaj Kultur Organizoj Japanaj, also known as '''KOPF'''), incorporating other cultural organizations, such as musicians and filmmakers. KOPF produced various magazines including ''Working Woman'' (働く婦人)

The Japanese government cracked down harshly on proletarian authors, as the Japanese Communist Party had been outlawed since its founding in 1922. Though not all authors were associated with the party, the KOPF was, leading to mass arrests such as the [[March 15 incident]]. Some authors, such as Takiji Kobayashi were tortured to death by police, while others were forced to [[Tenkō|renounce their socialist beliefs]].

''[[Kanikōsen]]'' (1929) is a short novel by [[Takiji Kobayashi]] (translated into English as ''The Cannery Boat'' (1933), ''The Factory Ship'' (1973) and ''The Crab Cannery Ship'' (2013)), which depicts the lives of Japanese crab fishermen. Told from a [[left-wing]] point of view, it is concerned with the hardships that the crew face and how they are exploited by the owners. The book has been made into a film and as [[manga]].

==Romania==
[[Panait Istrati]] (1884–1935), was a [[Romania]]n working class writer, the son of the laundress  and of a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[smuggler]].  He studied in primary school for six years in [[Vădeni, Brăila|Baldovinești]], after being held back twice. He then earned his living as an apprentice to a tavern-keeper, then as a pastry cook and peddler. In the meantime, he was a prolific reader.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Dadoun, ''Panait Istrati'', L'Arc, Aix-en-Provence, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Istrati's first attempts at writing date from around 1907 when he started sending pieces to the [[Socialism|socialist]] periodicals in Romania, debuting with the article, ''Hotel Regina'' in ''[[România Muncitoare]]''. Here, he later published his first short stories, ''Mântuitorul'' ("The Redeemer"), ''Calul lui Bălan'' ("Bălan's Horse"), ''Familia noastră'' ("Our Family"), ''1 Mai'' ("[[May Day]]"). He also contributed pieces to other [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] newspapers such as ''Dimineața'', ''[[Adevărul]]'', and ''Viața Socială''. In 1910, he was involved in organizing a strike in Brăila. He went to [[Bucharest]], [[Istanbul]], [[Cairo]], [[Naples]], [[Paris]] (1913–1914), and [[Switzerland]], where he settled for a while, trying to cure his [[tuberculosis]]). Istrati's travels were marked by two successive unhappy marriages, a brief return to Romania in 1915 when he tried to earn his living as a pig farmer, and long periods of vagabondage.&lt;ref&gt;Édouard Raydon, ''Panaït Istrati, vagabond de génie'', Les Éditions Municipales, Paris, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1923 in literature|1923]] Istrati's story ''Kyra Kyralina'' (or ''Chira Chiralina'') was published with a preface by the famous French novelist [[Romaine Rolland]]. It became the first in his ''Adrien Zograffi'' [[Literature cycle|literary cycle]]. Rolland was fascinated with Istrati's adventurous life, urging him to write more and publishing parts of his work in ''Clarté'', the journal that Rolland and [[Henri Barbusse]] ran.&lt;ref name="Roger Dadoun"&gt;Roger Dadoun.&lt;/ref&gt; The next major work by Istrati was the [[novel]] ''Codine''.&lt;ref name="Roger Dadoun"/&gt;

{{about||the cricket term|Run out}}
'''Run-out''' or '''runout''' is an inaccuracy of [[rotation|rotating]] mechanical systems, specifically that the tool or shaft does not rotate exactly [[rotation around a fixed axis|in line with the main axis]]. For example; when [[drill]]ing, run-out will result in a larger hole than the drill's nominal diameter due to the drill 
being rotated [[wikt:eccentric#Adjective|eccentrically]] (off axis instead of in line). In the case of [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], run-out will cause vibration of the machine and increased loads on the bearings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emachineshop.com/machine-shop/GD-T-Runout-Definition/page607.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Run-out is dynamic and cannot be compensated. If a rotating component, such as a drill chuck, does not hold the drill centrally, then as it rotates the rotating drill will turn about a secondary axis.

Run-out has two main forms:

* Radial run-out is caused by the tool or component being rotated off centre, i.e. the tool or component axis does not correspond with the main axis. Radial run-out will measure the same all along the main axis.
* [[Rotation around a fixed axis|Axial]] run-out is caused by the tool or component being at an angle to the axis. Axial run-out causes the tip of the tool (or shaft) to rotate off centre relative to the base. Axial run-out will vary according to how far from the base it is measured.

In addition, irregular run-out is the result of worn or rough bearings which can manifest itself as either axial or radial run-out.

Runout will be present in any rotating system and, depending on the system, the different forms may either combine increasing total runout, or cancel reducing total runout. At any point along a tool or shaft it is not possible to determine whether runout is axial or radial; only by measuring along the axis can they be differentiated.

Absolute alignment is impossible; a degree of error will always be present.

==Radial run-out==
Radial run-out is the result of a rotating component running off centre, such as a ball bearing with an offset centre. This means that the rotating tool or shaft, instead of being centrally aligned, will rotate about a secondary axis. In general, cutting tools are more tolerant of radial 
run-out since the edges are parallel to the line of cutting tending to keep the tool tip aligned. However, a rotating shaft may be 
less tolerant of radial run-out since the centre of gravity is displaced by the amount of run-out.

==Axial run-out==
Axial run-out is the result of a rotating component not being parallel with the axis, such as a drill chuck not holding the drill exactly in line with the axis. In general, cutting tools are less 
tolerant of axial run-out since the tool tip tends to dig in and further increase run-out. However a shaft may be more tolerant of axial run-out 
since the centre of gravity is displaced less.

==Measurement==
Typically run-out is measured using a [[Indicator (distance amplifying instrument)|dial indicator]] pressed against the rotating component while it is turned. [[Total indicator reading|Total indicated run-out 
(TIR)]] is a technician's term for the measured run-out of any rotating system, including all forms of run-out, at the measured point.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emachineshop.com/machine-shop/Total-Runout/page608.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Röntgen equivalent physical''' or '''rep''' (symbol '''rep''')&lt;!-- note that there are differences between the spelled out word rep and the symbol rep; see, e.g., radiation poisoning using the word in plural (symbols remain unchanged in plural) --&gt; is a legacy unit of [[absorbed dose]] first introduced by [[Herbert Parker (scientist)|Herbert Parker]] in 1945 to replace an improper application of the [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] unit to biological tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantrill|first=S.T|author2=H.M.

The rep has variously been defined as 83 or 93&amp;nbsp;[[erg]]s per gram of tissue (8.3/9.3&amp;nbsp;[[milligray|mGy]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunning|first=John R.|title=A Glossary of Terms in Nuclear Science and Technology|year=1957|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=-zgrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=83+erg+roentgen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NH0gk0eNeD&amp;sig=EfFqXfhlSczKw3GKwCRMn4ncayY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YZCxT5XlEYzsggfbvIW9CQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=83%20erg%20roentgen&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of tissue.&lt;ref name="Low-Beer1950"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertram |first=V.

At the time, this was thought to be the amount of energy deposited by 1 roentgen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Elda E.|title=Units of Radiation and Radioactivity|journal=Public Health Reports|date=March 1952|volume=67|issue=3|pages=293–297|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2030726/pdf/pubhealthreporig01075-0073.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2012|doi=10.2307/4588064|pmid=14900367|pmc=2030726}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Improved measurements have since found that one roentgen of air kerma deposits 8.77&amp;nbsp;mGy in dry air, or 9.6&amp;nbsp;mGy in soft tissue, but the rep was defined as a fixed number of ergs per unit gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APPENDIX E: Roentgens, RADs, REMs, and other Units|url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/radsafeguide/rsg_app_e.htm|work=Princeton University Radiation Safety Guide|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1952 handbook from the US National Bureau of Standards affirms that "The numerical coefficient of the rep has been deliberately changed to 93, instead of the earlier 83, to agree with L. H. Gray's 'energy-unit'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Bureau of Standards|title=Radiological Monitoring Methods and Instruments|year=1952|publisher=US Department of Commerce|volume=51|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/NBS/NBS%2051.pdf|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray's 'energy unit' was " one rontgen of hard gamma resulted in about 93 ergs per gram energy absorption in water". The lower range value of 83.8 ergs was the value in air corresponding to wet tissue. &lt;ref&gt; Meggitt G, "Taming the Rays", pub Lulu.com 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The rep was commonly used until the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

{{Music education|settings}}
A '''school band''' is a group of [[student]] musicians who rehearse and perform [[instrumental]] [[music]] together. A [[concert band]] is usually under the direction of one or more [[conducting|conductors]] (band directors). A school band consists of [[woodwind instrument]]s, brass instruments and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] instruments, although upper level bands may also have [[string basses]] or [[bass guitar]].

School bands in the [[United Kingdom]] are generally similar to those in the US although pure brass bands are more commonplace in schools than in the US. Some countries usually prefer certain special types of bands, usually drums, over conventional ones. The school band movement in Japan is unusually strong, organized around an enormous competition system administered by the [[All-Japan Band Association]]. Many international observers of Japanese school bands consider them to be the most impressive in the world, particularly among very young students, and Japan is also home to one of the world's leading professional concert bands, the [[Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra]].

==Middle school/Elementary school bands==
[[Image:JapaneseJr.HighBand.jpg|thumb|Junior High School Students band at Demachi Jr. High, Tonami City, Toyama, Japan]]
Although some children learn an instrument prior to entering a [[middle school]] (or junior high), students in [[music education]] programs within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] generally start daily band classes in the 6th or 7th Grade. Many band programs begin as early as 4th or 5th grade. The students usually make up a band based upon their grade, which may then be broken up into sectionals to provide better instrument-specific instruction. It is sometimes required for beginner students to play a recorder for a year before learning another instrument, so that basics, such as scales, [[embouchure]], etc. can be taught easily.  Other requirements may include learning a piano or guitar to understand basic music theory, notation, etc.

A "beginning" band, consisting of the youngest students in the school, usually gives two or three [[concerts]] a year, and may participate in a local/state contest. These bands are given easy music to learn, often with many duplicate parts and simple [[rhythms]]. Students sometimes may be required to memorize the [[Major Scale|12 major scales]].
Depending upon the size of the school,  there may be one to three "higher level" bands after the beginning band. These bands are usually divided similarly to [[high school]] bands. Some schools require students to audition and be placed in a band according to their ability on their instrument. Others will assign students based on their performance as seen in class. Yet others will simply sort the students according to their age or grade level. Most of these decisions are decided by the conductor.  These higher level bands will occasionally play in high school games and pep rallies to augment the local high school band, although in small schools they always come to these events. Beginning bands usually are used in the spot of an elective.

Instruments typically in beginning bands:

*Woodwind:
**[[Flutes]],
**[[Oboes]], 
**[[Clarinets]],
**Alto, Tenor, and occasionally Baritone [[saxophones]],
**[[Bassoons]]
*Brass:
**[[Tuba]]s,
**[[Trombones]],
**[[Trumpets]],
**[[French Horns]],
**Occasionally [[baritone horn|Baritones]], or [[Euphoniums]]

Some bands will also have a ''percussion kit'', which will allow them to play bells and drums

==High school bands==
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - G 14 - Life in Ziguinchor, Senegal - PAIGC boarding school band, Ziguinchor - 1973.tif|thumb|[[PAIGC]] High school band in [[Ziguinchor]], Senegal, 1973]]
High school bands typically challenge students musically more than those in middle school. Music is much more difficult with more complex passages, intricate rhythms and more involved phrasing. Selections also vary in style. A well-rounded band is expected to be able to play a wide variety of music, ranging from serious '[[program music]]' to lighter 'pop-style' music. For many high school students, school bands are the main form of [[music education]] available to them in school. [[March (music)|Marches]] were the first major contributions to the wind band repertoire.  There are many pieces other than marches written for wind band at present, but there are some historical standards that should be included into the repertoire of advanced ensembles.   Some of the most notable of these pieces are [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''[[First Suite in E-flat for Military Band|First Suite in E-flat]]'' and ''[[Second Suite in F for Military Band|Second Suite in F]]'', and [[Percy Grainger|Grainger's]] ''Children's March'' and ''[[Lincolnshire Posy]]'' among others.

Below is a list of the [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] in a typical [[concert band]] at the high school level. The number of instruments in each section varies, but listed below are usually the average number of members. Middle school/junior high bands are usually around the upper values for each instrument. Instrumentation in beginner bands is usually much larger than this. College and professional bands generally have smaller numbers of players. These numbers may vary widely, based on the instrument and the people playing them (as many people playing instruments such as trombones may drop out, causing others to change instruments to fill the need).  Some bands have a set number of performers per section while other bands have open unlimited participation.

'''Woodwind'''
*1 or no [[Piccolo|Piccolo in C]]
*8-10 [[Flute]]s
*1-2 [[Oboe]]s
* 1 or no [[Cor anglais|English Horn]]

*8-10 [[Soprano clarinet|B♭ Clarinets]]
*1 or no [[Alto clarinet|E♭ Alto Clarinet]]
*1-2  [[Bass clarinet|B♭ Bass Clarinets]]
*1 or no [[Contra-alto clarinet|EE♭ Contra-alto Clarinet]]
*1 or no [[Contrabass clarinet|BB♭ Contrabass Clarinet]]
*1 or no [[Soprano saxophone|B♭ Soprano Saxophone]]
*4-6 [[Alto saxophone|E♭ Alto Saxophones]]

*1-4 [[Baritone horn]]s or [[Euphonium]]s
*1-4 [[Tuba]]s

'''Strings'''
*1 or no [[String Bass]] or [[Bass Guitar|Electric Bass]]

'''Percussion'''
* Percussionists playing:
*[[Snare drum]]
*[[Tom-tom drum|Tom-toms]]
*[[Bass drum]]
*[[Cymbal]]s including [[Crash cymbal|crash]], [[Ride cymbal|ride]], and [[suspended cymbal|suspended]]
*[[Tambourine]]
*2 playing [[Mallet Percussion]], including [[orchestra bells]], [[xylophone]], [[marimba]], [[chimes]] and [[vibraphone]]
*1 [[Timpani]]
*1 [[Drum kit]]
*A variety of other auxiliary percussion instruments used on specific pieces, including [[Cabasa]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]], and [[Maraca]]s.

In most middle school bands, strings (besides the string bass) are not used. If they are, the band is generally considered an orchestra.

The first high school band in the United States was the Boston Farm and Trade School Band, founded in 1856.
The oldest high school band in America is [[The Christian Brothers Band (Memphis)]] founded in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, Patrick (2009). The Christian Brothers Band, "The Oldest High School Band in America" 1872-1937. Christian Brothers Archives: Master's Thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==College bands==
Many colleges/universities have band as a class. Some are integrated within a 'Music' course while others are not. They tend to be larger than a high school band and play at a higher level.

==Other school bands==
There are many other school band opportunities for students. Most of these fall under the jurisdiction of the director that teaches the daily band classes, whether or not the smaller groups meet daily or during school hours.

Many schools, especially high schools in the United States, have a [[marching band]]. A school marching band may contain from 11 to over 500 students.  Marching bands often practice frequently during the late summer and early fall and most often attend their school's [[American football|football]] games, playing music in the stands, and marching a show during halftime. A show is usually between 6 and 10 minutes long, but many competitions place restrictions on length. Bands often compete in marching band competitions throughout the marching season (typically the same time as football season). Competitions vary in intensity. Some areas have many smaller, local competitions hosted by individual schools. Others host a regional competition.  Others, such as [[Bands of America]] competitions are nationally known and take place in professional arenas.

In addition to their show, marching bands often march parades. Often this is limited to their city or town's municipal parades, but some bands travel to participate in well known parades, such as the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] or the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] on New Years Day.

===Jazz band===
{{Main|Jazz band}}
Many schools have jazz programs in addition to their concert program. Different schools have different time slots for their jazz band. Some meet as an actual class during the school day. Others choose to practice after school or before school two or three times a week. Meeting as a class during school can often cause schedule conflicts with students' academic classes.  Many times jazz band may rehearse during the [[study hall]], [[free period]], or part of the  lunch period. Typical instrumentation for jazz ensembles will include trumpets, trombones, alto, tenor and baritone saxophones, a drum set (often called a "trap set",) guitar, bass guitar, piano, clarinet and often, a vibraphone or marimba. Many areas have jazz festivals, but the popularity of these widely vary from different regions of the country. Jazz bands are most often used as an ambassador ensemble for the band program as a whole.  In addition, jazz education is seen as growing in popularity as a specialty area within school music departments. Possibly a person can only be in the jazz band if they are 7th grade or higher.

===Chamber ensembles===
Schools rarely have chamber music ensembles that meet as real classes, usually depending on the region, state and budget. Most of these groups are ''ad hoc'' ensembles put together by the director or the students themselves for a contest or recital. Examples would be clarinet quartets, woodwind quintet, brass quintet, duets, and trios. Groups consisting of the entire woodwind or brass section, or even percussion section of a band are also sometimes formed.

===All-region bands===
Perhaps not associated with the individual school, All-Region bands are audition-only groups for the most advanced players in each school. There are many different "All-Region" bands, ranging from the most local "All-County" or "All-District"(when referring to school districts) to the more prestigious "All-State".  Many states also have a level between County and State bands which varies in name according to the area. These events are often highly enjoyed by the students that attend them. Musical literature is often increased in difficulty for the concerts, providing a challenge that isn't seen at schools. Students also get to meet new players on their instrument and share stories from their own band experiences. Region bands typically last over a weekend, though some may meet for over a week before performing a concert.

Though not associated with All-State, [[Florida]] has a statewide band festival called Festival of Winds, held in [[Tampa]] at [[The University of South Florida]] in the first weekend of December. Also, Florida, [[Alabama]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] have a band festival called Tri-State, held in [[Tallahassee]], Florida at [[Florida State University]] in the same time period as Festival of Winds.

===Modern band===

Modern band &lt;ref&gt;''Modern Band: The Next Step in the Evolution of Music'' from ''School Band and Orchestra'' (March, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  is an instrumental and vocal school music program taught in a growing number of public schools systems in the U.S.  Instrumentation typically includes acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric bass, keyboard, vocals, computers and percussion instruments. The repertoire of modern band is evolving as it draws from commercially dominant and contemporary music styles of the day such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[disco]], [[reggae]], [[hip-hop]] and more.

Major public school systems that offer Modern Band programming include those in the [[New York City Department of Education]], [[Los Angeles Unified School District]], [[Chicago Public Schools]] and others. Modern band is a new movement in public school music education circles. The term "Modern Band" was coined by a music education non-profit, Little Kids Rock, who partners with school districts from economically challenged communities to expand their music programs.

==Stereotypes and popular culture==

==='Band geek'===
{{redirect2|Band geek|Band geeks|the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode|Band Geeks}}
"Band geek" or "band [[nerd]]" is a [[high school stereotype]] of a person obsessed with playing band music. However, the term usually relates to the belief that most people who are in school bands are socially inept.&lt;ref&gt;Patnaik, G. and Shinseki, M. (2000) ''The Secret Life of Teens: Young People Speak Out About Their Lives.'' HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bilsland, B. (2004) ''What It Means To Be In A Marching Band: A Band Geek Perspective For The Musically Challenged.'' Authorhouse.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumas, A. (2003) ''Lita: A Less Traveled R.O.A.D.--The Reality of Amy Dumas.'' Simon and Schuster. p 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes used to describe any student who plays an instrument and is in a band class (including students in the [[String orchestra|orchestra]]).&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, J.L. (2004) ''Taste Berries for Teens #4: Inspirational Short Stories and Encouragement.'' HCI Teens Publishing. p 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willman, C. (2005) ''Rednecks &amp; Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music.'' p 135.&lt;/ref&gt;   "Orch dork" is a variation specifically for members of school [[orchestra]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Trope, Z. (2003) ''Please Don't Kill the Freshman: A Memoir.'' HarperCollins. p 44.&lt;/ref&gt; These terms have become a label of pride for many band members, being found on T-shirts, bumper stickers, etc.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Gender stereotypes in instrument selection===
In school bands, more girls than boys tend to play most woodwind instruments, especially flute, and more boys than girls tend to play brass instruments, saxophone, and percussion.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  However, this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www-usr.rider.edu/~vrme/articles4/walker/index.htm |title=Influences of Gender and Sex-Stereotyping of Middle School Students' Perception and Selection of Musical Instruments: A Review of the Literature |author=Mark J. Walker |journal=Visions of Research in Music Education |date=January 2004 |volume=4 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002080741/http://www-usr.rider.edu/~vrme/articles4/walker/index.htm |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These stereotypes can be avoided when band directors assess each student for musical capacity, as well as, meet with students individually to analyze their physical characteristics.  For example, petite students would be more successful playing the clarinet over the tuba.  Additionally, the role of gender bias in musical instrument assignment is highly debated in the field of music education.  Some feel that it should be left alone while others want to combat it.  One way band directors can overcome these stereotypes is to have live demonstrations from musicians playing gender atypical instruments (i.e., males playing flute, females playing tuba).&lt;ref&gt;Dale, E. B. (2005). An investigation of the instrument selection processes used by directors of beginning band. Contributions to Music Education, 32(1), 9-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14034">'''Science advice''' is the process, structures and institutions through which governments and politicians consider science, technology and innovation information in policy- and decision- making. Across different national governments and international bodies, there are a variety of structures and institutions for scientific advice.  They reflect distinctive cultures and traditions of decision-making, which [[Sheila Jasanoff]] has termed the ‘civic epistemology’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11016-008-9201-6#page-1 |title= Controlling Biotechnology: Science, Democracy and ‘Civic Epistemology’|date=2008-05-07 |accessdate= 2015-05-31 |doi=10.1007/s11016-008-9201-6 |volume= 17 |journal=Metascience |pages= 177–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which expert claims are constructed, validated or challenged in a given society.

Science advice can also be called "science for policy," indicating the flow of information from scientific to policy domains with the intention of informing decisions. This is distinct from "policy for science," the institutions, rules and norms governing how science is funded, conducted, and communicated.

At the national level, countries have diverse models for how to connect scientists and policymakers. In some countries, the president of the [[National academy]], an elected organization of distinguished researchers in natural and social sciences, engineering, medicine, and the humanities, serves as a government science advisor, while other countries have an advisory committee or civil servants perform this role.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web | first1 =James | last1 = Wilsdon | first2 = Kristiann | last2 = Allen | first3 = Katsia | last3 = Paulavets |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/aug/27/a-rough-guide-to-science-advice |title=A rough guide to science advice &amp;#124; Science | work =The guardian | accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; National academies are often commissioned to write reports advising government on the state of scientific knowledge to inform policy-relevant questions, such as the risk from chemicals or disease.

Other countries, such as the UK, have a wide range of sources of expert scientific advice which draw on several of these sources.&lt;ref name= "globalscienceadvice.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.globalscienceadvice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Science_Advice_to_Governments_Briefing_Paper_25-August.pdf |format=PDF |title=Science Advice to Governments: Diverse systems, common challenges |publisher= Global science advice |accessdate= 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

At the international level, there is an increasing movement to bring together national science advisors to share best practices and form a network to deal with global challenges (e.g., pandemics, climate change). The first global Science Advice to Governments meeting was held in Auckland, New Zealand on August 27–28, 2014.  This meeting brought together high-level science advisors, scientists, and practitioners to discuss the relationship between science and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalscienceadvice.org/ |title=INGSA |publisher= Global science advice | accessdate= 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new network of European science academies was established at the European Open Science meeting in Copenhagen in June 2014,&lt;ref name= "guardian" /&gt; which now includes 20 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slideshare.net/SciAdvice14/1000-days-in-the-life-of-a-science-advisor-38529597 |title=1000 days in the life of a science advisor |publisher=Slideshare | accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) is a major international organization with a program in science for policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.icsu.org/science-for-policy/ |title= Introduction: Science for Policy |publisher=ICSU |date= 2015-05-25 |accessdate= 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science advice structures ==
A briefing paper,&lt;ref name="globalscienceadvice.org" /&gt; described four of the most commonly used science advice structures for jurisdictions: advisory councils, advisory committees, national academies, and chief scientific advisors. These structures are most commonly employed at the national level, but may also be used in sub-national jurisdictions like Quebec, or supra-national bodies like the [[European Commission]], which has an in-house science service, the [[Joint Research Centre]].

Science advice also occurs at sub-national levels, where structures may include departmental scientific advisors (for example, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and at the international level, where networks such as the [[International Council for Science]] coordinate science for policy, for example through serving as the science voice in the [[United Nations]].

For any of these structures, individual experts may be asked for advice in specific circumstances.

! Science Advice Structure&lt;ref name= "globalscienceadvice.org" /&gt;!! Explanation&lt;ref name= "globalscienceadvice.org" /&gt;
|-
| Advisory councils || Many economies have a high-level council for science (or science and innovation) policy. Members typically include senior scientists, alongside representatives of industry, higher education and civil society. Examples include Japan’s Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI) and the US President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). Another example is Australia, where chief scientist Ian Chubb recently announced that he plans to establish a new science council to advise government on policy. However, in most systems, the focus of such entities remains on policy advice in relation to the science system, which is distinct from science advice for public policy.

|-
| Advisory committees || Most governments also rely on an array of specialized scientific and expert committees, which can address detailed technical and regulatory issues in areas such as health, environment and food safety. For example, the US and Japan have hundreds of such committees; the UK has over seventy.
|-

|-
| National academies || A growing number of national academies are active in science policy and/or policy for science. In economies such as Canada, China, Germany, Netherlands, South Africa, US and UK, academies are an important source of scientific advice. Furthermore, networks of national academies such as the International Council for Science, with a membership of 121 national bodies, representing 141 economies, and 31 International Scientific Unions, and the Inter-Academy Panel, the global network of science academies from 107 economies are actively involved in science for policy processes at the international level.
|-

|-
| Chief scientific advisors || The first chief scientific advisor was appointed by the US in 1957, followed by the UK in 1964.  The first chief scientific advisor in Quebec, Canada, was appointed in 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27001">The '''Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study''' (SSMCIS) was the name of an American [[mathematics education]] program that stood for both the name of a curriculum and the name of the project that was responsible for developing curriculum materials. It is considered part of the second round of initiatives in the "[[New Math]]" movement of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  The program was led by Howard F. Fehr, a professor at [[Columbia University Teachers College]].

The program's signature goal was to create a unified treatment of mathematics and eliminate the traditional separate per-year studies of [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], and so forth, that was typical of American secondary schools.&lt;ref name="walmsley"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of the 'New Mathematics' Movement and Its Relationship with Current Mathematical Reform | first=Angela Lynn Evans | last=Walmsley | publisher=[[University Press of America]] | location=Lanham, Maryland | year= 2003 | isbn=0-7618-2511-8 | pages=30, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, the treatment unified those branches by studying fundamental concepts such as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], and [[Mapping (mathematics)|mappings]], and fundamental structures such as [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[Field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s.  The SSMCIS program produced six courses' worth of class material, intended for grades 7 through 12, in textbooks called '''''Unified Modern Mathematics'''''.  Some 25,000&amp;nbsp;students took SSMCIS courses nationwide during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==Background==
The program was led by Howard F. Fehr, a professor at [[Columbia University Teachers College]] who was internationally known and had published numerous mathematics textbooks and hundreds of articles about mathematics teaching.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/07/obituaries/dr-howard-f-fehr-author-helped-start-system-of-new-math.html | title=Dr. Howard F. Fehr: Author Helped Start System of New Math | first=Walter H. | last=Waggoner | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 7, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1961 he had been the principal author of the 246-page report "New Thinking in School Mathematics", which held that [[traditional mathematics|traditional teaching of mathematics]] approaches did not meet the needs of the new technical society being entered into or of the current language of mathematicians and scientists.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"/&gt;  Fehr considered the separation of mathematical study into separate years of distinct subjects to be an American failing that followed an educational model two hundred years old.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

The new curriculum was inspired by the seminar reports from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in the early 1960s&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt; and by the [[Cambridge Conference on School Mathematics]] (1963),  which also inspired the [[Comprehensive School Mathematics Program]].&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathcurriculumcenter.org/PDFS/CCM/summaries/cambridge_summary.pdf | title=Goals for School Mathematics | publisher=Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum | year=2004 | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were some interactions among these initiatives in the early stages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imacs.org/imacsadmin/parser?pageid=37 | title=Burt Kaufman | publisher=Institute for Mathematics &amp; Computer Science | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of SSMCIS was part of a general wave of cooperation in the mathematics education reform movement between Europe and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icmihistory.unito.it/portrait/steiner.php | title=The first century of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (1908–2008) – History of ICMI – Hans Georg Steiner | first=Gert | last=Schubring  | publisher=[[University of Turin]] | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on the SSMCIS program began in 1965&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt; and took place mainly at Teachers College.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Fehr was the director of the project from 1965 to 1973.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"/&gt;  The principal consultants in the initial stages and subsequent yearly planning sessions were [[Marshall H. Stone]] of the [[University of Chicago]], [[Albert W. Tucker]] of [[Princeton University]], [[Edgar Lorch]] of [[Columbia University]], and Meyer Jordan of [[Brooklyn College]].&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Howard F. | last=Fehr | title=The Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study: A Unified Mathematics Program | journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume=67 | issue=1 |date=January 1974 | pages=25–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was targeted at the junior high and high school level and the 15–20&amp;nbsp;percent best students in a grade.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;

Funding for the initiative began with the U.S. [[Office of Education]] and covered the development first three courses produced; the last three courses produced, as well as teacher training, were funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and by Teachers College itself.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"/&gt; The scope and sequence of the curriculum was developed by eighteen mathematicians from the U.S. and Europe in 1966 and subsequently refined in experimental course material by mathematical educators with high school level teaching experience.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"&gt;{{cite journal | first=H. F. | last=Fehr | first2=James | last2=Fey | title=The Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study | journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume=76 | issue=10 |date=December 1969 | pages=1132–1137 | doi=10.2307/2317192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1971, some thirty-eight contributors to course materials were identified, eight from Teachers College, four from Europe, one from Canada, and the rest from various other universities (and a couple of high schools) in the United States.&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"/&gt;  Fehr did not do much curriculum development himself, but rather recruited and led the others and organized the whole process.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-79"&gt;Howson, Keitel, and Kilpatrick, ''Curriculum Development in Mathematics'', pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Graduate students from the Department of Mathematical Education at Teachers College also served each year in various capacities on the SSMCIS program.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;

The central idea of the program was to organize mathematics not by algebra, geometry, etc., but rather to unify those branches by studying the fundamental concepts of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], and [[Mapping (mathematics)|mappings]], and fundamental structures such as [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[Field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Other terms used for this approach included "global" or "integrated";&lt;ref name="lhs-cos"/&gt; Fehr himself spoke of a "spiral" or "helical" development, and wrote of "the spirit of global organization that is at the heart of the SSMCIS curriculum – important mathematical systems unified by a core of fundamental concepts and structures common to all.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;

For example, as the courses progressed, the concept of mappings were used to describe, and visually illustrate, the traditionally disparate topics of [[Translation (geometry)|translation]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|line reflection]], [[Probability space|probability of an event]], [[trigonometric functions]], [[isomorphism]] and [[complex number]]s, and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[Linear map|linear mappings]].&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;  Traditional subjects were broken up, such that the course material for each year included some material related to algebra, some to geometry, and so forth.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;&lt;!-- TODO ... more descr and examples --&gt;

Even when abstract concepts were being introduced, they were introduced in concrete, intuitive forms, especially at the younger levels.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Logical proofs were introduced early on and built in importance as the years developed.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  At least one year of university-level mathematics education was incorporated into the later courses.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;  Solving traditional applications problems was de-emphasized, especially in the earlier courses, but the intent of the project was to make up for that with its focus on real numbers in measurements, computer programming, and probability and statistics.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  In particular, the last of these was a pronounced element of SSMCIS, with substantial material on it present in all six courses, from measures of [[statistical dispersion]] to [[combinatorics]] to [[Bayes' theorem]] and more.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

The curriculum that SSMCIS devised had influences from earlier reform work in Europe,&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt; going back to the [[Bourbaki group]]'s work in France in the 1930s and the ''Synopses for Modern Secondary School Mathematics'' published in Paris in 1961.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Indeed, most European secondary schools were teaching a more integrated approach.&lt;ref name="nys-integrated"/&gt;  Also, this was one of several American efforts to address a particularly controversial issue, the teaching of a full year of [[Euclidean geometry]] in secondary school.&lt;ref name="acmdl"&gt;{{cite conference | first=Joseph K. | last=McAdams | first2=Arlan R. |last2=DeKock | title=Computer graphics as an aid to teaching geometric transformations | conference=SIGCSE '76 Proceedings of the ACM SIGCSE-SIGCUE Technical Symposium on Computer Science and Education | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] | location=New York | &lt;!-- doi=10.1145/800107.803463 --&gt; | pages=137–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like many of the others, it did this by teaching [[Transformation geometry|geometric transformations]] as a unifying approach between algebra and geometry.&lt;ref name="acmdl"/&gt;  

Regardless of all these influences and other projects, the SSMCIS study group considered its work unique in scope and breadth, and Fehr wrote that "nowhere [else] had a total 7–12 unified mathematics program been designed, produced, and tested."&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  It was thus considered one of the more radical of the reform efforts lumped under the "New Math" label.&lt;ref name="kline"&gt;{{cite book | first=Morris | last=Kline | authorlink=Morris Kline | title=Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math | publisher=[[Vintage Books]] | location= | year=1974 | isbn=0394719816 | at=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Fehr believed that the SSMCIS could not just improve students' thinking in mathematics, but in all subjects, by "develop[ing] the capacity of the human mind for the observation, selection, generalization, abstraction, and construction of models for use in the other disciplines."&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

==Materials==
[[Image:Unified Modern Mathematics Course III Part 1 cover.jpg|thumb|223px|right|upright|The paper covers of the course books had a different color for each of the six courses: light blue, yellow, light green (here), red, blue, dark red.]]

The course books put out by SSMCIS were titled ''Unified Modern Mathematics'', and labeled as Course I through Course VI, with the two volumes in each year labeled as Part I and Part II.&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"&gt;{{cite book | title=Unified Modern Mathematics: Course V: Part II | publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]] | location=New York | edition=Revised | year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Materials for the next year's course were prepared each year, thus keeping up with the early adoption programs underway.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Using largely [[formative evaluation]] methods for gaining teacher feedback,&lt;ref name="curdev-math-196"/&gt; revised versions were put out after the first year's teaching experience.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;  By 1973, the revised version of all six courses had been completed.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"&gt;{{cite book | title=Curriculum Development in Mathematics | type=Paperback | first=Geoffrey |last=Howson |first2=Christine |last2=Keitel |first3= Jeremy |last3=Kilpatrick | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location= | year=1982 | pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first three volumes were put into the public domain for any organization to use.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

The pages of the books were formatted by typewriter, augmented by some mathematical symbols and inserted graphs, bound in paper, and published by Teachers College itself.&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"/&gt; A more polished hardcover version of Courses I through IV was put out in subsequent years by [[Addison-Wesley]]; these were adaptations made by Fehr and others and targeted to students with a broader range of mathematical ability.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;

[[Computer programming]] on [[Time-sharing|time-shared computer systems]] was included in the curriculum both for its own importance and for understanding numerical methods.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  The first course introduced [[flow chart]]s and the notion of [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref name="umm-i-ii"&gt;{{cite book | title=Unified Modern Mathematics: Course I: Part II | publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]] | location=New York | edition=Revised | year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The beginning portion of the fourth-year course was devoted to introducing the [[BASIC]] programming language, with an emphasis on fundamental [[control flow]] statements, continued use of flow charts for design, and [[numerical programming]] applications.  Interactive teletype interfaces on slow and erratic [[dial-up modem|dial-up connections]], with troublesome [[paper tape]] for offline storage, was the typical physical environment.&lt;ref name="umm-iv-i"&gt;{{cite book | title=Unified Modern Mathematics: Course IV: Part I | publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]] | location=New York | edition=Revised | year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==
Starting in 1966, teachers from nine junior high and high schools, mostly in the [[New York metropolitan area]], began getting training in the study program at Teachers College.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Such training was crucial since few junior high or high school teachers knew all the material that would be introduced.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-79"/&gt;  They then returned to their  schools and began teaching the experimental courses,&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt; two teachers per grade.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;    For instance, [[Leonia High School]], which incorporated grades 8–12 (since there was no middle school then), called the program "Math X" for experimental, with individual courses called Math 8X, Math 9X, etc.&lt;ref name="lhs-cos"&gt;{{cite book | title=Program of Studies: 1970–1971 | publisher=[[Leonia High School]] | location=Leonia, New Jersey | year=1970 | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hunter College High School]] used it as the basis for its Extended Honors Program; the school's description stated that the program "includes many advanced topics and requires extensive preparation and a considerable commitment of time to the study of mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hchs.hunter.cuny.edu/images/uploads/CourseOutline_Math7.pdf | title=Mathematics: Departmental Philosophy | publisher=[[Hunter College High School]] | accessdate=September 13, 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Students were periodically given standardized tests to make sure there was no decline in performance due to the unusual organization of material.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Some 400&amp;nbsp;students were involved in this initial phase.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

Because the program was so different from standard U.S. mathematics curricula, it was quite difficult to students to enter after the first year; students did, however, sometimes drop out of it and return to standard courses.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;  As teaching the program was a specialized activity, teachers tended to move along from each grade to the next with their students, and so it was typical for students to have one of the same two teachers, or even the same teacher, for five or six years in a row.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;
  
More teachers were added in 1968 and 1969 and the [[University of Maryland]] and [[University of Arizona]] were added as teaching sites.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Eighteen schools in [[Los Angeles]] adopted SSMCIS in what was called the Accelerated Mathematics Instruction program; some 2,500&amp;nbsp;gifted students took part.&lt;ref name="la-ami"&gt;{{cite journal | title=New Programs | first=Robert J. | last=Kansky | first2=Arthur A. | last2=Hiatt | first3=Mary Margaret |last3=Odom | journal=
The Mathematics Teacher | volume=67 | issue= 8 |date=December 1974 | page= 729}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1971, teacher education programs were being conducted in places like [[Austin Peay State University]] in [[Tennessee]], which was attended by junior high school teachers from seventeen states and one foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KONHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=F4AMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4830,1672755 | title=Math Teacher Taking Course | newspaper=[[The Victoria Advocate]] | location=Victoria, Texas | date=August 10, 1971 | page=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- also https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xKAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1868,5399869 but seems like a pretty confused account --&gt;  By 1974, Fehr stated that 25,000&amp;nbsp;students were taking SSMCIS courses across the U.S.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

The Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study program did show some success in its educational purpose.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;  A study of the Los Angeles program found that SSMCIS-taught students had a better attitude toward their program than did students using [[School Mathematics Study Group]] courses (another "New Math" initiative) or traditional courses.&lt;ref name="la-ami"/&gt;  In [[New York State]] schools, special examinations were given to tenth and eleventh grade SSMCIS students in lieu of the standard [[Regents Examinations]]&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt; due to a mismatch in curriculum.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-196"&gt;Howson, Keitel, and Kilpatrick, ''Curriculum Development in Mathematics'', pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, SSMCIS was one of the direct inspirations for the [[New York State Education Department]], in the late 1970s and 1980s, adopting an integrated, three-year mathematics curriculum for all its students, combining algebra, geometry, and trigonometry with an increased emphasis in probability and statistics.&lt;ref name="nys-integrated"&gt;{{cite journal | title=An Integrated Approach for Secondary School Mathematics | first=Fredric | last=Paul | journal=[[The Mathematics Teacher]] | volume= 79 | issue= 4 |date=April 1986 | pages= 236–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;

Given the differences in subject matter and approach, how SSMCIS-taught students would perform on [[College Entrance Examination Board]] tests became a major concern of parents and students and teachers.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-196"/&gt;  A 1973 report compared the test performance of such students with those from traditional mathematics curricula.  It found that the SSMCIS students did better on the mathematics portion of the [[PSAT/NMSQT|Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT)]], even when matched for background and performance on the verbal portion. It also found that SSMCIS students did just as well on the [[SAT Subject Test in Mathematics Level 2|Mathematics Level II Achievement Test]] as traditional students taking college preparatory courses or, indeed, as college freshmen taking introductory calculus courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED081847 | title=Performance of SSMCIS-Trained Students on College Board Mathematics Examinations | last=Williams | first=S. Irene | last2= Jones | first2=Chancey O. | publisher=Test Development Report | year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study found SSMCIS students well prepared for the mathematics portion of the regular [[SAT|Scholastic Aptitude Test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=An Overview of the Mathematics Achievement Tests Offered in the Admissions Testing Program of the College Entrance Examination Board | first=Chancey O. | last=Jones | first2=Mildred R. | last2=Rowen | first3=Howard E. | last3=Taylor | journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume=70 | issue= 3 |date=March 1977 | pages= 197–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, SSMCIS developed slowly.&lt;ref name="kline"/&gt; Funding became an issue,&lt;ref name="record"/&gt; and indeed it was never funded as well as some other mathematics curriculum efforts had been.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;  Despite the federal funding source, there was no centralized, national focal point in the U.S. for curriculum changes – such as some European countries had – and that made adoption of SSMCIS innovations a harder task.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-45"&gt;Howson, Keitel, and Kilpatrick, ''Curriculum Development in Mathematics'', pp. 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-1970s there was a growing backlash against the "New Math" movement, spurred in part by a perceived decline in standardized test scores and by [[Morris Kline]]'s critical book ''Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math''.&lt;ref name="fey-1978"&gt;{{cite journal | first=James T. | last=Fey | title=Change in Mathematics Education Since the Late 1950's – Ideas and Realisation U.S.A. | journal=[[Educational Studies in Mathematics]] | volume=9 | issue=3 |date=August 1978 | pages=339–353 | doi=10.1007/bf00241036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many reform efforts had underestimated the difficulty of getting the public and the mathematics educational community to believe that major changes were really necessary, especially for secondary school programs where college entrance performance was always the key concern of administrators.&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  Federal funding for curriculum development also came under attack from [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] in the [[U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  As one of the participants in creating SSMCIS, James T. Fey of Teachers College, later wrote, "Schools and societal expectations of schools appear to change very slowly."&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  In the end, SSMCIS never became widely adopted.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;

==Legacy==
One SSMCIS student, [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] of [[Leonia High School]], decades later became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Estonia)|Foreign Minister]] and then [[President of Estonia]].&lt;ref name="nj2016"/&gt;  He credited the SSMCIS course, the early exposure it gave him to computer programming, and the teacher of the course, Christine Cummings, with his subsequent interest in computer infrastructure, which in part resulted in the country leaping over its [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era technological backwardness; computer-accessible education became pervasive in [[Education in Estonia|Estonian schools]], and the [[Internet in Estonia]] has one of the highest penetration rates in the world.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.president.ee/en/media/interviews/3304-qfrom-estonia-to-leoniaq-the-record-23-april-2008/ | title=From Estonia to Leonia | first=Herb | last=Jackson | newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]] | location = | date=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.riponsociety.org/forum131thi.htm | title=The Estonian Example: Q&amp;A with Toomas Hendrik Ilves | work=[[The Ripon Forum]] | publisher=[[Ripon Society]] | date=Winter 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As his tenure as president came to a close in 2016, Ilves visited his old school building with Cummings and said, "I owe everything to her. Because of what she taught us, my country now uses it."&lt;ref name="nj2016"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2016/09/president_of_estonia_visits_his_old_nj_high_school_before_un_talk.html | title=President of Estonia visits his old N.J. high school before UN talk | first=Sara | last=Jerde | publisher=[[NJ.com]] | date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cummings said that SSMCIS not only introduced beginning computer programming but also taught students "how to think".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/estonian-president-a-leonia-h-s-grad-stops-by-middle-school-1.1663775 | title=Estonian president, a Leonia H.S. grad, stops by middle school | first=Andrew | last=Wyrich | newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]] | date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSMCIS did represent a productive exercise in thinking about mathematics curriculum, and the mathematics education literature would cite it in subsequent years, including references to it as a distinct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Review: Geometry in the Mathematics Curriculum, Thirty-sixth Yearbook | first=James D. | last=Bristol |journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume= 67 | issue= 5 |date=May 1974 | page= 442}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most radical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=What Do Mathematics Teachers Think About the High School Geometry Controversy | first=George | last=Gearhart | journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume= 68 | issue= 6 |date=October 1975 | pages= 486–493}}&lt;/ref&gt; approach to teaching geometry; as using functions as a unifying element of teaching mathematics;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Intuitions on Functions | first=Tommy |last=Dreyfus | first2=Theodore |last2=Eisenberg | journal=The Journal of Experimental Education | volume= 52 | issue= 2 | date=Winter 1984 | pages= 77-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as its course materials having value when used as the vehicle for further research in mathematics education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Communication of Mathematical Structure and Its Relationship to Achievement | first=Nicholas A. |last=Branca|journal=[[Journal for Research in Mathematics Education]] | volume=11 | issue= 1 |date=January 1980 | pages= 37–49 | doi=10.2307/748731}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Two mentions in here, maybe some legacy stuff, maybe not: books.google.com/books?id=8FTKCaDjhZ0C&amp;pg=PA512 --&gt;

The '''Society of German Chemists''' (German: ''{{lang|de|Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker}}'', GDCh) is a [[learned society]] and [[professional association]] founded in 1949 to represent the interests of German chemists in local, national and international contexts. GDCh "unites those people associated with the chemical and molecular sciences and supports them in their responsible and sustainable endeavors for the good of the public and of our environment."&lt;ref&gt;Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker (GDCh), [http://www.gdch.de/gdch/statement__e.htm  Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest precursor of today's GDCh was the [[German Chemical Society]] (''{{lang|de|Deutsche Chemische Gesellschaft zu Berlin}}'', DChG).  [[Adolf von Baeyer]] was prominent among the German chemists who established DChG in 1867; and [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] was the first president.&lt;ref name="gdch1"&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/gdch/historie__e.htm  History]&lt;/ref&gt;  This society was modeled after the [[British Chemical Society]], which was the precursor of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. Like its British counterpart, DChG sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout Germany and across international borders.&lt;ref name="Lagowski"&gt;[[J J Lagowski|Lagowski, J. J.]] (1991). [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed068p1  "A British Sesquicentennial,"] ''[[Journal of Chemical Education]],'' Vol 68, No. 1, p. 1; acknowledging the sesquicentennial of The Chemical Society in London, which eventually became the Royal Society of Chemistry; retrieved 2011-06-08&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, the current organization was created by a merger of the German Chemical Society (DChG) and the [[Association of German Chemists]] (''{{lang|de|Verein Deutscher Chemiker}}'', VDCh).

Honorary Members of the GDCh have included [[Otto Hahn]], [[Robert B. Woodward]], [[Jean-Marie Lehn]], [[George Olah]] and other eminent scientists.&lt;ref name="gdch2"&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/gdch/eps__e.htm  Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Scientific publications of the society include ''{{lang|de|Nachrichten aus der Chemie}},''&lt;ref&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/taetigkeiten/nch__e.htm  ''Nachrichten aus der Chemie'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Angewandte Chemie]],'' ''[[Chemistry: A European Journal]],''  ''[[European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry]],'' ''[[European Journal of Organic Chemistry]],'' ''[[ChemPhysChem]],'' ''[[ChemSusChem]],'' ''[[ChemBioChem]],'' ''[[ChemMedChem]],'' ''[[ChemCatChem]],'' ''[[ChemistryViews]],'' ''Chemie Ingenieur Technik'' and ''[[Chemie in unserer Zeit]].''&lt;ref&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/taetigkeiten/zeitschriften__e.htm  Journals]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, the society has become a member of [[ChemPubSoc Europ]]e, which is an organization of 16 European chemical societies.  This European consortium was established in the late 1990s as many chemical journals owned by national chemical societies were amalgamated.&lt;ref&gt;ChemPubSoc Europe, [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu.html mission]; [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu_members.html  participating societies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prizes and awards===
The society acknowledges individual achievement with prizes and awards, including medals originally conferred by the predecessor organizations DChG and VDCh:
* [[Hoffman Medal]] (''Hofmann Denkmünze''), first awarded to [[Henri Moissan]], 1903&lt;ref name="gdch1"/&gt;  
* [[Liebig Medal]] (''Liebig Denkmünze''), first awarded to [[Adolf von Baeyer]], 1903&lt;ref name="gdch1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6259">The '''Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory''' (SABO) is a nonprofit membership-supported scientific and educational organization founded in 1996 in [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]], [[Arizona]], USA.  The mission of the Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory is to promote the conservation of the birds of southeastern Arizona, their habitats, and the diversity of species that share those habitats through research, monitoring, and public education.  

The observatory's founders and current directors are Tom Wood and Sheri Williamson, former managers of [[The Nature Conservancy]]'s [[Ramsey Canyon Preserve]], and Mark Newstrom.

==Monitoring bird diversity==

Southeastern Arizona is at a biogeographic crossroads, where the [[Rocky Mountains]] meet the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] of [[Mexico]] and the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] blends into the [[Sonoran Desert]].  Isolated mountain ranges known as "[[sky islands]]" are home to a variety of animal and plant species found nowhere else in the [[United States]].  The [[San Pedro River, Arizona|San Pedro River]] flows north from the mountains of northern [[Sonora]], Mexico providing a highway for millions of migrating birds every spring and fall.  The [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] and [[Sonoita Creek]] also provide [[riparian]] habitat for breeding and migrating birds and other wildlife.  Much of the best remaining wildlife habitat in the region is in the [[Coronado National Forest]], national and state parks, national wildlife refuges and conservation areas, state wildlife areas, military reservations, and [[The Nature Conservancy|Nature Conservancy]] preserves. 

The Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory has conducted various monitoring projects both independently and in cooperation with public agencies.  Its longest-running research project, in cooperation with the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]] and Friends of the San Pedro River, is a study of the [[hummingbird]]s that use the [[San Pedro River, Arizona|San Pedro River]] as a migratory corridor or breeding area.&lt;ref name="band1"&gt;City of Sierra Vista, AZ YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VXtUC3J0Jw Hummingbird Banding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="band2"&gt;Davis, Tony. [http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/science/305680 "Tiny bird banded in AZ recaptured after humdinger of a flight"], ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'', 2008-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Banding sessions are open to the public, which has allowed thousands of visitors to observe research in progress and learn more about hummingbirds, other migratory birds, the ecological significance of the San Pedro River, and other conservation issues. Past projects include migration monitoring and breeding bird monitoring under the MAPS ([[Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship]]) Program&lt;ref name="maps"&gt;Institute for Bird Populations: [http://www.birdpop.org/maps.htm Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920120302/http://www.birdpop.org/maps.htm |date=2007-09-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[United States National Park Service|National Park Service]] and [[United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]].  SABO is a participant in the Landbird Monitoring Network of the Americas.&lt;ref name="lamna1"&gt;[http://www.klamathbird.org/lamna/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lamna2"&gt;U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station: [http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/topics/wildlife/birdmon/pif/mnstalst.shtml Landbird Monitoring Network of the Americas: Member Organizations and Stations]. Retrieved on 2009-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informal surveys of wintering raptors are integrated into weekly public tours of the southern [[Sulphur Springs Valley, Arizona|Sulphur Springs Valley]], between [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]] and [[Elfrida, Arizona|Elfrida]].

==Ecotourism and outreach==

Southeastern Arizona consistently ranks as one of the top five [[birding]] locations in the United States. Tens of thousands of birders visit the area each year, making [[Ecotourism|nature-based tourism]] an important asset to the regional economy.  The area's natural attractions also lure active retirees and others interested in relocating to areas with diverse opportunities for outdoor recreation.  To cultivate environmental awareness and advocacy among both residents and tourists, the Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory offers bird walks, workshops, other educational activities in both Arizona and northwestern Mexico,&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Wilcove, David S. [http://www.birds.cornell.edu/NetCommunity/LbPrintPage.aspx?print=725 "Border Traffic: The challenge of saving Mexico’s vanishing Thick-billed Parrots"]. ''Living Bird'', [[Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology]], Winter 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and volunteer opportunities. 

The Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory also supports community-based outreach and economic development programs such as the Southwest Wings [[Birding]] and Nature Festival, the Wings Over [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]] [[Sandhill crane|Sandhill Crane]] Celebration, and the Southeastern Arizona Birding Trail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3101">The '''Sterling 10.5 axle''' is an automotive axle manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company]]  at the Sterling Axle Plant in [[Sterling Heights, MI]]. It was first used in model year 1985 Ford trucks.  The axle was developed to replace the [[Dana 60]] and [[Dana 70]].  The Sterling 10.5 axle is currently only made as a [[axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|full floating]] axle.  


[[Image:10.5 Sterling.JPG|thumb|10.5 Sterling axle in 2011 Super Duty (without the electronic locking differential option)]]

__TOC__

== General Specifications ==

* Ring gear measures {{Convert|10.5|in|}}.
* 35 Spline axle shafts with a {{Convert|1.5|in||abbr=on|adj=on}} diameter
* Ratios 3.08 to 4.30. Current production ratios offered are 3.31, 3.55, 3.73, and 4.30.
* Since ca. 2005, the gears are formed by the face hob process, formerly face milled process.
* 2005 through 2012 have {{Convert|13.38|in||abbr=on|adj=on}} disk brakes, dual piston calipers and {{Convert|8.1|in||abbr=on|adj=on}} in hat parking brakes.
* 2013 have {{Convert|14.29|in||abbr=on|adj=on}} disk brakes, dual piston calipers and {{Convert|9|in||abbr=on|adj=on}} in hat parking brakes.

==10.25==
Originally the axle was made with a ring gear that measured {{Convert|10.25|in|}} until it was upgraded 1999 to the 10.50 for the [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks. This axle came with drum brakes. The first version was made 1985 to 1992. A second revision included a stronger pinion/yoke design and was made 1993-1997. This corrected a known, but rare, issue of the pinion yoke nut working loose.

The 10.25 is still made.  It appears the same as the 10.5 externally, except it uses a one piece differential case with 2 pinion gears.

===10.25 Semi-float===
The semi float variation is less common and was used in F-250 trucks with a lower GVWR (7200)  This stopped in 1993 model year trucks until the generation change.  The [[Ford F-Series#Tenth generation (1997–2004)| 10th generation Ford F-150]] offered this axle in the light-duty F-250 trucks from 1997-1999. For model year 2000 - 2004 trucks, the F-150 7700 offered this axle and the F-250 light duty was discontinued. Gear ratios were 3.73 in 4x4 and either the 3.73 or 4.10 in the two-wheel-drive models.

==10.50==
1999 Ford revamped their heavy trucks, including their own Sterling axle.  An upgraded 3 pinion differential carrier was added.  The differentials are interchangeable between the two variations. The new axle also came with disc brakes and a unique 8x{{Convert|170|mm||abbr=on|adj=on}} metric lug pattern. Options and features remained unchanged until model year 2011 trucks.  2011 models with this axle have the option of being equipped with an electronic locking differential.&lt;ref&gt; http://blogs.fourwheeler.com/6564589/whats-new/2011-ford-super-duty-electric-locker-lowdown/index.html &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sustainable yield''' of [[natural capital]] is the [[ecological yield]] that can be extracted without reducing the base of capital itself, i.e. the [[Economic surplus|surplus]] required to maintain [[ecosystem services]] at the same or increasing level over time.  This yield usually varies over time with the needs of the [[ecosystem]] to maintain itself, e.g. a [[forest]] that has recently suffered a [[blight]] or [[flooding]] or [[fire]] will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain and re-establish a mature forest.  While doing so, the sustainable yield may be much less.

In forestry terms it is the largest amount of harvest activity that can occur without degrading the productivity of the stock.

[[File:Net fishing professionally 0544990019 KALFA.jpg|thumb| Fishery management utilizes the concept of sustainable yield to determine how much fish can be removed, so that the population remains sustainable.]]

This concept is important in fishery management, in which sustainable yield is defined as the number of fish that can be extracted without reducing the base of fish stock, and the [[maximum sustainable yield]] is defined as the amount of fish that can be extracted under given environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ricker|first=W.E.|date=1975|title=Computation and Interpretation of Biological Statistics of Fish Populations|journal=Bulletin of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada|volume=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fisheries, the basic natural capital or virgin population, must decrease with extraction. At the same time productivity increases. Hence, sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield. It may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield, because every dynamic ecological conditions and other factors  not  related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both, the natural capital and its productivity.

In the case of [[groundwater]] there is a safe yield of water extraction per unit time, beyond which the [[aquifer]] risks the state of [[overdrafting]] or even depletion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8508">'''T.J. Demos''' is an [[Art history|art historian]] and [[Cultural criticism|cultural critic]] who writes on [[contemporary art]] and [[visual culture]], particularly in relation to [[globalization]], [[politics]], [[Human migration|migration]] and [[ecology]]. Currently a Professor in the Department of History of Art and Visual Culture (HAVC) at UC Santa Cruz, and the founding director of the Center for Creative Ecologies, he is the author of several books, including ''Decolonizing Nature: Contemporary Art and the Politics of Ecology'' (Sternberg Press, 2016),
''The Migrant Image: The Art and Politics of Documentary during Global Crisis'' (Duke University Press, 2013), and ''Return to the Postcolony: Spectres of Colonialism in Contemporary Art'' (Sternberg Press, 2013).  Previous to his current appointment, Demos taught at University College London between 2005-2015. 

Demos has also curated a number of art exhibitions, including ''Rights of Nature: Art and Ecology in the Americas''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nottinghamcontemporary.org/art/rights-nature/&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 and ''Uneven Geographies: Art and Globalisation''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nottinghamcontemporary.org/art/uneven-geographies/&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015, both at Nottingham Contemporary (both co-curated with Alex Farqharson); ''Specters: A Cinema of Haunting''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/activities/spectres-cinema/&lt;/ref&gt; at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid in 2014; and ''Zones of Conflict'', at Pratt Manhattan Gallery in New York in 2008.

==Education and career==

Demos received his PhD in 2000 from Columbia University. His first book, which emerged from his doctoral thesis, was ''The Exiles of Marcel Duchamp'' (MIT Press, 2007). It situates Duchamp’s mixed-media projects, such as ''La Boîte-en-valise'', and his installations, including the 1938 Surrealist exhibition in Paris, in the context of the early twentieth century’s world wars and nationalist formations. The text argues that Duchamp’s practice brought about an aesthetic negotiation of the experiences of geopolitical dislocation.

==Writing==

Demos’ work focuses on the intersection of contemporary art and politics (particularly in the areas of photography and moving-image art), and considers the ways that art is capable of inventing creative and critical approaches that analyze, defy, and provide alternatives to reigning political, social, and economic forms of neoliberal globalization. His recent writing investigates contemporary art’s relation to environmental crisis, and he recently guest-edited a special issue of the journal ''Third Text'' on "Contemporary Art and the Politics of Ecology" (no. 120, January 2013), and has written several essays on the subject, such as “The Post-Natural Condition” in ''Artforum''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Post-Natural Condition|url=http://tomorrowmorning.net/texts/demos_artafternature_artforum.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Migrant Image: The Art and Politics of Documentary during Global Crisis''===
This book looks at contemporary artists who have turned to documentary practice in order to investigate the mobile lives of migrants, refugees, stateless persons, and the politically dispossessed. His analysis considers the work of artists from Europe, the United States, the Middle East, and North Africa, which portrays the frequently negative conditions of neoliberal globalization, and which connects viewers to the lived experiences of economic and political crisis. The text includes close readings of works by Steve McQueen, The Otolith Group, Emily Jacir, Hito Steyerl Ahlam Shibli, Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige, Ursula Biemann, Lamia Joreige, Rabih Mroué, Walid Raad, Yto Barrada, Ayreen Anastas and Rene Gabri, Goldin+Senneby. It argues that these artists propose innovative ways to approach a politics of social justice and equality, and historical consciousness, even while operating in an aesthetic domain that is post-representational and deterritorialized.

===''Return to the Postcolony: Specters of Colonialism in Contemporary Art''===
This text examines the video and photographic projects by Sven Augustijnen, Vincent Meessen, Zarina Bhimji, Renzo Martens, and Pieter Hugo. The book traces the work of these artists who have each travelled to former European colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa in recent years in order to investigate past and present traumas and injustices, resulting in projects that were also made around the time of the 50th anniversary of the independence of numerous African countries. Addressing the larger context of failed states, increasing socio-political and economic inequality, and the continuing US-led military campaigns for security, resources, and economic supremacy worldwide, the book contends that artists today are critically investigating the aesthetics and image systems of neoliberalism and global crisis. Arguing that the past colonial experience continues to haunt those living in the present, but lies repressed, the book considers these artists’ voyages as constituting a “reverse migration,” a return to the African postcolony, “which drives an ethico-political as well as an aesthetic set of imperatives: to learn to live with ghosts, but to do so more justly.” (back cover).

===''Dara Birnbaum: Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman''===
Demos reads Birnbaum's video art in relation to media theory, postmodernist appropriation aesthetics, and the politics of feminism, and considers the pioneering attempts of the artist to develop the transformative capabilities of the medium of video.

===''The Exiles of Marcel Duchamp''===
Demos' text analyses the artist’s installations and conceptual mixed-media pieces – such as his La Boîte-en-valise, which Duchamp called his “portable museum.” The book places these project in relation to the aesthetic and geopolitical dislocations of early twentieth-century nationalisms and world war.

== Recognition ==
In 2014, Demos was awarded the prestigious [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/2014awards|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=14 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116070852/http://www.collegeart.org/awards/2014awards|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theoretical planetology''', also known as '''theoretical planetary science'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12525.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211094245/http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12525.html |date=December 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of [[planetary sciences]] that developed in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="yugoplanet"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0005117 [astro-ph/0005117&amp;#93; Semiclassical planetology : some results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of the work ==
[[File:VFPt Earths Magnetic Field Confusion.svg|thumb|right|Diagram showing [[Earth's magnetic field]]: theoretical planetologists study many aspects of planetary bodies, such as how their magnetic fields are generated in their cores.&lt;ref name="uclaplanet"/&gt;]]

Updated: November 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Theoretical planetology uses [[computer graphics]], scientific visualisation, and [[fluid dynamics]] extensively.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="visualisation"/&gt;]]
[[File:AtmosphCirc2.png|thumb|right|Theoretical planetologists study [[atmospheric circulation]] over planets.]]

Theoretical planetologists, also known as theoretical planetary scientists, use [[Scientific modelling|modelling]] techniques to develop an understanding of the internal structure of [[planet]]s by making assumptions about their [[chemical]] composition and the state of their materials, then calculating the radial distribution of various properties such as [[temperature]], [[pressure]], or [[density]] of material across the planet's internals.&lt;ref name="yugoplanet"/&gt;

Theoretical planetologists also use [[numerical analysis|numerical]] models to understand how the [[Solar System]] planets were formed and develop in the future, their [[thermal]] evolution, their [[tectonics]], how [[magnetic field]]s are formed in planetary interiors, how [[convection]] processes work in the [[Planetary core|cores]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]s of [[terrestrial planet]]s and in the interiors of [[gas giants]], how their [[lithosphere]]s deform, the [[orbit]]al dynamics of planetary satellites, how [[dust]] and [[ice]] are transported on the surface of some planets (such as [[Mars]]), and how the [[atmospheric circulation]] takes place over a planet.&lt;ref name="uclaplanet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ess.ucla.edu/research/planet_physics.asp |title=UCLA - Earth and Space Sciences - Research in Planetary Physics |publisher=Ess.ucla.edu |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426105504/http://www.ess.ucla.edu/research/planet_physics.asp |archivedate=2009-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical planetologists may use [[laboratory]] [[experiment]]s to understand various phenomena analogous to planetary processes, such as convection in rotating fluids.&lt;ref name="uclaplanet"/&gt;

Theoretical planetologists make extensive use of basic [[physics]], particularly [[fluid dynamics]] and [[condensed matter physics]], and much of their work involves interpretation of [[data]] returned by [[space missions]], although they rarely get actively involved in them.&lt;ref name="stevenson"&gt;[http://www.planetary.caltech.edu/faculty/stevenson/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820132705/http://www.planetary.caltech.edu/faculty/stevenson/ |date=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational requirements ==

Typically a theoretical planetologist will have to have had [[higher education]] in [[physics]] and [[theoretical physics]], at [[PhD]] doctorate level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.caltech.edu/faculty/stevenson/cv.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Media Relations |url=http://mr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12525.html |title=Four from Caltech Named to National Academy of Sciences - Caltech |publisher=Mr.caltech.edu |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814065850/http://mr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12525.html |archivedate=2007-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific visualisation ==

Because of the use of [[scientific visualisation]] animation, theoretical planetology has a relationship with [[computer graphics]].  Example movies exhibiting this relation are the 4-minute "[[The Origin of the Moon (scientific visualisation movie)|The Origin of the Moon]]"&lt;ref name="visualisation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olats.org/space/13avril/2002/space13Avr2002.html |title=Présentation de la journée |publisher=Olats.org |accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major successes ==

One of the major successes of theoretical planetology is the prediction and subsequent confirmation of [[volcanism on Io]].&lt;ref name="Hans-2003"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

  | first = Hans 
  | title = Encyclopedia of Space Science &amp; Technology

The prediction was made by [[Stanton J. Peale]] who wrote a [[scientific paper]] claiming that Io must be volcanically active that was published one week before [[Voyager 1]] encountered [[Jupiter]].  When Voyager 1 photographed Io in 1979, his theory was confirmed.&lt;ref name="prediction"/&gt;  Later photographs of Io by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and from the ground also showed volcanoes on Io's surface, and they were extensively studied and photographed by the [[Galileo]] orbiter of Jupiter from 1995-2003.

A '''triple conjunction''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] event, where two [[planet]]s or a planet and a [[star]] meet each other three times in a short period either in [[Astronomical opposition|opposition]] or at the time of [[inferior conjunction]], if an [[inferior planet]] is involved. The visible movement of the planet or the planets in the sky is therefore normally [[Apparent retrograde motion|prograde]] at the first conjunction, [[Apparent retrograde motion|retrograde]] at the second conjunction and again prograde at the third conjunction.

The meeting of three planets is referred to as a particular case of [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]].

There are three possible cases of triple conjunctions.

== Of inferior planets with superior planets or stars ==
{{Disputed|date=April 2013}}
If [[Mars]] is in conjunction with the Sun, there is often a triple conjunction between Mars and Mercury or between Mars and Venus. In the events in which Mercury is involved, the second conjunction is invisible because of small elongation from Sun; both other events are difficult to see because of the nearness to [[horizon]] and the relatively low brightness of Mars, which is there always near its greatest distance from Earth, barely visible.

For a Mars–Venus triple conjunction all three events can almost always be seen, but Mars is dim because of its great distance from the [[Earth]].

Triple conjunctions between the inferior planets Mercury and Venus and the superior planets [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]] or with [[star]]s take place when these objects are at the same time in conjunction to Sun while Mercury or Venus are at inferior conjunction.
Frequently the second conjunction takes place when both bodies are too close to the Sun in order to be seen, while the other conjunctions are easily visible, especially if the other body is Jupiter, Saturn or a bright star.

With the dim planets Uranus, Neptune and dwarf planet Pluto the visibility of such an event is difficult, because of the low elongation from Sun.

Triple conjunctions of Mercury and Venus with the exterior planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and dwarf planet Pluto happen relatively frequently (approximately once in 10 years).
During the movement in their inferior conjunction loop Mercury and Venus are always involved in triple conjunctions with some stars. Triple conjunctions with bright stars are as frequent as with exterior planets.

== Between two exterior planets ==

These are the most interesting triple conjunctions, because all three conjunctions can be seen very easily, because of the great elongation of the planets or stars involved. Triple conjunctions between exterior planets or an exterior planet and a star can only occur when these objects are nearly simultaneously in opposition.

Triple conjunctions between the bright exterior planets are very rare: the last triple conjunctions between Mars and Jupiter occurred in 1789–1790, in 1836–1837 and in 1979–1980. The next events of this kind will be again in 2123 and in 2169–2170.

The last triple conjunctions between Mars and Saturn took place in 1779, 1877 (only in [[right ascension]]) and in 1945–1946. The next triple conjunction between these planets will occur in 2148–2149, in 2185 and in 2187.

For both at triple conjunctions between Mars and Jupiter and for triple conjunctions between Mars and Saturn it is possible that two such events follow at an interval of only 2 years. This last happened for Mars and Jupiter in 927 and 929 and will be again in 2742 and 2744. It last happened for Mars and Saturn in 1742–1743 and 1744–1745 and will occur again in 2185 and 2187.

The most historically important triple conjunction was that one between Jupiter and Saturn in 7 BCE-5 BCE, which has been proposed as the explanation for the [[star of Bethlehem]]. Triple conjunctions between Jupiter and Saturn—so-called [[Greatest Conjunction]]s—last took place in 1682–1683, 1821 (only in [[right ascension]]), 1940–1941 and 1981. It will not occur again until 2238–2239.

There are more frequent triple conjunctions of Jupiter with Uranus or Neptune. They are unspectacular, but offer a good possibility for amateur astronomers to find these dim planets. The last triple conjunction between Jupiter and Uranus was in 2010–2011 and the next will be in 2037–2038. The last between Jupiter and Neptune was in 2009 and the next will be in 2047–2048.

At each opposition, because of the visible loop movement of the planets, there are triple conjunctions between the planet and some stars. Triple conjunctions between planets and bright stars close to the [[zodiac]] are not so frequent (approximately 2 events in 10 years).

Note that conjunctions in [[right ascension]] and [[ecliptic longitude]] need not to take place on the same date. It is possible, that there is a triple conjunction in right ascension, but not in [[ecliptic longitude]] and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4233">VOCs ([[volatile organic compounds]]) are a dangerous contaminant of [[groundwater]], leading to [[groundwater pollution]].  They are generally introduced to the environment through careless industrial practices.

==Overview==
[[Volatile organic compounds|VOCs]] are responsible for a number of adverse health effects especially for [[breastfeeding|nursing]] and [[pregnant]] mothers.  Many of these compounds were not known to be harmful until the late 1960s and it was some time before regular testing of [[groundwater]] identified these substances in drinking water sources.

==Specific VOCs==
===PCE===
[[Tetrachloroethylene]] is used in metal degreasing and dry cleaning.  It is a suspected to cause cancer, and a host of other health problems.

===TCE===
[[Trichloroethylene]] is used in cleaning metal parts and was widely believed to be harmless before being linked to [[birth defects]]. It is a suspected to cause cancer, and a host of other health problems.

===Toluene===
[[Toluene]] is an organic compound which is mostly harmless to adults and is sometimes abused as an [[inhalant]].  [[Fetal toluene syndrome]] has been defined and resembles [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] with resultant [[birth defects]], but the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] have identified differentiating features between the two [[syndrome]]s including FTS having the additional facial features of [[micrognathia]], large anterior [[fontanel]], down-turned mouth  corners, hair patterning abnormalities, bifrontal narrowing of the face, and ear abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;CDC. (2004). ''Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis''. Can be downloaded at https://www.cdc.gov/fas/faspub.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505061132/http://www.cdc.gov/fas/faspub.htm |date=2007-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Camp Lejeune===
{{Details|Camp Lejeune water contamination}}
U.S. Marine Corps Base [[Camp Lejeune]] was built near [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]] in 1942.  In 1982, the Marine Corps discovered volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in several drinking water wells that fed into two of the eight water systems.  The sources were traced to [[Tetrachloroethylene]] (PCE) from a two dry cleaners - one on base, the other off the base and [[Trichloroethylene]] which had been used in vehicle maintenance on the base.  These problems were addressed but there were concerns with nursing and pregnant mothers who may have been exposed previously.  It wasn't until the late 1990s that the federal government tried to track down people who may have been exposed.

===Love Canal===
{{main|Love Canal}}
[[Love Canal]] was an abandoned canal near [[Niagara Falls, New York]] which was used by the [[U.S. military]] and [[Occidental Petroleum]] as a [[chemical waste]] dumping ground.  Numerous cases of cancer and birth defects were found from the 1950s to the 1970s.  The primary VOC at Love Canal is [[toluene]], which is found along with [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]s and other [[pollutants]].

===Valley of the Drums===
{{main|Valley of the Drums}}
The [[Valley of the Drums]] is a {{convert|23|acre|m2|adj=on}} toxic waste site in northern Bullitt County, Kentucky, near Louisville, named after the waste-containing drums strewn across the area. Contaminants include 
[[xylene]], [[methyl ethyl ketone]], 
[[methylene chloride]],
[[acetone]],
[[phthalates]],
[[anthracene]],
[[toluene]],
[[fluoranthene]],
[[alkyl benzene]],
[[vinyl chloride]],
[[dichloroethylene]], and [[aliphatic acids]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/rods/fulltext/r0486009.pdf EPA report on the A. L. TAYLOR SITE  - page 5]
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known as one of the primary motivations for the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or Superfund Act of 1980.

The '''Webster's test''' is a qualitative [[urine]] test used to detect the presence of [[trinitrotoluene]] and its [[metabolites]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp81-c2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The test was developed in 1917 by T.A. Webster&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Webster's Test for T.N.T. Derivatives in Urine|pmc=2341277 | page=658 | volume=1|issue=3047|journal=British Medical Journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.3047.658-a|year=1919 |author1=Moore |first1=B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=TRINITROTOLUENE POISONING| page=842 |journal=British Medical Journal |date=16 December 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; in London as a way to test for trinitrotoluene poisoning.  A positive test results in a purple color for the acidified urine samples.

'''Youth in Arts''' is a [[non-profit]] organization that provides [[visual art|visual]] and [[performing arts]] instruction to public and private school students and enriches the community with cultural events. Youth in Arts has been providing [[Arts in education|arts education]] to [[students]] in the [[San Francisco]] [[Bay Area]] since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthinarts.org/|title=Youth In Arts San Rafael|publisher=Youthinarts.org|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], Ca. The Artists in Schools program brings artists into classrooms to teach visual and performing arts in extended residencies or shorter workshop programs and also provides training for teachers and parents in supporting students' learning and development through the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinmagazine.com/Marin-Magazine/June-2008/Art-for-Kids-Sake/|title=Art for Kids' Sake|publisher=Marinmagazine.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth in Arts also houses the only children's art gallery in the Northern Bay Area. Youth in Arts reaches over 30,000 youth annually.  Youth in Arts creates interactive public art works at the Marin County Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinij.com/opinion/ci_15424234|title=Marin Voice: Fair brings world a little closer|publisher=Marinij.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During July 2013, Youth in Arts worked with over 600 youth and professional artists to create the world's biggest pop up book spanning 48' long and 6' high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_23621279/worlds-biggest-pop-up-book-displayed-at-marin|title=World's biggest pop-up book displayed at Marin County Fair|publisher=Marinij.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent evaluation of the Artists in Schools program, funded by a grant from the [[California Arts Council]], found that three-quarters of the students participating showed a more positive attitude toward learning in an arts-inclusive classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/03/05/NBGGC58DOH1.DTL|title=Fade to red / Program that brings arts to schools is running out of cash|work=SFGate|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools pay Youth in Arts for programming. The agency also fundraises to offset costs and to provide free programs to schools that cannot afford to pay.

In addition to the Artists in Schools program, Youth in Arts Presents offers live performances to thousands of local students through Theater Shows and Assemblies; VSA arts and "Arts Unite Us"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinscope.com/mill_valley_herald/news/article_76b4ccb0-020f-533a-be28-1f6ce5782295.html|title=Special Education and theater students create one-act play|work=Marinscope Community Newspapers|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide tailored programs to special needs students and bring together students of differing abilities through the arts and 'Til Dawn is an award-winning teen a cappella program for advanced young vocalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinmagazine.com/Marin-Magazine/May-2010/Something-to-Sing-About/|title=Something to Sing About|publisher=Marinmagazine.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth in Arts founded the Italian Street Painting Festival in downtown San Rafael and ran that event for 17 years, that event is now being continued by a separate organization, Italian Street Painting Marin.
