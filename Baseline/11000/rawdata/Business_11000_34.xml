The '''AN/SPN-46(V)2''' is a ground-based [[Precision Approach and Landing System]], built by [[Textron Systems]]. It is used for PALS training of pilots, operators and maintenance personnel.

==History==
The AN/SPN-46(V)2 was made to replace [[AN/SPN-42(T)1]], [[AN/SPN-42(T)3]], and [[AN/SPN-42(T)4]] radar systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AN/SPN-46(V) PALS|url=http://electronicstechnician.tpub.com/14089/css/An-Spn-46-V-Pals-33.htm|website=electronicstechnician.tpub.com|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The system functions very similarly to the AN/SPN-46(V)1 system, which is carrier based, and not ground-based. The only major differences between them are that the (V)2 does not possess a MK 16 Mod 12 shipboard stabilization unit, and its antennas are {{convert|7|ft}} long, as opposed to the {{convert|4|ft}} long antennas of the V(1).&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web|title=SIGNIFICANT  INTERFACES|url=http://electronicstechnician.tpub.com/14089/css/Significant-Interfaces-34.htm|website=electronicstechnician.tpub.com|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12039">The '''Akron rubber strike of 1936''' was a strike by workers against [[Natural rubber|rubber]] factory owners in [[Akron, Ohio]].

During the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, rubber factory workers, including those who worked for the three major rubber factories in Akron, OH, faced poor working conditions, low wages, and close to no benefits. The year 1936 was not only within this period in which rubber factory workers struggled with poor conditions and low wages, but also coincided with the period of the Great Depression in the [[United States]], as well as the passing of the [[National Labor Relations Act]]. The combination of all these conditions, as well as many other conditions, caused the founding of the United Rubber Workers in 1935, and the major picket strike of February and March 1936.

== Unions ==

=== United Rubber Council ===
In 1933, the same year the [[National Recovery Administration]] was established by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) created a United Rubber Council (URC) to be a nationwide union for the industry. But workers at many individual factories had already organized federal local unions, and so recruitment was slow. So the AFL printed 50,000 leaflets and distributed them to the many rubber factories in Akron, Ohio, inviting workers to a recruiting meeting. About 5,000 workers showed up to hear the AFL's Paul Smith,  and eventually about 50,000 workers joined the URC.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941|last=Bernstein|first=Irving|publisher=Haymarket|year=2010|isbn=978-1-608460-64-9|location=Chicago, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But during a rubber industry strike in 1934 and 1935, the URC's elected leadership reached terms with factory management that many striking workers felt far too unfavorable. The union's membership to plummeted below 5,000 members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strike!|last=Brecher|first=Jeremy|publisher=PM Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-60486-428-1|location=Oakland, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Rubber Workers ===
In its wake, the United Rubber Workers (URW) union was founded as the new industry-wide union. The AFL's William Green threatened to pull AFL funding from rubber-industry unions unless the URW elected as president the AFL's Coleman Claherty,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement, 1935-1941|last=Galenson|first=Walter|publisher=Harvard UP|year=1960|isbn=9780674131507|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had been directing AFL activity in Akron since 1933. The rubber workers rejected Claherty, a boilermaker by trade, and elected instead Sherman Dalrymple, president of the [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich]] factory's local union. So the AFL ceased funding the rubbr-industry union, after making one donation of $1,000 cash and passing along some URC assets: office furniture, equipment, and about $1,800 in a URC bank account.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The URW eventually affiliated with the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), and solidified itself as the prominent industry-wide union for rubber workers through the remainder of the Great Depression and until [[World War II]]. The URW is also one of the first few unions in the CIO that was founded without  financial help from an outside organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Labor Conflict in the United States: An Encyclopedia|last=Filippelli|first=Ronald L.|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=0-8240-7968-X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the 1935 [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935|National Labor Relations Act]], which guaranteed the right to organize and form unions, helped the CIO form many unions within different industries. But it did not require employers to recognize and cooperate with unions. [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]'s management, led by Paul Litchfield, did not wish to recognize the URW during negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thirties in America|last=Lewis|first=Thomas Tandy|publisher=Salem Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-58765-725-2|location=|pages=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goodyear Industrial Assembly ===
The Goodyear Industrial Assembly, founded in 1919, was a local union for employees of the Goodyear Tire plant. Many of the rubber factories had local unions in place to allow the workers and management of individual factories to bargain, and (during this time period) these local unions often existed at the same time as industry-wide unions. Because the Goodyear factory was more than twice the size of the next largest employer, the actions between the workers and management at the Goodyear factory had an effect on how the rest of the industry acted.

Goodyear's management and the leadership of the local union were able to cooperate and bargain until late 1935. During the later stages of 1935, Goodyear's management, led by Paul Litchfield,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International directory of company histories. Vol. 20|last=Pederson|first=Jay P.|last2=Grant|first2=Tina|publisher=St. James Press|year=1998|isbn=1-55862-361-2|location=Detroit, MI|pages=258–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced plans to reduce hourly wages, while at the same time moving from six hour shifts to eight hour shifts for its employees. The local union voiced its displeasure to management, but management was adamant on going through with the proposed changes, regardless of how the local union felt. Because the local union was now unable to negotiate with management, its perceived bargaining power decreased in the eyes of the workers, causing the union's support to decrease, and workers began to look elsewhere for union support (with many workers eventually joining the URW).

== Sit-down strikes ==
The [[Sitdown strike|sit-down strike]] was a type of strike that the rubber factory workers used very frequently both before and after the large picket strike of February–March 1936. The sit-down strike is when factory workers, who are currently working on the assembly line, sit down at their assembly line positions to stop production at their point in the production process. The stoppage of production in one department will cause the next department in the process to stop because that department will have no new products or batches to work with. Because one department decides to sit down, it causes the rest of an assembly line to cease production.

The workers in the rubber industry got the idea of using the sit-down strike from a strike that occurred at a baseball game that was played between union members from different factories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The players, who were union members, disliked an umpire who was not a union member, so the players decided that they would rather sit down on the field than play in a game that would be umpired by someone who was not a member of their union. The sit-down strikes in Akron, OH are considered to be some of the earliest origins of the sit-down strike, even earlier than the [[Flint sit-down strike]] of 1936-1937.

The sit-down strike was used frequently by the rubber workers because of a few reasons. The most important reason for the sit-down strike being used is that it does not allow the factory's management to hire [[scab workers]] to continue production, because the sitting workers are occupying the space necessary for the work to be done. Another major reason as to why the sit-down strike was frequently used by the rubber workers was due to management's inability to use force in order to get the striking workers out of the way. Factory management would rarely use force to drive out striking employees because of the fear of damaging expensive equipment used in the manufacturing process. These reasons also allowed the sit-down strike to be an effective tool for the workers.

== The picket strike of February–March 1936 ==
The large picket strike of February–March 1936 began in the Goodyear Tire factory, and then quickly spread to the rest of the rubber factories in Akron, OH.

Late during 1935, the management of the Goodyear plant, which was by far the largest employer of rubber workers in the industry, introduced a plan for the reduction of hourly wages for workers as well as a move from six hour shifts to eight hour shifts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Akron_Rubber_Strike_of_1936?rec=461|title=Akron Rubber Strike of 1936|last=|first=|date=|website=Ohio History Central|publisher=Ohio History Connection|access-date=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for management's plan was to save money on labor. The move to eight hour shifts from six hour shifts would cause significant layoffs of around 1,200 workers, because with six hour shifts, four shifts of workers would be employed compared to three shifts of workers being employed under eight hour shifts. Eventually, Goodyear's management decided to go back to six hour shifts because of the displeasure voiced by workers.

During the early stages of 1936, shortly after Goodyear's management decided to go back to the six hour shifts for its employees, Goodyear was forced to layoff around 700 workers due to decreases in tire sales.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This round of layoffs ended up being the final event between management and workers that caused the workers to start the picket strike on February 14, 1936.

Throughout the strike, there were as many as 10,000 workers, which included people from all trades in the city of Akron, that picketed around the many gates to the Goodyear factory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The leaders of the strike were able to maintain strong morale amongst the striking workers during the strike largely due to the playing of music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are a couple of known attempts to break the picket strike by using force, the first of which was by the police. The sheriff's force consisted of around 150 deputies as the force approached the striking workers. At the last possible second, the sheriff's force deciding against attempting to break up the striking workers due to number of people that they would be confronting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second known attempt to break the strike by using force would have been by a Law and Order League. This group was financially funded by Goodyear and was managed by a former mayor of Akron. The group consisted of approximately 5,200 members that were fully prepared to attack the striking workers if told to do so. As a way of avoiding a violent confrontation, the Summit County Central Labor Council was able to convince the Law and Order League to not attack the striking workers.

During the time of the picket strike, Goodyear's management and the URW were busy negotiating terms that would allow for the workers to go back to the factories and continue production. Goodyear's management refused to formally sign any agreements between the two sides, causing the negotiation process to potentially take longer than it should have. By the end of the negotiating process, Goodyear had capitulated on many of the major demands by the workers. These demands included layoffs by seniority, six hour work shifts, and regular meetings between management and union representatives. The workers came away from the strike largely victorious, and their excitement was shown by a march of 5,000 delighted workers throughout the streets of Akron following the announcement that the strike was over.

Even though the strike had halted production for about a month, Goodyear had three months of inventory built up prior to the beginning of the strike, so the company did not lose any potential sales revenue by not being able to meet demand. Also, despite the length and size of the strike, no lives were lost and injuries were practically nonexistent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He was born the son of John Adie.

He was apprenticed in 1789 to his uncle John Miller. They later went into business together as Miller and Adie, Mathematical Instrument Makers, which continued until 1822.

His shop was at 58 [[Princes Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://digital.nls.uk/directories/browse/pageturner.cfm?id=83399607&amp;mode=transcription| title= Post-Office Annual directory for Edinburgh and its environs 1832–33|page= 37 |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adie supplied lenses to [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], [[Charles Darwin]]&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin Correspondence'' Vol 3, p 358, Letter 1012&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir David Brewster]] and was optician to William IV and to Queen Victoria.&lt;ref name="Anne"/&gt; He invented the sympiesometer or marine barometer and had a small observatory erected long before there was a public observatory in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="Anne"/&gt;  He was elected as Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] on 25 January 1819, upon the proposal of Lord F Gray, [[Sir David Brewster]] and James Russell.

Adie lived at 10 [[Regent Terrace]], Edinburgh, from 1832 to 1838.&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;Mitchell, Anne (1993), ''The People of Calton Hill'', Mercat Press, James Thin, Edinburgh, {{ISBN|1-873644-18-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He died at Caanan Lodge, in the [[Morningside, Edinburgh|Morningside]] district of Edinburgh (now demolished) in December 1858, and was interred in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]]. The grave lies to the south-west of the church, just to the north-east of the [[William Adam (architect)|Adam]] mausoleum.

His daughter married [[Thomas Henderson (astronomer)|Thomas Henderson]] (1798–1844). Henderson is buried with Adie but is not listed on the memorial.

Adie's son was born on 16 December 1808 and also named Alexander James Adie after his father.&lt;ref name = RSE/&gt;

He studied at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|High School in Edinburgh]] and then [[Edinburgh University]] before training as a civil engineer under [[James Jardine]].

In 1836 he became Resident Engineer on the Bolton, Chorley and Preston Railway. In 1863 he became Manager of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway.

In February 1846 he followed in his father's footsteps and was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

He died at his house, Rockville near [[Linlithgow]], on 3 April 1879. He is buried on the south side of St Michael's Church in Linlithgow.

== Role of the Council ==
The Council is the peak industry association representing the Australian Aluminium industry. The Council promotes the use of Australian aluminium products nationally and internationally. A [[Specification (technical standard)|technical standards]] group within the Council also develops and maintains material specifications and technical data for industry use, and the Council produces an annual statistical analysis of materials consumption, aluminium production and exports by Australia's six aluminium smelters and one aluminum-rolled product plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aluminium Production, Consumption and Trade |publisher=National Statistical Service |date=November 2007 |url=http://www.nss.gov.au/nss/home.NSF/d33ed5064c6e0e80ca25712d002022d5/c745e6813aa43d48ca2571ab00223bd8?OpenDocument |accessdate=2008-01-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901110824/http://www.nss.gov.au/nss/home.NSF/d33ed5064c6e0e80ca25712d002022d5/c745e6813aa43d48ca2571ab00223bd8?OpenDocument |archivedate=2007-09-01 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an industry advocate, the Council has strongly opposed [[greenhouse gas]] [[emissions trading]] schemes on the basis that anti-emission technology is insufficient to minimise the cost impact on producers, and that international action on greenhouse gases should precede Australian programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Emissions Trading Taskforce Discussion Paper -  Possible Design for a National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme: Response by the Australian Aluminium Council |publisher=National Emissions Trading Taskforce |date=December 2006 |url=http://www.emissionstrading.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/5363/Australian_AluminiumCouncil.pdf |accessdate=2008-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830123115/http://www.emissionstrading.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/5363/Australian_AluminiumCouncil.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council also notes that while greenhouse gas emissions from Australian aluminium smelters rose 29 percent since 1990 to a peak of 13.9 million tonnes in 2006, this lags behind a 64 percent increase in aluminium production over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainability Report 2006 |publisher=Australian Aluminium Council |pages=7 |year=2006 |url=http://www.aluminium.org.au/Page.php?d=1281 |accessdate=2008-01-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828193125/http://www.aluminium.org.au/Page.php?d=1281 |archivedate=2007-08-28 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Astronomical Society''' (CASCA; {{lang-fr|link=yes|'''La Société Canadienne d'Astronomie'''}}) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] society of professional [[astronomer]]s, founded in 1971 and incorporated in 1983.  The society is devoted to the promotion and advancement of knowledge of the universe through research and education, and its membership is open to people with a professional involvement in astronomy and related sciences.

The main activities of the Society are its annual scientific meetings, the planning and realization of scientific projects, the support of the scientific activities of its members, and the dissemination of related information among members and other interested people.

== History ==
Before World War II, there were few professional astronomers in Canada. There were two government-run, national observatories, the [[Dominion Observatory]], which opened in 1905 in  [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] and the [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]], which opened in 1918 in [[Saanich, British Columbia]]. In addition, the [[University of Toronto]]'s  [[David Dunlap Observatory]], which opened in 1935 in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]], housed the only significant university faculty and the only centre for graduate studies in astronomy in Canada.

During this period, the most prominent astronomical organization in Canada was the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]], which counted both amateurs and professional astronomer as members. Canadians also held leadership positions and attended meetings of the [[American Astronomical Society]] (AAS). Beginning with Ottawa in 1911, several Canadian cities hosted AAS meetings. Canada was also an early member of the [[International Astronomical Union]], with activities coordinated through the Dominion Observatory.

In the 1960s, University programmes in science expanded rapidly and astronomy groups and departments appeared across Canada. This influx of astronomers, along with the closure of the Dominion Observatory in 1970, created demand for a professional society of Canadian astronomers.

CASCA was founded in May 1971 by a committee of the Canadian government's [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] and [[Helen Sawyer Hogg]] was elected as the first president. CASCA was incorporated in 1983 as a society of professional astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History| url = 
http://casca.ca/?page_id=53 | publisher = Canadian Astronomical Society  | accessdate = 8 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
The quarterly newsletter of the Society, called ''Cassiopeia'' is published at [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s.

'''''Carnival Cruise Lines Tycoon 2005: Island Hopping''''' is a 2004 cruise-line [[business simulation game]] inspired by the cruise line [[Carnival Cruise Lines]] and developed by [[Deck13]] under the Artex Software label, and published by [[Activision Value]]. The primary objective of the game is to offer cruise line services to customers. The game itself offers what would be expected from a typical tycoon game. Users are in command of the ship and are responsible for the task of purchasing buildings and designing the layout. While gaining popularity, users also have an advantage to buy more ships and have a large fleet of ships going to exotic destinations.  The game included Carnival logos and the entertainment and lounges available to add to the ships were named as per Carnival Cruise Lines standards. The ships that can be worked with in the game are: ''Sunshine'' (a fictional cruise [[ferry]] only accessible as the first ship in the career mode), ''[[Grand Celebration|Carnival Celebration]]'', ''[[Carnival Paradise]]'', ''[[Carnival Legend]]'', and the ''[[Carnival Conquest]]''.

The '''Castner–Kellner process''' is a method of [[electrolysis]] on an [[aqueous]] [[alkali]] [[chloride]] solution (usually [[sodium chloride]] solution) to produce the corresponding alkali [[hydroxide]],&lt;ref name="pauling"&gt;Pauling, Linus; ''General Chemistry'' 1970 ed. pp. 539–541 Dover publishing&lt;/ref&gt; invented by American [[Hamilton Castner]] and [[Austrian people|Austrian]]&lt;ref name="isbn0-419-24680-0"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trinder, Barrie Stuart |author2=Stratton, Michael |title=Twentieth century industrial archaeology |publisher=E&amp;FN Spon |location=London |year=2000 |pages=80–81 |isbn=0-419-24680-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Kellner (mystic)|Karl Kellner]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="saltman"&gt;[http://www.saltsense.co.uk/hist-chem12.htm Salt Manufacturers' Association: Salt and the Chemical Revolution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514034157/http://www.saltsense.co.uk/hist-chem12.htm |date=May 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first patent for electrolyzing [[brine]] was granted in England in 1851 to [[Charles Watt]]. His process was not an economically feasible method for producing sodium hydroxide though because it could not prevent the chlorine that formed in the brine solution from reacting with its other constituents. [[Hamilton Castner]] solved the mixing problem with the invention of the mercury cell and was granted a U.S. patent in 1892 ([http://www.google.com/patents/US528322]). Austrian chemist, [[Carl Kellner (mystic)|Karl Kellner]] arrived at  a similar solution at about the same time. In order to avoid a legal battle they became partners in 1895, founding the Castner-Kellner Alkali Company, which built plants employing the process throughout Europe. The mercury cell process continues in use to this day.&lt;ref name="chemchron"&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/tcaw/11/i04/html/04chemistry.html Chemistry Chronicles]&lt;/ref&gt; Current-day mercury cell plant operations are criticized for environmental release of mercury &lt;ref name="oceana"&gt;[http://www.oceana.org/index.php?id=1707 Chlorine Plants: Major, Overlooked Source of Mercury Pollution, ''Oceana'']&lt;/ref&gt; leading in some cases to severe [[mercury poisoning]] as occurred in [[Ontario Minamata disease]]. Due to these concerns, mercury cell plants are being phased out, and a sustained effort is being made to reduce mercury emissions from existing plants.&lt;ref name="wcc"&gt;[http://www.chem.unep.ch/Mercury/partnerships/progress-reports/WCC%20Submission.pdf WCC Submission to United Nations Environment Program on Reduction of Mercury in the Chlor-alkali sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525111624/http://www.chem.unep.ch/Mercury/partnerships/progress-reports/WCC%20Submission.pdf |date=2011-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process details==
[[Image:HgNaOHElectrolysis.png|thumb|400px|right|Castner–Kellner apparatus]]
The apparatus shown is divided into two types of cells separated by [[slate]] walls. The first type, shown on the right and left of the diagram, uses an electrolyte of sodium chloride solution, a [[graphite]] [[anode]] (A), and a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[cathode]] (M). The other type of cell, shown in the center of the diagram, uses an electrolyte of [[sodium hydroxide]] solution, a mercury anode (M), and an iron cathode (D). The mercury electrode is common between the two cells. This is achieved by having the walls separating the cells dip below the level of the electrolytes but still allow the mercury to flow beneath them.&lt;ref name="newell"&gt;Newell, Lyman C.; ''Descriptive Chemistry'' p. 291; D. C. Heath and company, 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction at anode (A) is:

:Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →1/2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The [[chlorine]] gas that results vents at the top of the outside cells where it is collected as a byproduct of the process. The reaction at the mercury cathode in the outer cells is

:Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Na (amalgam)

The [[sodium]] metal formed by this reaction dissolves in the mercury to form an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]. The mercury conducts the current from the outside cells to the center cell. In addition, a rocking mechanism (B shown by fulcrum on the left and rotating eccentric on the right) agitates the mercury to transport the dissolved sodium metal from the outside cells to the center cell.

The anode reaction in the center cell takes place at the interface between the mercury and the sodium hydroxide solution.

:2Na (amalgam) → 2Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Finally at the iron cathode (D) of the center cell the reaction is

:2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The net effect is that the concentration of sodium chloride in the outside cells decreases and the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the center cell increases. As the process continues some sodium hydroxide solution is withdrawn from center cell as output product and is replaced with water. Sodium chloride is added to the outside cells to replace what has been electrolyzed.

'''Costas Kondylis''' (1940 – August 18, 2018) was an American [[architect]]. He designed over 85 buildings in [[New York City]], many of them for real-estate developer and future U.S. president [[Donald Trump]], through his eponymous [[architectural firm]].&lt;ref name=" kathryn 2018"&gt;{{cite web | author= kathryn | title=Costas Kondylis, the "developer's architect," dies at 78 | website=The Real Deal New York | date=August 17, 2018 | url=https://therealdeal.com/2018/08/17/costas-kondylis-the-developers-architect-dies-at-78/ | access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kondylis was born in Burundi, though his parents were from [[Greece]]; he ultimately ended up attending boarding school there. He attained master's degrees at the [[University of Geneva]] and at [[Columbia University]]. After receiving his master's degrees in 1967, Kondylis worked at [[Davis Brody &amp; Associates]], and then at [[Philip Birnbaum &amp; Associates]]. In 1989, Kondylis created '''Costas Kondylis and Partners'''; the firm's work was featured in several magazines&lt;ref&gt;Marino, Vivian (November 3, 2011).

Kondylis was known for his conventional designs of skyscrapers in Manhattan, at a time when developers were either building low-rises or unconventional high-rises.&lt;ref name="Pogrebin 2007"/&gt; He created several dozen residential towers in Manhattan over the course of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=New York Magazine | publisher=New York Media, LLC | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NuECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 | language=en | access-date=August 21, 2018 | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pogrebin 2007"/&gt; From 2000 to 2007, it was estimated that he designed one residential building in Manhattan every six weeks on average.&lt;ref name=" kathryn 2018"/&gt; A 2007 ''New York Times'' profile noted that Kondylis had designed 75 projects in New York City and was designing 15 more at the time.&lt;ref name="Pogrebin 2007"&gt;{{cite web | last=Pogrebin | first=Robin | title=Costas Kondylis - Architecture | website=The New York Times | date=February 5, 2007 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/05/arts/design/05arch.html | access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Kondylis's projects were controversial. The 90-story [[Trump World Tower]] in [[Kips Bay, Manhattan]], New York City, was opposed by nearby residents and the [[United Nations]], whose [[Headquarters of the United Nations|headquarters]] were located nearby.&lt;ref name=" kathryn 2018"/&gt; However, the tower was built without further controversy.&lt;ref name="Plitt 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Plitt | first=Amy | title=Architect Costas Kondylis dies at 78 | website=Curbed NY | date=August 20, 2018 | url=https://ny.curbed.com/2018/8/20/17757776/nyc-architecture-costas-kondylis-donald-trump | access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7859">'''The Euro Alliance of Payment Schemes (EAPS)''' was an international alliance of [[Europe]]an bank and [[interbank network]]s that had aimed to creating a [[pan-Europe]]an [[debit card]] system in the [[Single Euro Payments Area]] to rival [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[Mastercard]] using existing country specific systems.  It was launched in 2007 with the support of the [[European Union]] but failed and was abandoned sometime after 2013.&lt;ref name=abandon&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.emerchantbroker.com/blog/payments-competition-in-the-world-high-risk-payment-processing/ |title=Payments Competition In The World of High Risk Payment Processing |date=March 24, 2017 |publisher=EMB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to European Card Review in 2007, EAPS was expected to play a less pivotal role in spreading the [[Single Euro Payments Area]] initiative than larger schemes such as the "Falkensteiner Group" which they believed to include [[UniCredit]], [[Société Générale]], [[ING Group|ING]] and [[Deutsche Bank]], but was nevertheless capable of a "marginal" role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeancardreview.com/CardNotes/CardNotes_01.html Debit cards: pressure continues for third scheme in Europe] (2007) European Card Review. Retrieved 2008-08-04  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726191042/http://www.europeancardreview.com/CardNotes/CardNotes_01.html |date=July 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Falkensteiner Runde" (''Falkensteiner Circle'') - according to the Lafferty Group to consist of [[ABN AMRO]], Allianz Dresdner, [[ING Bank]], [[Rabobank]], [[UniCredit]],
[[Deutsche Bank]], [[Société Générale]] and [[Commerzbank]] - was discussing an alternative interbank network based on the German [[Girocard]] network joined by the French [[Carte Bancaire]] network.&lt;ref name="paysys2008"&gt;[http://www.paysys.de/download/SepaJan08.pdf "PaySys SEPA Newsletter - Jan. 2008"]&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time in early 2007 another initiative was formed in the "PayFair" company in Brussels to implement the European Payment Scheme.&lt;ref name="paysys2008" /&gt; This effort was building an infrastructure from scratch focussing at first to rebuild the [[Point of sale|POS]] (i.e. non-bank) infrastructure in Belgium and Netherlands as of 2008 and expanded to Germany during 2010 via "easycash" terminals.&lt;ref name="paysys2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="db2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payfair.eu/news/ PayFair news], "22 Sept 2009 - EasyCash, key PayFair partner in Germany" Bergisch Gladbach&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2008, the "Monnet Project" was unveiled in Frankfurt in 2009 listing the same members as reported earlier on the Falkensteiner Circle.&lt;ref name="db2009"&gt;[http://www.dbresearch.de/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_DE-PROD/PROD0000000000244256.pdf "SEPA: Changing times for payments", Deutsche Bank Research, July 27, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="monnet2010"/&gt; Later reports cite these three elements - Monnet Project, PayFair scheme, EAPS council - as the driving forces behind SEPA-centric alternatives for debit card networks.&lt;ref name="mccaughey2010"&gt;[http://www.card-alliance.eu/assets/Uploads/Download-News/2010-01-10-Extract-from-Lafferty-Cards-Insider.pdf "A grand scheme"], Interview with EAPS board chairman Ugo Bechis, by Ronan McCaughey, 1. January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile the EAPS announced the bilateral cooperation of ATM interbank networks, namely the German Girocard acceptance at Italian Bancomat ATMs,&lt;ref name="bancomat"&gt;http://www.card-alliance.eu/assets/2009-08-27-Bancomat-and-girocard-connected.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Bancomat card acceptance at German Girocard ATMs&lt;ref name="bancomat"/&gt; and German Girocard acceptance at UK LINK ATMs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.card-alliance.eu/assets/Uploads/Download-News/2010-07-12-EAPS-LINK-ZKA-Cooperation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Independently the European savings banks had created the pan-European [[Eufiserv|EUFISERV]] network to mutually accept debit cards at their ATMs - Eufiserv was a founder of the EAPS council.

On May 5, 2010 the Monnet Project held a meeting in Madrid to endorse a European Card Project. From the 30 banks that were attending it occurred that 12 banks from 8 countries volunteered to join a consortium phase to detail the technical requirements and to prepare treaties on the foundation of a new bankcard payment company.&lt;ref name="info2010"&gt;[http://www.dbgcm.db.com/wms//customers/dbfk_SEPA/pdf/12_SEPA_What_s_New_German_v0.7.pdf "Infobrief SEPA – Euro-Zahlungsverkehr - Nr.12"], May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ECB welcomed these steps pointing to the [[China UnionPay]] example that a new bankcard brand can quickly gain acceptance with China UnionPay being accepted in 29 European countries plus 60 more countries worldwide)&lt;ref name="ecb2010"&gt;[http://www.ecb.eu/press/key/date/2010/html/sp100505.en.html "SEPA for cards: more than a symbol of SEPA’s success"], Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Monnet Symposium organised by The Monnet Project, Madrid, 5 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was predicted that by 2010 the results of the consortium phase would lead into a definite decision to build a new bankcard infrastructure, this was not to be the case.&lt;ref name="monnet2010"&gt;[http://www.fbf.fr/web/internet/content_presse.nsf/%28WebPageList%29/55D8698EF2868B8CC125771B0054C9E1 "PROJET MONNET - Une vingtaine de banques européennes prévoient de créer un nouveau système de cartes bancaires en Europe"], press release, 6. May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="info2010" /&gt;

The project failed and was abandoned at some time after this.&lt;ref name=abandon&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''False advertising''' is the use of false, misleading, or unproven information to advertise products to [[consumer]]s or advertising that does not disclose its source.&lt;ref name="AMAdef"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary 'Deceptive advertising'|url=https://www.ama.org/resources/Pages/Dictionary.aspx?dLetter=D|website=American Marketing Association|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://consumer.laws.com/deceptive-advertising/deceptive-advertising-definition|title=Deceptive Advertising Definition - Consumer {{!}} Laws.com|website=consumer.laws.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One form of false advertising is to claim that a product has a [[health benefit (medicine)|health benefit]] or contains vitamins or minerals that it in fact does not.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10431119|title=Ribena-maker fined $217,500 for misleading vitamin C ads|date=2007-03-27|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments use regulations to control false advertising. A false advertisement can further be classified as deceptive if the advertiser deliberately misleads the consumer, as opposed to making an honest mistake.

== Types of deception ==

===Photo retouching===

Often used in cosmetic and [[weight loss]] [[commercials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14304802|title=Airbrushed make-up ads banned for 'misleading'|last=|first=|date=2011|website=BBC News|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; these adverts portray false and unobtainable results to the consumer and give a false impression of the product's true capabilities. If retouching is not discovered or fixed, a company can be at a competitive advantage with consumers purchasing their seemingly more effective product, thus leaving competitors at a loss.

Advertisers for weight loss products may also employ athletes who are recovering from injuries for "[[before and after demonstration|before and after]]" demonstrations.

===Omitting information===

An ad may omit or skim over important information. The ad's claims may be technically true, but the ad does not include information that a reasonable person would consider relevant. For example, TV advertisements for prescription drugs may technically fulfill a regulatory requirement by displaying side-effects in a small font at the end of the ad, or have a "speed-talker" list them. This practice was prevalent in the United States in the recent past.

===Hidden fees and surcharges===
Hidden fees can be a way for companies to trick the unwary consumer into paying excess fees (for example tax, shipping fees, insurance etc.) on a product that was advertised at a specific price as a way to increase profit without raising the price on the actual item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/marketing/textbooks/boundless-marketing-textbook/pricing-8/pricing-legal-concerns-65/illegal-price-advertising-327-4069/ |title=Illegal Price Advertising |website=Boundless.com |date=2015-07-21 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fraud.laws.com/false-adversiting/surcharges-and-hidden-fees |title=Surcharges And Hidden Fees - Fraud &amp;#124; Laws.com |website=Fraud.laws.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common form of hidden fees and surcharges is "[[fine print]]" in advertising. Another way to hide fees that is commonly used is to not include "shipping fees" into the price of goods online. This makes an item look cheaper than it is once the shipping cost is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/fair-trading/fair-trading-act-fact-sheets/add-ons-and-hidden-fees/ |title=Add-ons and hidden fees &amp;#124; Commerce Commission |website=Comcom.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2366389/Scams-cons-TRUE-cost-budget-flight-How-dreams-bargain-holiday-spoiled-unsavoury-added-extras.html|title=Scams, cons and the TRUE cost of your budget flight: How our dreams of a bargain holiday are spoiled by unsavoury added extras|last=|first=|date=17 July 2013|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many hotels charge mandatory "[[resort fee]]s" that are not typically included in the advertised base price of the room.

===Manipulation of measurement units and standards===
Manipulation of measurement units and standards can be described as a seller deceiving customers by informing them with facts that either are not true or are using a standard or standards that wouldn’t be widely used or understood which results in the customer being misinformed or confused.

===Fillers and oversized packaging===
Some products are sold with [[filler (animal food)|filler]]s, which increase the legal weight of the product with something that costs the producer very little compared to what the consumer thinks that he or she is buying. Food is an example of this, where meat is injected with [[broth]] or even [[brine]] (up to 15%), or [[TV dinner]]s are filled with gravy or other sauce instead of meat. [[Malt]] and [[ham]] have been used as filler in [[peanut butter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wallechinsky | first = David | title = The People's Almanac | publisher = Doubleday | location = Garden City | year = 1975 | isbn = 0-385-04060-1 | page = 1010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also non-meat fillers which may look starchy in their makeup; they are high in carbohydrate and low in nutritional value. One example is known as a cereal binder and usually contains some combination of flours and oatmeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/food-fillers-101.htm|title=Food Fillers 101|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some products may have a large container where most of the space is empty, leading the consumer to believe that the total amount of food is greater than it actually is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/prosecutors-659218-unilever-county.html|title=O.C.

===Misleading health claims===
The words “Diet, low fat, [[sugar-free]], healthy and good for you” are labels they may see every day and they associate these labels with products that will aid a healthy lifestyle. It seems advertisers are aware of their needs to live longer and live well so they are adapting their products in accordance with this. It is suggested that [[food advertising]] influences consumer preferences and shopping habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://handbook.vla.vic.gov.au/handbook/16-applying-for-grant-of-legal-assistance/giving-false-information-or-omitting-relevant-information-in-application|title=Giving false information or omitting relevant information in the application|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Victoria Legal Aid|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by highlighting certain contents or ingredients is misleading consumers into thinking they are buying healthy when in fact they are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1011/11rp09|title=Marketing obesity?

Many large food companies are going to court after using misleading tactics like these:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/fat-free-and-100-natural-seven-food-labelling-tricks-exposed-25143|title=Fat free and 100% natural: seven food labeling tricks exposed|last=Jones|first=S.,|date=2014|website=The Conversation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using a tick panel above the [[Nutritional Labeling and Education Act|nutritional label]] and using large, bold font and brighter colors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Highlighting one healthy ingredient on the front of the packet with a big tick next to it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Using words like ''healthy'' and ''natural'' which are weasel claims – words that contradict the claims that may follow it. These are commonly used words where the meaning can be overlooked by consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Regulation/Heinz-is-latest-target-in-new-wave-of-false-advertising-lawsuits-over-all-natural-claims-and-GMOs|title=Heinz is latest target in new wave of false advertising lawsuits over ‘all natural’ claims and GMOs|last=Watson|first=E.,|date=2014|website=Food Navigator-USA. com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using words like ''help'' on the product labeling, misleading consumers into thinking it ‘will’ help.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/big-food-lobbying-tip-of-the-iceberg-exposed-23232|title=Big Food lobbying: tip of the iceberg exposed|first=Gary|last=Sacks|date=|website=TheConversation.com|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this is not always the case. There has been an increase in the number of large organizations going to court over misleading claims, stating that products are ‘school canteen approved’ or ‘all natural,’ hence claiming their products are healthy or only uses natural ingredients, but this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-11/two-junk-food-giants-fined-over-misleading-kids-health-food/7586108|title=Consumer watchdog fines junk food giants over misleading 'healthy' kids food|last=Lannin|first=S.,|date=2016|website=ABC NEWS|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Puffing ==
Puffing or ''[[puffery]]'' is the act of exaggerating a product's worth through the use of meaningless unsubstantiated terms, based on opinion rather than fact.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calderwood|first=James|date=1998|title=False &amp; deceptive advertising|url=|journal=Ceramic Industry|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include many superlatives and statements such as “greatest of all time”, “best in town” and “out of this world” or a restaurant claiming it had "the world’s best tasting food".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsieh Hsu Fang|first=Ching-Sheng Ya-Hui Wen-Chang|date=2010|title=The Relationship Between Deceptive Claims and Ad Effect: The Moderating Role of Humorous Ads|url=|journal=International Journal of Business and Information|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically puffing is not an illegal form of false advertising and can be looked at as a humorous way to grab and attract the attention of the consumer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Puffing may be able to be used as a defense against charges of deceptive advertising when it is formatted as an opinion rather than a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandran|first=Ravi|date=2004|title=CONSUMER PROTECTION (FAIR TRADING) ACT|url=|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it can also be used as a defense for misleading or deceptive advertising. For example, claims like ‘Top Quality’ can have regulatory and legal consequences and can be looked at as illegal misrepresentation, if not supported through the products capabilities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lysonski Duffy|first=Steven Michael F|date=1992|title=The New Zealand Fair Trading ACt of 1986: Deceptive Advertising|url=|journal=The Journal of Consumer Affairs|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toncar Fetscherin|first=Mark Marc|date=2012|title=A study of visual puffery in fragrance advertising|url=|journal=European Journal of Marketing|doi=10.1108/03090561211189239|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulation of terms===
[[File:Listerine advertisement, 1932.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Listerine]] advertisement, 1932. The FTC found that the claim of these advertisements, reduced likelihood of catching cold, was false.]]
Many terms have imprecise meanings. Depending on the jurisdiction, "[[organic food|organic]]" food may not have a clear legal definition, and "light" food has been variously used to mean low in [[calorie]]s, [[sugar]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[table salt|salt]], [[texture (food)|texture]], [[viscosity]], or even light in color. Labels such as "all-natural" are frequently used but are essentially meaningless in a legal sense.

Tobacco companies, for many years,{{When|date=September 2017}} used terms like ''low tar'', ''light'', ''ultra-light'' and ''mild'' in order to imply that products with such labels had less [[Health effects of tobacco|detrimental effects on health]], but in recent years{{When|date=September 2017}} the United States has banned manufacturers from labeling tobacco products with these terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |title=Light, Low, Mild or Similar Descriptors |url=http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/Labeling/ucm2023661.htm |date=22 June 2010 |access-date=12 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the US [[United Egg Producers]]' used an "Animal Care Certified" logo on [[egg carton]]s, the [[Better Business Bureau]] argued that it misled consumers by conveying a higher sense of [[animal husbandry|animal care]] than was actually the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/04/business/media/egg-producers-relent-on-industry-seal.html | work=The New York Times | title=Egg Producers Relent on Industry Seal | first=Alexei | last=Barrionuevo | date=4 October 2005 | access-date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Kellogg's [[Rice Krispies]] cereal claimed that the cereal can improve a child’s immunity. The company was forced to discontinue all advertising stating such claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/04/kellogg-settles-rice-krispies-false-ad-case/|title=Kellogg settles Rice Krispies false ad case|access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the same company advertised their Kashi product as “all natural”, when it contained a variety of synthetic and artificial ingredients; Kellogg's paid $5 million to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/suit-prompts-kelloggs-drop-natural-labels-kashi-products-n100391|title= Suit Prompts Kellogg's to Drop "Natural" Labels on Kashi Products|website=NBC|language=en-US|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incomplete comparison===
{{Main article|Incomplete comparison}}
"Better" means one item is superior to another in some way, while "best" means it is superior to all others in some way. However, advertisers frequently fail to list the way in each they are being compared (price, size, quality, etc.) and, in the case of "better", to what they are comparing (a competitor's product, an earlier version of their own product, or nothing at all). So, without defining how they are using the terms ''better'' and ''best'', the terms become meaningless. An ad which claims "Our cold medicine is better" could be just saying it is an improvement over taking nothing at all. Another often-seen example of this ploy is "better than the leading brand" often with some statistic attached, while the leading brand is often left undefined.

===Inconsistent comparison===
{{Main article|Inconsistent comparison}}
In an inconsistent comparison, an item is compared with many others, but only compared with each on the attributes where it wins, leaving the false impression that it is the best of all products, in all ways. One variation on this theme is web sites which also list some competitor prices for any given search, but do not list those competitors which beat their price (or the web site might compare their own sale prices with the regular prices offered by their competitors).

===Misleading illustrations===
One common example is that of [[serving suggestion]] pictures on food product boxes, which show additional ingredients beyond those included in the package. Although the "serving suggestion" disclaimer is a legal requirement of an illustration which includes items not included in the purchase, if a customer fails to notice or understand this caption, they may incorrectly assume that all depicted items are all included.

In some advertised images of [[hamburger]]s, every ingredient is visible from the side shown in the advertisement, giving the impression that they are larger than they really are.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Products which are sold unassembled or unfinished may also have a picture of the finished product, without a corresponding picture of what the customer is actually buying.

Commercials for certain video games include trailers that are essentially CGI short-films - with graphics of a much higher caliber than the actual game.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===False coloring===
“The color of food packaging is considered to be extremely important in the marketing world” (Blackbird, Fox &amp; Tornetta, 2013) as people see color before they absorb anything else. Consumers buy items based on the color they’ve seen it on the advertisement and they have a perception of what the packaging colors should also look like. However, when it comes to buying food, usually consumers can only judge the product based on the packaging and usually consumers judge products based on color.

When used to make people think food is riper, fresher, or otherwise healthier than it really is, [[food coloring]] can be a form of deception. When combined with added sugar or corn syrup, bright colors give the subconscious impression of healthy, ripe fruit, full of [[antioxidant]]s and [[phytochemical]]s.

One variation is packaging which obscures the true color of the foods contained within, such as red mesh bags containing yellow oranges or grapefruit, which then appear to be a ripe orange or red. Regularly stirring minced meat on sale at a deli can also make the meat on the surface stay red, causing it to appear fresh, while it would quickly oxidize and brown, showing its true age, if left unstirred. Some sodas are also sold in colored bottles, when the actual product is clear.

===Angel dusting===
[[Angel dusting]] is a process where an ingredient which would be beneficial, in a reasonable quantity, is instead added in an insignificant quantity which will have no consumer benefit, so they can make the claim that it contains that ingredient, and mislead the consumer into expecting that they will gain the benefit. For example, a cereal may claim it contains "12 essential vitamins and minerals", but the amounts of each may be only 1% or less of the [[Reference Daily Intake]], providing virtually no benefit to nutrition.

==="Chemical free"===
{{main|Chemical free}}
Many products come with some form of the statement "chemical free!" or "no chemicals!". As everything on Earth, save a few elementary particles formed by [[radioactive decay]] or present in minute quantities from [[solar wind]] and sunlight, is made of [[chemicals]], it is impossible to have a chemical free product. The intention of this message is often to indicate the product contains no synthetic or exceptionally harmful chemicals, but as the word chemical itself has a stigma, it is often used without clarification.

===Bait-and-switch===
{{main article|Bait-and-switch}}
Bait-and-switch is a deceptive form of advertising or marketing tactic generally used to lure in customers into the store. A company will advertise their product at a very cheap and enticing price which will attract the customers (bait). However, the product the customer seeks is not available for various reasons, such as the company only having a limited quantity of product available for sale which was quickly sold out (switch). After which, the store/company will then try to sell something that is more expensive and valuable than what they originally advertised (upsell). Regardless of the fact that only a small percentage of the shoppers will actually buy the more expensive product, the advertiser using the bait remains to gain profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bait-switch.asp |title=Bait And Switch Definition |website=Investopedia |date=2014-04-11 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bait advertising is also commonly used in other contexts, for example, in online job advertisements by deceiving the potential candidate about working conditions, pay, or different variables. Airlines may be guilty of "baiting" their potential clients with a bargains, then increase the cost or change the notice to be that of a considerably more costly flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1407/bait-advertising|title=What is Bait Advertising? - Definition from Techopedia|author=|date=|website=Techopedia.com|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses are asked to remember a few guidelines to avoid charges of misleading or deceptive conduct:
* Reasonable timeframe, reasonable quantities - Businesses must supply publicized merchandise or services at the promoted cost for a sensible or expressed timeframe and in sensible or expressed amounts. There is no exact meaning of what is implied by a 'sensible timeframe' or 'sensible amounts'. 
* Qualifying statements - General qualifying statements, for example, 'in store and online now' could at present still leave a business open to charges of bait advertising if sensible amounts of the publicized item are not accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.nt.gov.au/ForConsumers/Youth/BuyingStuff/Pages/Bait-Advertising.aspx |title=Bait Advertising - Department of the Attorney-General and Justice - NT Consumer Affairs |website=Consumeraffairs.nt.gov.au |date=2016-01-06 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Advertising deadlines - Companies need to have good grounds to trust that the merchandise will be accessible
* Rain checks - When, through no shortcoming of its own, a business can't supply merchandise or services as promoted companies ought to have a framework set up to supply or acquire the supply of the merchandise or benefits at the promoted cost as quickly as time permits.
* Online claims - If a company is an online-based company, it is essential for them to keep everything on their website updated to avoid misleading customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/fair-trading/fair-trading-act-fact-sheets/bait-advertising/ |title=Bait advertising &amp;#124; Commerce Commission |website=Comcom.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries bait advertising can result in severe penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.mtansw.com.au/13/feb/files/BaitAdvertising.pdf |format=PDF |title=Misleading and Deceptive Conduct: Bait Advertising |website=Journal.mtansw.com.au |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guarantee without a remedy specified===
If a company does not say what they will do if the product fails to meet expectations, then they are free to do very little. This is due to a [[legal technicality]] that states that a [[contract]] cannot be enforced unless it provides a basis not only for determining a breach but also for giving a remedy in the event of a breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Restatement (Second) of Contracts §33 | url = http://lexinter.net/LOTWVers4/certainty.htm|website=Lexinter.net | access-date = June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="No risk"===
Advertisers frequently claim there is no risk to trying their product, when clearly there is. For example, they may charge the customer's credit card for the product, offering a full refund if not satisfied. However, the risks of such an offer are numerous. Customers may not get the product at all, they may be billed for things they did not want, they may need to call the company to authorize a return and be unable to do so, they may not be refunded the shipping and handling costs, or they may be responsible for the return shipping.

Similarly, a ‘free trial’ is an advertising manoeuvre to have consumers become hands-on with the products or services before purchase, without any money spent but a free trial in exchange for credit cards details cannot be stated as a free trial, as there is a component of expenditure.&lt;ref name="eighmey"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eighmey | first1 = J | year = 2014 | title = My Experience as Deputy Assistant Director for National Advertising at the Federal Trade Commission | url = | journal = Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 202–204 | doi=10.1509/jppm.14.ftc.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2753/JOA0091-3367380106| title = The Current State of Advertising Ethics: Industry and Academic Perspectives| journal = Journal of Advertising| volume = 38| pages = 83| year = 2009| last1 = Drumwright| first1 = Minette E.| last2 = Murphy| first2 = Patrick E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceptance by default===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}This refers to a contract or agreement where no response is interpreted as a positive response in favor of the business. An example of this is where a customer must explicitly "opt out" of a particular feature or service, or be charged for that feature or service. Another example is where a subscription automatically renews unless the customer explicitly requests it to stop.

==Regulation and enforcement==

=== United States ===
In the United States, the federal government regulates advertising through the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC),&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally enables private litigation through various statutes, most significantly the [[Lanham Act]] (trademark and unfair competition).

The goal is prevention rather than punishment, reflecting the purpose of civil law in setting things right rather than that of criminal law. The typical sanction is to order the advertiser to stop its illegal acts, or to include disclosure of additional information that serves to avoid the chance of deception. Corrective advertising may be mandated,&lt;ref&gt;Johar, Gita, "Intended and Unintended Effects of Corrective Advertising on Beliefs and Evaluations: An Exploratory Analysis", Journal of Consumer Psychology, 1996, 5(3), 209-230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johar | first1 = Gita Venkataramani | authorlink = Gita Johar | last2 = Simmons | first2 = Carolyn J. | year = 2000 | title = The Use of Concurrent Disclosures to Correct Invalid Inferences | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 307–322 | doi=10.1086/209565}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no fines or prison time except for the infrequent instances when an advertiser refuses to stop despite being ordered to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, ''id''; ''Policy Statement on Deception'', 103 FTC Decisions 110 (1984), appendix to ''Cliffdale Associates''; originally a letter from FTC Chairman James C. Miller to Rep. John D. Dingell (October 14, 1983). For the history of changing from deception to deceptiveness as the standard, see Preston, Ivan L., ''The Great American Blow-Up: Puffery in Advertising and Selling'', [[University of Wisconsin Press]], revised ed. (1996), at Ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 and 2014, the United States Supreme Court reviewed two false advertising cases: ''[[Static Control v. Lexmark]]'' (concerning who has standing to sue under the Lanham Act for false advertising) and ''[[POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.]]''.

State governments have a variety of unfair competition laws, which regulate false advertising, trademarks, and related issues. Many are very similar to that of the FTC, and in many cases copied so closely that they are known as "Little FTC Acts."&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. N.Y. ISC. Law §§ 2401-2409.&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, one such statute is the [[California Unfair Competition Law|Unfair Competition Law]] (UCL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/CIV/5/d3/4/1.5/3/s1770|title=California Civil Code - CIV § 1770 - FindLaw|work=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCL “borrows heavily from section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act” but has developed its own body of case law.&lt;ref&gt;California Antitrust &amp; Unfair Competition Law (Third), Volume 2: Unfair Competition (State Bar of California, 2003 Daniel Mogin &amp; Danielle S. Fitzpatrick, eds.) at pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Advertising in the UK is managed under the [[Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008]]&lt;ref name="ot2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/284442/oft1008.pdf|title=Office of Trading. (2008). Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading. Department of Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. United Kingdom Government.|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CPR), effectively the successor to the [[Trade Descriptions Act 1968]]. It is designed to implement the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], part of a common set of European minimum standards for consumer protection and legally bind advertisers in England, Scotland, Wales and parts of Ireland.&lt;ref name="eighmey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ot2008"/&gt; These regulations focus on ''business to consumer'' interactions. These are modelled by a table used for assessing unfairness, evaluations being made against four tests expressed in the regulations that indicate deceptive advertising: 
* ''Contrary to the requirements of professional diligence'' 
* ''False or deceptive practice in relation to a specific list of key factors'' 
* ''Omission of material information (unclear or untimely information)'' 
* ''Aggressive practice by harassment, coercion or undue influence'' 
These factors of deceptive advertising are critically analysed as they may crucially impair a consumer's ability to make an informed decision, thereby limiting their freedom of choice.

This system resembles American practice as reflected by the [[FTC regulation of behavioral advertising|FTC]] in terms of disallowing false and deceptive messaging, prohibition of unfair and unethical commercial practices and omitting important information, but it differs in ''monitoring aggressive sales practices'' (regulation seven) which included high-pressure sales practices that go beyond persuasion. Harassment and coercion are not defined but rather interpreted as any undue physical and psychological pressure (in advertising).

Even if proven cases of false advertising do not inevitably result in civil or criminal repercussions: the [[Office of Fair Trading]] states ''in the instance of false advertising, companies are not always faced with civil and criminal repercussions, it is based on the seriousness of the infringement'' and each case is analysed individually, allowing the standards authority to promote compliance with regards to their enforcement policies, priorities and available resources. Another area of departure from American practice relates to a ''general prohibition on the use of competitors' logotypes, trademarks or similar copy to that used in a competitor's own advertising by another, particularly when making a comparison''.

Under CPR legislation, there are different standards authorities for each country:
* In England and Wales, standards offences are handled by the [[Trading Standards|Local Authority Trading Standards Services]] (TSS) 
* In Northern Ireland by the [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]] 
* In Scotland, offences are evaluated by. and potentially prosecuted through, the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|Crown Office and the Procurator Fiscal Service]] on behalf of the [[Lord Advocate]].

=== Australia ===
In Australia, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also known as the ACCC, are responsible for ensuring all businesses and consumers act in accordance with the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Act 2010, as well as'','' fair trade and consumer protection laws (ACCC, 2016).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/advertising-selling/advertising-and-selling-guide/avoid-misleading-or-deceptive-claims-or-conduct/misleading-or-deceptive-conduct.|title=Advertising and selling guide|last=|first=|date=October 24, 2016|website=Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACCC is designed to assist both consumers, businesses, industries and infrastructure within the country. The ACCC assists the consumer by making available the rights, regulations, obligations and procedures; for refund and return, complaints, faulty products and guarantees of products and services. They also assist businesses and industries by developing clear laws and guidelines in relation to unfair practices and misleading or deceptive conduct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are many similarities in the laws and regulation between the Australian ACCC, the New Zealand FTA, the American FCT and United Kingdom CPR. The structure of these policies is to support fair trade and competition alongside offering the consumers exactly what they are selling, in order to reduce deceptive and false practices. However, it is not limited to these countries, as most countries have agreements with the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network or ICPEN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icpen.org/|title=International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network|last=|first=|date=October 24, 2016|website=ICPEN|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, the [[Fair Trading Act 1986]] aims to promote fair competition and trading in the country.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/fair-trading/fair-trading-act-fact-sheets/what-is-the-fair-trading-act/|title=What is the Fair Trading Act ... {{!}} Commerce Commission|website=www.comcom.govt.nz|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/the-commission/about-us/|title=About us {{!}} Commerce Commission|website=www.comcom.govt.nz|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The act prohibits certain conduct in trade, provides for the disclosure of information available to the consumer relating to the supply of goods and services and promotes product safety. Although the Act does not require businesses to provide all information to consumers in every circumstances, businesses are obliged to ensure the information they do provide is accurate, and important information is not kept from consumers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/fair-trading-act|title=Fair trading act|website=Consumer NZ|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of selling methods that intend to mislead the consumer are illegal under the Fair Trading Act:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The Act also applies to certain activities whether or not the parties are 'in trade' – such as employment advertising, pyramid selling, and the supply of products covered by product safety and consumer information standards.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Both consumers and businesses alike can rely on and take their own legal action under the Act. Consumers may contact the trader and utilize their rights which have been stated in the Act to make headway with the trader. If the issues are not resolved, the consumer or anyone else can take actions under the Act. The [[Commerce Commission]] is also empowered to take enforcement action and will do so when allegations are sufficiently serious to meet its enforcement criteria.

Additionally, there are currently five consumer information standards:&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
* Country of Origin (Clothing and Footwear) Labeling – Regulations 1992
* Fibre Content Labeling - Regulations 2000
* Used Motor Vehicles - Regulations 2008
* Water Efficiency - Regulations 2010

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7457">'''Industry classification''' or '''industry taxonomy''' is a type of [[economic taxonomy]] that organizes companies into industrial groupings based on similar production processes, similar products, or similar behavior in financial markets.

Many are used by [[national statistical agencies|national and international statistical agencies]] to summarize economic conditions. They are also used by [[securities analyst]]s to understand common forces acting on groups of companies, to compare companies' performance to their peers', and to construct either specialized or diversified portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;MSCI Barra, "Frequently Asked Questions about GICS" [https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/5973a128-47f0-4317-b083-716a10207b50]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sectors and industries ==
Industries can be classified in a variety of ways. At the top level, industry is often classified according to the [[three-sector theory]] into [[economic sector|sectors]]: [[primary sector of the economy|primary]] (extractive), [[secondary sector of the economy|secondary]] (manufacturing), and [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary]] (services). Some authors add [[quaternary sector of the economy|quaternary]] (knowledge) or even [[quinary sector of the economy|quinary]] (culture and research) sectors. Over time, the fraction of a society's industry within each sector changes.

Below the economic sectors are more detailed classifications. They commonly divide industries according to similar functions and markets and identify businesses producing related products.

Industries can also be identified by product, such as: [[Construction|construction industry]], [[chemical industry]], [[petroleum industry]], [[automotive industry]], [[consumer electronics|electronic industry]], [[power engineering]] and [[Electricity generation|power manufacturing]] (such as gas or wind turbines), [[meatpacking industry]], [[hospitality industry]], [[food industry]], [[fish industry]], [[software industry]], [[paper industry]], [[entertainment industry]], [[semiconductor industry]], [[cultural industry]], and [[poverty industry]].

[[Market (economics)|Market]]-based classification systems such as the [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] and the [[Industry Classification Benchmark]] are used in [[finance]] and [[market research]].

== List of classifications ==

A wide variety of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] is in use, sponsored by different organizations and based on different criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Standard &amp; Poor's, "What's an Industry" [http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/products/GCC3Q2004.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iran Venezuela Bi-National Bank''' ({{lang-fa|بانک مشترک ایران و ونزوئلا}}, {{lang-es|Banco Binacional Irán-Venezuela}}) is an [[international financial institution]] that was founded in 2010 with an aim to develop commercial ties between [[Iran]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Norman A.|date=February 2012|title=Iran's Venezuelan Gateway|url=http://www.hacer.org/pdf/HHRG1122.pdf|journal=Iran Strategy Brief|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It started as a [[joint venture]] between two state-owned banks, [[Banco Industrial de Venezuela]] and [[Export Development Bank of Iran]] with a starting capital of $200 million offered equally by both parties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-business-and-markets/65918/5-foreign-banks-licensed-by-iran|title=5 Foreign Banks Licensed by Iran|date=2017-06-06|work=Financial Tribune|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] imposed sanction on the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-oil-sanctions/u-s-blacklists-firms-for-evading-iran-oil-sale-sanctions-idUSBRE94814Q20130509|title=U.S. blacklists firms for evading Iran oil sale sanctions|last=Gardner|first=Timothy|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, an official in the [[Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] told press that "[the] bank is not given much freedom" and it is being managed one-sidedly by Iran, because the Venezuelan side does not participate in the general assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.trend.az/iran/business/2427169.html|title=Joint Iran-Venezuela bank not much of a bank: Iran|date=2015-08-25|work=Trend.Az|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, the Iranian side was willing to sell its share.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-business-and-markets/53228/iran-to-sell-shares-in-joint-bank-with-venezuela|title=Iran to Sell Shares in Joint Bank With Venezuela|date=2016-11-08|work=Financial Tribune|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.]]

== Biography ==
Born in [[Kagoshima, Kagoshima|Kagoshima]] to a [[kimono]] merchant, Kawasaki Shōzō became a tradesman at the age of 17 in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], the only place in Japan then open to the West. He started a [[shipping]] business in [[Osaka]] at 27, which failed when his [[cargo ship]] sank during a storm. In 1869, he joined a company handling [[sugar]] from the [[Ryukyu Islands]], established by a [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]] [[samurai]], and in 1893, researched Ryukyu sugar and sea routes to the Ryukyus at the request of the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Ministry of Finance]]. In 1894, he was appointed executive vice president of Japan Mail Steam-Powered Shipping Company,&lt;!-- Nippon Yusen? --&gt;  and succeeded in opening a sea route to the Ryukyu and transporting sugar to mainland Japan.

Having experienced many sea accidents in his life, Kawasaki deepened his trust in Western ships because they were more spacious, stable and faster than typical Japanese ships. At the same time, he became very interested in the modern shipbuilding industry. In April 1876, supported by [[Matsukata Masayoshi]], the Vice Minister of Finance, who was from the same province as Kawasaki, he established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard on borrowed land from the government alongside the Sumida-gawa River, Tsukiji Minami-Iizaka-chō (currently Tsukiji 7-chome, [[Chūō, Tokyo]], a major step forward as a shipbuilder.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. traces its origins to 1878, when Kawasaki Shōzō (川崎 正蔵) established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo, Japan. Eighteen years later, in 1896, it was incorporated as Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8802">'''Marketing engineering''' is currently definded as "a systematic approach to harness data and knowledge to drive effective marketing decision making an implementation through a technology-enabled and model-supported decision process".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/840607615|title=Principles of marketing engineering|last=Arvind.|first=Rangaswamy,|last2=de.|first2=Bruyn, Arnaud|date=2013|publisher=DecisionPro|isbn=0985764805|oclc=840607615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''marketing engineering'' can be traced back to Lilien et al. in "The Age of Marketing Engineering" published in 1998;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ama.org/Archive/ResourceLibrary/MarketingManagement/Pages/1998/7/1/679274.aspx|title=The Age of Marketing Engineering.|website=archive.ama.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this article the authors define ''marketing engineering'' as the use of [[computer]] [[decision model]]s for making [[marketing]] decisions. [[Marketing manager]]s typically use "conceptual marketing", that is they develop a [[mental model]] of the decision situation based on past experience, intuition and reasoning. That approach has its limitations though: experience is unique to every individual, there is no objective way of choosing between the best judgments of multiple individuals in such a situation and furthermore judgment can be influenced by the person position in the [[Hierarchical organization|firm's hierarchy]]. In same year [[Gary Lilien|Lilien G. L.]] and A. Rangaswamy published ''Marketing Engineering: Computer-Assisted Marketing Analysis and Planning'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/731888669|title=Marketing Engineering : computer assisted marketing analysis and planning|last=Arvind.|first=Rangaswamy,|date=2005|publisher=Trafford|isbn=1412022525|oclc=731888669}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fildes and Ventura''&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Operational Research Society, Vol. 51, No. 7 (Jul., 2000), pp. 891–892&lt;/ref&gt; praised the book in their review, while noting that a fuller discussion of [[market share]] models and [[econometric model]]s would have made the book better for teaching and that "conceptual marketing" should not be discarded in the presence of marketing engineering, but that both approaches should be used together. Leeflang and Wittink (2000)&lt;ref&gt;P.S.H. Leeflang, D. R. Wittink, Building models for marketing decisions: Past, present and future, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; have identified five era of model building in marketing:
# (1950-1965) The first era of application of [[operations research]] and [[management science]] to marketing
# (1965-1970) Adaptation of models to fit marketing problems
# (1970-1985) Emphasis on models that are an acceptable representation of reality and are easy to use
# (1985-2000) Increase interest in marketing [[decision support system]]s, [[meta-analyses]] and studies of the generalizability of results
# (2000- .  ) Growth of new exchange systems (ex: [[e-commerce]]) and need for new modeling approaches

How to build market models and how to develop a structured approach to marketing questions has been an issue of active discussion between researchers, L. Lilien and A. Rangaswamy (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lilien|first=Gary L.|last2=Rangaswamy|first2=Arvind|date=2001-06-01|title=The Marketing Engineering Imperative: Introduction to the Special Issue|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.31.3s.1.9679|journal=Interfaces|volume=31|issue=3_supplement|pages=S1–S7|doi=10.1287/inte.31.3s.1.9679|issn=0092-2102}}&lt;/ref&gt; have observed that while having data gives a competitive advantage, having too much data without the models and systems for working with it may turn out to be as bad as not having the data. Lodish (2001) &lt;ref&gt;Leonard M. Lodish, (2001) Building Marketing Models that Make Money. Interfaces 31(3_supplement):S45-S5&lt;/ref&gt; observed that the most complicated and [[mathematical beauty|elegant model]] will not necessarily be the one adopted in the firm, good models are the ones who capture the [[trade-off]]s of [[decision making]], subjective [[estimate]]s may be necessary to complete the model, risk needs to be taken into account, model complexity must be balanced versus ease of understanding, models should integrate tactical with strategic aspects. Migley (2002)&lt;ref&gt;David Migley, What to codify: marketing science or marketing engineering? Marketing theory 2002&lt;/ref&gt; identifies four purposes in codifying marketing knowledge:
# To facilitate the progress of marketing as a [[science]]
# To promote the discipline within its institutional and professional environments
# To better educate and credential the potential manager
# To provide competitive advantage to the firm
Lilien et al.(2002)&lt;ref&gt;Lilien L.G., Rangaswamy A., van Bruggen Gerrit H.,Wierenga B., Bridging the marketing theory-practice gap with marketing engineering, Journal of Business Research 2002&lt;/ref&gt; define marketing engineering as "the systematic process of putting marketing data and knowledge to practical use through the planning, design, and construction of decision aids and marketing management support systems (MMSSs)". One the driving factors toward the development of marketing engineering are the use of high-powered personal computers connected to [[LAN]]s and [[Wide area network|WAN]]s, the [[Big data|exponential growth in the volume of data]], the reengineering of marketing functions. The effectiveness of the implementation of marketing engineering and MMSSs in the firm depend on the decision situation characteristics(demand), the nature of the MMSS (supply), match between supply and demand, design characteristics of the MMSS, characteristics of implementation process.  Wider adoption depend on difference between end-user systems and high-end systems, user training and the growth of the [[Internet]].

==Market response models==
All market response models include:&lt;ref name="PrinMktgEn"&gt;[[Gary Lilien|Lilien G. L.]], Rangaswamy A., De Bruyn A., Principles of Marketing Engineering, Decision Pro 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

*Response Model: links inputs to outputs such as product perceptions, [[sales]], [[Profit (economics)|profit]]s
*Objectives: used to evaluate actions such as sales

==Models==
In marketing engineering methods and models can be classified in several categories:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

*Causal analyses: [[regression analysis]], [[econometric model]]s, [[input-output model]]s, multivariate [[Autoregressive–moving-average model|ARMA]], [[neural network]]s
*New product forecasting models: [[Bass Model]], [[Product forecasting#Assessor model|ASSESSOR model]]

===New product and service design===
*Creativity software: idea generation, idea evaluation, [[G. E. multi factoral analysis|GE/Mckinsey portfolio model]], [[conjoint analysis]]

===[[Marketing mix]]===
*[[Pricing]]: classic approach, cost-oriented pricing, demand-oriented pricing, competition-oriented pricing
*[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]: affordable method, percentage-of-sales method, competitive parity method, objective-and-task method
*[[Sales|Sales force]] decisions: intuitive methods, market-response methods, response functions

'''Maximin-Dominique Consolat''' (1785-1858) was a French politician. He worked for his family business in [[Russia]] for twenty-three years. Upon returning to France, he served as the [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of [[Marseille]] from 1831 to 1843.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Maximim-Dominique Consolat was born on 4 August 1785 in [[Le Bar-sur-Loup]], [[Var (department)|Var]], France.&lt;ref name="repertoire"&gt;Répertoire des travaux, Société de statistique d'histoire et d'archéologie de Marseille et de Provence, 1859, Volume 22, p. 543 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_pUDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA543]&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in [[Draguignan]], where he was a very good student in mathematics.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt;

His three uncles worked as merchants in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt; Indeed, they had established the first Franco-Russian trading operation to date.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
In 1800, at the age of fifteen, Consolat moved to Russia, where he worked for his uncles.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt; Shortly after, he served on the Board of Directors of their company.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt; He worked for the family business in Russia for twenty-three years, until 1823.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt;

In 1830, he became postmaster in [[Marseille]].&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt; Later that year, he served as Deputy Mayor, while [[Joseph Alexis Rostand]] was [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]].&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mayors"&gt;[http://www.marseille.fr/sitevdm/jsp/site/plugins/document/PrintDocument.jsp?document_id=592 City of Marseille: List of Mayors]&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 September 1831 he was appointed as Mayor, serving until 1843.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt; He oversaw relief efforts in Marseille during the epidemics of [[cholera]] of 1834 and 1835.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt; In 1834, he paved the way for the [[Canal de Marseille]] and the construction of the [[Roquefavour Aqueduct]].&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ventabren"&gt;[http://www.ventabren.fr/L-Aqueduc-de-Roquefavour_a35.html Ventabren: L'Aqueduc de Roquefavour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907064729/http://www.ventabren.fr/L-Aqueduc-de-Roquefavour_a35.html |date=2014-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[André Raynard]] in 1843.&lt;ref name="mayors"/&gt;

He became a Knight of the [[Legion of Honor]] in 1832 and an Officer in 1834.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt;

===Personal life===
He married one of his cousins in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt; He was a practicing Roman Catholic.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt; He received treatments for his recurring stomach upsets in [[Vichy]].&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt;

===Death===
He died on 29 July 1858 of stomach upset.&lt;ref name="repertoire"/&gt;

'''Multimarket contact''' occurs when [[company|firms]] meet the same rivals in multiple markets. When firms compete with each other in more than one [[Market (economics)|market]], their [[Competition|competitive behavior]] may differ from that of single-market rivals. Multimarket competition may result in the reduction of the competitive intensity among rivals, an effect known as mutual forbearance.

Multimarket contact gives a firm the option to respond to actions or attacks by a rival not only in the market being challenged, but also in other markets where they both compete. As a result, multimarket competitors may hesitate to attack in one market for fear of [[retaliation]] in other markets.

The '''once-only principle''' is an [[e-government]] concept that aims to ensure that citizens, institutions, and companies only have to provide certain standard information to the authorities and administrations once. By incorporating data protection regulations and the explicit consent of the users, the public administration is allowed to re-use and exchange the data with each other. The once-only principle is part of the [[European Union|European Union's (EU)]] plans to further develop the [[Digital Single Market]] by reducing the administrative burden on citizens and businesses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-egovernment-action-plan-2016-2020|title=European eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020|work=Digital Single Market|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The application of the once-only principle to public administrations in all EU Member States aims to reduce administrative burdens. This objective was endorsed by EU ministers in the Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ministerial-declaration-egovernment-tallinn-declaration|title=Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment - the Tallinn Declaration|work=Digital Single Market|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU-wide application of once-only is also one of the pillars of the strategy for the [[Digital Single Market]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52015DC0192|title=EUR-Lex - 52015DC0192 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the basic principles of the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The once-only principle is defined differently in the individual EU Member States. In some countries it refers to data storage, which means storing the collected data in a single database. In other countries, once-only refers to data collection and specifies that data may be transmitted only once to public administrations, but that multiple data repositories are possible. Other countries combine both approaches and require that the data must be collected only once and stored in a single database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-digital-once-only-principle-citizens-and-businesses-policy-options-and-their-impactshttps://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-digital-once-only-principle-citizens-and-businesses-policy-options-and-their-impacts|title=News|work=Digital Single Market|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government-Centric vs Citizen-Centric Once-Only ==

Critical to the discussion of Once-Only is WHO is doing the sharing and using which Identity? There are two opposing approaches; the Government-centric and the Citizen-centric - both of which technically implement Once-Only.

In the Government-centric model, the citizen use the same or easily linkable identifiers across applications, borders and databases. In this case, data control is centralized leading to systemic profiling and accumulation of risks. Proponents - mainly government bureaucracy - of this model claim it to be more efficient.

In the Citizen-centric model, the citizen do NOT use the same or linkable identifiers, but instead a variant of Privacy/Security by Design &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/896495/artefact/NewDigitalSecurityModels.pdf?artefact=true&amp;PID=1792137|title=New Digital Security Models|work=Digital Single Market|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.privacytrust.eu/public/Reports/securist-ab-recommendations-issue-v3-0_en.pdf|title=FP7 Security Research Roadmapping - - from Security &amp; Dependabiity by Central Command &amp; Control to Security &amp; Dependabiity by Empowerment |access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as according to e.g. EU Digital Signature Regulation article 5.2 on pseudonymous signatures and Identity. Applying this principle the citizen can have non-linkable but fully functional and legal identities that are not linkable even within the same application in the same database in the same memberstate. In this model control is decentralized and the citizen act as data broker. Proponents – mainly citizen-rights experts and activists (e.g. EDRI), legal experts, security experts and economists – of this model claim it to be more effective and secure as it prevents classical Command &amp; Control failures ensuring systems adapt to citizens choice and drastically reduce security risks. 

In addition to the technical and economic issues, there is a real concern that Government-Centric model similar to Data Retention will prove incompatible with GDPR and Human Rights article 8 as it requires government profiling citizen in order to detect attempted requests for data already collected for another purpose. This problem would not arise in Privacy by Design based Citizen-Centric Once-Only models.

Citizen-centric models are under implementation in Denmark in a model named CitizenKey.

== Benefits ==
The once-only principle can help to reduce administrative burdens in the EU Member States, as exchanging information that has already been collected is cheaper and less burdensome than collecting and storing it repeatedly. Furthermore, some experts believe that data protection concerns can be better taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interoperability-privacy-andres-k%C3%BCtt/|title=Interoperability and privacy|last=Kütt|first=Andres|date=|website=Linkedin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Process optimization and potentially higher administrative efficiency are described as main advantages of once-only for public administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalvet|first=Tarmo|last2=Toots|first2=Maarja|last3=Krimmer|first3=Robert|date=2017-08-29|title=D2.7 Drivers and barriers for the OOP|url=http://www.toop.eu/deliverables|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include fewer calls to customer service centers, fewer paper-based applications, faster processing of administrative processes, time savings due to reduced data capture requirements and fewer data errors due to data reuse. This could save costs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eu2017.ee/political-meetings/tallinn-digital-summit|title=Tallinn Digital Summit|date=2017-05-31|work=EU2017.EE|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for public administrations and improve the quality of various public services.

Cross-border implementation of the principle could also help to ensure equal treatment for domestic and foreign persons and companies in the use of public services, for which they are obliged to provide information to public authorities. Better public value creation could, on the overall level, improve the legitimacy, transparency and accountability of public administrations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-digital-once-only-principle-citizens-and-businesses-policy-options-and-their-impacts|title=EU-wide digital Once-Only Principle for citizens and businesses - Policy options and their impacts|work=Digital Single Market|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Barriers ==
According to a study carried out on behalf of the [[European Commission]], once-only encounters technical, organisational, semantic, and legal obstacles to implementation throughout the EU.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

On the technical side, there is a lack of a comprehensive and secure data exchange solution, interoperable catalogs and IT systems as well as a lack of infrastructure for a secure and data protection-compliant exchange. In addition, other barriers are organisational in nature. The study includes the lack of clear political guidance, the high implementation costs and the lack of administrative willingness to cooperate and exchange data. As far as semantic aspects are concerned, the challenge lies in the lack of or over-distributed registers and the insufficient interoperability of existing registers and data. In addition, barriers exist due to different standards, taxonomies, data models and data quality. Legal obstacles include the heterogeneity of national legal frameworks, data protection and respect for privacy.

These aspects prevent a fast and far-reaching implementation of the once-only principle at European level.

== Criticism and public reception ==
The [[European Data Protection Supervisor|European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)]], [[Giovanni Buttarelli]], welcomed the EU-initiative, but claimed additional clarity on important data protection principles. In particular, the proposal should not provide a legal basis for the exchange of information for purposes other than those mentioned therein. Furthermore, it should not restrict the principle of purpose limitation laid down in the [[General Data Protection Regulation]]. The EDPS also asks for clarification of a number of questions relating to the practical implementation of user control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2017/digital-europe-needs-data-protection-0_en|title=A digital Europe needs data protection|website=European Data Protection Supervisor|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocacy group [[European Digital Rights|European Digital Rights (EDRi)]] pointed out, that a once-only implementation needs to follow privacy by design and privacy by default, to be citizen-friendly and user-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edri.org/files/DSM_Analysis_EDRi_20150617.pdf|title=Analysis: A truly Digital Single Market?|last=European Digital Rights (EDRi)|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A representative survey on e-government in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in 2017 showed that the majority of the population in each country is rather skeptical. A national once-only implementation received less than 50% support in all countries, a Europe-wide once-only implementation received less than 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egovernment-monitor.de/die-studie/2017.html|title=2017: eGovernment Monitor|website=www.egovernment-monitor.de|language=de|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation of the once-only principle (national) ==
By 2014, 25 European countries had begun to implement once-only to a certain extent and 13 countries had legislation supporting the implementation of the principle for businesses and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/final-report-study-egovernment-and-reduction-administrative-burden-smart-20120061|title=Final Report: Study on eGovernment and the Reduction of Administrative Burden (SMART 2012/0061)|work=Digital Single Market|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, implementation is still fragmented across the EU and once-only cross-border applications are still limited to a few services and cases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The most advanced once-only infrastructures exist in Belgium, Estonia and the Netherlands, which have national legislation and enforce its implementation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Estonia ===
In Estonia, once-only is used in most administrative procedures. Several essential prerequisites, including legal, administrative and technical requirements, have been fulfilled. Since 2007, the Public Information Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/514112013001/consolide|title=Public Information Act – Riigi Teataja|last=Andmevara|first=AS|website=www.riigiteataja.ee|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits the creation of separate databases for the collection of the same data. Also, the General Part of the Economic Activities Code Act&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/530102013062/consolide|title=General Part of the Economic Activities Code Act – Riigi Teataja|last=Andmevara|first=AS|website=www.riigiteataja.ee|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that economic administrative authorities are prohibited to require companies to provide information that is already entered in a public database. The prohibition also applies to information which can be obtained from the relevant register of another Contracting State.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the health sector in Estonia, the once-only principle is already being used in the [[electronic health record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eu2017.ee/news/press-releases/estonias-unique-e-health-thousands-data-fields-one-personal-health-record|title=Estonia’s unique e-health: thousands of data fields, one personal health record|date=2017-10-11|work=EU2017.EE|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, health data has been managed via a central database. Specialists can document analyses, diagnoses, test results and treatment procedures. After a transfer to a hospital, for example, the patient data can be retrieved from the database without the patient having to enter the data again. In emergency situations, an electronic first aid card can be generated in the ambulance after identification of the patient, which provides vital data to the first responders. Patients can access the database via a (mobile) ID card and manage their data independently and give their consent/rejection to the data exchange.

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, the once-only principle is applied in several areas. The Stelsel van Basisregistraties (Basic Registries System) was founded in 2003 and comprises 12 basic registries containing general information on companies and individuals, such as company names, personal addresses, cadastral information, income and registration information for motor vehicles. This enables businesses and citizens to provide this data only once. The system includes both open and closed registers where information is only accessible to those who need it for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/digitale-overheid/inhoud/efficienter-werken-door-samenvoegen-basisregistraties|title=Van 11 basisregistraties naar 1 stelsel|last=Koninkrijksrelaties|first=Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en|website=www.rijksoverheid.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the once-only principle for private individuals, the Dutch tax office ([[Tax and Customs Administration|Belastingdienst]]) introduced the prefilled tax returns in 2014 and made them standard in 2016. Because tax data from different databases is automatically merged and added to tax forms, users don't have to manually fill in tax forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumentenbond.nl/belastingaangifte/checklist-belastingaangifte-doen;|title=Belastingaangifte doen over 2017 {{!}} Tips en info {{!}} Consumentenbond|website=www.consumentenbond.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once-only is also used in the Elektronisch Patiënten Dossier (EPD, Electronic Patient Dossier. It enables caregivers to ask other service providers for patient information via a national exchange office. Access to information is only possible if patients have given their prior consent. Patients can view their medical records online (authentication takes place via [[Electronic identification|eID]]) and allow access to the care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toop.eu/deliverables|title=D2.14 Position on Definition of OOP and Situation in Europe|last=Krimmer|first=Robert|date=|website=toop.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics in the Netherlands see the risk of abuse and invasion of privacy in the event of burglary of the system by crackers. In that case, very sensitive medical information can be exposed. Such information is highly sensitive to privacy and can cause major harm to victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105042637/http://staff.science.uva.nl/~noordend/epd/summary.html|title=The Dutch Electronic Patient Record System|date=2014-01-05|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
Belgium adopted its own law on once-only in 2014. The law requires the federal government's public administrations to retrieve all available data from official registers with a unique identification feature instead of asking citizens and companies to make this data available more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&amp;la=F&amp;cn=2014050506&amp;table%20_name=loi|title=LOI - WET|website=www.ejustice.just.fgov.be|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the law is facilitated by the system of basic registers and the eID system, which provides each data holder with a unique identification feature. This will allow public administrations to exchange data and give individuals and businesses access to public electronic services. The system also enables citizens to know at any time which organisation has accessed their data.

In the area of business services, a number of common transactions (e. g. registration of company name and address, withholding tax and social security contributions from wages) can be carried out online using pre-entered forms. The administrative burden of setting up a business is also considered low due to the extensive re-use of data from public sector databases.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

In the Belgium region [[Flanders]], the once-only principle (known as the "vraag niet wat je al weet" principle) was adopted as part of the Flemish e-government decree of July 18th 2008.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://codex.vlaanderen.be/PrintDocument.ashx?id=1017242|title=Decreet betreffende het elektronische bestuurlijke gegevensverkeer|website=codex.vlaanderen.be|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree requires that the Flemish public administrations retrieve the data required for their government processes from authentic data sources, when available, and gives citizens the possibility to complain if he or she is asked for data which is already available in such an authentic data source.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The MAGDA platform (Maximum Data Sharing between Agencies) is a once-only principle implementation supporting electronic delivery of public services, at the federal, regional, and local levels of the government. The platform enables the reuse and sharing of citizens’ and companies’ data between the Flemish government authorities (190 agencies and 13 departments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/document/magda-20-platform-magda|title=MAGDA 2.0 platform (MAGDA) {{!}} Joinup|website=joinup.ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform allows citizens and businesses to enter or update their data only once, from a single point of access, to be used by all public authorities. The exchange and reuse of existing data between government agencies through the MAGDA platform is performed using the national eID; accordingly, the once-only data collection relies on the eID card as well. Different public services, especially the application for benefits, can be performed online, without providing personal information or performing any further paperwork. All required data is transferred automatically, since MAGDA retrieves the required data from the national registry of natural persons after the citizen has been identified through his or her eID card.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/hans.arents/documents/MAGDA%20SOA%20platform.pdf|title=MAGDA SOA platform integrates state agencies, streamlines citizen processes|last=Company|first=EDS|date=2008|website=Arents.be|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria has set itself the goal of advancing once-only integration in the field of eGovernment services in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.derbrutkasten.com/ministerin-schramboeck-zu-oesterreich-gv-at/|title=Schramböck: "Once Only"-Prinzip soll Unternehmen helfen|date=2018-01-19|work=der brutkasten|access-date=2018-03-14|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the principle has already been applied, e. g. in the case of the Austrian electronic health record (ELGA) or the Austrian FinanzOnline service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.bmf.gv.at/e-government/portals/fon.html|title=BMF - FinanzOnline (FON)|website=english.bmf.gv.at|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent example is the case of [[family allowance]]s in Austria. After the birth of the child, the authorities will be asked whether a legal claim exists without a request. The competent registry office collects all relevant data on the child and the personal status data of the parents in the Central Register of Civil Statuses (CPR), operated by the Federal Ministry of the Interior. These data are transmitted by the Federal Ministry of the Interior to the tax authorities. The tax authorities are now examining whether all the conditions for granting family allowances are met. If this is the case, the parents are informed and the money is automatically transferred to the account. Up to six authorities had to be consulted by May 2015. As a rule, citizens no longer have to produce any evidence at all and receive support without submitting an application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmfj.gv.at/familie/finanzielle-unterstuetzungen/familienbeihilfe0/antrag-familienbeihilfe.html|title=Antragslose Familienbeihilfe bei Geburt eines Kindes: Bundesministerium für Familien und Jugend|website=www.bmfj.gv.at|language=de|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the birth certificate and other documents can be requested in some hospitals (e. g. in Vienna) through a branch office of the registry office (so-called' baby points'). This avoids further visits to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.help.gv.at/Portal.Node/hlpd/public/content/8/Seite.080055.html|title=Checkliste – Behördenwege bei der Geburt eines Kindes|last=Österreich|first=Republik|website=HELP.gv.at|language=de|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portugal ===
Slowly, the national administration is adopting the once-only principle. For the moment (2018), the most visible effort is on the annual tax form for individuals, which is now mostly pre-filled for everybody, using data existent on several different national offices. In thousands of cases, the form is even defined as complete, without the need for those citizens to do anything else other than confirming it in the system. This allows a speedy processing of taxes, to the point of reimbursements being made in a matter of weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://info.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/pt/apoio_contribuinte/modelos_formularios/irs/Pages/imposto-sobre-o-rendimento-das-pessoas-singulares.aspx|title=Imposto sobre o Rendimento das Pessoas Singulares|website=info.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===

Denmark has for many years been pursuing the Government-centric Once-Only model with significant focus on central sharing and citizen profiling. Benefits of this model was mainly achieved in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Since then accumulating problems with trust, security and effectiveness of public sector models has lead to search for New Digital Security Models addressing and solving these issues through extending or replacing models with Citizen-Centric Once-Only &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/896495/artefact/NewDigitalSecurityModels.pdf?artefact=true&amp;PID=1792137|title=New Digital Security Models|work=Digital Single Market|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These models would involve introducing a two-layer National Identity and Digital Signature Scheme implementing support for eIDAS article 5.2 as purpose-specific identity and data sharing which will be tested in Denmark preparing for an EU-wide roll-out.

== Implementation of the once-only principle (cross-border) ==

=== e-SENS ===
The aim of e-SENS is to enable digital, cross-border management through generic and reusable technical components in the European Union. This project focused on technical solutions such as eID, e-documents and electronic signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.esens.eu/content/about-project|title=About the project|last=PiotrFenger|date=2015-10-21|work=e-SENS|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Citizen Lifecycle area of e-SENS, Sweden has been testing a new online service since 2016, providing third country students access to academic programmes at [[Stockholm University]]. The pilot project uses eID to identify and register, using a federal cross-border authentication tool supported by e-SENS, a large-scale EU initiative.

The pilot project, which is run by the University of Stockholm, enables foreign students to study Swedish courses at the same level as students on campus, including secure submission of signed assignments, individual teacher feedback online and participation in examinations. The system uses an extended version of the online learning platform [[Moodle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/sweden-opens-academic-borders-e-sens-project|title=Sweden opens academic ‘borders’ with the e-SENS project|work=Digital Single Market|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions ===
Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) is a non-profit association founded by Estonia and Finland in June 2017. Iceland joined NIIS as a partner in September 2018. The mission of the institute is to develop e-governance solutions and its first product is [[X-Road]] data exchange layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niis.org/|title=Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS)|website=Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS)|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; X-Road is used nationwide in the Suomi.fi Data Exchange Layer service ({{lang-fi|Suomi.fi-palveluväylä}}) in Finland and in the Estonian data exchange layer X-tee. Public sector organisations in both countries are legally obliged to use the national data exchange layer services. In addition, private companies are allowed to use the services in both countries. X-tee and Suomi.fi Data Exchange Layer are technically connected to one another which enables easy and secure cross-border data exchange between Estonia and Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vrk.fi/en/artikkeli/-/asset_publisher/suomen-ja-viron-palveluvaylat-liitetty-yhteen-7-2-tietojen-nopea-ja-luotettava-vaihto-maiden-valilla-nyt-mahdollista|title=Finland's and Estonia's data exchange layers connected to one another on 7 February - the rapid exchange of information between the countries is now possible|website=Population Register Centre, Finland|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== eManifest ===
The eManifest pilot project was launched in 2016 to test the implementation of the once-only principle for maritime data in cooperation between [[Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport|DG MOVE]], [[Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union (European Commission)|DG TAXUD]], the [[European Maritime Safety Agency|European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA)]] and representatives of maritime and customs authorities from 13 EU Member States and industry associations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/digital-services/e-maritime_en|title=European Maritime Single Window environment - Mobility and Transport - European Commission|website=Mobility and Transport|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the project is to test procedures that would simplify reporting formalities for maritime transport and facilitate the implementation of Directive 2010/65/EC on reporting formalities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The pilot project aims to ensure that data elements transmitted by maritime operators can be reported once only through a single transmission to the national or EU-wide maritime Single Window. Subsequently, they will be distributed to the competent national authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/general-information-customs/electronic-customs_en|title=Electronic customs - Taxation and Customs Union - European Commission|website=Taxation and Customs Union|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business Registers Interconnection System ===
The BRIS (Business Registers Interconnection System) is an initiative at EU level that provides a cross-border cooperation platform for European business registers and acts as a single point of access for the European e-Justice portal.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=46992657|title=Business Registers Interconnection System (BRIS)|website=CEF Digital|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a service through which citizens, businesses and public administrations can access information on companies and their branches established in other Member States in accordance with Directive 2017/17/EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Directive 2012/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2012 amending Council Directive 89/666/EEC and Directives 2005/56/EC and 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers  Text with EEA relevance|date=2012-06-16|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2012/17/oj/eng|volume=OJ L|issue=32012L0017|language=en|accessdate=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; BRIS provides an interface/search function for accessing enterprise data at EU level. It is designed to reduce the administrative burden on businesses in meeting cross-border obligations and to increase the legal certainty and efficiency of procedures carried out by public administrations.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt;

=== X-trans.eu ===
X-trans.eu was a cross-border pilot project between the Free State of Bavaria and Upper Austria with the aim of developing a faster procedure for the application and approval of cross-border large-capacity transports. Due to the different application forms and procedures for obtaining heavy goods transport permits in different countries, the aim of the pilot project was to create a central system that would save companies from submitting multiple applications for the same transport to different local authorities. The central approval portal x-trans.eu enabled the applicants to make their data available only once for the respective transport. The information collected was then forwarded to the appropriate authorities in each country, based on the application requirements in each country. The portal was based on a common data model that contained all the information required for approval. Rules could then be formulated to describe the information and application formats required in the individual countries. This made the system completely scalable for every European country. During the pilot phase, the data exchange between Austria and Germany was successfully tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?action=display&amp;doc_id=5522|title=X-trans.EU Cross-Border Public Service|last=Kestermann|first=Carsten|date=2014-05-20|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Once-only research projects  ==

=== The Once-Only Principle Project (TOOP) ===
The Once-Only Principle Project (TOOP) is a large-scale cross-border pilot initiative supported by the [[Horizon 2020]] framework programme, which examines the feasibility of the once-only principle at cross-border level. TOOP takes a specific approach to the once-only principle by focusing on information about companies (i. e. without data on individual citizens) and the cross-border exchange of this information. The project aims to contribute to a future in which companies have to pass on certain standard information to a national or supranational public administration only once, and this information can be shared and reused by public authorities in compliance with legal requirements and constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toop.eu|title=TOOP.EU {{!}} providing data once-only.eu|website=www.toop.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stakeholder Community of the Once-Only Principle For Citizens (SCOOP4C) ===
Stakeholder Community of the Once-Only Principle For Citizens (SCOOP4C) is an EU coordination and support action supported by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. The aim of the initiative is to examine how better provision of public services to citizens can be achieved by applying the once-only principle. SCOOP4C was established to analyze implementation barriers, generate once-only research and identify and link relevant EU stakeholders. To this end, the initiative regularly organises EU-wide workshops and events on the subject and provides an online knowledge base, a community platform and a best practice database. This aims to bundle all current once-only initiatives and facilitates the exchange between experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop4c.eu|title=Home {{!}} SCOOP4C|website=www.scoop4c.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purpose-specific Citizen identity (eIDAS 5.2) and Citizen-centric Once-Only (CitizenKey) ===
A civil-society driven project established in Denmark aiming to setup a self-owned non-profit foundation (Digital Identity &amp; Security) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalfond.dk/|title=Fonden for Digital Identitet og Sikkerhed|date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support and service eIDAS 5.2 identities and citizen-centric Once-Only data sharing across all of Denmark.
The project emerged out of numerous large-scale EU security and identity research projects such as SECURIST, HYDRA, and ABC4TRUST etc. aiming to implement full-service eIDAS 5.2 identities including legal signing, payments, data sharing, credentials validation and communication WITHOUT digital identification in the transaction. The project aims to implement two large-scale Privacy by Design pilots – one on one Identity, payments and tax compliance and one on Personal Medicine ensuring strong anonymity around genome-related SmallData research and treatment.

'''Osman Eltayeb''' (Born 1919 - 29 September 2011) in Rufaa, [[Sudan]] was a Sudanese Businessman and the Honorary Consul of [[Sudan]] in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.loquatclassic.com/team-view/ceo/|title=- Loquat Classics NIG|work=Loquat Classics NIG|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

He migrated to Nigeria in 1939 with his uncle Bashir Elrayah who was posted there by the Sudanese Judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oetandsons.com/about-us/our-founder|title=Our Founder|last=User|first=Super|website=oetandsons.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later abandoned his studies to pursue a trading career, and as of the 1950s, Osman Eltayeb was a well established figure in the Nigerian markets- Controlling a large share of the cotton and textile markets. He founded the group Osman Eltayeb and Sons and later diversified into Skin and Hides becoming one of the leading exporters in Africa and also setting up Wheat Mills, Nicco Sweets (With brother Ibrahim), Rivera Biscuits and a Cattle bone-crushing company. The group also has large real estate investments in the United Kingdom. An arm of the group also has investments in the Sudanese Gum arabic and Hibiscus markets.
Sheikh Bashir Elrayah School was founded in 1996 as a non-profit and high standard of education school by Osman as a way of giving back to the community. The school now has over 2000 students enrolled and is among the best in Northern Nigeria.

Osman Eltayeb is a leading figure in Sudanese and Nigerian politics. He was a very close personal friend of Sudan's late President [[Ja'far Numeiri]]. He is a close ally of President [[Omar al-Bashir]]. He played a prominent role in getting the North and South of Sudan to negotiate the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] (CPA) 2005, in the Nigerian capital [[Abuja]]. This in turn led to the end of the 21-year-old Civil War in Sudan.

For his many contributions to the Sudanese and Nigerian communities, Osman Eltayeb received the Nilein Award (Highest degree) from Sudan's President [[Omar al-Bashir]] and the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) award from Nigeria's President [[Obasanjo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711130021/http://s62050.gridserver.com/databank/resource?id=69|title=Konferge|date=2011-07-11|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became one of the leading philanthropists in both Nigeria and Sudan. Being from a very religious Islamic background, he built and aided in the building of Mosques and Islamic Centers. He also built the Osman Eltayeb Community Hospital in Rufaa, North Sudan. 

"Osman Eltayeb is a Loyal Friend, Osman is a Generous man, Osman is a Gentleman. Osman loves Nigeria just as he loves his own country Sudan. Indeed we know he has been a friend of most of our leaders, Traditional and political. Among them the Emirs (Past and Present) of Kano. " [[Maitama Sule]] Former Nigerian Ambassador to the UN.

Two separate TV documentaries were filmed and aired about the lifetime achievements of Alhaji Osman Eltayeb, By Sudan TV and Shirouq TV in 2007 and 2010 respectively.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

'''Pride at Work''' ('''PAW''') is a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group (LGBT) of [[trade union|labor union]] activists affiliated with the [[AFL-CIO]].

==Homosexual rights and the labor movement==
The openness, visibility and participation of LGBT people in the American labor movement is closely linked to that of the [[LGBT movements in the United States|American Gay Rights Movement]]. But gay activism flourished in a limited way in some sectors of the "house of labor." The [[National Union of Marine Cooks and Stewards (NUMCS)]], which represented workers on luxury liners,&lt;ref name="Santora99" &gt;{{harvtxt|Santora|2001|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; included among its leaders the openly gay [[Stephen R. Blair]]. NUMCS was derided as "red, black and queer" for its leftist politics, racial integration and the large number of gay members.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, "A Short History of Lesbian and Gay Labor Activism in the United States," in ''Laboring for Rights: Unions and Sexual Diversity Across Nations,'' 1999, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; A sign in the union hall proclaimed, "Race-baiting, Red-baiting, and Queer-Baiting is Anti-Union."&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, ''Sexuality and Socialism: History, Politics, and Theory of LGBT Liberation,'' 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair's life-partner, Frank McCormick, was a vice president of the California [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] and an important leader in the [[1934 West Coast Longshore Strike|1934 West Coast longshore strike]].&lt;ref name="Santora99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bain60"&gt;Bain, "A Short History of Lesbian and Gay Labor Activism in the United States," in ''Laboring for Rights: Unions and Sexual Diversity Across Nations,'' 1999, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NUMCS also had a number of openly gay African-American men serving in leadership positions.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Hay]] was an organizer for the [[Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Santora99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bain60" /&gt; Attending the [[Southern California Labor School]], he met many of the men who would later become some of the first members of the [[Mattachine Society]],&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance, 1950-1963,'' 2009, p. 470; Bullough, ''Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights in Historical Context,'' 2002, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; whose initial five members were all union activists.&lt;ref name="Santora99"/&gt;

The first public endorsement of LGBT rights by an American labor union, however, did not occur until 1970, after the [[Stonewall Rebellion]].&lt;ref name="Santora100"/&gt; In that year, the executive council of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] passed a resolution which denounced discrimination against teachers solely because the individual was a homosexual.&lt;ref name="Santora101" &gt;{{harvtxt|Santora|2001|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild and Hayward, ''Now That You Know: A Parents' Guide to Understanding Their Gay and Lesbian Children,'' 1998, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; A second step forward for LGBT labor activists came with the [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors beer]] boycott. As part of its anti-union efforts, the company administered [[polygraph|lie-detector]] tests to prospective employees asking about their union views.&lt;ref name="Santora101"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heath and Palenchar, ''Strategic Issues Management: Organizations and Public Policy Challenges,'' 2009, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the questions also asked was whether the job applicant was a homosexual.&lt;ref name="Santora101"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''Consumer Boycotts: Effecting Change Through the Marketplace and the Media,'' 1999, p. 126; [[Russ Bellant]], ''The Coors Connection: How Coors Family Philanthropy Undermines Democratic Pluralism,'' 1991, p. 66; Kates, ''Twenty Million New Customers!: Understanding Gay Men's Consumer Behavior,'' 1998, p. 157; [[Lee Badgett|Badgett]], ''Money, Myths, and Change: The Economic Lives of Lesbians and Gay Men,'' 2001, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] were attempting to organize workers at Coors. Two straight Teamster organizers approached [[San Francisco]] gay community leaders [[Howard Wallace]], a teamster union activist, and [[Harvey Milk]], then an emerging political activist, about supporting the boycott.&lt;ref name="Wolf246"&gt;Wolf, ''Sexuality and Socialism: History, Politics, and Theory of LGBT Liberation,'' 2009, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace and Milk agreed, if the Teamsters would agree to promote the hiring of openly gay truck drivers.&lt;ref name="Wolf246" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Santora102" &gt;{{harvtxt|Santora|2001|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Teamsters consented.&lt;ref name="Wolf246" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Santora102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History From 1869 to the Present,'' 2006, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; The Coors boycott took off in San Francisco, and spread nationally. In California, the [[market share]] of Coors dropped from 40 percent to 14 percent. Facing this boycott, Coors stopped asking its applicants about their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Santora102"/&gt;

The gay rights and labor movements joined forced again in 1978. [[California Proposition 6 (1978)|Proposition Six]], known as the Briggs amendment, would have banned gays from teaching in California public schools. A coalition of gay and union activists was formed and defeated the amendment.&lt;ref name="Santora102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rimmerman, ''From Identity to Politics: The Lesbian and Gay Movements in the United States,'' 2002, p. 130; Harbeck, ''Gay and Lesbian Educators: Personal Freedoms, Public Constraints,'' 1997, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the quadrennial convention of the AFL-CIO unanimously adopted a resolution calling for the enactment of federal legislation banning discrimination based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Santora1023" &gt;{{harvtxt|Santora|2001|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bain, "A Short History of Lesbian and Gay Labor Activism in the United States," in ''Laboring for Rights: Unions and Sexual Diversity Across Nations,'' 1999, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a number of LGBT union members had formed caucuses within their respective unions.  Organizations with large numbers of members which became politically active, even electorally important, included those within the [[Service Employees International Union]], [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]], the [[Communications Workers of America]] and UFCW.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, "Lesbian and Gay Caucuses in the U.S. Labor Movement," in ''Laboring for Rights: Unions and Sexual Diversity Across Nations,'' 1999, p. 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In June 1994, LGBT union activists gathered in [[New York City]] as part of the 25th anniversary of the [[Stonewall riots]]. Wallace and others associated with the [[Gay and Lesbian Labor Activists Network]] (GALLAN), an organization of LGBT labor union activists in San Francisco, pushed for the formation of national organization out of frustration with the labor movement's silence during the debate over the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Bain, "A Short History of Lesbian and Gay Labor Activism in the United States," in ''Laboring for Rights: Unions and Sexual Diversity Across Nations,'' 1999, p. 74-78.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a cue from a 1990 booklet titled ''Pride at Work: Organizing for Lesbian and Gay Rights in Unions'', the group decided to adopt the title as its name.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, "A Short History of Lesbian and Gay Labor Activism in the United States," in ''Laboring for Rights: Unions and Sexual Diversity Across Nations,'' 1999, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, PAW affiliated as a constituency group of the AFL-CIO. Affiliation did not come easily. Several members of the AFL-CIO's executive council argued that the group was too small to affiliate. Affiliation was also opposed on the basis that members of the group were not historically discriminated against in collective bargaining, and that the members should work through their local and international unions. This claim led to accusations by some members of the executive council and the LGBT union community that those opposing affiliation were [[homophobia|homophobic]]. But AFL-CIO president [[John Sweeney (labor leader)|John Sweeney]] pushed hard for the affiliation. When a final vote was taken, opponents of affiliation abstained rather than vote no.

PAW's relationship to the AFL-CIO proved rocky at first. Unlike other AFL-CIO constituent organizations, Pride at Work was not given a budget to help fund its operations until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, "A Short History of Lesbian and Gay Labor Activism in the United States," in ''Laboring for Rights: Unions and Sexual Diversity Across Nations,'' 1999, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, funding was still minimal. From the outset, however, PAW was given full access to AFL-CIO state and local labor councils and international member unions, enhancing its research and mobilization efforts substantially.&lt;ref name="Noyes"&gt;Noyes, "Coming Out for Union Democracy: AUD at Pride at Work," ''Union Democracy Review,'' August/September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "What Can Be Done? Sexual Diversity and Labor Unions in Perspective," in ''Laboring for Rights: Unions and Sexual Diversity Across Nations,'' 1999, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Pride at Work is a non-profit organization. It has seven executive officers: male-identified and female-identified co-presidents, male-identified and female-identified vice co-presidents, an organizing vice president, a treasurer and a secretary. The co-presidents co-chair the National Executive Board and the Executive Committee of the organization. Each officer has a three-year term, with elections held at the organization's convention.

PAW's policy-making body is the National Executive Board (NEB). The NEB is composed of the seven executive officers; chapter representatives elected from the chapters; a member appointed by the president of the AFL-CIO; members from each recognized international union's LGBT union caucus (with a maximum one member per international); and a maximum of six 'diversity representatives' appointed by the aforementioned members of the NEB. PAW's National Executive Board meets at least once a year.

Representation on the NEB is proportionate to membership. A chapter which represents 10 percent or more of the organization's membership is entitled to two representatives on the NEB. Chapters which represent at least 5 percent but no more than 10 percent of the organization's membership are entitled to one representative on the NEB.  Each June 30 in a non-convention year, smaller chapters may seek recognition from the organization to determine whether they meet the 5 percent cut-off mark. Small chapters not meeting the rule may elect two board members, who then represent all small chapters. Board members serve for three-year terms.

Diversity representatives are important to PAW's work as a new organization. Categories covered under diversity include but are not limited to race, industrial sector, rank and file status, gender identity, union representation, gender, age and geographic area (especially those targeted for new chapter organizing). Diversity representatives are charged with advocating for their diversity group under PAW's constitution.

An executive committee governs the organization in the absence of the National Executive Board.  The executive committee is composed of the seven officers as well as however many other members the NEB sees fit to elect to it. The executive committee meets at least twice a year, but often more frequently.

The PAW staff is small.  Constitutionally, there must be at least one director. Directors are appointed by a majority vote of the executive committee. As of July 2006, there are three staff members in addition to constitutionally-required director.

PAW's members, assembled in membership meetings, are the highest decision-making body within the organization.  Members may be at-large or members of local chapters.  Chapters are largely autonomous. PAW had roughly 25 chapters in the United States in 2006, about double the number it had in 1997. PAW holds a triennial convention, usually in September. An annual membership meeting is usually held in mid-summer.

==Goals and program==
[[File:PrideatWork DCCapitalPride 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|Pride at Work members distribute literature and educate the public about union organizing campaigns affecting LGBTQ workers at the [[Capital Pride (Washington, D.C.)|Capital Pride]] street festival in [[Washington, D.C.]], on June 14, 2009.]]
Pride at Work exists to build tolerance and support for LGBT members in the workplace and in labor unions.

The organization educates LGBT people about their rights as workers, the organized labor movement and the principles of trade union solidarity; encourages and assists LGBT workers to organize and to become active participants in the trade union movement; opposes discrimination on the job and in unions based on sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, race, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, religion or political views; encourages LGBT workers to register and vote to exercise their full rights and responsibilities of citizenship at the local, state and national levels; and educates the union movement and the public about the economic and social needs and interests of LGBT workers.

PAW also helps educate union members on larger political questions of importance to the LGBT community, such as gender identity-anti-discrimination protections and marriage equality.

Nationally, PAW led the struggle for domestic partnership benefits, an issue important to LGBT couples and non-married heterosexuals. PAW has also recently undertaken an initiative to advocate for health care benefits for the special needs of transgender workers.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, "Protecting Lesbian, Gay, and Transgender Members," ''Labor Notes,'' May 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pride at Work v. Granholm===
Pride at Work is the lead [[plaintiff]] in ''National Pride at Work v. Granholm,'' No. 05-368-CZ (55th Dist. Ct. September 27, 2005). In 2004, the state of [[Michigan]] amended its [[constitution]] to define [[marriage]] as a union between a man and a woman. After enactment of the amendment (known as Proposal 2), Michigan governor [[Jennifer Granholm]] questioned the legality of providing state-funded [[domestic partnership]] benefits. In May 2005, Pride at Work, on behalf of its members at [[Michigan State University]] and other state agencies, filed a complaint seeking to establish that the amendment does not bar public employers from providing benefits to domestic partners. Pride at Work argued in its brief that domestic partnership benefits are a contractual relationship unrelated to marital status and are not preempted by the amendment. On September 27, 2005, district court judge Joyce Draganchuk agreed, and issued summary judgment for the plaintiffs.

The state of Michigan appealed. On October 31, 2005, the [[Michigan Court of Appeals]] granted the state attorney general's motion to stay the decision and accelerate the appeal. On April 11, 2006, a panel of three Michigan Court of Appeals judges heard oral arguments on the amendment prohibiting public employers from offering domestic partner benefits.

On February 2, 2007, a unanimous three-judge panel of the state Court of Appeals ruled that the amendment bans domestic partner benefit plans. The ruling dismissed Pride at Work's claim that the amendment deprives same-sex couples of the equal protection of the law. "Consistent with the state's long public policy tradition of favoring the institution of marriage," the court wrote, "the marriage amendment's purpose, 'to secure and preserve the benefits of marriage for our society and for future generations of children...' is neither arbitrary nor invidious on its face."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, "Partner Benefits Barred in Michigan," ''Gay City News,'' February 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Pride at Work immediately appealed the ruling.

===Pride at Work v. Governor of Michigan===
In ''Pride at Work v. Governor of Michigan'', 481 Mich. 56 (2008), the Supreme Court of Michigan interpreted the state's 2004 constitutional amendment providing that only different-sex unions may be "recognized as a marriage or similar union for any purpose."  The court ruled that the statute prohibited public employers from offering health insurance benefits to employees' same-sex domestic partners because domestic partnerships are "similar unions" to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/laws_and_elections/13025.htm HRC Michigan Decisions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817230643/http://www.hrc.org/laws_and_elections/13025.htm |date=2009-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Refaat El-Sayed''' (born 11 February 1946 in Egypt) is a businessman of Egyptian and Swedish nationality, who made most of his career in Sweden. At the beginning of the 1980s, he took command of a small [[biotechnology|biotech]] company, Fermenta, which he quickly turned into one of the success stories of the [[Stockholm]] stock exchange. El-Sayed soon became Sweden's richest man, and made the fortune of his employees and shareholders. A charismatic leader, he was a favourite of the media, and in December 1985 he was named "[[Swede of the year]]" by the TV news program ''[[Rapport (television programme)|Rapport]]''. The following month, Fermenta announced a partnership with Swedish industrial giant [[Volvo]]. El-Sayed was at the peak of his fame.

The fall from grace was brutal: just one month later, El-Sayed was accused of lying about his academic qualifications, as he had falsely asserted he was a Doctor of Science. The partnership with Volvo was broken. In 1992, El-Sayed became the CEO of another biotech company, Hebi Health Care.

== Early life ==
El-Sayed was born 11 February 1946 in a small town in Northern Egypt. As a teenager, he showed an early interest in [[microbiology]].&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 02:16 – 02:24 : ''Refaat El-Sayed föddes 1946...&lt;/ref&gt; He immigrated to Sweden in 1966, and started working as a laboratory assistant at the Fiskeby paper mill in [[Norrköping]]. He then resumed his studies, at first in Stockholm, before joining the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences|University of Agricultural Sciences]] at [[Ultuna]] near [[Uppsala]].&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 02:50 – 03:11 : ''1966 kommer Refaat till Sverige...''&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few years, he left Sweden for the [[United States]], where he worked as a consultant for [[SDS Biotech]], and studied at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] in [[California]]. This helped him build a relationship network, which would become handy in later stages of his career. His ambition was to start a biotechnology company, and to develop his inventions and patents in the field of water purification. In the mid-1970s, he acquired his first company, which he renamed Mikrokem.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 04:12 – 05:05 : ''Efter det ägnar Refaat tid åt att resa...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, he turned his attention to Fermenta, a subsidiary of [[AstraZeneca|Astra]] located in [[Strängnäs]] near Stockholm. Fermenta's main output was raw materials used for the production of antibiotics, an activity considered at the time of low strategic value. It was an ageing, money losing business, which Astra was eager to get rid of. El-Sayed became the new owner after taking a loan of one million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] from [[Handelsbanken]]. But in order to develop itself, Fermenta needed even more money, and El-Sayed decided to go public, at a time that marked the start of a bull run for the Stockholm stock exchange.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 10:21 – 12:45 : ''1981 får Refaat upp ögonen på...''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Success ==
In the first half of the 1980s, the Fermenta stock price rose steadily, which allowed El-Sayed to embark on a campaign of acquisition. In early 1985, he notably bought [[Pierrel]] from Italian industrial [[Vittorio de Nora]]. Pierrel's activities were diversified; they included pharmacy, with the production of antibiotics, chemicals, with [[aspartam]], etc... El-Sayed's plan was to retain only the activities he was interested in, and to sell other operations for a profit. Through this campaign of acquisition, he was hoping to turn Fermenta into a giant in the biotechnology sector. Just after taking the control of Pierrel, El-Sayed presented his new board of directors, which included big names of the Swedish business scene, such as [[Ove Sundberg]] from [[AkzoNobel|KemaNobel]], [[Gösta Bystedt]] and [[Simon Liliedahl]] from [[Electrolux]], and advertising guru [[Leon Nordin]].&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 12:45 – 15:13 : ''När man nu i början på 1985...''&lt;/ref&gt;

After an aborted attempt at buying Swedish giant Kabi Vitrum, El-Sayed turned his attention to the American firm for which he had worked in the 1970s: he bought SDS Biotech for 500 million kronor. The Fermenta stock price rose from 85 to 230 kronor between January and December 1985. The Swedish media started to show interest in the Fermenta phenomenon – it had taken only a few years for the company to become a major actor in the pharmaceutical industry. El-Sayed was presented as an unusual corporate leader: at barely 10 000 kronor, his salary was at par with that of a worker of the Strängnäs plant, he was living in a flat in the outskirts of Stockholm, and he played amateur football in the Swedish third division. On 22 December 1985, the TV news program ''Rapport'' named him « Swede of the year » for his success as Fermenta's chief, for his unconventional management style, and for « putting the light on the important role played by immigrants in the Swedish society.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 21:53 – 24:53 : ''Att den tänkta affären mellan Fermenta...''&lt;/ref&gt; »

On 8 January 1986, El-Sayed appeared in front of TV cameras besides [[Pehr G. Gyllenhammar]], the most powerful man in Sweden's industry. Volvo and Fermenta announced a deal, through which Volvo was exchanging its participations in two pharmaceutical companies, Soneson and Pharmacia, against a 20% stake in Fermenta. With this deal, Fermenta was becoming a world giant in the pharmaceutical industry, with a market capitalisation of four billion kronor. The news made the front page of the [[Financial Times]]. It was said that it had taken El-Sayed only 10 minutes to win the favours of Gyllenhammar. The Fermenta stock reached a new high at 325 kronor, while El-Sayed was at the peak of his glory. He would remain there for a little over a month.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 26:38 – 29:55 : ''Vid årskiftet 85-86 står Refaat El-Sayed...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/10/business/ab-fermenta.html ''A.B. Fermenta'']. New York Times. 10 January 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The DSc scandal ==
In February 1986, researcher and environmental activist [[Björn Gillberg]], whom El-Sayed knew from his time at Ultuna, publicly accused Fermenta of pollution at the site of the Strängnäs plant. Gillberg also accused El-Sayed of lying about his academic qualifications, and of falsely claiming he was a Doctor of Science. Journalists who tried to verify these allegations discovered that according to some sources, El-Sayed was awarded his Doctor degree in California, while according to others, he had earned it in Sweden.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 30:55 – 32:18 : ''Men det var just här, i februari 1986...''&lt;/ref&gt;

This scandal had disastrous effects for El-Sayed and Fermenta. That he was not a Doctor was in itself a mere detail, which on one hand stripped him of the « genius » aura that had so far surrounded him, but on the other hand added to the myth of the self-made billionaire. But his 48 hours of awkward denial cost him the trust of the markets, of the business world.

== The fall ==
After the DSc scandal, the markets were unforgiving. The Fermenta stock price dropped, and the Volvo and Pharmacia shares were also slammed. El-Sayed was soon compelled to leave his position as CEO, while Volvo reminded in a press release that the partnership agreement was not yet finalised. Fermenta's new CEO [[Ove Sundberg]] granted Volvo full access to the company's books. El-Sayed remained optimistic in his public comments, but it became clearer and clearer that Volvo was going to backtrack, which was eventually confirmed on 25 February.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 34:33 – 40:31 : ''I två dygn hade han nekat anklagelserna...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/26/business/volvo-cancels-fermenta-link.html Volvo cancels Fermenta link]. New York Times. 26 February 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a financial disaster for El-Sayed, who had personally bought four millions of Fermenta shares with the intention of exchanging them with Pharmacia. The drop in the stock price meant he was soon riddled with debts amounting to more than a billion kronor.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 42:42 – 43:26 : ''Och den spruckna Volvo-affären skulle...''&lt;/ref&gt;

For Fermenta however, optimism was still ''de rigueur:'' it showed a profit for the first quarter of 1986. But in May, . Nevertheless, two weeks later, El-Sayed made a comeback at the top of Fermenta. In the hope of clearing his debts, he attempted to sell the company to [[Montedison]], and later to [[Bayer AG|Bayer]], but with no success.

In December 1986, Fermenta's auditors discovered extensive irregularities in Fermenta's financial statements. Refaat El-Sayed was sentenced to five years in prison by the district court in 1989, as well as banning him from engaging in commercial activities on charges of fraud, gross indebtedness against creditors, unfair benefit of creditors and breaches of the Securities Market Act. In the following year, the Sveahov Court raised the sentence to six years. El-Saayed was released in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fermenta : skandalen som alla vill glömma|url=http://www.affarsvarlden.se/hem/nyheter/article2579424.ece|last=Bränfeldt|first=Lars-Eric|work=Äffärsvärlden|accessdate=27 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermenta's board was also sentenced to daily fines for environmental crime.

== Hebi Health Care ==
El-Sayed's charisma had not yet vanished: Hebi Health Care soon gathered 45 000 shareholders, and its market capitalisation reached one half billion kronor.Hebi Health Care relocated part of its activities to Egypt.

In business management theory, the '''smiling curve''' is a graphical depiction of how [[value added]] varies across the different stages of bringing a product on to the market in an IT-related manufacturing industry. The concept was first proposed around 1992 by [[Stan Shih]], the founder of [[Acer Inc.]], an IT company headquartered in [[Taiwan]]. According to Shih's observation, in the personal computer industry, the two ends of the [[value chain]] &amp;ndash; conception and marketing &amp;ndash; command higher values added to the product than the middle part of the value chain &amp;ndash; manufacturing. If this phenomenon is presented in a graph with a Y-axis for value-added and an X-axis for value chain (stage of production), the resulting curve appears like a "smile".

Based on this model, the Acer company adopted a business strategy to reorient itself from manufacturing into global marketing of brand-name PC-related products and services. Acer accordingly invested heavily in [[R&amp;D]] to develop innovative technology. The concept later became widely cited to describe the distribution of value-adding potentials in other types of industry to justify business strategies aimed at higher value-adding activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smiling curve|url=http://money.163.com/10/0625/14/6A1GCL9H00253G87.html.|website=money.163|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory origins==

===Pursuing the new trend===

Although the smile curve theory is very simple but it points out the future direction of Taiwan’s industrial efforts, the only way is moving and positioning towards high value-adding block through the guidance of value-adding concept, therefore, the industry can continue the development and sustainable management. Although the construction is one of the locomotive industry, but under a mature industrial trend, [[market saturation]] and traditional manufacturing which only concerned low value-adding area, has experienced a decade of economic downturn. Smiling curve theory can provide a new thinking direction.

===Diagram illustration===

[[File:Smiling Curve.svg|thumb|Smiling Curve]]
The most lucrative value area focus on both ends of the [[value chain]] – [[R&amp;D]] and marketing. The only thing can do is just agency or [[OEM]] without R&amp;D capability, which earn a little money;
Without marketing ability, the product will only be treated as rubbish over disposal period.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smiling curve definition|url=http://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/微笑曲线理论.|website=MBA encyclopedia|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realizing the fact===

[[BYD Company|BYD]]'s Wang once lamented that Chinese companies had only learned how to organize workers, but have not learned how to organize engineers, it can only make a living in the most inhospitable terrain area of the manufacturing. If it can use advanced methods to organize a large number of Chinese Engineers, then China is the entrepreneur's treasure. Typically, knowledge-intensive organizations can find ways to organize engineers. Management master [[Peter Drucker]] said: "The most important management in the 21st century is to manage those intelligent workers." Which is the most successful aspect that [[Huawei]] has done among the Chinese companies. Among those employees, technology research and developing staff accounted for 46%, marketing and service staff accounted for 33%, management and other personnel accounted for 9%, and the remaining 12% is workers. For 20 years, [[Huawei]] has maintained this ratio, human resource allocation shows “high developing and marketing on both sides" of the "smile curve."

==Theory pressure==

[[Stan Shih]] ‘s smiling curve is promoted in order to reproducing [[Acer Inc.|Acer]]. However, there must be some breed factors. Some of the factors behind the birth may exist as follows:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not smiling curve's fault|url=http://www.tmtpost.com/17044.html.|website=TMTpost|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitive pressure of globalization===

Under the trend of [[globalization]] of [[high-tech]] product markets, we can use the "chase, catch, run, jump, touch" five words to describe the competitive pressures of the industry. Competitive enterprises continue to catch up, ready to catch up with the leaders, and those leading companies continue to run forward in order to stay ahead of the distance, and finding methods to jump over the barriers. Therefore, the market becomes saturated, only head-on, make price competition, even bloody competition exist. This is the fate of global competition, only the fittest survive.

===Pressure of product life period===

[[High-tech]] products, unless mastering the key technologies or components, among the finished product market, because the fast speed of technology development, fashion also changes quickly, product life periods are changing rapidly, so-called niche products, sometimes become a few % of the profit gross during a few years, therefore generating tremendous pressure on enterprises.

===Survival Pressure of enterprises===

Under the pressure of the foregoing, if technology cannot always be upgraded, strategy cannot leading the market, then under the less profit situation, may turn into a loss, more seriously, even gradually affecting the survival of the enterprise.

===Pressure of value-added===

The value-added of an enterprise can be said that the potential for profit. Mature technology, low requirement to entry, and universalization of technology is easy to become so-called "low-profit" enterprise, also known as low-value-added industries. Normal manufacturing, assembly enterprise is called low-value-added industries, in order to survive, only to keep expanding production capacity to maintain profits. But as long as the market is shrinking, product prices is decreasing, product sales will no longer growing. Enterprise will face to risk immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loss of smiling curve|url=http://tech.qq.com/a/20130217/000033.htm?pgv_ref=aio2012&amp;ptlang=2052.|website=Tencent news|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory factors==

===Trend of industries development===

In order to overcome the pressure of low added value, enterprises only thinking is to move toward the block which high-value added industry trends. In the industry, mastering the key technology and key components is high added value; general manufacturing or [[OEM]] is low added value; product integration services, due to combine a lot of added value, therefore becoming another high-value-added block.

===Needs of industrial developing environment===

Among the blocks of high value-added, the key technologies and key components, may sold to various needs of world market; but integrated services, need to have an appropriate area, and entire industry in this region also has reached considerable development.

===Conclusion===

====Enterprises====

Enterprise’s products and services need to have sustained value-added (earnings), so that can be able to survive.

====Products====

The direction and services of high [[value-added]] products is only way to have a high potential for profit, therefore to ensure business continuity.

==Applications Inspiration==

===The success of products===

Smile curve theory has basically proved that the success of products is inextricably related to concept, research, brand spreading and marketing. Those factors require the company hire and retain highly skilled, intelligent, professionals.  Typically, those professionals will be highly paid, so that countries with high smile curve slope will get more profits, therefore generating growing gaps between countries.

===Compare with developing and development countries ===

Like [[United States]] and other [[developed countries]], they have maintained highly slope of the smile curve, however, [[developing countries]] such as India and China confined to low-level employing and manufacturing. Therefore, if developing countries want to achieve to highly slope of the smile curve, they need more professional analysts, researchers and brand developers to reach higher levels of economic growth. In other words, if developing countries want to compete with developed countries equally, they must require a highly skilled and knowledge team in order to achieve these, government needs to invest heavily and support on basic education and higher education. In the [[long-term]] development, manufacturing country in the world will hardly to sustain the level of economic growth. Developing countries need to let the smiling curve more smile, therefore there will be a fair competition with developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kwan|first1=C.H.|title=China: Wrong part of the smiling curve|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/DJ04Ad01.html|website=Asia Times|date=4 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related to industry==

===Developing countries===

Some developing countries have begun the development of trade and investment liberalization, and the company's internal production network has become globalized. Depending on the strengths of each country, manufacturing form of the developing countries are generally labor-intensive, which means that they only provided low-wage to workers, but those high-tech jobs, such as research and development, are to be borne by the developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smiling curve: Stan shih|url=http://chaitravi.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/the-smiling-curve-stan-shih/|website=Chaitravi's Blog|date=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal division of labor===

The current situation is that between developed and developing countries, there are lots of flowing products and intermediate goods. This phenomenon which cooperating among the same industry is known as horizontal division of labor. 
However, the more accurate name is called vertical division of labor. However, because there are various ways of processes between developed and developing countries, developed countries always focus on high-value process while developing countries always focus on low-value-added processes.

=== Traditional manufacturing===

[[Fareed Zakaria]]'s writings mentioned, the significance of China and their traditional manufacturing dominance, China's manufacturing industry is in the middle stages, so that means production, plus some spare parts supply and engineering design. However, developed countries such as the United States has two complete form, so that is generated smiley curve, the curve shows the value added profits at every stage, and brand and product concepts at high point, the manufacturing industry is located below, values in the retail and service phases rise again. 
With the end of the [[Cold War]] and the former socialist countries into the global economy, there was more and more cheap labor, while developing countries have been watching their profits decline, then resulting in fierce competition. Therefore, increasing the slope of the smile curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brawn|first1=Alan.C.|title=Article: The Smiling Curve|url=http://www.dseg.org/page/article-smiling-curve.|website=Digital Signage Experts Group|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory phenomenon==

Smile curve assumes a phenomenon, in the middle of the process of value-added profits or assembly-type manufacturing value chain is assembled, these processes have a downward trend, which increases at both ends of these processes of the value chain, are the raw material at one end of chain and at the other sales service. This assumption has caused an intense global competition which increasing in the assembly of standardized and modular components.

===Use of  report===

Report examines the assembly-type manufacturing value chain and the formation of the smile curve. Because it use the ratio of the profit as a [[performance indicator]]. All the sources of products produced broader concept in industrial processes. Input-output tables and each firm's annual financial statements were used to calculate total assets and operating surplus.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kimura|first1=Tatsuya|title=The "Smile Curve" Phenomenon in the Japanese Assembly-Type Manufacturing Industry".|url=http://jp.fujitsu.com/group/fri/en/economic/publications/report/2003/report-167.html.|website=Japanese Fujitsu research institute|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analyze six sectors===

The assembly-type manufacturing industry also can be analyzed from:
 
#household electronic appliances, 
#household electric appliances, 
#electronic computing equipment and accessory devices, 
#communications equipment, 
#passenger motor cars,  
#trucks, buses and other vehicles.

In this research, the smile curve explained the household electronic appliances, computer equipment and ancillary equipment, as well as the three sectors trucks, buses and other vehicles. However, the smile curve cannot explain the other three sectors, and assembly-type manufacturing industry as a whole.

==Successful example ==

‘Clockwise’ company is one of the smiling curve practitioners, founded in 1991. Turning occurred in 2004, this year, the ‘Clockwise’ pay all attention on cotton underwear industry, formed a strategic alliance with Colored Cotton Group, controlled famous brand cotton "Choi days” upstream resources, meanwhile use media to publish brand. ‘Clockwise’ business total sales breakthrough billion yuan, became the industry leader.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Early life and management before ABBA==
Stig Anderson was born on 25 January 1931 in [[Hova, Sweden|Hova]], [[Sweden]], the son of a single mother named Ester. Anderson began his career as a chemistry and mathematics teacher at a primary school, by taking night classes&lt;ref name = obitulary/&gt; after leaving school at the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;ABBA: The Lovers Who Conquered The World&amp;nbsp;— Harry Edginton {{ISBN|0-905018-74-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date = January 2011|How could he become a teacher if he left school at 15?}} Having written his first song at age 16&lt;ref name = obitulary/&gt;, Anderson soon entered the [[Swedish popular music]] scene, becoming a music producer, [[Talent manager|manager]] and occasional performer. 

[[File:Ria Valk en Stig Anderson (1961).jpg|thumb|left|Stig Anderson and Dutch singer [[Ria Valk]] (1961)]]
Anderson had begun writing songs as early as 1951, and in 1959 he got his breakthrough with the song "''Är du kär i mig ännu, Klas-Göran?''" ("Are You Still in Love With Me, Klas-Göran?"), written for Swedish singer [[Lill-Babs]]. During the 1960s he was one of Sweden's most prolific songwriters, producing more than 3,000 published titles. Anderson also founded Sweden Music in 1960, as well as several other companies. Three years later, Anderson co-founded [[Polar Music]] with Bengt Bernhag. 

By the late 1960s, he was the manager and producer of [[Björn Ulvaeus]] and [[Benny Andersson]], who would become the two main songwriters of ABBA. He joined the careers of these two, after previously managing the [[Hootenanny Singers]], of which Ulvaeus was a member. Later, in 1972, he began managing [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], and finally in 1976 [[Agnetha Fältskog]] (until December 1975, Fältskog was still bound to Cupol/[[CBS]] Records under a contract). Prior to ABBA's formation, Björn and Benny were living in a [[Volkswagen]] bus and had decided to leave music and gain regular jobs; however, Anderson persuaded them to start a new band, investing considerable money in the group.

Before his time with ABBA, Anderson managed some of the biggest Swedish artists at that time, and had a huge number of hits on the Swedish [[Record chart|charts]]. His success earned him the nickname "The Business" since he often had several artists in the Top 10 at any time with whom he had written, published, and recorded the songs. When requiring fresh ideas, Anderson would travel to New York City, buy songs that had been American hits, and then [[Translation|translate]] or [[Transcription (service)|transcribe]] the [[lyrics]] on the return journey ready for a [[Studio recording|recording session]] shortly after and then have the record on the shelves within a few days. Some songs were sent to [[IFPI]]/[[ASCAP]] for [[copyright infringement]].

== ABBA ==
In the early stages of ABBA, Anderson co-wrote many of the songs' lyrics, among them some of the band's biggest hits, such as "[[Ring Ring (song)|Ring Ring]]" (1973), "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]" (1974), "[[Honey, Honey]]" (1974), "[[I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do]]" (1975), "[[Mamma Mia (song)|Mamma Mia]]" (1975), "[[SOS (ABBA song)|S.O.S]]" (1975), "[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]" (1976), "[[Dancing Queen]]" (1976), "[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]" (1977), and "[[The Name of the Game (ABBA song)|The Name of the Game]]" (1977).

Frequently known as the fifth member of ABBA, besides contributing to the lyrics, he also owned the record label and the publishing company. Anderson gave shares in the company as gifts to Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and [[Michael B. Tretow]] out of friendship as the group became highly successful. Tretow worked on the [[mixing board]] and was the [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]] for the group. According to PolarmusicPrize.org, Anderson's most treasured award was ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Magazine's "Trendsetter Award". Such a distinction had only been presented to one European before Anderson, and that was [[Brian Epstein]], manager of [[The Beatles]].

Anderson was one of the dominant figures behind ABBA, representing their commercial interests and global success through successful record deals. At the same time, he also managed the investment of funds and the enormous financial incomes of Polar Music, holding the majority of stocks. This was an agreement dating back to 1974, and a great deal of the money came from individual record deals he struck for the group, including a ground-breaking agreement for record sales in the [[Soviet Union]] in which ABBA recordings were released in exchange for [[Barrel (unit)#Oil barrel|barrels of oil]]. In the mid-1980s, a considerable part of ABBA's fortune was lost by mismanagement, bad investments, high demands for [[taxation|tax]], and the rise of credit rates.

=== Legal disputes ===

The contract with the performers, as well as the international distribution, ran from a standard publishing and recording deal involving identical contracts, rather than from one written specifically with the performers of the band. This led to problems later, when three of the four ABBA members terminated their relationship with Anderson when it was revealed that Anderson had used this contract to take a percentage of profits at a value of 4.5 million [[euro]]s over the course of many years. A complaint against Anderson was submitted to the Stockholm District Court in June 1990 by Agnetha Fältskog's company ''Agnetha Fältskog Produktion AB'', Benny Andersson's company ''Mono Music AB'', as well as a Dutch company holding Björn Ulvaeus's rights. The dispute was eventually settled out of court in July 1991; the terms of the settlement remain undisclosed.

In 1982, Anni-Frid Lyngstad had sold all the shares in the Polar Music company given to her by Anderson, as she moved abroad.&lt;ref name = obitulary/&gt; She remains the only member never to seek legal recourse for past [[Royalties|royalty fees]] and was not involved in any way with the legal proceedings against Anderson.

== Polar Music Prize ==
In 1989, Anderson made a substantial financial endowment to found the [[Polar Music Prize]] from money he made when he sold the multimillion-dollar record company Polar Records. In this deal nearly all utilisation and license rights, and the registered ABBA trademark, were sold for an unknown sum of money to [[PolyGram]] shortly before the ABBA members took him to court over royalty back payments. Previously, Anderson had licensed ABBA and the members' solo releases to various labels worldwide as a way to earn more royalties. In 1998, PolyGram was in turn sold to [[Seagram]] and merged into what is now one of the Big Three record labels, the [[Universal Music Group]], the company that today holds the rights to the entire ABBA back catalogue.

== Personal life and death ==
Stig Anderson was married to Gudrun Anderson (née Rystedt, 1931-2010), and had two sons, Anders and Lasse, and a daughter Marie. His daughter, Marie Ledin (born in 1957, wife of Swedish star and ABBA concert backing vocalist [[Tomas Ledin]]) was also involved in the music industry. In the mid-1980s she started a new, highly successful record label called ''Record Station'' (sold to German [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in the early 1990s), followed by ''Anderson Records''. ''Anderson Records'' released Anni-Frid Lyngstad's Swedish comeback album ''[[Djupa andetag]]'' in 1996, as well as Michael B. Tretow's ''Greatest Hits'' in 1999.

On 12 September 1997, at the age of 66, Stig Anderson died of a heart attack. He also had severe alcohol problems in the later years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abbasite.com/stig-stikkan-anderson/|title=Stig "Stikkan" Anderson's Biography|publisher=Polar Music International|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was broadcast live by [[Sveriges Television]], an honour generally only reserved for distinguished statesmen or royalty.

The '''Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996''' is an amendment to the [[Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act]], a law governing the management of marine [[fisheries]] in the [[United States]]. Another major amendment to this legislation was later made under the ''Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006''. The SFA was enacted to amend the outdated MSFCMA of 1976. The amendment included changes to the purpose of the act, definitions, and international affairs, as well as many small changes.

The U.S. Senate [[Bill (law)|bill]] S. 39 was passed by the 104th United States Congressional session and enacted into law by the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|42nd President of the United States]] Bill Clinton on October 11, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=52088 |title= William J. Clinton: "Statement on Signing the Sustainable Fisheries Act," October 11, 1996 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
There were several major changes to the purpose of the law: 
# Prohibiting fisheries managers from using social, economic, or any other justifications to allow catch targets to exceed a calculated "maximum sustainable yield."
# Mandating that for each managed species, fisheries managers quantitatively define "[[overfishing]]" (certain specified maximum allowed rates of fishing mortality) and "overfished" (depletion below a certain population level).
# Mandating regular assessment of which fish populations that are overfished, and creating an official list of overfished species in U.S. waters.
# Mandating that for overfished species, plans must be enacted allowing them to recover to quantitatively specified target population levels (usually about one-third of the estimated pre-fishing population) within ten years (with certain exceptions).
# Adding that catches of unintended species or unmarketable fish be reduced, to the extent practicable.
# Adding the promotion of protection of "Essential Fish Habitat."
# Adding the promotion of catch and release programs to conservation and management principles.

==Definitions==
The following terms which became relevant in the twenty years following the original act were added:
* [[bycatch]]
* charter fishing
* [[commercial fishing]]
* economic [[discards]]
* essential fish habitat
* [[fishing community]]
* [[individual fishing quota]]
* optimum yield
* [[overfishing]] (overfished)
* Pacific Insular Area
* [[recreational fishing]]
* regulatory discards
* special areas
* vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States

==International affairs==
Besides establishing the Pacific Insular Area fishery agreement regulations, the SFA directs the Secretary of State to "seek to secure an international agreement to establish standards and measures for bycatch reduction that are comparable to the standards and measures applicable to United States fishermen."

'''Swissmem''' is the '''Swiss association of mechanical and electrical engineering industries''' (MEM industries). With some 320,000 employees, the MEM industries are Switzerland’s largest industrial employer and,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/industry-politics/about-the-industry.html "About the Industry"] Retrieved 2016-02-29.&lt;/ref&gt; since they account for 31 percent of the country’s exports, an important economic and political player. In 2015, the nearly 1,000 member companies of Swissmem exported goods worth 63 billion [[Swiss francs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/industry-politics/about-the-industry.html "About the Industry"] Retrieved 2016-02-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swissmem was created by the merger of two associations: ASM (Association of Swiss Engineering Employers) und VSM (Swiss Association of Machinery Manufacturers). Both associations have been operating under the Swissmem name since 1999. VSM was renamed Swissmem at the beginning of 2007, when it took over all ASM’s activities with the exception of those associated with the sector’s collective bargaining agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/the-association/portrait/historical-background.html "Historical Background"]. Retrieved 2010-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swissmem represents the MEM industries’ interests to the Swiss government, national and international organizations, employee representative bodies and the public. It also acts as the MEM industries’ service centre. In its capacity as employer representative, Swissmem negotiates the terms of the collective bargaining agreement for the MEM industries with the unions. The MEM industries’ collective bargaining agreement is traditionally a benchmark for a large number of collective bargaining agreements in Switzerland, having evolved to its current state of refinement since the "peace agreement" of 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sozialpartner.ch/index-e.htm "Agreement in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Industry"] Retrieved 2010-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
Swissmem is chaired by Hans Hess since November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/information-policy/media/media-communications/single-view/news/hans-hess-ist-neuer-swissmem-praesident/145.html "Hans Hess becomes new Swissmem President"]. Retrieved 2010-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Councillor Johann Niklaus Schneider-Ammann was formerly the President of Swissmem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/information-policy/media/media-communications/single-view/news/grosse-freude-ueber-die-wahl-von-johann-n-schneider-ammann/145.html "Delight at the election of Johann N. Schneider-Ammann"] Retrieved 2010-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, several important officials of Swissmem, ASM or VSM have risen to even more influential positions in the Swiss Employers’ Association (Peter Hasler, Thomas Daum (Switzerland).

Swissmem’s CEO is Peter Dietrich.

== Member companies ==
Swissmem has nearly 1,000 member companies, including all Switzerland’s major industrial enterprises.
Swissmem’s members are divided into the following specialist groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissmem.ch/en/organization-members/specialist-groups.html "Specialist Groups"] Retrieved 2014-02-12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the documentary film|other uses|Sugar Babies (disambiguation){{!}}Sugar Babies}}

'''''The Sugar Babies''''' is a 2007 feature-length [[documentary film]] about exploitation in the sugar plantations of the [[Dominican Republic]]. The film, narrated by [[Edwidge Danticat]], explores how the descendants of African slaves, brought over from Haiti, live and work in unfair conditions akin to "modern day slavery."

==Production==
''The Sugar Babies'' was shot on location in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], [[England]], and the [[United States]]. The 99-minute film is originally in Spanish, French and Creole and sub-titled in English, and produced by the Hope, Courage and Justice Project of New Orleans, the Human Rights Foundation of New York, and the former Siren Studios of Miami.

The film was written, shot, produced, and directed by [[Amy Serrano]]. Its executive producer is Claudia Chiesi, its producer is [[Thor Halvorssen Mendoza|Thor Halvorssen]], Constance Haqq is co-producer and Salvador Longoria and Tico Pujals are associate producers. The film was edited by Jason Ocasio and scored by [[Bill Cruz]].

==Controversy==
The film officially premiered at the Montreal International Haitian Film Festival, but preview screenings in [[Paris]] and [[Miami]] led to heated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2007/06/29/c1a_SUGAR_CANE_0629.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamiherald.com/416/v-print/story/153614.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Miami screening of the film, which included many members of the [[Hispanic]] media of [[South Florida]] and from the Dominican Republic, was the subject of a cease and desist order one hour before the time of screening, as well as a bribery scandal when several radio producers came forward to state that Dominican diplomats had offered them bribes to disrupt the screening and give the film a bad review.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dominicanoshoy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12617&amp;Itemid=46&lt;/ref&gt;
The Paris screening of the film was also the subject of a [[sabotage]] attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=38029 IPS Inter Press Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710222406/http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=38029 |date=2007-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was an "Official Selection" at [[Unifem]]'s [[Through Women's Eyes Film Festival]], the [[New Orleans International Human Rights Film Festival]], and the [[Buffalo Niagara Film Festival]]. It was also an "Official Selection" at both the [[Miami International Film Festival]] and the [[Women's International Film Festival]], but was withdrawn from both South Florida festivals, ostensibly due to pressure from the sugar industry.

''The Sugar Babies'' won the Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the [[Delray Beach Film Festival]], was screened in film festivals and educational venues, and  toured with [[Amnesty International]] in France.{{when|date=November 2018}}

In business, '''value process management''' ('''VPM''') is the management of processes that do with ''value creation and dissemination'' throughout the entire organization. This definition bears some commonality with other related terms as [[process management]] and [[business process management]] but it differentiates itself by being focused entirely on value adding, generating, distributing and presenting to the key [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in the organization. 

VPM can be regarded as the next follow on to [[business process management]] (BPM) the same way  BPM was regarded at its time as the follow-on to [[business process reengineering]] (BPR) in a continually improving, maturing and evolving journey towards more or less a fixed set of desired performance attributes/outcomes.  This evolution/maturity journey manifests itself by shifting attention from pure technology topics, to business focus as we have seen in the middle nineties onwards.  Taking cultural dimensions into consideration, there is a further shift into premium value topics that are highly regarded by all stakeholders in any organization.

VPM neither claims nor intends to quit the business focus as it may seem at first glance. However, it will try to disengage the 'process' concept from 'business' aspects, and extend the scope and reach of the process management to become focused on what it is most worth i.e. VALUE throughout the organization as perceived and appreciated by the key stakeholders.
