== Career ==
As the Executive Chairman of DMCC, Bin Sulayem has played a key role in establishing and positioning DMCC as a major commodities trade hub in the region. Under his leadership, DMCC has introduced a number of value-added products and services; including the establishment of the Dubai Diamond Exchange (DDE),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/diamond/dubai-diamond-exchange/ |title=Dubai Diamond Exchange |website=dmcc.ae |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526225927/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/diamond/dubai-diamond-exchange/ |archivedate=May 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the only diamond exchange in the Arab World affiliated to the [[World Federation of Diamond Bourses]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfdb.com/ |title=World Federation of Diamond Bourses |website=wfdb.com |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2011-08-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718034839/http://wfdb.com/| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubai Tea Trading Centre (DTTC)&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/tea/dubai-tea-trading-centre/ |title=Dubai Tea Trading Centre |publisher=dmcc.ae |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711154915/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/tea/dubai-tea-trading-centre/ |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers a range of value-added facilities to the global tea trade and has contributed to the UAE becoming the world's largest re-exporter of tea;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulfmanagers.com/news-3749-it-s-my-cup-of-tea.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131009070548/http://www.gulfmanagers.com/news-3749-it-s-my-cup-of-tea.html |archivedate=2013-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; DMCC Tradeflow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/tradeflow/ |title=Tradeflow |website=dmcc.ae |accessdate=2012-10-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920054612/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/tradeflow/ |archivedate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a central registry of ownership for commodities stored in Dubai stimulating commodity trade by offering enforceable collateral based trade finance solutions; as well as other services, such as gold refineries, gold and diamond vaults; as well as the UAE gold bullion coins&lt;ref name="www.uaegoldbullioncoins.ae"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaegoldbullioncoins.ae|title=UAE Gold Bullion Coins - DMCC |website=www.uaegoldbullioncoins.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Visions of Dubai&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/gold/visions-of-dubai/ |title=Visions of Dubai |website=dmcc.ae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224011445/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/gold/visions-of-dubai/ |archivedate=2011-12-24 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; gold souvenir coins.

Bin Sulayem joined DMCC in 2001 as a director, prior to the official launch of the entity in 2002, and his responsibilities included overseeing the organisation’s operations. In addition to his responsibilities as Executive Chairman Bin Sulayem also serves as the Director of Human Resources, Director of Dubai Shariah Asset Management (DSAM) and Dubai Commodity Asset Management (DCAM).&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/financialservices/asset-management/ |title=Asset management |website=dmcc.ae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001065400/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/financialservices/asset-management/ |archivedate=October  1, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also played a leading role in reviving Dubai’s traditional pearling industry by launching the Dubai Pearl Exchange&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/pearl/dubai-pearl-exchange/ |title=Dubai Pearl Exchange |website=dmcc.ae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327190753/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/pearl/dubai-pearl-exchange/ |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 and conceptualizing the design of Almas Tower, the tallest commercial building in the Middle East, home to Dubai Diamond Exchange, one of the largest vaults in the UAE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/gold/dmcc-gold-vault/ |title=DMCC gold vault |website=dmcc.ae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327190805/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/gold/dmcc-gold-vault/ |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and DMCC headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameinfo.com/dmccs-ahmed-bin-sulayem-announces-plans-347465 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707193032/http://www.ameinfo.com/dmccs-ahmed-bin-sulayem-announces-plans-347465 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-07 |title=DMCC's Ahmed Bin Sulayem announces plans to build world's tallest commercial tower |website=www.ameinfo.com |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, DMCC hosted the World Federation of Diamond Bourse's annual Presidents' meeting, an initiative spearheaded by Bin Sulayem. This event was the first of its kind to be held in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/diamond/news/news-details/222/ |title=Former South African President Mbeki: UAE has successfully developed into one of the major players in the diamond industry |website=dmcc.ae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929062226/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/diamond/news/news-details/222/ |archivedate=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, on August 15, 2011, Bin Sulayem unveiled the prototype of the UAE's first gold bullion coin. The coin recognises the visionary leadership of [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], President of the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai. Designed by DMCC, the “Khalifa” coin features a portrait of His Highness [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa]] on one side, and on the other, [[Burj Khalifa]], the world’s tallest tower.

Following the announcement of its first gold UAE bullion coin in August 2011, on 2 December 2011, DMCC released the first design impressions of the second UAE bullion coin as part of DMCC’s celebration of the 40th anniversary of the UAE and in recognition of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.
Titled “Palm Jumeirah”, the gold coin features a portrait of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on one side, and on the other, an image of the iconic Palm Jumeirah. The coin is the second in a series and follows the “Burj Khalifa” coin which was successfully launched last August, and paid tribute to His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE.&lt;ref name="www.uaegoldbullioncoins.ae"/&gt;

In June 2012, Bin Sulayem received UN accreditation to represent Western Asia on behalf of [[CIBJO]], the international jewellery confederation of national trade organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zawya.com/story/United_Nations_accreditation_for_Ahmed_bin_Sulayem-ZAWYA20120714060044/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210004407/http://www.zawya.com/story/United_Nations_accreditation_for_Ahmed_bin_Sulayem-ZAWYA20120714060044/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-10 |title=United Nations accreditation for Ahmed bin Sulayem |website=www.zawya.com |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIBJO has been a consultative member of ECOSOC, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamonds.net/News/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=40588&amp;ArticleTitle=CIBJO+President+Addresses+ECOSOC+in+NY|title=CIBJO President Addresses ECOSOC in NY|website= www.diamonds.net |date=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECOSOC is one of the largest agencies operating under the United Nations umbrella, and is a coalition involving government, civil society and the business community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Jewellery Confederation|url=http://www.cibjo.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=235&amp;Itemid=46|website=www.cibjo.org|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in June 2013, Bin Sulayem became recognised as a prominent fan of the [[LA Lakers]] due to the full page advertisement he took out in the [[LA Times]] paying tribute to [[Kobe Bryant]]. The ad thanked [[Kobe Bryant]] for his contributions to the [[LA Lakers]] and wished him a speedy recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakersnation.com/fan-takes-out-full-page-l-a-times-ad-thanking-kobe-bryant/2013/06/09/|title=Fan Takes Out Full-Page L.A.

'''Kuan Yoke Loon''', commonly known as '''Andrew Kuan''' ({{zh|s=关玉麟|t=關玉麟|p=Guān Yù Lín}}) is the managing director of [[executive search]] firm [[Blue Arrow]].  From 2001 to 2004, Kuan was the group [[chief financial officer]] of the [[Jurong Town Corporation]], one of four designated statutory boards that confer eligibility to contest in the presidential elections.

Kuan applied to run as a candidate in the [[Singapore presidential election, 2005]].  However, his application for a Certificate of Eligibility was rejected as his seniority and responsibility as JTC's Group Chief Financial Officer were, in the opinion of the Presidential Elections Committee, not comparable to those required under the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]].

==Attempted candidacy for 2005 Singaporean presidential election==
Kuan joined the [[People's Action Party]] in 1999, and left in 2005 to qualify for the presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://singabloodypore.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2005/8/12/1131563.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927112920/http://singabloodypore.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2005/8/12/1131563.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuan announced his intention to compete in  the [[Singaporean presidential election, 2005|2005 Singapore presidential election]] where the incumbent president [[S R Nathan]] is a candidate. However his application for a certificate of eligibility to compete was unsuccessful resulting to Kuan alleging conspiratorial theories involving the government. 

Kuan was disqualified by the Presidential Elections Committee for failing to meet the criteria for running for President in Singapore. The Committee said Mr Kuan's seniority and responsibility as JTC's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to those required under the Constitution. A presidential candidate is required to have experience as chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least S$100 million. 

Singaporean media have reported extensively on the circumstances surrounding Kuan's departure from his condominium's management council in 2001.  Kuan originally said he left amicably, but later admitted to being voted out with 13 council members voting against him, 2 abstaining and 1 voting for him.  Kuan attributed this to enmity aroused after he filed a police report against council member [[Chia Boon Teck]], who is also a member of [[People's Action Party|PAP]], accusing him of forging signatures.  The case was closed without [[prosecution]], but Chia filed a [[defamation]] suit against Kuan in 2005 after details of the case and his identity were leaked by ''[[The New Paper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/65761.asp | title=Battle begins early for Andrew Kuan | accessdate=2011-01-03 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203013036/http://www.todayonline.com/articles/65761.asp | archivedate=2006-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuan had apologised unreservedly to Chia for embarrassment and distress that his statements had caused. They had reached an out-of-court settlement for Kuan's defamatory comments he had made, the settlement includes compensation for damages as well as legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/197557/1/.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080507171837/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/197557/1/.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-07 |title=Andrew Kuan apologises to ex-neighbour over defamatory remarks |accessdate=2011-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2005, [[Singapore]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Lee Hsien Loong]] called for all candidates to be open about their records, so that Singaporeans can make an informed judgement on them. He also encouraged Andrew Kuan's former employers to come forward, speak freely and tell Singaporeans what they know about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/162289/1/.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20050811013551/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/162289/1/.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-08-11 |title=PM Lee emphasises importance of electing the right person as President |accessdate=2011-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August 2005, Kuan's former employer government-linked [[JTC Corporation]] called a news conference to provide details on the circumstances leading to Kuan's resignation in July 2004. [[Chong Lit Cheong]], chief executive officer of JTC Corporation said that Andrew Kuan's work at JTC was unsatisfactory since his first year there and was asked to resign twice on 2003 and 2004.  No details of why his work was unsatisfactory were provided, other than to note that no fraud or other crime was involved and that Mr Kuan required "quite a fair bit of hand holding". In reply, Kuan noted that he had worked at JTC Corporation for 37 months, extending his contract several times, and he was given performance bonuses and a raise during this period.

==Singapore presidential election, 2011==
Kuan has announced his intention to contest in the [[Singaporean presidential election, 2011|2011 presidential elections]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_689527.html&lt;/ref&gt; Kuan was deemed ineligible once more by the PEC for failing to meet the criteria for running for President in Singapore. The Committee said in a statement that Mr Kuan's seniority and responsibility as JTC's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to positions listed under the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.sg/pressrelease/PreE2011/2011%20-08-11%20Certificates%20of%20Eligibility%20for%20Presidential%20Elections%202011.pdf#zoom=100 PE2011 Certificates of Eligibility]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7203">The '''Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement''' was an agreement signed on 16 March 1921 to facilitate trade between Great Britain and the [[Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic]]. It was signed by [[Robert Horne, 1st Viscount Horne of Slamannan|Robert Horne]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Leonid Krasin]],  Commissar of Foreign Trade.&lt;ref&gt; Misha V. Glenny,"The Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement, March 1921." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 5.2 (1970): 63-82. [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002200947000500203?journalCode=jcha Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenin's [[New Economic Policy]] downplayed socialism and emphasized business dealings with capitalist countries, in an effort to restart the sluggish Russian economy. Britain was the first country to accept Lenin's offer of a trade agreement. It ended the British blockade, and Russian ports now were open to British ships. Both sides agreed to refrain from hostile propaganda. It amounted to de facto diplomatic recognition and opened a period of extensive trade.&lt;ref&gt;Christine A. White,  ''British and American Commercial Relations with Soviet Russia, 1918-1924'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Lloyd George]] first raised the proposal to drop the blockade on Russia, following the [[October Revolution]] at a meeting of the [[Allied Supreme Council]], held on 14 January 1920, four days after the [[Treaty of Versailles]] had been ratified. Originally trade was to be restricted to being with the "Russian people", through [[All Russian Co-operative Society|Centrosoyuz]], the All-Russian Union of Consumer [[Co-operative]] Societies. However, by the end of May 1920, Leonid Krasin had arrived in London and the terms of the agreement had shifted. Also, although originally an ''allied'' proposal, the [[French Third Republic#France and the First World War|French]] declined [[Lord Curzon]]'s invitation to participate, and the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)#Italy.27s territorial settlements and the reaction|Italians]] sent a [[chargé d'affaires]] who only participated in one session. Meanwhile, the [[Bolshevik]]s, upon hearing of the Supreme Council's intention of lifting of the blockade and developing trade with the Co-operatives, responded by taking Centrosoyuz over. Lenin wrote the executive decree promulgated by the [[Council of People's Commissars]] on 27 January which put this into effect. Krasin and his fellow delegates were nominally co-opted on to the board of Centrosoyuz, 
maintaining the fiction that negotiations were being carried out with the Co-operatives Union.&lt;ref&gt; Glenny,  (1970), pp. 63-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First phase of negotiations: from 31 May, to 7 July 1920==
Krasin was accompanied by [[Viktor Nogin]] to London to engage in the negotiations. The British Cabinet discussed the proposed agreement at [[10 Downing Street]] on 28 May 1920. Lord Curzon had previously briefed the meeting:
:'We know from a great variety of sources that the Russian Government is threatened with complete economic disaster, and that it is ready to pay almost any price for the assistance which we - more than anyone else - are in a position to give. We can hardly contemplate coming to its rescue without exacting our price for it, and it seems to me that price can far better be paid in a cessation of Bolshevik hostility in parts of the world important to us, than the ostensible exchange of commodities, the existence of which on any considerable scale in Russia there is grave reason to doubt.'&lt;ref&gt;Cabinet Paper: 'Negotiations with M. Krassin - Note by Lord Curzon'. C.P. 1350, 27 May 1920. CAB. 241106. as quoted ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

There were four meetings held on 31 May, 7 June, 16 June, and 29 June. The first two were more formal, but the third meeting consisted only of Lloyd George, Krasin, Sir Robert Horne, [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian]] and [[Fridtjof Nansen]]. However, the last meeting was to prove crucial. Both Krasin and Lloyd George agreed that there were two principal issues:
* Hostile propaganda and subversion
* pre-1917 debts to British creditors

Faced with an impending meeting with Britain's allies, Lloyd George drew up a four-point plan:
* An armistice and end to hostile propaganda
* The exchange of prisoners
* Mutual recognition of outstanding debts for goods and services
* Exchange of trade missions
Krasin was given 7 days in which to reply and provided passage on board [[HMS Vimiera (1917)|HMS Vimiera]] to [[Reval]]. [[Georgy Chicherin]] responded on 7 July agreeing to these terms in principle.

==Second phase of negotiations: from 8 July, to 11 September 1920==
[[Lev Kamenev]] was appointed the head of the new negotiating team at Chicherin's insistence over Lenin's objections.

==Third phase of negotiations: from 12 September 1920 to 16 March 1921 ==

Negotiations were long and protracted. [[Lenin]] remarked at the 8th All Russian Congress of Soviets on 21 December 1920:
:The treaty, the trade agreement with Britain is not signed yet. At this very moment Krasin is conducting urgent talks on it in London. The British government has handed us its draft, we have given our counterdraft, but it is still obvious that the British government is dragging its feet over the agreement because the reactionary war party is still hard at work there; it has had the upper hand so far and is hindering the conclusion of a trade agreement. It is in our direct interest, and it is our direct duty to give all our support to whatever can help to fortify those parties and groupings who are striving for the signature of this treaty with us.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, ''Sochinenia'', XLII, 97-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Maisky]] was to underline the importance of the agreement thus:
:This diplomatic document, though modest in scope, is of truly historic significance. The Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement was not an ordinary trade treaty with the mere object of regulating commercial operations between two countries; it was an agreement of politico-commercial character: it gave the RSFSR defacto recognition by the most powerful capitalist power in Europe, a power which in those days still successfully contended with the USA for the role of the foremost capitalist country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;I. Maisky, 'Anglo-sovetskoe torgovoe soglashenie 1921 goda', ''Voprosy
Istorii'', No. 5, 1957, 76-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-corporate activism''' holds that the influence of [[big business]] [[corporation]]s is a detriment to the [[public good]] and to the [[democratic process]].

==Disagreements with corporations==
{{confusing|section|date=June 2018}} 
{{refimprove|date=June 2018}} 
[[Activists]]{{Who|date=March 2012}} argue that corporate globalization corresponds to a displacement in the transition from a highly industrial-based economy to one where trade development is connected with the [[financial deregulation]] on the basis of circulation of capital. An increasing number of diverse societies have been changed to [[free market|free-market]] structure, leading to displacement. As this expansion has occurred, market-governed regulation has outrun the grasps of the state. Opponents of corporate globalization hold that the government needs greater power to control the markets, that income inequality is increasing, and that corporations have gained too much power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abeles |first=Marc |title=Globalization, Power, and Survival: an Anthropological Perspective |pages=484–486 |journal=[[Anthropological Quarterly]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |publisher=Institute for Ethnographic Research |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[political left]], activists against [[corporate power]] and influence support a decreased [[income gap]] and improved [[Equity (economics)|economical equity]].

==Counter-arguments==
{{Section OR|date=March 2012}}
The defenders of corporations such as [[Ron Arnold]] highlight that governments do legislate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DiscoverTheNetwork|url=http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=6898|website=DiscoverTheNetwork.org|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ways that restrict the actions of corporations (see [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]]) and that lawbreaking companies and executives are routinely caught and punished, usually in the form of monetary fines.

In addition, from the perspective of [[business ethics]] it might be argued{{By whom|date=March 2012}} that chief executives are not inherently more evil than anyone else and so are no more likely to attempt unethical or illegal activity than the general population. Large multi-national corporations do continue to attempt to erode governmental regulations through in-house or contracted lobbyists who work closely with State and Federal legislators. So as corporate laws continue to lean in their favor, corporate members have improved portals to drive up company profits.

==Alliances==
Anti-corporate activists may often ally themselves with other activists, such as [[environmental activist]]s or [[animal-rights|animal-rights activist]]s in their condemnation of the practices of modern organizations such as the [[McDonald's Corporation]] (see [[McLibel]]) and forestry company Gunns Limited (see [[Gunns 20]]).

In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books (Naomi Klein's 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'' being a well-known example) and films such as ''The Corporation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecorporation.com/index.php ''The Corporation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050609023424/http://www.thecorporation.com/index.php |date=June 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which have to a certain extent supported anti-corporate politics.

==Art activism==
{{Unsourced|section|date=July 2018}}
An artist critical of [[sociopolitical]] agendas in business is conceptualist [[Hans Haacke]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Anti-corporate web sites==
In June 2008, [[Condé Nast Publications]] released an article entitled "The Secret Seven" which it listed the top seven anti-corporate web sites which include: [[WikiLeaks]], [[Mini-Microsoft]], [[Wal-Mart Watch]], [http://www.hobb.org/ HomeOwners for Better Building], Brenda Priddy and Company (automotive spy photos) and finally Apple Rumor Sites [[AppleInsider]] and [[MacRumors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/06/13/Anti-Corporate-Websites |title=The Secret Seven |publisher=Condé Nast Publications |first=Kim |last=Zetter |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730011448/http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/06/13/Anti-Corporate-Websites |archivedate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/06/13/Dotcom-Confidential|title=Dotcom Confidential|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|first=Kim|last=Zetter|date=2008-06-13|accessdate=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New digital media==
{{Advert|section|date=July 2018}}
Media and digital networking have become important features of modern anti-corporate movements. The speed, flexibility, and ability to reach a massive potential audience has provided a technological foundation for contemporary network social movement structure. As a result, communities and interpersonal connections have transformed. The [[internet]] supports and strengthens local ties, but also facilitates new patterns for political activity. Activists have used this medium to operate between both the online and offline political spectrums.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Juris |first=Jeffrey S. |title=The New Digital Media and Activist Networking |pages=191–199 |journal=The Annals of the [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |volume=599 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage Publications, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Email lists, web pages, and open editing software have allowed for changes in organization. Now, actions are planned, information is shared, documents are produced by multiple people, and all of this can be done despite differences in distance. This has led to increased growth in digital collaboration. Activists can presently build ties between diverse topics, open the distribution of information, decentralize and increase collaboration, and self-direct networks.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199" /&gt;

==Rise of anti-corporate globalization==

Close to fifty thousand people [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|protested]] the WTO meetings in Seattle on November 30, 1999. Labor, economic, and environmental activists succeeded in disrupting and closing the meetings due to their disapproval of corporate globalization.  This event became a symbol as anti-globalization networks emerged and became strengthened.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199" /&gt;
The experiences from the protests were distributed throughout the internet via emails and websites. Anti-corporate globalization movements have also expanded through the organization of mass mobilizations, including the anti-WTO protests, which were remarkably successful. In the United States, these movements reemerged after less attention was given to the war in Iraq, resulting in an increase in mass mobilizations.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199" /&gt;

In 1994 Artur Kirilenko along with [[Sergei Polonsky]] founded construction company &lt;span&gt;[[Stroymontazh]] in St. Petersburg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title =Manhattan on the Moskva|author = BRETT FORREST|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/10/realestate/keymagazine/910moscow.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0|work = The New York Times|date =2006-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained its owner and CEO between 1994 and 2010.

In 2000 Stroymontazh corporation opened a branch in Moscow, which had been headed by Sergei Polonsky. Artur Kirilenko remained a head of the St. Petersburg business of the group. In 2002 Polonsky and Kirilenko divided up the business and in 2004 Polonsky created [[Mirax Group]] on the basis of the Moscow branch end exited the St. Petersburg business of Stroymontazh: after dividing up the business Artur Kirilenko became a sole owner of Stroymontazh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Развод окончен|author = Бэла Ляув|url = http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2006/01/31/razvod-okonchen|work =Ведомости|date =2006-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Stroymontazh has delivered over 100,000 sq. meters of residential property and became the leader among the property developers in St. Petersburg.

By 2008 &lt;span&gt;[[Stroymontazh]]&lt;/span&gt; controlled about 10% of the construction market in St Petersburg in the residential sector. In 2008 the company delivered 286,000 square metres of residential property and its sales revenue exceeded 5.5 billion roubles (€150 million). Since inception the company built over 800,000 square metres of residential and 60,000 square metres of commercial property.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russian Developer Stroimontage JSC Has Been Liquidated|author = Insolvency Administration Officer for JSC Stroimontage|url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/russian-developer-stroymontazh-jsc-has-been-liquidated-518394751.html|work = PR Newswire|date =2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company suffered considerable losses as a result of the financial  crisis of 2008-2010 and a corporate conflict with one of its creditors ''Baltisky Bank'', which was subsequently bailed out by [[Alfa-Bank]]. in 2010 &lt;span&gt;[[Stroymontazh]]&lt;/span&gt; went into administration and in July 2015 the company was liquidated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2003 Stroymontazh corporation established a French subsidiary named Stroimotage de Paris and subsequently renamed [[Hermitage Group|Hermitage]]. Emin Iskenderov has become the head of the French operations.

In 2006 Hermitage began construction of its first project Les Allees de l’Hermitage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/06/04/2006/LesEchos/19642-183-ECH_hermitage-immobilier-.htm|title=Hermitage Immobilier. - Les Echos|website=www.lesechos.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-immobilier/2007-01-17/un-russe-a-paris/1085/0/9654|title=Un russe à Paris|last=magazine|first=Le Point,|website=Le Point.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/seine-et-marne/les-russes-investissent-dans-la-pierre-a-montevrain-21-02-2007-2007787015.php|title=Les Russes investissent dans la pierre à Montévrain|last=|first=|date=|work=Le Parisien|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was successfully completed in 2008 and was named the best residential development in Ile-de-France.

This was followed by such projects as:

Domaine du Lac for 1000 apartments, completed in 2009; 

Le Jardin des Muses for 200 apartments, completed in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.infosimmo.com/immobilier/immobilier-neuf/hermitage-devoile-ses-nouveaux-projets-en-france/|title=Hermitage dévoile ses nouveaux projets en France -|date=2007-07-18|work=Infosimmo|access-date=2018-08-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/immobilier/marche-immobilier/20100304.OBS3058/le-groupe-hermitage-cree-immovi.html|title=Le groupe Hermitage crée Immovi|work=L'Obs|access-date=2018-08-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Disputes and litigation ==
At the height of the [[Great Recession]] in 2008, as the construction sector experienced severe liquidity shortage, ''Baltisky Bank'', one of Stroymontazh's creditors, initiated a series of court suits aimed at acquiring the debtor's assets at distressed value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = "Строймонтаж" расстроили крдиторы|author = Халиль Аминов, Яна Карпова|url = http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1104865|work = Коммерсант|date = 2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Artur Kirilenko acted as a guarantor for the loans and ''Baltisky Bank'' also sued him personally for 1.2 billion rubles (€33 million)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926024219/http://www.finansmag.ru/news/34014|title=«Финанс.» «Строймонтаж» пригрозил Балтийскому банку банкротством|date=2015-09-26|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Apart from this ''Baltisky Bank'' also initiated a criminal investigation, which was eventually dropped as the inquiry found no instances of criminal conduct or wrongdoing in Kirilenko’s actions. No signs of premeditated bankruptcy were found in the actions by Stroymontazh's management&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bn.ru/articles/2011/03/10/81080.html|title=Кириленко остался не у дел|author=Павел Никифоров|date=2011-03-10|work=БН-газета}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Transactions involving Stroymontazh's assets were pronounced fair and justified and all proceeds were used for completion of the project construction.

&lt;div&gt;In 2009 Stroimontage filed for bankruptcy, describing it as a “necessary measure”, in order to defend the interests of private investors - primarily buyers of the off-plan apartments - against the hostile actions of ''Baltisky Bank''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = "Строймонтаж" пригрозил Балтийскому банку банкротством|author = |url = http://www.finansmag.ru/news/34014|work = Финанс.-онлайн|date = 2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2010 the court declared ZAO "Stroymontazh" insolvent and it went into bankruptcy administration; Artur Kirilenko resigned as the CEO of the company. By that time Stroymontazh has completed all of its construction projects and fulfilled all its obligations towards off-plan buyers and restructured its liabilities towards all other banks, including [[Bank Saint Petersburg|Bank Saint-Petersburg]], [[Sberbank of Russia|Sberbank]], Alfa-Bank, Baltinvestbank, [[Rosbank]], [[Credit Europe Bank]] and others&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;In February 2015 the Petrograd district court of St. Petersburg validated the settlement agreement between the subsidiaries of Baltisky Bank and Artur Kirilenko as guarantor of Stroymontazh. Later ''Baltisky Bank'' experienced a shareholder conflict, which resulted in it being bailed out by Alfa-Bank and criminal charges being pressed upon its former shareholder and chairman Oleg Shigaev, the initiator of Stroymontazh’s bankruptcy. Oleg Shigaev was subsequently put on a wanted list and charged with fraud and money laundering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Девелопер Артур Кириленко купил у Балтийского банка свой долг в 1 млрд рублей|author = |url = http://www.dp.ru/103w9k/|work = Деловой Петербург|date = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Экс-президент Балтийского банка заочно арестован по делу о хищении|author = |url = http://www.rapsinews.ru/incident_news/20150727/274279738.html|work = РАПСИ|date = 2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Biography work''' is essentially about interest in the human being and the great mystery of existence we call human life.  It is an active practice for developing self-knowledge.  It is a search for meaning out of which may arise greater social understanding—deeper, genuine interest in one's fellow man.  Biography work is founded upon the vast work of [[Rudolf Steiner]], collectively called [[Anthroposophy|spiritual science]] or [[anthroposophy]]--"wisdom or knowledge of the human being."  Anthroposophy is often described as a path from the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the world or cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA026/English/RSP1973/GA026_index.html
| title = Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts
| website = wn.rsarchive.org
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A profound relationship exists between the cosmos or [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]] and the human being as microcosm.  Indeed, anthroposophy suggests the human being ''is'' a microcosm of the macrocosm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA119/English/RSP1968/MacMic_index.html
| title = Macrocosm and Microcosm
| website = wn.rsarchive.org
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, biography work works directly with physical existence, life on earth, which itself speaks volumes, if we will but "learn to read the text" of the individual experience, as well as that of the [[archetype]].  The human being is a bridge then:  on the one hand, embedded in the earth, directed by the rhythms of nature, the seasons, night and day, etc.; and, on the other hand, belonging to the spiritual world.  "The only real hope of people today is probably a renewal of certainty that we are rooted in the earth, and at the same time in the cosmos," as so beautifully described by [[Václav Havel|Vaclav Havel]] (''The Measure of Man'').

== Individuality and Connection to Others ==

The human life, one's biography, is shaped by the inherently creative and uniquely individual power of the "I" or Higher Ego&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/AP1971/GA009_index.html
| title = Theosophy
| website = wn.rsarchive.org

| title = An Outline of Occult Science

| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Higher Self.  It is an exploration of the role of the "I" in unfolding a life full of gifts, opportunities, illnesses, accidents, struggles, tasks, responsibilities, and perhaps above all questions. Biography work invites new self-understanding and, in turn, awakens interest in the experiences of others.  In an evermore virtual world, biography work fosters real meetings and genuine appreciation for the diversity of human endeavor and creativity.   

== History ==
Biography Work was first developed in the 1970s, arising out of a picture of human development given by Rudolf Steiner early in the twentieth century.  Steiner described physical, soul, and spiritual development from birth to death in great detail, and included, as a significant aspect of the whole human being, the soul’s further spiritual growth after death and through successive lifetimes, i.e. [[reincarnation]].  Steiner knew that in our time there would be tremendous need for increased social understanding, and that study of human development would be an essential foundation of such understanding.

One of the earliest descriptions of biography work given by Rudolf Steiner appears in the lecture titled "How Can the Destitution of Soul in Modern Times Be Overcome?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/KnoSpi_index.html
| title = Lecture: How Can the Destitution of Soul in Modern Times Be Overcome?
| website = wn.rsarchive.org
| access-date = 2016-02-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is as follows:  "As many descriptions as possible of how human beings really develop—what I would call the positive natural history of individual human development—must be disseminated in an understanding way.  Wherever we can we should describe how this or that person developed—we should be able to give a loving account of human development, as we have observed it. The study of life is needed, the will to the understanding of life."

Drawing on the many references found in multiple lectures given by Rudolf Steiner, students of his work and leaders in the anthroposophical community began to create practices that are today collectively referred to as "biography work" (or sometimes "social art").  Two of those leaders, [[Bernard Lievegoed]], a Dutch physician, and Gudrun Burkhard, a physician who still lives and practices in Brazil, both teachers and authors as well, led a pioneering initiative and introduced this new way of life-consultation, first in their respective regions and soon to the world.  In the United States, the efforts of George and Gisela O'Neil culminated in the publication (by Florin Lowndes, after the O'Neils' deaths) of ''The Human Life'', a rich depiction of human development, birth to death, a thorough exploration of their original work in developing the life-chart, and a comprehensive collection of references made by Dr. Steiner regarding human biography.

== Method or Ways of Working ==
Biography work is about listening. At the heart of biography work is the understanding that each life story is a unique revelation of intention and deep wisdom. For the biography practitioner, each “journey” is sacred, and there is an understanding that the “traveler” is continually informed by both individual and universal truths. Biography practitioners bring a broad perspective, artistic exercises, and true listening to life explorations.
Biography work is phenomenological; its methods based in [[Phenomenological model|phenomenology]], particularly as developed by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].  Biography practitioners (also called biography workers, social artists) work via the following: workshops, adult education courses, one-on-one or small group conversation, counseling, consultation and continuing education for professionals. 
=== Workshops and Courses ===

These are offered on a variety of themes and the learning process is typically infused with social art.  Sessions might include short talks, biography exercises, work with [[storytelling]], nature observation, artwork, [[meditation]] or inner practice, and conversation.  One of the gifts of working in groups is a heightened appreciation for each unique life as it resonates within the context of universal patterns. 
=== Conversation ===

Being one of the most human of activities, conversation is central to biography work.  
=== Counseling ===

Some certified biography practitioners are also licensed in counseling, psychotherapy, social work and the like. They typically work in a formal or clinical setting and are able to address crises, life-changing events, inner difficulties, and illness.
=== Consultation and Continuing Education ===
 
Biography practitioners can bring new perspectives to existing professions such as art therapy, medicine, care for the elderly, hospice, work with the homeless, and more.

'''Bjarte Baasland''' (born 5 March 1974) is a former Norwegian businessman and convicted [[fraudster]].

He became famous in Norway in connection with the ''Baasland case'' in the autumn of 2008, when it was revealed that he had [[Problem gambling|gambled]] away almost {{NOK|60 million}} (more than €7 million) that he borrowed from family friends and banks.&lt;ref name="Norway 2008a"&gt;{{cite web |last=Norway |first=Aftenposten |title=Baasland lost a fortune gambling - Aftenposten.no |website=aftenposten.no |date=2008-10-20 |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2659341.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020090928/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2659341.ece |archive-date=2008-10-20 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of [[Ernst Baasland]], who at the time was a [[Diocese of Stavanger|Bishop of Stavanger]] in the [[Church of Norway]].

[[Image:Lucent-campinas.jpg|thumb|Main building of Lucent Brazil in Campinas.]]
'''Brazilian Silicon Valley''' is a term commonly applied to the region of [[Campinas]] and in southern region this term is applied for [[Florianópolis]] city, [[Brazil]] because of its similarity to the 'original' [[Silicon Valley]], located in [[California]] in the [[United States|USA]].

==Characteristics==

Campinas has gained this distinction because it has several comparable features, such as:

*It is a modern city, located near a giant [[metropolis]], [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]]
*It has a vibrant, [[high-tech]] [[university]] and [[research]] environment, composed of the University of Campinas ([[UNICAMP]]), the Pontificial Catholic University of Campinas ([[PUCCAMP]]), the FACAMP, the UNISAL (Centro Universitário Salesiano de São Paulo), the Center for Research and Development in Telecommunications ([[CPqD]]), the [[National Laboratory of Synchrotron Light]], the [[Renato Archer Research Institute]] (CenPRA), the Brazilian Company of Agricultural Research ([[EMBRAPA]]), the [[Agronomical Institute of Campinas]], the Biological Institute, the Food Technology Institute, the [[Eldorado Institute]], the [[Werner von Braun Institute]] and several others. Campinas boasts a researcher/population ratio equal to those of the most advanced technology centers.
*A number of high-tech, non-pollutant electrical and [[electronics]] industries have settled around Campinas, such as [[IBM]], [[Lucent]], [[Samsung]], [[Nortel]], [[Compaq]], [[Freescale Semiconductor]], [[Motorola]], [[Dell]], [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], [[Huawei]], [[3M]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[Celestica]], [[Solectron]], and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]].
*Several [[industrial park]]s and [[business incubator|incubator]]s for high tech companies in the fields of [[microelectronics]], [[computers]], [[software]], [[telecommunications]], etc. have developed there.

==History==
Until the 1970s, the Campinas region had few industries and had an [[Economic system|economy]] based on [[agriculture]] and in the services and [[commerce]] sectors. With the foundation of UNICAMP and the ready availability of high-quality [[researcher]]s, [[engineer]]s and [[student]]s focused on [[physics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[computer sciences]], [[mathematics]], [[mechanical engineering]], etc., a number of high-tech companies started to establish their industrial plants and [[R&amp;D]] labs nearby, such as [[IBM]]. The municipality of Campinas and those surrounding it began to foster actively the growth of this new area, and the CIATEC I and II ([[Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Pólo de Alta Tecnologia de Campinas]]) industrial zones were established around the university campus, in the subdistrict of [[Barão Geraldo]]. The Center for Research and Development (CPqD) set up by [[Telebras]], a state holding for the [[telecommunications]] industry in Brazil, which had grown enormously under the military regime umbrella, was the second boost to Campinas Silicon Valley. A law was passed by the Federal government, protecting Brazilian-made technology against imports, and this resulted in further growth. Together with UNICAMP researchers a number of pioneering developments occurred in the brand-new areas of [[laser]]s, [[fiber optics]], [[digital telephony]], [[computer]] technology, [[software]] development, and so on. In addition, the [[Petrobras]] state-owned [[Petroleum|oil]] giant was starting to develop a long range oil exploration program with the aim of making Brazil independent of oil imports, a policy also started by the military for strategic and economic reasons (the [[1979 energy crisis|oil shock]] had deeply affected the country), and UNICAMP was one of the leading research universities to participate. In this respect, UNICAMP's open philosophy of collaboration with the private sector (unheard of in Brazil until that time), established by his visionary founder and first rector, Dr. [[Zeferino Vaz]], prepared the way for a unique synergy between industry and university.

==Other areas==
Other areas in Brazil are also claiming a similar status to Campinas Silicon Valley, although they are much less organized and with smaller companies. They are:
* [[Araraquara]] and [[São Carlos]], [[State of São Paulo]], with a high technology industries and [[University of São Paulo]] - USP, [[Federal University of São Carlos]] - UFSCar and [[Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho]] - UNESP.
* [[Recife]], state of [[Pernambuco]], with a budding Digital Port and many collaborative ties with the [[Universidade Federal de Pernambuco]]
* The Vale do [[Sapucaí River (Minas Gerais)|Sapucaí]] in Minas Gerais, with several cities (such as [[Santa Rita do Sapucai]]) where collaboration between high-tech industries and universities (such as [[INATEL]]) is generally recognized as one of the best examples of a nascent Silicon Valley.
* [[Belo Horizonte]], state of [[Minas Gerais]], not properly a Silicon Valley because it has mostly a software industry, but the upcoming [[BHTec]] along with possible semiconductor industry developments in its metropolitan area (specifically, in [[Confins]]) could change this situation.
* [[Florianópolis]], state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], also has mostly a software industry.
* The cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Curitiba]], [[Blumenau]] and [[Londrina]], all in the Southeast and South, have also a strongly developed digital economy.

The '''Campus Blairon''' is a [[business incubator]], education site, local government site, medical post and a seminar centre located in [[Turnhout]] in the [[campine]] region of the [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp province]] ([[Belgium]]). Both the [[Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen]] and the [[Katholieke Hogeschool Kempen]] are located on the Campus.

==History==
For about 50 years the ''Campus Blairon'' was known as the training centre nr. 3 ''Majoor Blairon'' of the [[Belgian Land Component|Belgian army]]. New [[Army recruit|recruits]] started their training at the Blairon [[barracks]]. In 1994 the last recruits started their training and in 1999 the military site was closed. A new destination for the building was sought for and the new project started in 2000.

* 2000: The gate building was sold to the [[Flemish Innovation Center for Graphic Communication]].
* 2001: The Northern area was sold the ''Katholieke Hogeschool Kempen'' (KHK, E: Catholic College of the Campine).
* 2002: Opening of the Europeion building
* 2003: First users enter the [[Pieter Corbeels]] building.
* 2004: [[Movie theater|Cinema]] was sold to the ''Van Eyck Group'' and the ''Stadskantoor'' (E: City office) is opened.
* 2005: The ''Arrestatiegebouw links'' (E: Prisonbuilding left) was sold to the [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp province]] and the new parking space was opened.
* 2006: The medical post starts in the [[Pieter Corbeels]] building.
* 2008: The last available open space of the Pieter Corbeels building is being used and the project ''Lokerenstraat KLE'' starts. The former Paradeplein (E: Parade square) becomes a parking site.

It is also distinct from the [[financial district]], which in this case is neighboring [[Brickell]] to the south.

[[File:Macy's downtown Miami, historic Burdine's Department Store building.jpg|thumb|right|The Burdine's Department Store, built in 1912, is located in the very heart of Miami at [[Miami Avenue]] and [[Flagler Street]], which divide the Miami Grid street numbering pattern.]]
The City of Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896 with a population of just over 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmsf.org/history/south-florida-brief-history.htm|title=South Florida: A Brief History|author1=Williams, Linda K.|author2=George, Paul S.|publisher=Historical Museum of South Florida|accessdate=August 24, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429002717/http://www.hmsf.org/history/south-florida-brief-history.htm|archivedate=April 29, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Downtown is the historic heart of Miami, and along with [[Coconut Grove]], is the oldest settled area of Miami, with early pioneer settlement dating to the early 19th century. Urban development began in the 1890s with the construction of the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] by [[Standard Oil]] industrialist [[Henry Flagler]] down to Miami at the insistence of [[Julia Tuttle]]. Flagler, along with developers such as [[William Brickell]] and [[George E. Merrick]] helped bring developer interest to the city with the construction of hotels, resorts, homes, and the extension of Flagler's rail line. [[Flagler Street]], originating in Downtown, is a major east-west road in Miami named after the tycoon; the [[Julia Tuttle Causeway]], crossing Biscayne Bay just north of Downtown in [[Edgewater (Miami)|Edgewater]], is named in honor of Tuttle.

[[File:Flagler Street.jpg|thumb|right|Looking west down [[Flagler Street]]]]
The CBD has long been [[Urban density|dense]] with retail and office space, as well as some lofts and apartments, but recently has seen large scale high-rise residential development as during Miami housing market booms in the aughts and continuing again in the 2010s. Though the historically wealthy suburb of [[Brickell]] to the south remains much more popular, downtown has seen urban buildings such as [[The Loft (Miami)|The Loft]], [[The Loft 2]], and [[Centro Lofts]] which have no built-in [[Multi-storey car park|parking]] as well as more traditional luxury condos such as the bayfront [[50 Biscayne]] and [[Vizcayne]]. [[Wolfson Campus]], the primary (but not largest) campus of [[Miami-Dade College]] is located in the CBD, with about ten buildings around NE 5 Street and NE 2 Ave. The historic [[Flagler Street]], which is the north-south divider of the street grid in Miami-Dade, may undergo a major renovation from the Miami River to the terminus at Biscayne Boulevard starting by 2016. The project was publicized in 2014 and has faced several delays.&lt;ref name="MTflaglerdelays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamitodaynews.com/2015/10/20/flagler-street-upgrade-faces-two-hurdles/ |title=Flagler Street upgrade faces two hurdles |work=Miami Today |date=October 20, 2015|first= Catherine |last=Lackner |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |via=miamitodaynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===

The [[Metromover]] Inner Loop is located entirely within the CBD, as is [[Metrorail (Miami-Dade County)|Metrorail's]] [[Government Center station (Miami)|Government Center station]], where the rapid transit and people mover systems meet. This is the busiest station for both systems and sees over 15,000 riders on an average weekday. It is located on the west side of downtown in the [[Government Center (Miami)|Government Center]] area, which has a large concentration of city, county, state, and federal offices. The area is also heavily served by the [[Metrobus (Miami-Dade County)]] and [[Miami Trolley]], as well as taxis [[Transportation network company|ridesharing]] and [[carsharing]] services such as [[Uber (company)|Uber]] and [[Car2Go]]. Downtown Miami as defined by [[Walk Score]] which includes Brickell and the [[Arts &amp; Entertainment District]], is considered "very walkable" and as having "world-class public transportation", as well as being "very bikeable".&lt;ref name="walkscore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.walkscore.com/FL/Miami/Downtown |title=Downtown|publisher=[[Walk Score]] |website=walkscore.com|accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5105">A '''decision game''' is an exercise in which a [[teacher]] presents [[Student|students]] with a scenario, asks them to take on the role of a character in that scenario, and then asks them to solve problems as if they were that character.  If the scenario is based entirely upon a reliable historical narrative, a decision game is also a ''[[case method|decision-forcing case]]''.  However, if any of the elements in the scenario are fictional, then the exercise is a ''fictional decision game''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/2215/1460284/Decision-Forcing-Cases.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Until the late twentieth century, most decision games dealt with problems drawn from the realm of tactics.  The exceptions to this general rule, moreover, were incidental rather than deliberate.  That is, while authors of [[case method | decision-forcing cases]] in such disciplines as business management and public policy would sometimes fictionalize their cases (thereby converting them into fictional decision games), these works were invariably (if erroneously) described as "case studies".  Because of this, the history of the decision game was, until recently, very hard to distinguish from the history of the [[tactical decision game]].

Since the 1990s, decision games dealing with matters other than military tactics have made their appearance.  Some of these exercises deal with situations, such as those faced by police officers, fire fighters, and first responders, that have so much in common with tactical military problems that they are accurately described as "tactical decision games".    In other instances, the problems are so different from those faced by military tacticians that the use of the term "tactical decision games" would be misleading.

==Elements of a decision game==

A decision game has two indispensable elements:

# The presentation of the problem to participants.
# The discussion of solutions.

In most instances, however, the instructor will add a third element, which is the presentation of a "wrap up" solution to the problem.  If the decision game is fictional, this would be his own solution to the problem.  If the decision game is a decision-forcing case, then the solution would be the decision made by the protagonist of the case, followed by the immediate results of that decision.

==Types of decision games==

The taxonomy of decision games is based upon two attributes.  The first of these, whether the game is historical (real) or fictional (imaginary), is a binary attribute.  That is, a decision game can either be real or imaginary, but it cannot be both.  The second attribute, which is the art to which the problem at the heart of the game belongs, is open ended.  That is, there is no inherent limit to the number of arts for which decision games can be created.  Moreover, a given decision game can deal with a problem that belongs to more than one art.  Thus, for example, a decision game designed for police officers may deal with both ethics and tactics.

Common types of decision games include:

* business decision games 
* ethical decision games
* firefighting decision games
* leadership decision games
* logistical decision games
* operational decision games 
* police decision games 
* strategic decision games 
* [[tactical decision game|tactical decision games]]

'''Ely Calil''' (8 December 1945 – 28 May 2018) was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] businessman holding [[United Kingdom|British]] citizenship. He was one of the richest men in Britain; ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'' estimated his wealth in 2010 to be around £350 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
His ancestry can be traced back to 1920s or 30s when his family set up their home in what's today [[Turkey]] after leaving [[Lebanon]], but then returned to Lebanon after [[Ataturk]]'s policies discriminating against [[Christianity in Turkey|Christians]]. Before he was born, his family set up an oil mill for groundnut processing in Lebanon in 1941. His father, George Khalil, died in 1970, leaving behind two sons, him [Ely] and Bernard, and was said to have bequeathed £20 million to Ely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Under fire: Lebanese millionaire who seems to know everybody|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/under-fire-lebanese-millionaire-who-seems-to-know-everybody-53489.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=26 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations ==
In 2002, Calil was arrested in [[Paris]] in connection with the [[Elf Aquitaine]] scandal but was released on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Calil was alleged to be part in the failed [[2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'état attempt|coup d'état in Equatorial Guinea]] and is currently sought by courts both in Equatorial Guinea and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaisse, Mark. ''Rich, Betrayed en Lonely. Reconstruction of the international plot against Equatorial Guinea'' (PREG Publications, Malabo, 2011){{pageneeded|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, he was sued by the Equatorial Guinean government for allegedly having raised $750 000 to finance the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK businessman sued for coup|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/UK-businessman-sued-for-coup-20040910|publisher=News 24 Archives|accessdate=10 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married his first wife, a [[Tennessee]] tobacco heiress named Frances Condon, at [[Roman Catholic]] church in Farm Street, [[Mayfair]] in 1972. The couple divorced in 1985, and the following year, Calil married a Lebanese socialite, Hayat Emma Morowa. The marriage also failed, and Calil married his third wife, Renuka Jaine, in 1989. He died on 28 May 2018 after falling down stairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ely-calil-oil-wonga-coup-equatorial-guinea-simon-mann-mark-thatcher-a8382886.html|title=Ely Calil: The oil magnate who financed the failed 'wonga coup' in Equatorial Guinea|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equitana''' is a [[trade fair]] organization for [[Equestrianism|equestrian sports]]. This bi-annual trade fair first opened in 1972 in [[Essen]], [[Germany]], and holds events in Germany, the United States and Australia.

==Germany==
The 2009 fair was held on 14–21 March at Essen fairground.&lt;ref name="equi2009-1"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.derwesten.de/nachrichten/zeusmedienwelten/zeus/fuer-schueler/zeus-regional/luenen/Komplettpaket-fuer-Pferd-und-Reiter-id572524.html | title= Komplettpaket für Pferd und Reiter| author= Veronika Altebäumer | publisher=''[[WAZ-Mediengruppe]]''|language=German | date= April 1, 2009 | accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 850 exhibitors from 30 countries registered for the trade fair, which was visited by 213,000 visitors from Germany and around the world. Equitana is one of Germany's most visited trade fairs.&lt;ref name="equitana.com"&gt;http://www.equitana.com/contract_extension_finalised_114.224.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2010 it was announced that Equitana had entered into a ten-year contract to ensure that Essen which will remain the “horse world’s trade fair capital“ for another five events until the year 2019.&lt;ref name="equitana.com"/&gt;

The 2011 Equitana took place on 12–20 March 2011. In 2010, Equitana will host a festival of equestrian sports, and in 2013 the Equestrian Sports World Fair will return to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equitana.com/|title=EQUITANA – Messe für Pferdesport, Reitsport, Pferdemesse, Pferde Messe|author=Thyen, Christina|date=21 June 2010|work=equitana.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
There was also Equitana USA, a similar trade fair that was held in Louisville, Kentucky.&lt;ref name="equiusa97"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/1996/07/15/story3.html | title= Equitana USA equestrian event gets big response, making it a hot bet to appear annually | author= Terry Boyd | publisher=''[[Business First of Louisville]]'' | date= July 12, 1996 | accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Equitana expos have been held biennially in [[Melbourne]] since 1999, attracting more than 50,000 visitors per event. In 2004, the event won a Victorian Tourism Award in the Major Event or Festival category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitvictoria.com/displayobject.cfm/objectid.0005BC8A-F88D-1EAD-9EAB80C476A90000/ Equitana Melbourne]&lt;/ref&gt;

The event has also been held in [[Brisbane]] in 2002 and since 2011 has been held biennially at Sydney Showgrounds, alternating each year with the Melbourne Showgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/landline/stories/s736709.htm|title=Landline - 1/12/2002: Brisbane Equitana the largest horse expo ever .

'''Florentino Pérez Rodríguez''' ({{IPA-es|floɾenˈtino ˈpeɾeθ roˈðɾiɣeθ}}; born 8 March 1947) is a Spanish [[businessman]], civil engineer, former politician, and current president of [[Real Madrid C.F.]], as well as [[Grupo ACS]], a civil engineering company.

==Early career==
Pérez attended the [[Polytechnic University of Madrid]].&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Florentino-Perez_6IVF.html | work=Forbes | title=#677 Florentino Perez | date=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pérez joined the [[Democratic Center Union (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Centre]] party in 1979, serving among others on the [[Madrid]] city council.

In 1986, Pérez ran in the Spanish general elections as candidate for the ''Partido Reformista Democrático'' (Democratic Reform Party).&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

In 1993, he was named vice president of OCP Construcciones. After the fusion of OCP with Gines y Navarro into [[Grupo ACS|Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A.]] (ACS) in 1997, he became president of the new company.

As of 2018 he leads [[Grupo ACS]],&lt;ref&gt;https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=https://www.grupoacs.com/&amp;prev=search&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's largest construction company, and has a net worth of $2.1b.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/profile/florentino-perez/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real Madrid==
Florentino Pérez first ran for the presidency of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 19 February 1995 election. He campaigned on the poor financial situation of the club and the alleged extensive mismanagement by the board, but lost to the incumbent [[Ramón Mendoza]] by 699 votes.

===First term=== &lt;!--He wasn't elected the first time he tried, therefore his second attempt can't be termed as a second term. His second term began in 2004--&gt;
His second attempt was more successful; he took over as president in 2000, beating the current chairman at that time, [[Lorenzo Sanz]]. Sanz assumed that the recently won [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]s in 1998 and 2000 would give him enough credit to win the elections, but Pérez's campaign, once again highlighting the financial problems of the club and claims of mismanagement by the previous boards, proved otherwise. Pérez's promise to bring in [[Luís Figo]] from arch-rivals [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] also played a decisive role in the elections. Pérez was reelected in 2004 with 94.2% of the total votes.

Figo also marked the start of Pérez's policy to bring one of the best football players in the world to Real Madrid each season. The strategy was initially known as that of ''Zidanes y [[Francisco Pavón|Pavones]]'' - in which superstars would play alongside the [[Cantera|''Canteranos'']], but the players were soon popularly referred to as ''[[Galáctico]]s''. In 2001, [[Zinedine Zidane]] was signed from [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] for a then-world record transfer fee of [[Euro|€]]77.5 million. He was followed by [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] in 2002, [[David Beckham]] in 2003, [[Michael Owen]] in 2004 and [[Robinho]] for a short while in 2005. Initially, Pérez's policy worked to great success, as each new ''Galáctico'' had the squad built around them, and the team had a good balance between attack and defence. In his first years in office, Real Madrid won two [[La Liga|Spanish championships]] and its record ninth [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]].

Pérez claimed success in clearing the club's debt; however, this was contradicted by director [[Ramón Calderón]].

Several years after leaving Real, McManaman and Morientes stated that [[Claude Makélélé|Makélélé]] was the most important and least appreciated midfielder, the latter saying, "The loss of Makélélé was the beginning of the end for ''Los Galácticos''... You can see that it was also the beginning of a new dawn for Chelsea." From the [[2003–04 Real Madrid C.F. season|2003–04 season]] onward, with the absence of del Bosque and Makélélé, Real Madrid failed to win a trophy.

Though Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being focused too much on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the football. He announced his resignation on 27 February 2006, acknowledging that the team and the club as a whole needed a new direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=President quits troubled Real |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article735797.ece |newspaper=The Times |date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |location=London |first1=Philippe |last1=Naughton |first2=Miles |last2=Costello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second term=== &lt;!--This is his THIRD TERM. He was re-elected (his second term) in 2004--&gt;
On 14 May 2009, Pérez announced his candidacy for president of Real Madrid in a press conference at the [[Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company|Hotel Ritz Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11827_5323492,00.html|title=Perez makes presidential promise|work=SkySports}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 2009, given that he was the only candidate able to provide the €57,389,000 guarantee necessary to run for the presidency, Pérez was announced as the new president of Real Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202773095983/noticia/ComunicadoOficial/ANNOUNCEMENT_OF_THE_BOARD_OF_DIRECTORS.htm|title=Real Madrid News - Real Madrid CF|work=Real Madrid C.F. - Web Oficial}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8076515.stm|title=Perez to return as Real president |date=1 June 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pérez has continued with the ''Galácticos'' policy pursued in his first term. On 8 June 2009, he bought [[Kaká]] from [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] for just under £60 million,&lt;ref&gt;The Times Madrid Signs Kaká http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article6458907&lt;/ref&gt; while on 11 June, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] accepted an £80 million offer for [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], which would once again break the world record. On 25 June, Pérez and Real Madrid announced the signing of [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] centre-back [[Raúl Albiol]] for €15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202774661659/noticia/ComunicadoOficial/Official_Announcement_2009-06-25.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628000321/http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202774661659/noticia/ComunicadoOficial/Official_Announcement_2009-06-25.htm |archivedate=28 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }} and [[Karim Benzema]] from [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]].&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July, Pérez bought [[Karim Benzema]] from [[Olympique Lyonnais]] for a fee of at least £30 million, which could rise to £35 million, depending on the player's success.

On 5 August 2009, Real Madrid confirmed the signing of [[Xabi Alonso]] from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8184444.stm [[Xabi Alonso]] from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]&lt;/ref&gt; for £30 million; Alonso became the second Liverpool player to join Real Madrid in the same transfer window after full-back [[Álvaro Arbeloa]]'s £5 million switch to the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]] in July.

On 31 May 2010, Pérez presented [[José Mourinho]] as the new coach of Real Madrid in a £6.8 million deal.

During the next three years, Pérez brought a lot of new faces to the team, including the German wonderkid [[Mesut Özil]], and [[Ángel Di María]], who both attracted attention from Europe's elite football clubs during the [[World Cup 2010|2010 World Cup]] in [[South Africa]]. This squad enjoyed its share of domestic success in 2011 and 2012, with the club bringing home a [[Copa del Rey]] title and the [[La Liga|Spanish League]] title. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/232468/report|title=Madrid clinch Copa del Rey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/15/table?season=2011|title=Spanish Primera División Table - ESPN FC|website=www.espnfc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the club's lack of success in European competition and a disappointing [[2012–13 Real Madrid C.F. season|2012–13 season]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/17/sport/football/atletico-copa-del-rey/index.html|title=Mourinho: "Worst season of my career"|first=|last=By|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged Mourinho to depart for his former club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2013/05/20/en/football/real_madrid/1369070464.html|title=Bye Bye Mourinho!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2013, Pérez was awarded a fourth term as the Real Madrid president, bringing in [[Carlo Ancelotti]] to replace Mourinho. Mesut Özil and [[Gonzalo Higuaín]] were sold to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/23929339|title=Mesut Ozil: Arsenal sign Real Madrid midfielder for £42.4m|date=2 September 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[S.S.C.

Pérez also brought in Welsh footballer and PFA Player of the Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/22331030|title=Gareth Bale wins PFA Player of Year and Young Player awards|date=28 April 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gareth Bale]], purchased from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee reported to be in the £86 million range, yet again breaking the world record. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2401904/Gareth-Bale-finally-given-green-light-sign-Real-Madrid-86m.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Transfer record smashed as Real Madrid land Bale with £86MILLION swoop as Tottenham finally let him go|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two promising Spanish talents, playmaker [[Isco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/23083749|title=Isco: Real Madrid agree deal for Manchester City target|date=27 June 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and holding midfielder [[Asier Illarramendi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2013/07/12/4112360/real-madrid-reveal-3219-million-illarra-fee?ICID=CP_124|title=Real Madrid reveal €32.19 million Illarra fee - Goal.com|date=12 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also secured by Pérez prior to the start of the season. The following season proved to be a resounding success, as Real Madrid won the Copa del Rey and its tenth Champions League title.

During the 2014 summer transfer window, Pérez brought in [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] stars [[James Rodríguez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/22/james-rodriguez-signs-real-madrid-monaco|title=James Rodríguez signs for Real Madrid for a reported £63m|first=Guardian|last=staff|date=22 July 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toni Kroos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2695525/Toni-Kroos-completes-24m-Real-Madrid-Bayern-Munich.html|title=Toni Kroos completes £24m move to Real Madrid from Bayern Munich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Keylor Navas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/03/real-madrid-confirm-keylor-navas-signing|title=Real Madrid confirm signing of Costa Rica’s goalkeeper Keylor Navas|first=Press|last=Association|date=3 August 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Real Madrid for a combined cost of £95 million, as well as [[Javier Hernández]] on a loan deal from Manchester United. As a result of the mounting competition for starting spots and wage disputes, Ángel Di María left the club for Manchester United for a British record transfer fee of £60 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/28926665|title=Angel Di Maria: Man Utd pay British record £59.7m for winger|date=26 August 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xabi Alonso]] also left during this transfer window to join [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/28964916|title=Xabi Alonso: Bayern Munich sign Real Madrid player|date=29 August 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, Pérez again showed his muscle in the transfer market when Real Madrid signed the 16-year-old Norwegian [[Martin Ødegaard]] in competition with many of the big clubs in Europe, including Bayern, Barcelona and Arsenal.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Controversies===
After [[Iker Casillas]]' move to [[FC Porto|Porto]] in July 2015, Casillas' agent, Santos Márquez, criticized Pérez, "He doesn't like black players, but is not a racist," and that is why players like [[Claude Makélélé]] and [[Samuel Eto'o]] weren't paid as much as other players. Márquez also expressed that he expects Pérez to leave Real Madrid after Casillas' transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3167152/Real-Madrid-president-Florentino-Perez-doesn-t-like-black-players-claims-Iker-Casillas-agent-says-departing-keeper-turned-Premier-League-offers.|title=Casillas agent: Real Madrid president Perez doesn't like black players|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GPI-Logo-2005.jpg.gif|thumb|right|200px|Logo of the Glass Packaging Institute.]]

The '''Glass Packaging Institute''' (GPI) is the North American [[trade association]] for the glass container industry, headquartered in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. Through GPI, glass container manufacturers advocate job preservation and industry standards, and promote sound energy, environmental, and recycling policies.

==Organization==
The GPI membership consists of 5 glass container manufacturing member companies, and 33 supplier member companies, who provide raw materials, recycled glass, equipment, decorating, and other services to the glass companies.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The country's 46 glass container plants in 22 states comprise a $5.5 billion industry. U.S. glass container manufacturers operate 102 glass furnaces, collectively producing 30 billion glass food, beverage, cosmetic, spirits, wine, and beer containers annually.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The U.S. glass container industry directly employs approximately 18,000 nationwide, and its supplier and customer companies support hundreds of thousands of additional jobs.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 

GPI's Board of Trustees is the core decision-making body in the organization. It is made up of representatives from each of the glass container manufacturing member companies, as well as two representatives from the associate member companies (supplier member companies). The Trustees meet semi-annually for budget, agenda and future planning purposes.

GPI hosts two meetings each year: a Spring Membership Meeting in [[Washington D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], and an Annual Meeting in the Fall.

Dan Steen of O-I serves as the Acting Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the Glass Packaging Institute. Lynn M. Bragg serves as the trade association's President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpi.org/about-gpi/leadership "Leadership."] ''Glass Packaging Institute.'' Retrieved May 26, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board is supplemented with a series of committees, including a Marketing and Communications Committee, Government Affairs Committee, Membership Committee and Drawing and Specifications Committee.

==Container finish standards==
GPI publishes a voluntary set of standards for glass container finishes and their closures to improve compatibility and interchangeability between manufacturers. This includes vials, wine bottles, canning jars, beer bottles, and jugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finish Drawings|url=http://www.gpi.org/industry-resources/finish-drawings|website=www.gpi.org|publisher=Glass Packaging Institute|accessdate=21 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are specified by the nominal outside diameter in millimeters followed by the glass finish number. For example, an 8-425 finish is approximately 8&amp;nbsp;mm neck outside diameter with a 425 finish corresponding to a threaded neck typically found on small vials.

'''Henry Esau Avery''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CMG|CBE|DSO|size=85%}} (3 October 1885 – 22 March 1961) was a New Zealand [[rugby union]] player, military officer and businessman. He played three rugby test matches for New Zealand in 1910, served as quartermaster general in New Zealand's military forces during World War II, and founded Avery Motors, the Wellington franchisee for [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] cars, in the 1920s.

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Wellington]] on 3 October 1884,&lt;ref name="AB profile"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/Profile.asp?ABID=27 |title = Henry Avery | last = Knight | first = Lindsay | publisher = New Zealand Rugby Union | accessdate = 4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avery was the son of Helen Jane Avery (née Boyle) and her husband Joseph Avery. He was educated at [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]].&lt;ref name="AB profile"/&gt; On 2 July 1913 Avery married Alice Maude Draper at the Church of the Nativity in [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=MEX19130703.2.21 | title=Wedding | date=3 July 1913 | work=Marlborough Express | accessdate=3 October 2015 | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple went on to have seven children between 1914 and 1929.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt;

==Rugby union==
A [[Thomas Ellison#Wing-forward|wing-forward]], Avery represented [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]] at a provincial level from 1905 to 1910, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the [[All Blacks]], on their [[1910 New Zealand rugby union tour of Australia|tour of Australia]] in 1910. He played six matches for the All Blacks on that tour including three internationals. He twice served as club captain of the Wellington College Old Boys Rugby Football Club, in 1920 and then from 1923 to 1924.&lt;ref name="AB profile"/&gt;

==Military career==
Avery joined the New Zealand Field Artillery Volunteers as a gunner in 1904, and rose through the ranks to be commissioned as a lieutenant in 1910. In January 1911 he became a regular soldier in the [[New Zealand Military Forces]] as a lieutenant in the [[New Zealand Staff Corps]]. He was promoted to temporary captain in July 1911 and captain in April 1914.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], Avery served overseas with the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] in Egypt, Gallipoli and France, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref name="Military record"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ndhadeliver.natlib.govt.nz/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE19276034 |title=Avery: Henry Esau - WWI 5/420A, WWII 800237, 30280 - Army |date= |website= |publisher=Archives New Zealand |accessdate= 3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1916 he was appointed a [[Distinguished Service Order|Companion of the Distinguished Service Order]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=12947 |city=e |date=5 June 1916 |page=996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and between 1916 and 1919 he was [[mentioned in dispatches]] four times.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt; In the 1919 King's Birthday Honours, Avery was appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] in recognition of services rendered in relation to military operations in France and Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31370 |date=3 June 1919 |page=6793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the war, Avery served as New Zealand's military representative in the War Office in London from 1920 to 1921, and trained at the [[Staff College, Camberley]] from 1921 to 1922.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cenotaph"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/war-memorial/online-cenotaph/record/C36203 |title=Henry Esau Avery |date= |website=Online Cenotaph |publisher=Auckland War Memorial Museum |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was transferred to the Reserve of Officers in 1925.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt; He received the [[New Zealand Long and Efficient Service Medal]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt;

Avery served as president of the Wellington branch of the [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association|Returned Soldiers Association]] from 1930 to 1932.&lt;ref name="Who Was Who"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militarian.com/attachments/avery-jpg.6284/ |title=Avery, Brigadier Henry Esau |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], Avery was recalled to serve at army headquarters in Wellington in August 1940. Two months later he was promoted to colonel and appointed quartermaster general and third military member of the Army Board, and remained in those posts until he was seconded to the War Assets Realisation Board as general manager in September 1944. He retired from that role and the army in March 1949, having been promoted to the rank of brigadier in late 1941.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt; In the [[1943 New Year Honours]], Avery was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35841 |date=1 January 1943 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] (Commander degree) by the American government.&lt;ref name="Cenotaph"/&gt;

==Business career==
Avery obtained the franchise for Ford motor vehicles and established Avery Motors in Wellington in 1924. He was general manager of the company from 1924 to 1936. He then became the secretary and assistant manager of the [[New Zealand Centennial Exhibition]] from 1937 to 1940.&lt;ref name="AB profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who Was Who"/&gt;

[[Image:RevereWickedStatesman.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Political cartoon from 1774 by [[Paul Revere]], depicting Death attacking Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]].]]

The '''Hutchinson Letters Affair''' was an incident that increased tensions between the colonists of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] and the British government prior to the [[American Revolution]].  In June 1773 letters written several years earlier by [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and [[Andrew Oliver]], governor and lieutenant governor of the province at the time of their publication, were published in a [[Boston]] newspaper.  The content of the letters was propagandistically claimed by Massachusetts radical politicians to call for the abridgement of colonial rights, and a duel was fought in England over the matter.

The affair served to inflame tensions in Massachusetts, where implementation of the 1773 [[Tea Act]] was met with resistance that culminated in the [[Boston Tea Party]] in December 1773.  The response of the British government to the publication of the letters served to turn [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the principal figures in the affair, into a committed [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]].

==Background==
[[File:ThomasHutchinson.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], author of some of the inflammatory letters]]
{{Main article|American Revolution}}
During the 1760s, relations between Great Britain and some of its [[British colonization of the Americas|North American colonies]] became strained by a series of Parliamentary laws (including the 1765 [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and the 1767 [[Townshend Acts]]), intended to raise revenue for the crown, and to assert Parliament's authority to pass such legislation despite [[No taxation without representation|a lack of colonial representation]].&lt;ref&gt;Knollenberg, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  These laws had sparked strong protests in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]; the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in particular saw significant unrest and [[direct action]] against crown officials.&lt;ref&gt;Danver, pp. 127–132&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[British Army]] troops into [[Boston]] in 1768 further raised tensions that escalated to the [[Boston Massacre]] in 1770.&lt;ref&gt;Danver, pp. 151–154&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after the enactment of the Townshend Acts, Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and his colonial secretary (and brother-in-law) [[Andrew Oliver]] wrote a series of letters concerning the acts, the protests against them, and containing suggestions on how to respond, to [[Thomas Whately]], an assistant to Prime Minister [[George Grenville]].&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Whately died in 1772, and his papers were turned over to his brother William.  Whately at one point gave access to his brother's papers to [[John Temple (diplomat)|John Temple]], another colonial official who sought to recover letters of his own from those papers.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchinson was appointed governor of Massachusetts in 1770, following the critical publication by opposition politicians of letters written by his predecessor, [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]].&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, pp. 178, 180–182&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next two years Hutchinson engaged in an extended and rancorous written debate with the provincial assembly and the governor's council, both of which were dominated by radical leadership hostile to Parliamentary authority.  The debate centered on the arbitrariness of executive prerogative and the role of Parliament in colonial governance, and greatly deepened divisions in the province.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, pp. 171–173, 211&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Benjamin Franklin 1767.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Benjamin Franklin]], portrait by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]], 1767]]
The Massachusetts debate reached a pitch in England when the colonial secretary, [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]], insisted that [[Benjamin Franklin]], then acting as agent for Massachusetts in London, demanded that the Massachusetts assembly retract its response to a speech the governor gave early in 1772 as part of this ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklin had acquired a packet of about twenty letters that had been written to Whately.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 27. Penegar notes that there are varying interpretations on how many letters constitute the set at issue.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon reading them, Franklin concluded that Hutchinson and Oliver had mischaracterized the situation in the colonies, and thus misled Parliament.  He felt that wider knowledge of these letters would then focus colonial anger away from Parliament and at those who had written the misleading letters.&lt;ref name=Morgan187/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklin sent the letters to [[Thomas Cushing]], the speaker of the Massachusetts assembly, in December 1772.&lt;ref name=Morgan187&gt;Morgan, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  He insisted to Cushing that they not be published or widely circulated.  He specifically wrote that they should be seen only by a few people, and that he was not "at liberty to make the letters public."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters arrived in Massachusetts in March 1773, and came into the hands of [[Samuel Adams]], then serving as the clerk of the Massachusetts assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  By Franklin's instructions, only a select few people, including the Massachusetts [[Committee of Correspondence]], were to see the letters.&lt;ref name=Bailyn239&gt;Bailyn, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;  Alarmed at what they read, Cushing wrote Franklin, asking if the restrictions on their circulation could be eased.  In a response received by Cushing in early June, Franklin reiterated that they were not to be copied or published, but could be shown to anyone.&lt;ref name=Bailyn239/&gt;

==Publication==
A longtime opponent of Hutchinson's, Samuel Adams narrowly followed Franklin's request, but managed to orchestrate a propaganda campaign against Hutchinson without immediately disclosing the letters.  He informed the assembly of the existence of the letters, after which it designated a committee to analyze them.  Strategic leaks suggestive of their content made their way into the press and political discussions, causing Hutchinson much discomfort.  The assembly eventually concluded, according to [[John Hancock]], that in the letters Hutchinson sought to "overthrow the Constitution of this Government, and to introduce arbitrary Power into the Province", and called for the removal of Hutchinson and Oliver.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  Hutchinson complained that Adams and the opposition were misrepresenting what he had written, and that nothing he had written in them on the subject of Parliamentary supremacy went beyond other statements he had made.&lt;ref name="Alexander, p. 152"&gt;Alexander, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;  The letters were finally published in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' in mid-June 1773,&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; causing a political firestorm in Massachusetts and raising significant questions in England.&lt;ref name=Penegar29/&gt;

==Content of the letters==
[[Image:Andrew Oliver.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andrew Oliver]], portrait by [[John Singleton Copley]], c. 1758]]
The letters were written primarily in 1768 and 1769, principally by Hutchinson and Oliver, although the published letters also included some written by Charles Paxton, a customs official and Hutchinson supporter, and Hutchinson's nephew Nathaniel Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  The letters written by Oliver (who became lieutenant governor when Hutchinson became governor) proposed a significant revamping of the Massachusetts government to strengthen the executive, while those of Hutchinson were ruminations on the difficult state of affairs in the province.  Historian [[Bernard Bailyn]] confirms Hutchinson's own assertion that much of the content of his letters expressed relatively little that had not already been publicly stated.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bailyn, Hutchinson's ruminations included the observation that it was impossible for colonists have the full rights they would have in the home country, essentially requiring an "abridgement of what are called [[Rights of Englishmen|English liberties]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;  Hutchinson, unlike Oliver, made no specific proposals on ''how'' the colonial government should be reformed, writing in a letter that was not among those published, "I can think of nothing but what will produce as great an evil as that which it may remove or will be of a very uncertain event."&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;  Oliver's letters, in contrast, specifically proposed that the governor's council, whose members where then elected by the assembly with the governor's consent, be changed to one whose members were appointed by the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
[[Image:Benjamin Franklin at the Court of St. James - NARA - 518216.jpg|thumb|right|19th century engraving depicting Benjamin Franklin's appearance before the Privy Council]]
In England, speculation ran rampant over the source of the leak.  William Whately accused John Temple of taking the letters, which Temple denied, challenging Whately to a duel.  Whately was wounded in the encounter in early December 1773, but neither participant was satisfied, and a second duel was planned.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, pp. 22–23, 34&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to forestall that event, Franklin on [[Christmas Day]] published a letter admitting that he was responsible for the acquisition and transmission of the letters, to prevent "further mischief".&lt;ref name=Penegar34&gt;Penegar, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  He justified his actions by pointing out that the letters had been written between public officials for the purpose of influencing public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hutchinson's opponents in Massachusetts read the letters, they seized on key phrases (including the "abridgement" phrase) to argue that Hutchinson was in fact lobbying the London government to make changes that would effect such an abridgement.  Combined with Oliver's explicit recommendations for reform, they presented this as a clear indication that the provincial leaders were working against the interests of the people and not for them.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

Bostonians were outraged at the content of the published letters, burning Hutchinson and Oliver in effigy on [[Boston Common]].&lt;ref name=Penegar29&gt;Penegar, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  The letters were widely reprinted throughout the British North American colonies, and acts of protest took place as far away as [[Philadelphia]].  The Massachusetts assembly and governor's council petitioned the Board of Trade for Hutchinson's removal.&lt;ref name="Alexander, p. 152"/&gt;  In the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] hearing concerning Hutchinson's fate, in which the aftermath of the [[Boston Tea Party]] was also discussed, Franklin stood silently while he was lambasted by [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Alexander Wedderburn]] for his role in the affair.  He was accused of thievery and dishonor, and called the prime mover in England on behalf of Boston's radical [[Committee of Correspondence]].  The Board of Trade dismissed Franklin from his post as colonial [[Postmaster General (disambiguation)|Postmaster General]]&lt;!--lacking a more suitable link--&gt;, and dismissed the petition for Hutchinson's removal as "groundless" and "vexatious".&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, pp. 83–97&lt;/ref&gt;  Parliament then passed the so-called "[[Coercive Acts]]", a package of measures designed to punish Massachusetts for the tea party.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Hutchinson was recalled, and the Massachusetts governorship was given to the commander of British forces in North America, [[Lieutenant General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Thomas Gage]].  Hutchinson left Massachusetts in May 1774, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;Hosmer, pp. 314–315&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrew Oliver suffered a stroke and died in March 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Thomas Pownall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|[[Thomas Pownall]], who may have given Franklin the letters]]
Gage's implementation of the Coercive Acts further raised tensions that led to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in April 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 41ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklin, who had been politically neutral with respect to the colonial radicals prior to his appearance before the Board of Trade, returned to America in early 1775, committed to independence.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, pp. 284–291&lt;/ref&gt;  He went on to serve in the [[Second Continental Congress]] and became a leading figure in the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, pp. 291ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who gave Franklin the letters?==
A number of candidates have been proposed as the means by which Benjamin Franklin acquired the letters.  John Temple, despite his political differences with Hutchinson, was apparently able to convince the latter in 1774 that he was not involved in their acquisition.  He did, however, claim to know who ''was'' involved, but refused to name him, because that would "prove the ruin of the guilty party."&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  Several historians (including Bernard Bailyn and Bernard Knollenberg) have concluded that [[Thomas Pownall]] was the probable source of the letters.  Pownall was Massachusetts governor before Francis Bernard, had similar views to Franklin on colonial matters, and had access to centers of colonial administration through his brother John, the colonial secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;  Other individuals have also been suggested, but all appear to have an only tenuous connection to Franklin or the situation.  Historian Kenneth Penegar believes the question will remain unanswerable unless new documents emerge to shed light on the episode.&lt;ref&gt;Penegar, pp. 176–178&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9308">'''Intrastat''' is the system for collecting information and producing [[statistics]] on the trade in goods between countries of the [[European Union]] (EU). It began operation on 1 January 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Summaries of EU legislation, [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_for_goods/free_movement_goods_general_framework/l11011a_en.htm Intrastat system - statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States]&lt;/ref&gt; when it replaced customs declarations as the source of trade statistics within the EU. The requirements of Intrastat are similar in all [[List of European Union member states|member states of the EU]], although there are important exceptions.

== Motivation ==

Trade statistics are an essential part of a country's [[balance of payments]] account and are regarded as an important economic indicator of the performance of any country.&lt;ref&gt;HM Revenue &amp; Customs, [http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_024570&amp;propertyType=document UK Customs Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Export]] data in particular can be used as an indicator of the state of a country's manufacturing industries as a whole. The statistics are used by government departments to help set overall trade policy and generate initiatives on new trade areas. The volume of goods moving is also assessed to allow the planning of future transport infrastructure needs. Intrastat is also being used as a tool against VAT fraud, permitting the comparison between Intrastat and VAT declarations, for example in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruffles|first=David|title=VAT missing trader intra-Community fraud: the effect on Balance of Payments statistics and UK National Accounts|journal=Economic Trends|year=2003|volume=597|pages=58–70|url=http://www.unescap.org/STAT/meet/wnoe/waisq_background1.pdf|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in Italy (as suggested by rules governing Intrastat in that country).

The commercial world uses the statistics to assess markets within the country (e.g. to gauge how imports are penetrating the market) and externally (e.g. to establish new markets for their goods).

In addition, the statistics are passed on to European and International bodies such as [[Eurostat]] (the Statistical Office of the European Communities),  the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=СИСТЕМА  ИНТРАСТАТ – най–важното, казано накратко във връзка с новия Закон за статистика на вътрешнообщностната търговия със стоки /ЗСВТС/|pages=
|url=http://www.nap.bg/document?id=3594|publisher=National revenue agency. Central office|website=http://www.nap.bg|date=July 2012 |page=1|language=Bulgarian|trans-title=INTRASTAT SYSTEM - the most important, in brief, concerning the new Act on the statistics relating to the intra-Community trading of goods  /ASITG/|format=Microsoft Office Word 97 - 2003 Document|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrastat data forms an integral part of these statistics and therefore it is important that the data submitted be of a high quality.

==Practicalities==

Each member country establishes an annual threshold value below which a business is not required to file Intrastat forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrastat system - statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_for_goods/free_movement_goods_general_framework/l11011a_en.htm|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reporting thresholds vary from country to country and, within one country, may be different for dispatches (exports) and arrivals (imports). For the eurozone countries excluding Italy, thresholds for 2013 average 316,000 and 422,000 euro for arrivals (imports) and dispatches (exports), respectively.&lt;ref name=VATlive&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Intrastat reporting thresholds|url=http://www.vatlive.com/eu-vat-rules/intrastat-reporting-thresholds/|publisher=VATlive|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As established by Regulation (EC) No 222/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009, the current thresholds are designed to cover 97% of dispatches and 95% of arrivals.&lt;ref name=EurLex&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EC) No 222/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 on Community statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:087:0160:01:EN:HTML|publisher=EurLex|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regulation raised thresholds with the purpose of reducing the statistical and, hence, financial burden on small operators. According to an EU Memo of 2013, the increased thresholds reduced the number of reporting enterprises by one third and saved them 134 million euro.&lt;ref name=Memo&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission initiatives to cut red tape and reduce regulatory burdens – Questions and Answers|date=19 September 2013|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-786_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy is the only EU country to set no thresholds,&lt;ref name=VATlive /&gt; so all operators (excluding only new, young entrepreneurs in a facilitated tax regime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modello Intrastat 2013: scadenza, istruzioni compilazione operazioni|url=http://www.guidafisco.it/modello-intrastat-scadenza-774|publisher=GuidaFisco|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) must file Intrastat forms.

For the Intrastat system, the customs authorities provide the national authorities with statistics on dispatches and arrivals of goods. Member states 
then transmit their data to Eurostat on a monthly basis, generally within 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on Community statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0638:EN:HTML|publisher=EurLex|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The national authorities collect the following data:
* the identification number allocated to the party responsible for providing information;
* the reference period;
* the flow (arrival, dispatch);
* the commodity;
* the value of the goods;
* the quantity of the goods;
* the partner Member State;
* the nature of the transaction.

Since 2010, Intrastat reporting also applies to services in both Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pagani|first=Giuseppe|title=Le novita' IVA 2010, prestazioni di servizi, reverse charge, modelli intrastat|url=http://www.fiscoetasse.com/approfondimenti/10153-le-novita-iva-2010-prestazioni-di-servizi-reverse-charge-e-intrastat.html|publisher=Fisco e Tasse|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrastat|url=http://www.agenziadogane.it/wps/wcm/connect/internet/ed/operatore/servizi+online/intrastat|publisher=Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Déclaration Européenne de Services (DES)|url=http://www.douane.gouv.fr/page.asp?id=3846|publisher=Douane|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of data on the intracommunity trade in services is not a part of the European Intrastat system, but is instead required by the [[EU VAT]] Directive. So, in these two countries, Intrastat forms replace EC Sales lists.

Specifically concerning the commodity codes according to the [[Combined Nomenclature]] (CN), it needs to be acknowledged that although the CN is revised annually and published as a Commission Regulation in the EU Official Journal in October of the preceding year, the Member States have the right to collect more detailed information such as a more detailed commodity code by adding another digit to the end of the EU level 8 digit CN code (Article 9(2) of regulation 638/2004).

'''Karel Aalbers''' (born June 28, 1949, [[Velp, Gelderland|Velp]]) was the President of the [[Association Football|football]] club [[Vitesse Arnhem]] ([[Arnhem]], the [[Netherlands]]) from 1984 until February 2000.

==Career==
Aalbers' goal was to bring Vitesse from the bottom of the Second League (Eerste divisie, now [[Eerste Divisie|Keuken Kampioen Divisie]]), where the club was when he
started, to the top 40 soccer clubs of Europe.

He developed the basic idea for the ‘[[Gelredome]]’, a stadium with a sliding pitch that can be moved out of the building. Later, the same system was applied in [[Gelsenkirchen]] ([[Schalke 04]]) and in [[Japan]]. Events such as pop concerts can be held without damaging the grass. Gelredome opened in 1998. It has a roof that can be opened and closed. It is fully climate controlled as well. In the first season after the opening, Gelredome's attendance rose to 20,000, (from less than 8,000 in the old stadium.)

He financed the ambitions by making solid profits on the transfer market. Players such as [[Roy Makaay]], [[Sander Westerveld]], [[Nikos Machlas]], [[Glenn Helder]] and [[Phillip Cocu|Philip Cocu]] were sold for large sums of money. Others came to occupy empty player positions, such as [[Mahamadou Diarra]] and [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]].

Vitesse ranked top 4 positions, made profit and showed a solid balance sheet in the final years of his presidency.

Aalbers resigned on February 15, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ritsema | first = André | title = Aalbers moet bij Vitesse weg als voorzitter | work = [[NRC Handelsblad]] | language = Dutch | date = 2000-02-16 | url = http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Nieuws/2000/02/16/Spo/01.html | accessdate = 2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the main sponsor, Nuon, threatened to pull the plug if he did not. Nuon, as a public utility
company, owned by local authorities, had trouble explaining why it invested heavily in Aalbers' ambitious plans.

His successor was Jan Koning (former chief of Sara Lee/DE who resigned after 4 month). In a short period of time, Vitesse began to show negative financial results, due to poor deals on the transfer market. The club survived numerous financial crises, such as the last one in 2008, when debts were bought of, under the threat of bankruptcy.

Aalbers is currently a marketing expert and consultant in city and stadium development. He acts as a matchmaker in international projects. He and his wife live in [[Eerbeek]].

'''Lean Government''' refers to the application of [[lean production]] (also known as "Lean") principles and methods to both identify and then implement the most efficient, [[value added]] way to provide government services. Government agencies have found that when Lean is implemented, they see an improved understanding of how their own processes work, that it facilitates the quick identification and implementation of improvements and that it builds a culture of [[continuous improvement]].&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (March 2008) and Graham Richard (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lean for government focuses on governing and serving citizens with respect and continuously improving service delivery by cutting out "waste" and "inefficiency" in processes; this in turn will result in better services overall, engaged civil servants as well as more [[Value (economics)|value]] for tax-supported programs and services. Generally, proponents also see that a Lean government is a means to expand the capacity of government to provide more services per [[Unit of account|unit]] of [[investment]].&lt;ref&gt;Ken Miller, [http://www.governing.com/column/promise-going-lean &amp;ldquo; The Promise of Going Lean&amp;rdquo;], ''Governing,'' May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common methods and approaches==
Many Lean manufacturing methods have been successfully adapted to identify non-value added activities (waste) in administrative, transactional, and office processes that are common in government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Carlos | last = Venegas | title = Flow in the Office: Implementing and Sustaining Lean Improvements  | publisher= Productivity Press  | year =2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common Lean methods include:

* [[Value Stream Mapping]] (VSM) – Value stream mapping refers to the development of a high‐level visual representation of a process flow that is involved in delivering a product or service (called a “value stream”) to customers. VSM events, which are typically 3–4 days, focus on identifying the sources of non‐value added activity and prioritizing possible improvement activities.
* [[Kaizen]] – Kaizen means to change for the good of all and is based on the philosophy of improvement, without regard to its size, type or duration. Kaizen activity is often focused on rapid process improvement events (called kaizen events) that bring together a cross‐functional team for 3‐5 days to study a specific process followed by implementing process changes.
* [[5S (methodology)|5S]] – 5S is the name of a workplace organizational method that uses a list of five Japanese words which, when translated into English, start with the letter S—Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain.

As more and more government services are delivered electronically, Lean government initiatives are commonly applications of [[Lean IT]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Maria. [https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS119892+06-Mar-2009+PRN20090306 &amp;ldquo;The City of Cape Coral Enables Leaner Government with AMX and JD Edwards&amp;rdquo;] ''Reuters''. March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lean government approaches typically have the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/lean/government/primer/resources/LeanGovtPrimer.pdf | title=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Environmental Council of States, Working Smart for Environmental Protection: Improving State Agency Processes with Lean and Six Sigma | publisher= U.S. EPA | work = Publication #EPA-100-R-08-007 | date = March 2008 | pages =3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Take a [[customer service]] perspective that seeks to optimize value delivered to the public, the regulated community, and/or other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s;
*Involve employees and external stakeholders in continual improvements and [[problem-solving]] activities;
*Deploy a rapid [[continuous improvement]] framework that emphasizes implementation over prolonged planning;
*Seek to reduce the complexity of processes and the variation in process outputs;
*Use [[performance metrics]] and visual controls to provide rapid feedback to improve real-time [[decision-making]] and problem-solving; and
*Approach improvement activities using [[systems thinking]].

Lean government does not necessarily promote low [[taxes]], only efficient use of those taxes levied. Tax policy is discerned by the [[legislative]] and executive branches of government with oversight of the [[judicial branch]] of government.  Lean government is implemented by the administrative function of government through executive order, legislative mandate, or departmental administrative decisions.  Lean government can be applied in legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.

==Types of waste==
Several types of non-value added activity, or waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]] in Japanese), are common in government administrative and service processes.  Lean methods focus on identifying and eliminating these wastes.  The list below identifies common administrative process wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/lean/government/starterkit/index.htm|title=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lean in Government Starter Kit: How to Implement Successful Lean Initiatives at Environmental Agencies, Version 2.0|publisher=U.S. EPA Publication # EPA-100-K-09-007, May 2009, p. 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative process wastes with examples===

* Inventory = Backlog of Work, Excess Materials or Information
* Defects = Data Errors, Missing Info
* Overproduction = Unneeded Reports, Doing Work Not Requested
* Complexity = Unnecessary Process Steps
* Waiting = Unnecessary Approval Cycles
* Excess Motion = Trips to Remote Printer or Files
* Moving Items = Report Routing, File Storage

Wastes in administrative and service processes can relate to:
# collection, use, and management of information
# design and implementation of work processes
# the efficiency and effectiveness with which individuals work.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Venegas, Flow in the Office: Implementing and Sustaining Lean Improvements, Productivity Press, 2007, pp. 10-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lean government activity==
Numerous government agencies, such as the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and the States of [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]] [[Washington (state)|and Washington]], are using Lean to improve the quality, [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and speed of government processes. As in the manufacturing and service sectors, some government agencies are implementing Lean methods in conjunction with [[Six Sigma]] process improvement approaches.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Michael L. George, Lean Six Sigma for Service: How to Use Lean Speed &amp; Six Sigma Quality to Improve Services and Transactions, The McGraw-Hill Companies, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law for [[workplace bullying]] is given below for each country in detail. Further European countries with concrete antibullying legislation are Belgium, France, and The Netherlands.&lt;ref name="antimoblegis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/econ_pub/5/ |last = Browne

== Australia ==
Each state has its own legislation.

In [[Queensland]], legislation comes from Workplace Health and Safety Queensland. If bullying (referred to as 'Workplace Harassment' in the Queensland subordinate legislation) endangers a worker's health causing stress or any other physical harm, an obligation holders under the 'Workplace Health and Safety Act, 1995' can be found liable for not providing a safe place for their employees to work. Queensland is one of only two States in Australia with a Code of Practice specifically for workplace bullying – 'The Prevention of Workplace Harassment Code of Practice, 2004'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deir.qld.gov.au/workplace/law/codes/harassment/index.htm |title=Codes of practice – Workplace Health and Safety Queensland |publisher=Deir.qld.gov.au |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], legislation comes from Worksafe Victoria. If bullying endangers a worker's health causing stress or any other physical harm, a corporation can be found liable for not providing a safe place for their employees to work.&lt;ref name="worksafe"&gt;[http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/WorkSafe/Home/ Worksafe, Victorian Workcover Authority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030143610/http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/WorkSafe/Home/ |date=October 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==

=== Quebec ===
The Canadian Province of [[Quebec]] passed legislation addressing workplace bullying on 1 June 2004. In its act representing labour standards, "psychological harassment" is prohibited. The Commission des normes du travail is the organization responsible for the application of this act.&lt;ref name="travail"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/in-case-of/psychological-harassment-at-work/index.html |title=Psychological harassment at work – Commission des normes du travail du Québec |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=cnt.gouv.qc.ca |year=2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontario ===
Under the [[Ontario]] Occupational Health and Safety Act 1979, all employers "take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker". This includes protecting them against the risk of workplace violence.&lt;ref name="oohsa"&gt;[http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/ohsaguide/index.html Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act 1979] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925073905/http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/ohsaguide/index.html |date=2009-09-25 }} Ministry of Labour, Ontario, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; The Act requires establishment of Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committees for larger employers.

Under the act, workplace violence is defined as ''"...the attempted or actual exercise of any intentional physical force that causes or may cause physical injury to a worker. It also includes any threats which give a worker reasonable grounds to believe he or she is at risk of physical injury"''.&lt;ref name="oohsa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VW"&gt;[http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/workplace_violence.html Workplace Violence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012194651/http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/workplace_violence.html |date=2009-10-12 }} Ministry of Labour, Ontario, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, as the Act is written, the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act does not specifically cover the issue of psychological harassment.&lt;ref name="oohsa" /&gt;

On 13 December 2007, MPP Andrea Horwath introduced for first reading a new Bill, Bill-29, to make an amendment to the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act. This Bill-29 is proposing "to protect workers from harassment and violence in the workplace" and will include protection from psychological abuse and bullying behaviors in the workplace in Ontario.&lt;ref name="tp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;BillID=1938 |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Canada |publisher=Ontla.on.ca |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario OHS Act has been amended to include Bill 168, which came into force 15 June 2010. The amendment includes the protection of employees from psychological harassment, workplace violence, including domestic violence in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;Intranet=&amp;BillID=2181 |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Canada |publisher=Ontla.on.ca |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saskatchewan ===
&lt;!---&lt;ref name="chrc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca|title=Canadian Human Rights Commission|website=www.chrc-ccdp.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;
The Canadian Province of [[Saskatchewan]] made workplace bullying illegal in 2007 by passing The Occupational Health and Safety (Harassment Prevention) Amendment Act, 2007. The act broadened the definition of harassment, as defined in The Occupational Health and Safety Act 1993, to include psychological harassment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/FirstRead/2006-07/Bill-66.pdf The Occupational Health and Safety] (Harassment Prevention) Amendment Act, 2007 in Saskatchewan&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manitoba ===
Manitoba enacted Bill 18 making bullying illegal and legitimized school  "bullying clubs", Including [[gay-straight alliance]]s, and other school anti-bullying clubs.
http://web2.gov.mb.ca/bills/40-2/b018e.php

== Ireland ==
In Republic of Ireland, there is a Code of Practice for employers and employees on the prevention and resolution of bullying at work.&lt;ref name="copf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.hsa.ie/index.asp?docID=222 |title=Republic of Ireland – 2007 Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work |publisher=Publications.hsa.ie |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code notes the provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare Act 2005 requiring employers to manage work activities to prevent improper conduct or behaviour at work. The Code of Practice provides both employer and employee with the means and the machinery to identify and to stamp out bullying in the workplace in a way which benefits all sides.

== Spain ==
In Spain, within the public administration, activities including preventing access to opportunities, physical or social isolation, withholding necessary information, keeping the target out of the loop, ignoring or excluding, if permanent and for a long time, are considered labor harassment and have to be prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Mantener/funcionario/desocupado/sera/acoso/laboral/elpepisoc/20110604elpepisoc_8/Tes Mantener a un funcionario desocupado será acoso laboral] in Spanish newspaper [[El País]] on 4. June 2011. Retrieved 4. June 2011, in Spanish Language&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sweden ==
Workplace bullying in [[Sweden]] is covered by the ''Ordinance of the Swedish National Board of Occupational Safety and Health containing Provisions on measures against Victimization at Work'', which defines victimisation as ''"...recurrent reprehensible or distinctly negative actions which are directed against individual employees in an offensive manner and can result in those employees being placed outside the workplace community".''&lt;ref name="vicwork"&gt;Ordinance of the Swedish National Board of Occupational Safety and Health containing Provisions on measures against Victimization at Work AFS 1993:17 [http://www.av.se/dokument/inenglish/legislations/eng9317.pdf Official English translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030023948/http://www.av.se/dokument/inenglish/legislations/eng9317.pdf |date=2013-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act places the onus on employers to plan and organise work so as to prevent victimisation and to make it clear to employees that victimisation is not acceptable. The employer is also responsible for the early detection of signs of victimisation, prompt counter measures to deal with victimisation and making support available to employees who have been targeted.

== United Kingdom ==
{{See also|Harassment in the United Kingdom|UK employment discrimination law}}
In the United Kingdom, although bullying is not specifically mentioned in workplace legislation, there are means to obtain legal redress for bullying. The [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://194.128.65.3/acts/acts1997/97040--a.htm#1 Protection from Harassment Act 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; is a recent addition to the more traditional approaches using employment-only legislation. Notable cases include [[Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060712/majro-1.htm#1|title=House of Lords - Majrowski (Respondent) v. Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Trust (Appellants)|last=Department|first=Law Lords|date=|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein it was held that an employer is vicariously liable for one employee's harassment of another, and Green v DB Group Services (UK) Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[2006] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2006/1898.html EWHC 1898]&lt;/ref&gt; where a bullied worker was awarded over £800,000 in damages. In the latter case, at paragraph 99, the judge Mr Justice Owen said "I am satisfied that the behaviour amounted to a deliberate and concerted campaign of bullying within the ordinary meaning of that term."

Bullying behaviour breaches other UK laws. An implied term of every [[employment contract]] in the UK is that parties to the contract have a (legal) duty of trust and confidence to each other. Bullying, or an employer tolerating bullying, typically breaches that contractual term. Such a breach creates circumstances entitling an employee to terminate his or her contract of employment without notice, which can lead to a finding by an [[Employment Tribunal]] of [[unfair dismissal]], colloquially called [[constructive dismissal]]. An employee bullied in response to asserting a statutory right can be compensated for the detriment under Part V of the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]], and if dismissed, Part X of the same Act provides that the dismissal is automatically unfair. Where a person is bullied on grounds of sex, race or disability ''et al.'', it is outlawed under anti-discrimination laws.

It was argued, following the obiter comments of [[Lord Hoffmann]] in [[Johnson v Unisys Ltd]] in March 2001,&lt;ref name="jvu1"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldjudgmt/jd010322/johnso-1.htm Judgments – Johnson (A.P.) v. Unisys Limited], Uk Parliament – Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jvu2"&gt;[http://www.eoc-law.org.uk/default.aspx?page=3170 Johnson v Unisys Ltd [2001&amp;#93; IRLR 279 House of Lords], Case Summaries, Equal Opportunities Commission, UK&lt;/ref&gt; that claims could be made before an Employment Tribunal for injury to feelings arising from unfair dismissal. It was re-established that this was not what the law provided, in Dunnachie v Kingston upon Hull City Council, July 2004&lt;ref name="jvu3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Law Lords Department |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldjudgmt/jd040715/dunn-1.htm |title=Dunnachie v Kingston upon Hull City Council 2004 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the Lords confirmed that the position established in ''[[Norton Tool v Tewson]]'' in 1972, that compensation for unfair dismissal was limited to financial loss alone. The compensatory award element for "ordinary" unfair dismissal is subject to a statutory cap set, from February 2014, at the lower of £76574 or 12 months gross pay. Discriminatory dismissal continues to attract compensation for injury to feelings and financial loss, and there is no statutory cap.

Access to justice in the UK is via self-representation at a tribunal, via a no-win no-fee lawyer, or via insurance or trade union lawyers. Since the Access to Justice act, "collective conditional fees" have blurred the distinction causing controversy for example in the case of Unison v Jervis.

}}
These workplace bullying bills would typically have allowed employees to sue their employers for creating an "abusive work environment", and most have been supported by the notion that laws against workplace bullying are necessary to protect public health. Many of the above bills are based upon the proposed Healthy Workplace Bill.&lt;ref name="HWPB" /&gt; This proposed bill contains several restrictive provisions not found in workplace anti-bully legislation adopted in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.droitcivil.uottawa.ca/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=2516 |title=The law of workplace bullying: an international overview |first=Katherine |last=Lippel |journal=Comp Labor Law Policy J |volume=32 |number=1 |date=Fall 2010 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of any federal or state law specifically on workplace bullying, some targets of bullying have prevailed in lawsuits that allege alternative theories, such as Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and Assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abusergoestowork.com |title=Potential Statutory and Common Law Remedies for Workplace Bullying |publisher=When the Abuser Goes to Work |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most US states operate primarily under the doctrine of [[at-will]] employment (which, in theory, allows an employer to fire an employee for any reason or no reason at all), American workers have gained significant legal leverage through discrimination and harassment laws, workplace safety laws, union-protection laws. etc., such that it is illegal under federal and most states' laws to fire employees for many reasons. For example, these employment laws typically forbid retaliation for good faith complaints or the exercise of legal rights such as the right to organize a union. Discrimination and harassment laws enable employees to sue for creating a "[[hostile work environment]]", which can include bullying, but the bullying/hostility usually is tied in some way to a characteristic protected under the discrimination/harassment law, such as race, sex, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, etc.

== South Korea ==
People can take legal action if specific action of workplace bullying is violated existing law or if it is recognized that laborer who is bullied in workplace suffer industrial accident, but generally it is hard to confirm whether it is illegal or not. Fundamentally, industrial accident can be approved when the accident have task correlation. However, it is hard to say that bullying is related with work. Besides bullying could be occurred in diverse places such as cafeteria, commuting bus, get -together so the task correlation is not likely to be approved. There is, however, a case about recognition of industrial accident related with workplace bullying. The court said that if laborer received treatment due to workplace bullying, it is an industrial accident and the person can take legal action.

'''Leong Sin Nam''' 梁燊南(1880–1940), alias Leong Sin, Leung Sin, Leong Sin Hee,&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum of Resealing. The Estate of Leong Sin Nam alias Leong Sin alias Leung Sin alias Leong Sin Hee Deceased. The High Court of the State of Singapore, Island of Singapore. 25 November 1959&lt;/ref&gt; was a Malaysian businessman.  He migrated and settled in [[British Malaya]] in 1898.  From humble beginnings, he worked hard to become a wealthy [[tin]] mine owner in [[Perak]].  He was a businessman, an active community leader and a philanthropist.  He was a Chinese revolutionary with similar aspirations as Dr. [[Sun Yat Sen]] and a strong supporter of the Chinese war efforts during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese war]].

[[File:Lsnofficialportrait.JPG|thumb|Leong Sin Nam, JP, OBE, MCH]]

==Birth==
Leong Sin Nam was born on 20 April 1880 in Thai Chook Pau, a village in the district of [[Mooi Yan]] (Kaying), [[Kwangtung]] Province, south eastern China.  He was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]]. His other names were Leong Sin, Leung Sin and Leong Sin Hee.

==Migration==
His father Leong Hin Fook ({{zh|c=梁欽福|p=Liáng Qīnfú}}), also known as Leong Tin Siew, left Kwangtung with the family to settle in [[Penang]] in 1883.  Leong Sin Nam was only 3 years old and had two younger brothers, Leong Yoon Hee and Leong Lian Hee. China was then ruled by the [[Ching Dynasty]] where wars and famines were common.  The failed [[Taiping rebellion]] led by a Hakka caused widespread misery.

==Early years==
Leong Sin Nam grew up and received his early Chinese education in Penang.  He was described as a brilliant and diligent scholar and completed a middle course in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 20 January 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; However his education was interrupted by the death of his father in 1894.  Leong Sin Nam then aged 14 years and being the eldest of the three sons took on the responsibility of looking after the family.

In 1896, Leong Sin Nam's mother decided to return to China with her husband's remains (ashes). During the journey she fell ill and died at [[Swatow]].  From Swatow, Leong Sin Nam hired a sampan and proceeded to Mooi Yan.  Leong Sin Nam held the responsibility of burying his mother and looking after his two younger brothers aged 6 and 10 years old.  He had a warm welcome on arrival in Mooi Yan.

Little was known of his teenage life in China.  Apparently he led a carefree life and even experimented with opium.  Fortunately for him he realised his errors in life early, repented and decided to start a new life in Malaya.

In 1898, Leong Sin Nam at age 18 years returned to Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;Perak Khek Association Handbook. 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; China was politically unstable.  The Empress Dowager was fending off foreign intervention.  The [[Boxer rebellion]] was crumbling.  The Chinese were attracted to [[British Malaya]] to work, trade and seek their fortunes in the [[tin]] fields.  The British policies to increase the labour force to work in the tin mines fielded immigration to Malaya.

==Tin Mining==
Upon his arrival in Malaya Leong Sin Nam first worked as a mining labourer then as a purchasing clerk in Perak.  He worked and lived in a mining "[[kongsi]]" under the "Co-Operative System", commonly known as the "Fun-Si-Kai", whereby the employed entered himself as a shareholder, identifying his fortune with those of the mine.&lt;ref&gt;Selangor Journal. Vols. 4, Chapter 2, Page 43 – 46.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a long and hard struggle to make ends meet in the beginning, but with perseverance and self-denial, he succeeded brilliantly.  He steadily climbed the ladder to become a supervisor.  He was hardworking and made the best of his job.  His employer, Leong Pit Loo, trusted and relied heavily on him for advice.  In 1906, at age 25 years, they both went to Keng Chiow, China to investigate and learn more about the mining industry.  This and other experiences laid the foundation for his future mining business.  Leong Sin Nam once worked in the [[Leong Fee]]'s tin mine at Tambun, four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) away from Ipoh.&lt;ref&gt;Everitt, W.E. History of Mining in Perak. 1952. Vols. 14, Page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

After working for several years, Leong Sin Nam saved some money and ventured into tin mining with other miners.  He had several disappointments.  His first break came in Telok Kruin.  With a capital of $200 he entered into partnership with other miners and made a few thousand dollars.  The price of tin was high then at $89 per pickul in 1906.  Tin mining and prosperity in the Kinta valley had already surpassed Larut in importance.  Tin was discovered in Kinta in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, Kay Kim. Tanjong, Hilir Perak, Larut and Kinta; the Penang-Perak nexus in history. Department of History, University of Malaya. The Penang Story – International Conference 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 the Ipoh Tronoh branch railway opened.  The railway line ran through rich mining centres like [[Menglembu]], Lahat, Papan, Pusing and Siputeh.

In 1910 Leong Sin Nam started the Sin Nam Kongsi in Menglembu. The Leong Sin Nam Lode Mine was very profitable and with the profits he bought two other mines, one in Pusing in 1912 and the other at Falim in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Teoh, Guat Kim. "The Life and Times of Leong Sin Nam OBE, JP, MCH, MCS in Ipoh (1880–1940)." Diss. University of Malaya, Singapore. 1957.11&lt;/ref&gt; The Leong Sin Nam Lode mine was abandoned in 1917 because of subterranean streams which made mining activities dangerous.  Attempts to pump out the water failed.
Leong Sin Nam came to [[Ipoh]], a booming tin mining town, in 1913.  Ipoh was rapidly developing and had expanded across the [[Kinta River]] which divided the Old and the New Town.  Brick houses had replaced attap houses after a great fire in 1892. The Birch Memorial Clock Tower, Rest House, Post Office and Town Hall, Yau Tet Shin Market, Church of England, Anderson School, Methodist Girls' School, Convent and Anglo-Chinese School buildings were already in existence.  There were many successful European mining companies in Ipoh like the [[Tronoh]] Mines Ltd., [[Gopeng]] Tin Mining Co. Ltd.and [[Kinta District|Kinta]] Tin Mines Ltd.  There were many successful Chinese miners too like [[Foo Choo Choon]], [[Eu Tong Sen]], [[Leong Fee]], Chop Thai Lee, [[Chung Thye Phin]], Au Moh Yi, Yau Tet Shin, Khi Ho Nin, Shak Yin Fuk,&lt;ref&gt;Tak Ming Ho. 'Generations: The Story of Batu Gajah'. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Lam Look Ing and Aw Kong all of whom were large employers of labour.  There were three banks namely, the [[Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China]], the [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank]] and later the Bank of Malaya Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 17 July 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the rapid development of Ipoh the Town Planning Committee of Ipoh was formed in 1914.

Leong Sin Nam was at different times the chairman and managing director of the [[Toh Allang Chinese Tin Ltd.]]., the first Chinese limited liability company concerned with tin.  It was formed in 1925 by Ho Man, Foo Choong Nyit and Chung Thye Pin.&lt;ref&gt;Khoo Salma Nasution &amp; Abdur-Razzaq Lubis. Kinta Valley Pioneering Malaysia's Modern Development. Perak Academy. 2005:183.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Leong Sin Nam bought the Ampang mine near Tambun from the son of Yau Tet Shin and started the Lean Pang Kongsi.  Later, in 1933, he acquired the mining leases of the Ampang Tin Dredging (Perak) company.&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, F.T. &amp; E.F. Bradford. The Geology and Mineral Resources of the Kinta Valley, Perak. Kuala Lumpur: Government Printer, 1960:274&lt;/ref&gt;  These mines covered an area of {{convert|1800|acre|km2}} of land and were very profitable.

His mines were part mechanised to save labour which was expensive and in short supply.  Even then these two large mines were once said to have supported the livelihood of more than 1,000 families. The tin ore was exported via ports like [[Teluk Anson]] and [[Port Weld]] which were already connected by the railways and roads to Ipoh.

In 1935 he was sent to China by a Limited Company to prospect for tin.  He left Malaya on 28 September 1935 by the boat "Cathay"&lt;ref&gt;Straits Times. 24 September 1935&lt;/ref&gt; and returned in December the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Pinang Gazette and Straits Chronicle. 21 December 1935&lt;/ref&gt; The trip turned out to be a disappointment because of poor transportation in China.

==Other Business Interests==
By 1912 Leong Sin Nam had saved enough money and bought houses in Menglembu, Brewster Road and in 1919 a bungalow in Gopeng Road from a European which he renovated extensively in 1925. Later Leong Sin Nam ventured into real estate where he built several blocks of houses in Ipoh.  He built houses on Leong Sin Nam Street, Anderson Road (1926), Falim (1928), Clarke Street (1929), Horley Street (1930) and two bungalows in Penang (1927) located at Ayer Rajah Road.&lt;ref&gt;Teoh, Guat Kim. "The Life and Times of Leong Sin Nam OBE, JP, MCH, MCS in Ipoh (1880–1940)." Diss. University of Malaya, Singapore. 1957.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Tate and Chai Hon Chan. Ipoh: The Town That Tin Built. A town that grew between two rivers. The Straits Times Press ( Malaya), 1962.24
&lt;/ref&gt;

Leong Sin Nam owned and managed several large rubber estates. In 1912 he bought an estate at Siputeh and in 1913 with Lim Sin Chew as partner he bought land at Malim Nawar and in 1920 land in Jelapang for rubber planting.  Other notable Chinese planters included Foo Choo Choon and Chung Thye Phin.  Rubber plantations were found in Batu Gajah, Tanjong Tuallang, Chemor, Tanjong Rambutan and Gopeng.

Leong Sin Nam was also interested in the Chinese media. He was the chairman of the Malayan Chinese Daily News Ltd. in Kuala Lumpur and managing director of the Perak Chinese Daily News in Ipoh.

In 1933 Leong Sin Nam built a bungalow in Tanah Rata, [[Cameron Highlands]], Pahang when access was made possible by a new road from Tapah.  In 1934, recognising Cameron Highlands as a potential holiday resort destination, he and a group of people formed the Eastern Hotel Company where he was the chairman and built the Eastern Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Teoh, Guat Kim. "The Life and Times of Leong Sin Nam OBE, JP, MCH, MCS in Ipoh (1880–1940)." Diss. University of Malaya, Singapore. 1957.41&lt;/ref&gt; The company's aim in building the hotel was to provide comfortable accommodation at a cheap rate to the Chinese and others.   The hotel was opened on 19 January 1935 and the Straits Times reported, &lt;blockquote&gt;
".....the Eastern Hotel consists of twelve bedrooms with private verandahs and bathrooms attached, one common or public lounge, a large dining room with kitchen and servants' quarters, a garage and for exercise tennis and badminton courts in front of the main building together with a lily and fish pond."
&lt;/blockquote&gt; This hotel was a great help to the further development of Cameron Highlands for soon more people went there for a holiday. In 1935 following the success of the hotel Leong Sin Nam built another bungalow in Ringlet, Cameron Highlands.

He was also active in financial institutions where he was the chairman of the Perak Trust and Investment Co. Ltd. in Ipoh and a director of the [[Bank of Malaya]] Limited. He helped the foundations of the Bank of Malaya in 1920 and the Hakka Chung Khiaw Bank in Perak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Khoo Salma Nasution|author2=Abdur-Razzaq Lubis|title=Kinta Valley: Pioneering Malaysia's Modern Development|publisher=Perak Academy|date=2005|page=217|ISBN=983-42113-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, he was a Director of the Kinta Electrical Distribution Co. Ltd.

Leong Sin Nam's personal and trusted secretary was Thong Siew Seong.

==Contributions to Charitable, Educational, Sporting and Social Institutions==
Once established Leong Sin Nam quickly showed that he had no desire to hoard his wealth but others less fortunate than him should derive benefit from his success.  From historic records, during the thirty years he had been in Malaya, he had contributed no less than half a million Straits dollars to charitable, educational, sporting and social institutions and later, particularly to the China Distress Relief Fund during the [[second Sino-Japanese war]].

Leong Sin Nam was a staunch supporter of education.  In 1927 he made a concerted effort to study English because his duties as a Justice of the Peace and Member of the State Council required an understanding of the language.  He had private English tuition every afternoon.  However, he also considered important the promotion of Chinese culture and language among the Chinese.  He was chiefly instrumental in securing Government aid for some of the Chinese schools in Ipoh beginning with the Yuk Choy Middle School.&lt;ref&gt;Teoh, Guat Kim. "The Life and Times of Leong Sin Nam OBE, JP, MCH, MCS in Ipoh (1880–1940)." Diss. University of Malaya, Singapore. 1957.38&lt;/ref&gt;

Leong Sin Nam donated money to Chinese Schools.  The following schools were the recipients:-  Yuk Choy Middle School, Min Tet Chinese School and Chinese Girls' Public School all in Ipoh,&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Fisher. Who's Who in Malaya. Singapore 1939&lt;/ref&gt; Kwong Hon Kok Min School (Pusing), Yik Chee School (Pusing), Choong Woon School (Buntong) and the Ban Wah School (Menglembu).

Leong Sin Nam was the founder of the Kah Yin Association’s Min Tet School which was established on 25 February 1913.  The Ban Wah (Wan Hwah) School was established in 1914 by Leong Sin Nam following his successful mining ventures in Menglembu.

He also donated money to English Schools. In 1927 he donated $2,500 to the Anglo-Chinese Girls School Building Fund.&lt;ref&gt;Teoh, Guat Kim. "The Life and Times of Leong Sin Nam OBE, JP, MCH, MCS in Ipoh (1880–1940)." Diss. University of Malaya, Singapore. 1957.39
&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1937 he donated $3,000 to the Anglo-Chinese School for building a science laboratory.

Placing great importance in education, he bequeathed the family bungalow in Gopeng Road, {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land and furniture to the "Kah Heng Chew Huay Kuan" (Kaying Association) for the purpose of setting up a school.  In accordance to the will the transfer was executed when his youngest son attained the age of 21 years.  The Perak Girls School once occupied this bungalow before being resited to Kampar Road, Ipoh in 1947.

He was also interested in sports although he was not a "sportsman".  He was especially interested in badminton and donated the "Leong Sin Nam" Challenge Cup for the Triangular Badminton Tournament between Perak, Selangor and Penang.  He attended several meetings of the Perak Chinese Athletic Sports.  He donated sports trophies in tennis and high jump to the Anglo-Chinese School.

Amongst his various hobbies, horse racing captured his interest most.  He owned several horses with names like, "Mr. Polly", "Flushed", "Pelonis", "Gee Up". "Celestial", "New Zealand" and the "Maid of Cashel". "Mr. Polly" was perhaps the best horse he had owned.

The Kinta Swimming Club in Ipoh with its olympic sized swimming pool was opened to the public in 1936 by Sultan Iskandar Shah, the Sultan of Perak.  The pool relied on a continuous supply of fresh water brought by pipes from the Leong Sin Nam mines near the Kledang Hills.  Leong Sin Nam donated a diving board to the Club.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 20 January 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937 was celebrated in Ipoh with great fanfare.  Leong Sin Nam sponsored the lion troupes and dragon parties at his residence.&lt;ref&gt;Khoo Salma Nasution &amp; Abdur-Razzaq Lubis. Kinta Valley Pioneering Malaysia's Modern Development. Perak Academy. 2005:239&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in Local Government==
Between 1914 and 1918 the State Government of Perak authorised Leong Sin Nam to issue private paper currency to overcome the shortage of coins towards the end of World War I

According to the F.M.S. Government Gazette Leong Sin Nam was appointed into the Perak State Council in 1920.  &lt;blockquote&gt;
"HRH the Sultan of Perak has been pleased with the approval of the Chief Secretary to the Government to appoint Mr. Leong Sin Nam to be a member of Council of State since Mr. Foo Choo Choon resigned&lt;ref&gt;FMS Government Gazette. 12 March 1920. pp. No.6, Paragraph No. 950&lt;/ref&gt;".
&lt;/blockquote&gt; In the same year in April Leong Sin Nam was appointed Justice of Peace for Perak and to the Perak Chinese Advisory Board.

In 1921, Leong Sin Nam was among one of the Malayans who was introduced to HRH the Prince of Wales who called on the Malay Peninsula after his tour in India.  The [[Malaya-Borneo Exhibition]] was held in Singapore to celebrate the royal visit.  Leong Sin Nam established a fund for the Perak exhibits (mining models, Ipoh Town models)&lt;ref&gt;Pinang Gazette and Straits Chronicle. 21 October 1921&lt;/ref&gt; and volunteered to publicise the Exhibition among the Chinese communities by distributing handbills printed in Chinese giving details about the objectives of the Exhibition.  The Exhibition was a great success.

Kinta experienced a crisis during the post World War 1 period from 1921 to 1922 when the demand for tin fell.  The effect of the sudden ending of hostilities at a time when special efforts were being made to increase tin production during the war was to present to the producers an unanticipated drop in demand for tin.  There was great financial distress amongst the tin producers in Kinta with resulting mass unemployment.  The recommendations of the Retrenchment Commission prevented much from being done in the way of relief through a program of public works.  The government's chief solution to the problem was the repatriation, at their own expense, the large number of unemployed back to their homes in China or India. The policy was quite effective.  The Ipoh Chinese Relief Camp was established under the leadership of Leong Sin Nam and remained in existence till 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Tate and Chai Hon Chan. Ipoh: The Town That Tin Built. A town that grew between two rivers. The Straits Times Press ( Malaya), 1962.22
&lt;/ref&gt;  Leong Sin Nam ranked second to none in Perak in the purchase of China Liberty Bonds which helped to finance the passage of these Chinese poor back to China.

On 23 September 1924, Leong Sin Nam, Chung Thye Phin and other prominent residents were introduced to HM [[King Rama VI]]&lt;ref&gt;Pinang Gazette and Straits Chronicle. 25 September 1924&lt;/ref&gt; at the railway station in Ipoh while on the way to Singapore.

In the 1930s the agitation for the transfer of the Perak state capital from Taiping to Ipoh was revived.  Leong Sin Nam spoke in favour of the transfer of the state capital to Ipoh in 1934 at a State Council meeting in [[Taiping, Perak]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;
"I crave leave to move that this Council do make provision for the transfer of the capital of the State to Ipoh at the earliest possible moment.  The question of Ipoh being made the capital of the State has been thoroughly discussed and finally approved by the Government years ago&amp;nbsp;... Apart from the incalculable convenience both to the administration and to the members of the public which will result by reason of the change there is one further reason why Ipoh should be made the capital of the State.  Ipoh with its modern and imposing buildings, well laid out roads and grounds and rapidly increasing importance as a business centre has no rival as the principal town in the State and as such is eminently suitable and fit to be made the capital.  I would also like to impress upon this Council the desirability of proceeding without further delay with the construction of the various public offices and residential quarters of the officials who will be stationed in Ipoh as a result of the change, for I know as an employer of labour, that the price of material and labour will increase rapidly.  If delay is occasioned I greatly fear that the expense of the change will be considerably increased".&lt;ref&gt;Pinang Gazette and Straits Chronicle. 19 October 1934&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1929, the tin and rubber prices dropped again.  Many mines and plantations clossed.  Leong Sin Nam and his fellow [[:wikt:towkay|towkay]]s started the Kinta Unemployment Committee which provided a monthly relief fund for the unemployed.

The [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s affected the world and Perak was no exception as the world demand for tin and other commodities fell.  The Tin Restriction Scheme was introduced to curtail the output of tin so as to maintain a stable price.  This reduction in tin output meant that labour had to be reduced and consequently unemployment was rife.

In 1938 Leong Sin Nam proposed a scheme to stabilise labour, both Chinese and Indian, as a means of reducing unemployment during slumps yet not prevent their return to the mines and rubber estates when so needed during better times.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Loh Kok Wah. Beyond the Tin Mines, Coolies, Squatters and New Villages in the Kinta Valley, Malaysia, c. 1880 – 1980.

The Company was to cultivate the land particularly with cashew nuts, amongst other commercially viable crops, and later hand this over to the settlers who would buy shares and eventually become sole owners of the property.&lt;ref&gt;Pinang Gazette and Straits Chronicle. 31 October 1938&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was rejected in May 1939 because it involved too much money.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 18 May 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rendering Assistance to the Chinese Government in China==
Leong Sin Nam was a Chinese Revolutionary like Dr. [[Sun Yat Sen]] who wanted a complete overthrow of the Ching Dynasty.  Dr. Sun managed to set up the Ipoh branch of the Tung Meng Hui with the help of Wang Ching-wei in 1907 after much opposition from the Reformists led by Foo Choo Choon in Ipoh.  The Reformists wanted to establish a constitutional monarch in China.  However, Foo had a change of heart following the [[Wuchang Uprising]] which led to the collapse of the Ching Government on 10 October 1911 and threw his full support behind the revolution. The Principal Leaders of the Tung Meng Hui Branch in Ipoh were Teh Lay-seng, Lee Guan-swee, Au Sheng-kang and Leong Sin Nam.&lt;ref&gt;Ching Fatt Yong, R.B. McKenna. The Kuomintang Movement in British Malaya, 1912–1949. Singapore University Press, Singapore. 1990:25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Malayan Tung Meng Hui movement, not registered with the Registrar of Societies, was institutionalised through underground branches and front organisations, including reading rooms and theatrical troupes.&lt;ref&gt;Yen Ching-hwang.  The Overseas Chinese and the 1911 Revolution. Kuala Lumpur. 1976.37–65&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore served as regional headquarters for the movement until 1908 and Penang from 1909 to 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Ching Fatt Yong, R.B. McKenna. The Kuomintang Movement in British Malaya, 1912–1949. Singapore University Press, Singapore. 1990:12&lt;/ref&gt;

The main function of the reading rooms was to raise the revolutionary consciousness of the Chinese through the provision of reading materials including books, magazines, journals and newspapers.  They also served as screening and recruiting offices for new members.  The theatrical troupes were used to spread revolutionary messages and were more popular, effective and appealing to the illiterate labourers.  The newspapers were important in sustaining the anti-Manchu feelings among the literate sector of the Chinese community and later the political climate in China.&lt;ref&gt;Ching Fatt Yong, R.B. McKenna. The Kuomintang Movement in British Malaya, 1912–1949. Singapore University Press, Singapore. 1990:15&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tung Meng Hui became an open and legalised political party known as the [[Kuomintang]] when the Last Emperor abdicated on 12 February 1912.  The Kuomintang branch in Ipoh was registered with the Registrar of Societies on 25 May 1913 and dissolved on 27 November 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Ching Fatt Yong, R.B. McKenna.

Singapore University Press, Singapore. 1990:26&lt;/ref&gt; Perak seemed to be the stronghold of the KMT Movement in the Federated Malay States with 27 registered branches principally because of the efforts of the original 4 leaders of the Tung Meng Hui in Ipoh including Leong Sin Nam&lt;ref&gt;Ching Fatt Yong, R.B.

When the Republic of China was founded in 1912, Dr. Sun was elected as the first "Provisional President" by the provisional Senate ending imperial rule in China.  Dr. Sun soon resigned from the office in favour of [[Yuan Shi Kai]], commander of the Beiyang Army of northern China, who formerly assumed the office of President of the Chinese Republic and became its first President.  Yuan soon asserted his presidential powers, abolished the National Assembly and later proclaimed himself the emperor of China in 1915 in a largely unpopular move and was later forced to retract his declaration shortly before his death in 1916.  The Kuomintang was outlawed in China in 1914 and was known as the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]].  The Ipoh Branch of the Chinese Revolutionary Party raised a good sum of money to support Dr. Sun against his arch rival Yuan.

Following Yuan's death China fragmented into warlordism.  Dr. Sun, forced into exile earlier, returned to China in 1917 to advocate unification.  He re-established the KMT in October 1919.  He started a self-proclaimed military government in Guanzhou, southern China in 1921 and was elected as president and generalissimo.  He established the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] with [[Chiang Kai-shek]] as the commandant in preparation for the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]].  The Communist Party of China was founded in July 1921.

Leong Sin Nam lent support to Dr. Sun's efforts to reunify China.  The warlord period ended in 1928 when the Northern Expedition succeeded in conquering northern China.  The KMT organised the expedition with assistance from the Chinese communist.  For his support, Leong Sin Nam was presented with a signed congratulatory photo message and a Certificate of Honour by Dr. Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Mortimer Green. The Story of China's Revolution. 1945.51 – 58 and Max Perleberg. Who's Who in Modern China 1954. Page 195 – 198&lt;/ref&gt; When Dr. Sun died in 1925 Leong Sin Nam supported his successor generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.  When Chiang became the leader of the KMT, he dismissed the communist and formed the Nationalist Government in Nanjing in 1927.

Leong Sin Nam's political affiliation and fame as a prominent miner reached China.  The Government officials of Yunnan Province, China invited him to demonstrate and instruct the Chinese miners how to use the modern mining methods adopted in Malaya.  The Governor in appreciation decorated him and appointed him Warden of Mines for [[Yunnan]] Province.&lt;ref&gt;S. Durai Rayasingam. Malayan Street Names, Ipoh. 1939&lt;/ref&gt; The chief tin producing centre in China was the Kochu district in Southern Yunnan where [[cassiterite]] was obtained from deposits and rock ores.  Tin was also produced in Kwangsi, Kiansi, Kwantung and Hunan.&lt;ref&gt;Xing Zheng Yuan &amp; Xin Wen Ju. China Handbook. 1952–1953. China Pub. Co. 1952.23&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Leong Sin Nam was in Malaya he held several posts in various departments in China. He was the Adviser of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, Warden of Mines for Yunnan Province, Member of the Economic Committee of the Chinese Government, committee member of the Kwantung Branch of Reconstruction Commission&lt;ref&gt;Epitaph on Leong Sin Nam's tombstone&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the four members of the People's Assembly of the Republic of China in Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 22 January 1940&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his services he was awarded medals by Dr. Sun Yat Sen, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance and President Li Yuan Hung, China.

In 1937 the second Sino Japanese War began.  The China Distress Relief Fund (China Red Cross Fund) was started to alleviate the distress amongst the wounded in the war zones in China.  By November 1937 a sum of 1,450,000 yuan was collected.&lt;ref&gt;Pinang Gazette and Straits Chronicle. 20 November 1937&lt;/ref&gt; Leong Sin Nam was the chairman of the Perak Overseas Chinese Distress Relief Fund committee and donated 20,000 yuan to the fund.&lt;ref&gt;Teoh, Guat Kim. "The Life and Times of Leong Sin Nam OBE, JP, MCH, MCS in Ipoh (1880–1940)." Diss. University of Malaya, Singapore. 1957.49&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his timely contribution Generallisimo Chiang Kai-shek presented Leong Sin Nam with a signed congratulatory photo message.  In 1938 in his presidential address at the [[Perak Chinese Chamber of Commerce]] Leong Sin Nam said he was glad to note the unity prevailing among all Chinese in the State and the admirable way they had responded to the needs of the China Red Cross Fund.  Referring to the crisis in China, he stressed the fact that only a united front could secure an ultimate victory for China and they must all contribute their share whether it be big or small.  On another occasion, he remarked that &lt;blockquote&gt;
"though China has lost some of her most important cities the morale and courage of the overseas Chinese in Malaya should not be shattered"&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 9 November 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; In the same year he contributed 120 pounds towards the "Gold Drive" in aid of the Chinese Fund.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 13 October 1938&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by yet another generous contribution of $10,000 towards the Perak Chinese Branch of the Patriotic Fund in 1939.  Even on his death bed in 1940 he told his family to reduce the funeral expenses for a more worthy cause in China.&lt;ref&gt;Teoh, Guat Kim. "The Life and Times of Leong Sin Nam OBE, JP, MCH, MCS in Ipoh (1880–1940)." Diss. University of Malaya, Singapore. 1957.50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to the Local Chinese Community==
Leong Sin Nam contributed $7,500 towards the erection of the new Chinese Maternity Hospital in Kampar Road.  The 61/2 acre land was presented by Foo Choon Yit, Foo Nyit Tse and Cheah Chong Siew.  The original Ipoh Maternity Hospital started in 1904 was located in Chamberlain Road whose land was presented by Cheah Cheang Lim. Other notables in the early founding of the hospital were Dr. RM Connolly, Foo Choo Choon and Leong Fee. Leong Sin Nam was president of the Perak Chinese Maternity Association in 1926.  The Chinese Maternity Hospital building was declared open on 7 October 1939 by the High Commissioner Sir Shenton Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 9 October 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

Leong Sin Nam's further contribution was when he helped to build the Ipoh Chinese Assembly Hall at Kuala Kangsar Road.  During this time all important meetings were held at the Ipoh Town Hall facing the Railway Station.  He together with other Chinese advocated for a larger building.  An appeal was made to all Chinese workmen in Perak to subscribe to the building fund by a contribution of $3 per labourer to collect a total sum of $250,000 – $150,000 for the Assembly Hall and $100,000 for the adjacent School Building.&lt;ref&gt;Pinang Gazette and Straits Chronicle. 12 March 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Leong Sin Nam contributed $20,000 towards the project&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 7 January 1939&lt;/ref&gt; and he laid the foundation stone on 6 October 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Pinang Gazette and Straits Chronicle. 7 October 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The building was finally completed in 1939.

Leong Sin Nam was the second President of the Perak Chinese Chamber of Commerce, after Foo Choo Choon the first President, in 1920.  He was the mouthpiece for the Chinese and expressed their grievances over the rubber restrictions known as the "Stevenson Scheme" introduced on 1 November 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Pinang Gazette and Straits Chronicle. 19 July 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

==A Life of Public Service==

The ceremony to confer the Honour was presided by the British Resident, Mr. C.E. Cator who pointed out in his speech that the OBE conferred on Leong Sin Nam was a very rare one, that being only the second time a non-British subject had been honoured by the King, the first being the late [[:wikt:towkay|towkay]] [[Loke Yew]] of Kuala Lumpur.  The High Commissioner to the Federated Malay States, Sir [[Shenton Thomas]], then made his speech prior to the reading of the Royal Warrant for the conferment of the [[Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I am commanded by His Majesty the King to present to Mr. Leong Sin Nam the badge of his appointment to be an Honorary Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.       Mr. Leong Sin Nam has been in Malaya for 50 years, and in the State of Perak particularly he has been associated with many public charitable bodies which have for their object the well being of the local Chinese.  Since 1920 he has been a member of the Perak State Council and a Justice of the Peace.  He is a committee member of the Perak Chinese Maternity Hospital.  In 1929, he was awarded the Malayan Certificate of Honour. His influence has always been exercised in the best interests of the community and his unobtrusive but generous philanthropy has supported many deserving institutions. It is a pleasure to us all and especially to the Chinese people of Perak that His Majesty has been graciously pleased to recognise the public services of so worthy a citizen.  I trust that Mr. Leong Sin Nam will be spared for many years to give his services to the State and to its people, whose gratitude and admiration he has long since won.&lt;ref&gt;Leong Sin Nam's "Yung Yu Lu" or Souvenir. Circa 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;"

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The family bungalow was at 17, Gopeng Road, Ipoh, Perak.

==The Last Years and Farewell==
The social stress and heavy responsibilities of public life during the Great Depression and the Sino-Japanese Hostilities exerted a heavy toll on Leong Sin Nam.  Age was catching on and his health began to fail in 1939.  On his doctor's advice he went to [[Java]] to recuperate.&lt;ref&gt;Teoh, Guat Kim. "The Life and Times of Leong Sin Nam OBE, JP, MCH, MCS in Ipoh (1880–1940)." Diss. University of Malaya, Singapore. 1957.52&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that he should take opium but he refused for he knew that it would be useless and he remembered too the time when opium smoking nearly ruined his life.&lt;ref&gt;Malay Tribune. 20 January 1940&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the trip to Java, his health failed to improve and he returned to his bungalow in Port Dickson where he died on 19 January 1940 at age 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 20 January 1940&lt;/ref&gt; His body was brought back in a special train to Ipoh on 22 January and laid in the family residence for eleven days.&lt;ref&gt;Teoh, Guat Kim. "The Life and Times of Leong Sin Nam OBE, JP, MCH, MCS in Ipoh (1880–1940)." Diss. University of Malaya, Singapore. 1957.53&lt;/ref&gt; HRH the [[Sultan Abdul Aziz of Perak]] and the acting British Resident of Perak, Mr. N.F.H. Mather were among the distinguished people who paid their last respect. On the day of the funeral all Chinese businesses were closed in the morning.  His funeral was described as the grandest in Ipoh and the procession was about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Echo. 23 January 1940&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to be buried in the Cantonese cemetery in Gopeng Road, Ipoh and {{convert|38523|sqft|m2}} of land was presented to his family for his grave.

After his death both English and Chinese newspapers eulogised his fine qualities.  The Straits Echo reported  &lt;blockquote&gt;
"The passing away of [[:wikt:towkay|towkay]] Leong Sin Nam at Port Dickson will cause wide spread regret for he was deservedly popular and much respected, his good works in Perak being as numerous as the sands on the seashore, while by his urbanity and strict integrity, he endeared himself to all whom he came in contact...... he was popular not only with his countrymen but also with Europeans, Eurasians, Indians, Malays and Ceylonese.  Socially, he was the best of good fellows.  He had no acquaintances, for to know him was to be his friend. As a public man he spared neither time nor trouble in carrying out zealously the duties which public life entails.  He never used his position to which he attained with any idea of self advertisement.  One of the most modest man one can meet anywhere his aim was always to do good.  The same aim influenced his whole life.  He was a good man trying according to his lights to be of service to his countrymen.  He was so genial, well meaning, earnest and honest".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No better words can describe such a wonderful man whose good works had touched so many lives.  He will be remembered for many generations to come.

His passing away in 1940 should be celebrated because soon after in 1941 Malaya was invaded by the Japanese beginning with the bombing of Singapore on 8 December 1941.  Ipoh was invaded on 15 December 1941 and occupied on 28 December.  Leong Sin Nam's pro British and Chinese stance would surely had brought disaster to himself and the family when Britain and China were at war with Japan during the Second World War.  Leong Sin Nam's bungalow was seized by the Japanese and became the headquarters of the notorious Japanese Military Police ([[Kempeitai]]) headed by the infamous Ekio Yoshimura.&lt;ref&gt;Khoo Salma Nasution &amp; Abdur-Razzaq Lubis. Kinta Valley Pioneering Malaysia's Modern Development. Perak Academy. 2005:282&lt;/ref&gt;

The stories of good men usually have good endings.  The Americans dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The Japanese surrendered on 15 August 1945.  The British forces landed in Penang on 3 September 1945.  Ipoh was soon liberated.  Leong Sin Nam's family survived without casualties.

{{Chinese name|[[Lin (surname)|林 (Lin)]]}}
'''Lim Nee Soon''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|林|義|順}}|p=Lín Yìshùn}}; 12 November 1879 – 20 March 1936) was a Singaporean merchant who promoted social and community matters, and was a respected [[community leader]] in [[Singapore]]. Lim was of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] [[Peranakan]] descent, with ancestry from [[Chenghai District]], [[Shantou]] in [[Guangdong]], [[China]].

He was a rubber magnate and was nicknamed the "pineapple king" for being the leading pineapple planter in the region. He was also a banker, contractor and general commission agent. He was the first general manager of the Bukit Sembawang Rubber Company Limited, formed in 1908. Nee Soon and Company was formed in 1911.

As a Chinese Peranakan (Baba), he was affectionately known as Bah Soon Pah ({{zh|c=峇順芭|p=Bā shùn bā}}). Bah Soon Pah Road was named after him.

==Early life==
Lim Nee Soon was born in Kampong Glam, Singapore. His family was from Shantou, Guangdong, China.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19350825-1.2.88|title=MR. LIM NEE SOON|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father died when he was eight and his maternal grandfather, a merchant, took care of him. Lim was educated in English at the [[St. Joseph's Institution]], and then later, at the [[Anglo Chinese School]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==
Lim was one of the pioneers that opened up [[Sembawang]]. He served on the Rural Board from 1913 to 1921 and was also appointed a [[Justice of Peace]]. In the field of education, he was one of the founders of [[The Chinese High School]] and also a member of the [[Raffles College]] Committee.
He was the President of the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry|Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce]] for two periods, from 1921-1922, and 1925-1926.

==Later life==
Lim, along with his uncle Teo Eng Hock, were the leading members of the [[Teochew people|Teochew]] clan association [[Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan]], and was a close friend of [[Sun Yat-Sen|Dr Sun Yat Sen]].

He died on the way home from a trip to China and his embalmed body was scheduled to be brought back to Singapore. But the Chinese government requested to give him a State burial and so he was buried in Nanjing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lim Nee Soon To Be Buried in Nanking |work=The Sunday Times |location=Singapore |page=1 |date=12 April 1936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; near the mausoleum of his close friend Dr Sun Yat Sen.

==Family==
Lim married Ms. Wi Peck Hay ({{zh|t=|s=阮碧霞|p=Ruǎn Bì Xiá}}) and had 3 sons and 6 daughters. His sons Lim Chong Kuo ({{zh|c=林忠國|p=Lín Zhōngguó}}) and Lim Chong Pang ({{zh|c=林忠邦|p=Lín Zhōngbāng}}) later also became prominent merchants and community figures. One of his daughter, Lim Chit Geck, married Oei Tjong Tiong, son of [[Chinese-Indonesian]] Businessman, [[Oei Tiong Ham]].

==Legacy==
Nee Soon Road was officially named in 1950 by the Rural Board to facilitate postal services. Nee Soon also owned a large plot of land in the area and several roads in this area are named after his business concerns and family members. For example, Chong Kuo Road is named after his eldest son Lim Chong Kuo, and [[Chong Pang|Chong Pang City]] his second son Lim Chong Pang.

The residential town of [[Yishun]] in the [[North Region, Singapore|northern part]] of Singapore, is also named after him. Although originally named Nee Soon, the name was subsequently romanized to its current appellation, to reflect the Singapore government's move to use proper [[Standard Chinese]] over the more popular and unrecognized [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]] prominent amongst local dialect groups.

'''Raleb Majadele''' ({{lang-ar|غالب مجادلة}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Levantine Arabic]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-ar|ˈɣaːleb maˈʒaːdele|}}; {{lang-he-n|ראלב מג'אדלה}}, {{IPA-he|ˈʁäleb mäˈd͡ʒädele|}}; also spelt '''Ghaleb Majadele''', born 5 April 1953) is an [[Israeli Arab]] politician. He served as a member of the Knesset for the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] in three spells between 2004 and 2015, and became the country's first Muslim [[Cabinet of Israel|minister]] when appointed [[Minister without Portfolio]] on 28 January 2007.

==Biography==
Born in [[Baqa al-Gharbiyye]], as a teenager Majadele was a member of [[HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed]] youth movement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=820989&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=15&amp;title='Overall,%20the%20street%20is%20happy%20'&amp;dyn_server=172.20.5.5 Overall, the street is happy] Haaretz&lt;/ref&gt; becoming its secretary.

A businessman, he became secretary of the Regional Workers Council, and headed the Education and Sport department of the [[Histadrut]] trade union.

He joined the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]], and was placed twentieth on the party's list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|2003 Knesset elections]]. Although the party won only 19 seats, Majadele entered the Knesset on 28 June 2004 as a replacement for [[Avraham Burg]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexByKnesset_eng.asp?knesset=16 Knesset Members in the Sixteenth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; who had resigned. He was re-elected in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]].

On 10 January 2007, Labor leader [[Amir Peretz]] announced that Majadele would be appointed Minister of Science, Culture and Sport.&lt;ref name="appointed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Labor MK Raleb Majadele to be appointed first Arab minister|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/812014.html|date=10 January 2007|author=Yoav Stern|publisher=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January 2007 the cabinet voted to appoint him [[Minister without Portfolio]].&lt;ref name="confirmed"&gt;{{cite news|title=First Arab joins Israeli cabinet|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6307673.stm|date=28 January 2007|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment was confirmed by a vote in which all ministers except the chairman of [[Yisrael Beiteinu]], [[Avigdor Lieberman]], voted in favour.&lt;ref name="confirmed" /&gt; In March 2007 Majadele received the Science, Culture and Sport portfolio.

Although welcomed by many, Majadele's appointment was controversial among several groups of politicians. [[Mohammed Barakeh]] of [[Hadash]] attacked it as a "dirty trick" that would not advance Arabs,&lt;ref name="appointed" /&gt; while Lieberman and [[Esterina Tartman]] of Yisrael Beiteinu claimed it was damaging to [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name="Beiteinu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lieberman calls on Peretz to quit over appointment of first Arab minister|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/812447.html|author=Mazal Mualem |author2=Gideon Alon |author3=Yoav Stern|date=12 January 2007|publisher=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter criticism was itself extremely controversial, with lawmakers from across the political spectrum branding Lieberman's and Tartman's remarks racist; a number of Labor lawmakers demanded that Yisrael Beiteinu be expelled from the governing coalition as a condition of Labor continuing to participate in the government.&lt;ref name="Beiteinu" /&gt;

For the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 elections]] he was placed fifteenth on the Labor list,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections18/heb/list/List.aspx?ListId=81 Detailed list of approved candidates: Labor] Knesset website {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost his seat as Labor were reduced to 13 representatives. However, he re-entered the Knesset on 13 April 2010 as a replacement for [[Yuli Tamir]], who had resigned her seat. For the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 elections]] he was placed seventeenth on the party's list,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bechirot.gov.il/elections19/heb/list/List.aspx?ListId=120 Labor Party] Central Elections Committee&lt;/ref&gt; and lost his seat again as the Labor Party won only 15 seats. However, he re-entered to the Knesset on 14 December 2014 to serve as a replacement for [[Binyamin Ben-Eliezer]], who resigned for health reasons after [[Danny Atar]] (who had been sixteenth on the party list) gave up the opportunity to take his place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/188622#.VI4SHmIaySM Raleb Majadla Replaces Ben Eliezer in Knesset] Israel National News, 14 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He did not contest the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 elections]], losing his seat.

==Quotes==
*"I fail to understand how an enlightened, sane Jew allows himself to ask a Muslim person with a different language and culture, to sing an anthem that was written for Jews only," in reference to ''[[Hatikvah]]'', the Israeli [[national anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3377681,00.html Majadele refuses to sing national anthem] Ynetnews, 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Majadele went on to point out that, although he does not participate in singing ''Hatikvah'', he does express respect for the song by standing up when it is sung.
*"Israel is a Jewish state and it does not require external affirmation to prove its Jewishness. Any such request could only weaken the state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1195127517597&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull  "Erekat: Why is PM 'poking us in the eye' over Jewish Israel"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Jerusalem Post, 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Emanuel Mattson''' (16 May 1851 — 10 May 1935) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[shipowner]] and [[businessman]].

Mattson was born in [[Åland]] to a shipowner family. He went to sea at young age and studied shipmaster degree. After ten years at sea he settled in [[Mariehamn]] and started [[trading]]; soon he went into [[shipping]] business. Mattson operated solely old [[sailing ship]]s, which were often lost due to their poor condition. However, the business was profitable. In the 1920s Mattson changed to [[steam ship]]s but could not operate them successfully.

Mattson became a major owner of [[Helsinki]]-based [[Kone- ja Siltarakennus]] [[engineering]] company. The company grew rapidly but by the 1930s it had fallen into financial problems. Also Mattson's personal financial situation weakened, and following to his death, the company's main creditor sold his shares.

== Early years ==
Mattson was born in [[Vårdö]], [[Åland]]. His father Mats Mattson was a shipowner and locally influential business person. At the age of 16 Mattson, against his father's will, became [[sailor]]. He studied in Mariehamn Sailing School graduating shipmaster in 1872, at age of 21. In the same year he made an excursion to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]]. Subsequently, Mattson mastered two sailing ships. In 1878, after spending about ten years at sea, Mattson became trader in Mariehamn and he opened another shop in [[Sund, Åland|Sund]]. However, trading was not very profitable because it was not possible to reach large volumes in Mariehamn where were just 500 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

== Shipping ==
At the early 1880s Mattson started shipping business first as minor shareholder of various ships, later as sole owner. He bought old, at least quarter of century old sailing ships. By the 1890s steamers started to replace sailing ships and Mattson could obtain good sailing ships for relatively cheap. Until the end of the 19th century Mattson only owned wooden ships; in 1900 he bought majority ownership of two steel-hulled [[windjammer]]s and one [[barque]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

Mattson became one of the most successful Åland shipowners along with [[August Troberg]] and [[Mathias Lundqvist]]. While Mattson played with high risk by operating with old craft, his business was so profitable that for a short period at the early 20th century he was the biggest shipowner of Finland – although 15 out of the 30 ships he owned between 1880 and 1920 were lost due to serious sea accidents or they were [[Scuttling|scuttled]]. Despite of this Mattson still had the largest tonnage amongst Åland shipowners after the [[First World War]]. Soon after Mattson gave up shipping with sailing ships; the last one was sold in 1924.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

Mattson bought his first steam ship, 4,600-GRT ''Naxos'' in 1925. The ship was operated via Helsinki-based company called ''Ab Naxos Prince'' which was owned by Mattson family. During the following couple of years the tonnage was grown by three more vessels, and at the end of the 1920s the company became with its 20,000-GRT craft the second biggest line shipping company of Helsinki after [[FÅA]]. All of Mattson's ships were over 20 years old and they were used in [[tramp ship]]ping which was sensitive to economic fluctuations. During the whole time of its operation the company created heavy losses.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

== Estate business ==
[[File:Nordsjo kno.jpg|240px|thumb|Nordsjö Manor.]]
Mattson started estate investment in Helsinki in the early 20th century. He owned [[Königstedt Manor]] during 1902–1907. Following to the death of his wife Amanda in 1915, Mattson moved permanently to Helsinki. He obtained several real properties and empty lots in Helsinki, most significant being Nordsjö Manor which he bought in 1916.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

== Kone- ja Siltarakennus ==
After moving to Helsinki Mattson acquired 50.4% share of engineering company [[Kone- ja Siltarakennus]] (Kone ja Silta) which was amongst 30 biggest companies of Finland in number of headcount. The company benefitted from machinery orders by the [[Forest industry in Finland|Finnish forest industry]], and its managers [[Julius Stjernvall]] and later [[Robert Lavonius]] grew the company substantially through acquisitions. By the 1930s Kone ja Silta had become the largest engineering company of Finland, producing [[Lock (security device)|locks]], [[Separator (milk)|separators]], ships, bridges and other engineering products.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

The rapid growth together with the [[1930s recession]] led to financial problems; Kone ja Silta could not deliver profit, which frustrated Mattson. Mattson was also indebted due to his other businesses, and the company main creditor [[Pohjoismaiden Yhdyspankki]] (PYP) closed Mattson's shares into its vault as deposit. Mattson further worsened the situation by [[nepotism]]. His son Curt Mattson was a deputy member of the board and his two sons-in-law held manager positions. This led into collision with the operating management.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

Mattson died in 1935 after which PYP sold the Kone ja Silta shares to [[Wärtsilä]] company which was led by [[Wilhelm Wahlforss]]. The acquisition was remarkable because Wärtsilä was much smaller than Kone ja Silta.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

== Other businesses ==
Mattson was co-founder of ''Ålands Sjöfartstidning'' newspaper which was issued in 1904–1905. He worked as inspector of [[Åbo Aktiebank]] Mariehamn office since 1897.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

Mattson was member of Mariehamn [[town council]] for over ten years, also as a member of board of poor people's caretaking.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Mattson donated significant sum of 1.2 million [[Finnish markka|marks]] for founding musicology and folk poetry professorship in [[Åbo Akademi]]. It came out just decades later that the professor appointed into the position, [[Otto Andersson (musicologist)|Otto Andersson]], was Mattson's cousin, and he had formulated his job description himself.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

Mattson did not forget his roots; he supported financially renovation of Vårdö church, Åland seamens' mission and schools.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

== Personal life and family ==
Mattson is characterised as religious, hardworking and businessman by nature. He was modest and often excessively thrifty.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

Mattson was married twice; first to Amanda Gustava née Savander until her death in 1915. In the following year he married Sonja née Bergroth, formerly Tschaplin.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Robert Mattson"/&gt;

'''Rostyslav Shtyn''', {{lang-uk|Ростислав Романович Штинь}}, (born September 19, 1957) in the town of [[Khodoriv]] located in [[Lviv Oblast]], Ukraine is a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]-Canadian&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ростислав Штинь повернувся в Україну. В кінці 80-х він займався Іриною Білик і "Скрябіном",  Богдан Логвиненко, http://h.ua/story/52588/&lt;/ref&gt; musician, producer of music, film and television projects, a businessman and entrepreneur.

He played a figurative role in the development of [[Ukrainian music]] during the period of ''perebudova'', also known as [[Perestroika]] in the Russian language, and during the formative years of an independent [[Ukraine]]. As Ukrainian music specialist and critic, Oleskandr Yevtushenko writes: "The first swallow of Ukrainian show-business was Rostyslav Shtyn, what a "new Ukrainian" he was back then, when such a label didn't even exist. It was 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction of Євтушенко, Олександр, "Легенди химерного краю". Українська рок-антологія.

==Biography==

=== Youth and education ===
Born on {{Birth date|1957|9|19}} as the first of two sons born to ethnically Ukrainian parents Roman Shtyn who hailed from [[Ustrzyki Dolne]] and Stefaniya Shtyn (née Tsybran) who was from ''Demydiv'' just about six kilometres [[Cardinal direction|SW]] of [[Khodoriv]].&lt;ref&gt;Twenty years old and still fresh today – OPALNIY PRINZ - (Interview with Rostyslav Shtyn) http://wpawlowsky.com/2010/08/23/twenty-years-old-and-still-fresh-today-opalni-prinz/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974 he completed his studies at Khodoriv Secondary School № 2 and that same year he completed seven years of musical studies at the local musical school. In 1979 he completed his studies at the [[Vasyl Stefanyk Subcarpathian National University|Vasyl Stefanyk Pedagogical Institute in Ivano-Frankivsk]], graduating from the faculty of music.

In 1996 Shtyn received a diploma in ''Directing Pop and Massive Celebrations'' from the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts.

=== As a musician ===
Shtyn's musical activity started as a musician being involved with [[VIA music]], or Vocal Instrumental Ensembles, which at the time seemed to be all the rage as a counter to the influence of western [[Rock and roll]] and a way to allow domestic contemporary music to develop. His first participation was with [[VIA Opryshky]] where he played both violin and guitar in 1975. Some time after 1981 when ''Vatra'' was under the leadership of Ihor Bilozir. Shtyn joined the group playing violin and guitar.&lt;ref&gt;
Ходорівці на видноті: На 60-річчя Білозіра ватрівчани після довгих років вперше зберуться на сцені у Львові  http://khodoriv.info/news/hodorivtsi-na-vydnoti-na-60-richchya-bilozira-vatrivchany-pislya-dovhyh-rokiv-vpershe-zberutsya-na-stseni-u-lvovi/&lt;/ref&gt; Over time differences of opinion developed between Shtyn and Bilozir. Shtyn tried to convince Bilozir that he should abandon the completely folkloric style of ''Vatra'' and take a new approach. When this failed Shtyn left ''Vatra'' and formed ''Zhayvir'' as an alternative playing guitar and violin.

It was not uncommon for authorities in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] to make it difficult for those who did not fit into the expected box. With ''Zhayvir'' being affiliated with the local philharmonic by 1984 ''Zhayvir'' was constantly under pressure from authorities, though they were still invited to tour and due to their busy schedule Shtyn eventually left the group when he was invited to [[Leningrad]] by Albert Asadullin to work with him. Shtyn had a different vision, due to the control that was always present with these government controlled ''Vocal Instrumental Ensembles'', and this was also a contributing factor of his moving on.

The mid 1980s Shtyn collaborated with Volodymyr Prasalenko and Yuriy Sayenko, who had been in ''Zhayvir'' with him to produce Ukraine's first [[Rock opera]]. Based on a poem by [[Justinas Marcinkevičius]] entitled ''The Wall: an urban poem'', written in 1965&lt;ref&gt;Siena: miesto poema. – Vilnius: Vaga, 1965 – [[:lt:Justinas Marcinkevičius|Justinas Marcinkevičius]]&lt;/ref&gt; the three had little time to compose the music for this work. According to witnesses the three took their respective parts of the poem and it was only later in studio in [[Kyiv]] where Shtyn pulled together the three compositions and fused them into a final work, a combination of Rock music, Classical music and [[Experimental music]]. This work was filmed for television by Tetyana Mahar&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;''''Любов чи прагматизм? (Тетяна Магар)'''', Лариса Брюховецька, "Кіно-Театр" – http://www.ktm.ukma.edu.ua/show_content.php?id=798&lt;/ref&gt; and featured [[Larisa Dolina]] and Albert Asadullin singing the [[aria]]s and actors [[Nataliya Sumska]] and Anatoliy Khostikoyev playing the main roles.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Upon, completion of this project Shtyn along with ''Zhayvir'' were invited to work together with Asadullin in [[St Petersburg|Leningrad]] which resulted in ''Everything That Happened to Us''.&lt;ref&gt;Альбеpт АСАДУЛЛИН – http://www.rock-n-roll.ru/show.php?file=encyclopedia/%C0/%C0%D1%C0%C4%D3%CB%CB%C8%CD%20%C0%EB%FC%E1%E5%F0%F2&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to [[Lviv]] from working with Asadullin in Leningrad in 1987, he invited his brother [[Yuriy Shtyn]] who had moved to Lviv after completing his studies in [[Rivne]], to form their own studio, Holos,&lt;ref&gt;[[:uk:Ростислав-шоу]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Twenty years old and still fresh today – OPALNIY PRINZ – (Interview with Rostyslav Shtyn) http://wpawlowsky.com/2010/08/23/twenty-years-old-and-still-fresh-today-opalni-prinz/&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "voice" in the Ukrainian language. While it was still not possible for individuals to set up private businesses within Soviet Ukraine, the ''Holos'' studio was set up as a collective.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In three years, from 1986 through 1989 Shtyn set up the studio, helped his brother [[Yuriy Shtyn]] with the musical project and predecessor to ''Opalni Prinz'', ''Strus Mozku'', in English ''Brain Concussion''. That group included both Shtyn brothers, Roman Brytsky, Boris Rosenthul and a young actress from the [[Maria Zankovetska Theatre|Zankovetska Theatre]] by the name of Lyudmila Razik, in addition he also set up the ''Rostyslav-show'' agency.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Three of most important principles of the Rostyslav-show agency and ''[[Opalnyi Prynz]]'' were the idea of technical and financial independence and high quality sound.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Євтушенко, Олександр, "Легенди химерного краю". Українська рок-антологія. Київ-2004, "Автограф" – онлайн версія http://www.rock-oko.com/knizhki/oblichchya-muziki/tvorch-portreti/opalnij-princz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The group consisted of Yuriy Shtyn, who composed the material, sang and played keyboards; Toomas Vanem, lead guitar; second keyboardist, Roman Brytsky; and the elder Shtyn on vocals and guitar.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

''[[Opalnyi Prynz]]'' recorded their first singles: ''Mandry'' – ''Mandry'' 1987, ''Pozychayesh pamyat'' – ''You Borrow memory'', ''Chorna Dira'' – ''Black Hole'', ''Leonid Brezhnev'', which received airplay on [[Radio Liberty]], and ''Paskuda'' – ''Hussy''. Those were very socially and musically "different" singles&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; and were part of their first album also named ''Mandry''. A few more singles would be released: ''Shantrapa'' – ''Riff-raff'' 1987; from the ''Wanderings'' album; other singles included ''Kombi u L’vovi'' – ''Kombi in L'viv'' – 1988; ''Tankova attaka'' – ''Tank attack'' (in Russian) this composition included saxophonist Zenon Kovpak 1989; and, ''Hey Ukraino!'' – ''Hey Ukraine!'' the opening track of their second album ''Nova revolutsiya'', ''New revolution'' in 1991.

The principles which Shtyn espoused regarding financial and technical independence and quality sound, came through completely in the second album ''Nova revolutsia'' released in 1990. "Undoubtedly, all tracks of the album were inspired by the tectonic shifts in the life of Ukrainian society. It permeated the movement for freedom, the feeling of changes. At the same time perfectly recorded.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Євтушенко, Олександр, "Легенди химерного краю". Українська рок-антологія. Київ-2004, "Автограф" – онлайн версіяhttp://www.rock-oko.com/knizhki/oblichchya-muziki/tvorch-portreti/opalnij-princz.html&lt;/ref&gt;"

In 1991 one of ''Opalnyi Prynz'''s videos to their song ''Nash prapor'' from their ''Nova revolyutsiya'' album received broadcast time on [[MTV]] in honour of Ukraine's newly gained independence.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Business interests ==
Without a doubt Shtyn's business career started with the creation of the ''Holos'' studio to which he had invited his brother Yuriy Shtyn. This was the precursor of the Rostyslav-show agency. Not only did the agency provide support for ''Opalni prinz'', it played a role in the development of a number of different groups developing in [[Lviv]] at the end of the 1980s. Lviv-based ''Mertviy piven'', ''[[Dead Rooster]]'' recorded their first album ''ETO'' under guidance of the agency.&lt;ref&gt;Аудиозаписи –  Алфавитный список сформирован на основе электронного каталога, который создается с 1996 года.

According to journalist and contemporary Ukrainian music specialist Oleksandr Yevtushenko, Rostyslav Shtyn was not only one of the oldest rockers at concerts of the Lviv-based band ''999'' in the mid to late 1980s, not to be confused with the English    [[punk rock band]] which preceded them of the same name [[999 (band)|999]], but also one of the first serious show-businessmen in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Євтушенко, Олександр, "Легенди химерного краю". Українська рок-антологія. Київ-2004, "Автограф" – онлайн версія http://rock-oko.com/knizhki/legendi-ximernogo-krayu/rok-ukransko-vdach2/lvv1.html&lt;/ref&gt; While Yevtushenko is very knowledgeable about contemporary music, his use of artistic license, about which concerts Shtyn attended may have been a little extended, he is correct about the fact that Shtyn from the time of ''Zhayvir'' approached music as a business in order to be independent from government control, as well as being independent financially, technically in terms of having access to technology and ensuring that the quality of their sound was unsurpassed. This had always been Shtyn's approach and continues to be his approach in all business projects.

=== Aktsionerno-Komertsiyniy Bank "Halytskiy" ===
In late 1991, Shtyn together with Oleksandr Hryniv as the chairman registered a private bank called ''Aktsionerno-Komertsiyniy Bank "Halytskiy"'' and received their license on February 21, 1992&lt;ref&gt;Перелік комерційних банків, які одержали в Національному банку України ліцензію  на  право  проведення  операцій  з валютними цінностями станом на 07.04.95 -http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/v1046500-95&lt;/ref&gt; word is that Shtyn was a majority shareholder in the said institution&lt;ref&gt;Documents that are being searched for.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vernisage-92: Nova Ukrainianska Khvylia ===
The ''Vernisage-92: Nova Ukrainianska Khvylia'' – ''Vernisage-92: New Ukrainian Wave'' was conceived as not a music project, but as a commercial venture. As mentioned above, there were three different cultural events at three different venues in [[Kyiv]], [[Ukraine]]; however, there were also a number of business related forums. Many of which lead to Shtyn's visit to Washington DC as part of a Ukrainian delegation, together with [[Leonid Kravchuk]], in search of international financing for Ukraine's transformation from state controlled businesses to the privatization of the nation,&lt;ref&gt;Vika, political rock band from Ukraine, to tour USA – ''The Ukrainian Weekly'' May 3, 1992. Note: At this time there were very few individuals who understood the structure of the then [[Music industry]] in Ukraine – from my knowledge ''Vika Vradiy'' was under the management of ''Rostyslav-show'' in 1992 after the ''Vernisage-92: Nova Ukrainianska Khvylia'' the http://ukrweekly.com/archive/pdf3/1992/The_Ukrainian_Weekly_1992-18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; however it is very clear that Shtyn was not part of the band as suggested by [[The Ukrainian Weekly]] article. ''Vika Vradiy'' during a period in 1992, had been working directly with the ''Rostyslav-show'' agency and after the ''Vernisage-92'' presentation was to have had a European tour with ''Opalnyi Prynz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rock-oko.com/knizhki/legendi-ximernogo-krayu/festival-akcz-mprezi/vern.html|title="Вернісаж" - Українська музика та сучасна рок-культура.|website=www.rock-oko.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From those who attended the press conferences it was evident that Shtyn was working with [[Mandré|Michael Andre Lewis]] as he had stated that he was working on European tour for ''Opalnyi Prynz'' and ''Sestrychka Vika'' the stage name of Vika Vradiy. Unfortunately this was never realized for a number of different reasons.

After ''Vernisage:92'', Shtyn together with the League of Ukrainian Businessmen, which at the time was headed by Sergey Pogоrelov and Oleksiy Ivchenko, who later was to become Chairman of [[Naftogaz|Naftohaz of Ukraine]], were tasked by the Ukrainian government to work with a number of different international [[financial institution]]s such as [[Merrill Lynch]] and others to finance government programs, this led to Shtyn doing a great deal of the preparatory work for President [[Leonid Kravchuk]]'s official state visit to the United States from May 5&lt;ref&gt;"Ukraine's President Kravchuk prepares for U.S. visit ", by Marta Kolomayets "The Ukrainian Weekly" May 3, 1992 – http://ukrweekly.com/archive/pdf3/1992/The_Ukrainian_Weekly_1992-18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; −11 of 1992.

It is clear from Shtyn's activities that by the time the ''Rostyslav-show'' agency ceased operations Shtyn, had left Ukraine with a focus on German-Ukrainian relations from the projects he was producing in [[Bonn]], Germany.

=== CSS consulting GmbH ===

Shtyn was co-owner of [[Hüttenberg|Hüttenberg-based]] CSS consulting GmbH which worked on marketing for [[Uhlsport]], Boeringer Ingelheim Backmittel GmbH, which was sold by its parent company [[Boehringer Ingelheim]].&lt;ref&gt;1998 – Boeringer Ingelheim Backmittel GmbH sold https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/corporate_profile/history/history3.html&lt;/ref&gt; Boeringer Ingelheim Backmittel GmbH main business was a series of stabilization products used in the baking industry,&lt;ref&gt;Boehringer Ingelheim Backmittel GmbH Trademarks – https://trademarks.justia.com/owners/boehringer-ingelheim-backmittel-gmbh-495288/&lt;/ref&gt; this led Shtyn with his partners to form the Joint venture RL(meaning Rostyslav and Lida, that first names of Shtyn and his wife) Company ''Prosto dobriy khlib'', meaning "Simply good bread", with Ukrainian partners in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Про компанію – http://hlib.ua/kompaniia/pro-kompaniiu&lt;/ref&gt;

=== H&amp;S Sportsmanagement GmbH ===

Shtyn was co-owner of [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt-based]] H&amp;S Sportsmanagement GmbH. This firm worked on marketing projects for the [[Bundesliga]] and Shtyn acted as [[Nevio Scala]]'s agent during negotiations with [[Rinat Akhmetov]]'s [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]], and succeeded in transferring Scala to the club.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of press conference in the Russian language after the signing of Nevio Scala as head coach of FC Shakhtar Donetsk on January 21, 2002, with the participation of Rinat Akhmetov President of the Club, Mark Levytsky, Club VP, Nevio Scala and Rostyslav Shtyn – http://www.profootball.ua/2002/01/21/press_konferenciya_przidenta_shahtera.html&lt;/ref&gt; Just ten days before Scala was signed to [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]] [[UEFA]] had reported that Scala may have pulled out of running for the top coaching job.&lt;ref&gt;Shakhtar eager to find coach – http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ukr/news/newsid=14682.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salamon Berger''' (25 February 1858 – 11 January 1934) was a [[Croatian Jews|Croatian Jewish]] industrialist, textile trader, and founder and first director of the [[Ethnographic Museum, Zagreb|Ethnographic Museum]] in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name = "židovski zagreb"&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zmg&gt;{{hr icon}} Biba Salata; 150. obljetnica rođenja Salamona Bergera; Zagreb, moj grad; Ožujak 2008.; broj 11; str. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger was born on 25 February 1858 in Mnešice, [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]], in present-day [[Slovakia]]. When he lost his parents at 16 years of age, Berger moved to Zagreb.&lt;ref name=zmg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Predstavnici Matice Slovačke položili vijenac na grob osnivača etnografskog muzeja|pages=|publisher=www.index.hr|date=2004-01-11|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/predstavnici-matice-slovacke-polozili-vijenac-na-grob-osnivaca-etnografskog-muzeja/180124.aspx|accessdate=2012-11-01|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a textile merchant and manufacturer, Berger presented the products of Croatian industry on 96 exhibitions across the [[Europe]], [[United States]] and [[Australia]]. Over the course of his business travels around [[Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], he amassed a collection of ethnographic artefacts. The biggest portion of textile artefacts in his collection - such as [[weaving]]s and [[lace]] items - Berger had collected in the [[Posavina]] region. In 1919, Berger founded the Ethnographic Museum in Zagreb, featuring over 8,000 textile items from his collections, titled "The Land Collection of Salamon Berger". He also served as museum's first director until 1925, when he retired and was named honorary director.&lt;ref name=zmg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Katarina Bušić; Salamon Berger i počeci izložbene djelatnosti zagrebačkog Etnografskog muzeja; Etnografski muzej Zagreb; 26. veljače 2009.; str. 281 - 300.&lt;/ref&gt; Berger died in Zagreb in 1934 and was buried at [[Mirogoj Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=mirogoj&gt;{{hr icon}} Gradska groblja Zagreb: Salamon Berger, Mirogoj Ž-924-ARKP-16/1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silvio Gesell''' ({{IPA-de|ɡəˈzɛl|lang}}; 17 March 1862 – 11 March 1930) was a [[Germany|German]] [[merchant]], theoretical [[economist]], [[social activist]], [[Georgist]], [[anarchist]], [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hakim Bey]], ''T.A.Z.: The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism'', Autonomedia, 2003, p. 125: "Gesell ... and other anti-authoritatian and extreme libertarian socialists".&lt;/ref&gt; and founder of [[Freiwirtschaft]]. In 1900 he founded the magazine ''Geld-und Bodenreform'' (''Monetary and Land Reform''), but it soon closed for financial reasons. During one of his stays in Argentina, where he lived in a vegetarian commune, Gesell started the magazine ''Der Physiokrat'' together with Georg Blumenthal. In 1914, it closed due to censorship.

The Bavarian Soviet Republic, in which he participated, had a violent end and Gesell was detained for several months on a charge of treason, but was acquitted by a Munich court after a speech he gave in his own defence.

==Life==
Silvio Gesell's mother was [[Walloons|Walloon]] and his father was German, originally from [[Aachen]], who worked as a clerk in the then-[[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] district of [[Malmedy]], now part of [[Belgium]]. Silvio was the seventh of nine children.

After visiting the public Bürgerschule in [[Sankt Vith]], he attended [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Malmedy. Being forced to pay for his living expenses from an early age, he decided against attending a university and worked for the ''[[Reichspost|Deutsche Reichspost]]'', the [[mail|postal system]] of the [[German Empire]]. Dissatisfied, he began an apprenticeship to his merchant brother in [[Berlin]]. Then he lived in [[Málaga]], [[Spain]] for two years, working as a [[correspondent]]. He then returned to Berlin involuntarily to complete his [[Conscription in Germany|military service]]. After this, he worked as a merchant in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and [[Hamburg]].

In 1887, Gesell relocated to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], where he opened a [[franchising|franchise]] of his brother's business. The [[Baring crisis|1890 depression in Argentina]], which hurt his business considerably, caused him to think about the structural problems caused by the [[money|monetary system]]. In 1891, he released his first writing on this topic: ''Die Reformation des Münzwesens als Brücke zum sozialen Staat'' (''The Reformation of the Monetary System as a Bridge to a Social State''). He then wrote ''Nervus Rerum'' and ''The Nationalization of Money''. He gave his business to his brother and returned to Europe in 1892.

After a stay in Germany, Gesell relocated to [[Les Hauts-Geneveys]] in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]]. He farmed in order to support himself while continuing his economic studies. In 1900, he created the [[magazine]] ''Geld- und Bodenreform'' (''Monetary and Land Reform''), but it failed in 1903 for financial reasons.

From 1907 to 1911, Gesell was in Argentina again, then he returned to Germany and lived in the [[vegetarian]] commune ''Obstbausiedlung Eden'', which was founded by [[Franz Oppenheimer]] in [[Oranienburg]], north of Berlin. There, he founded the magazine ''Der Physiokrat'' together with [[Georg Blumenthal]]. It folded in 1914 due to [[censorship]] as [[World War I]] began.&lt;ref name="WO2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Onken|first=Werner|date=October 2000|journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume=59|issue=4|title=The Political Economy of Silvio Gesell: A Century of Activism |pages=615–616|jstor=3487828|doi=10.1111/1536-7150.00046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Gesell left Germany to return to his farm in Les Hauts-Geneveys. In 1919, he was asked to join the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] by [[Ernst Niekisch]]. The republic offered him a seat on the Socialization Commission and then appointed him the People's Representative for Finances. Gesell chose the Swiss [[mathematician]] [[Theophil Christen]] and the economist [[Ernst Polenske]] as his assistants and immediately wrote a law for the creation of [[Freigeld]], a currency system he had developed. His term of office lasted only seven days. After the violent end of the Bavarian Soviet Republic, Gesell was detained for several months until being acquitted of [[treason]]&lt;ref name="WO2000"/&gt; by a [[Munich]] [[court]]. Because of his participation with the Soviet Republic, Switzerland denied him return to his farm in Neuchâtel.

Gesell then relocated first to [[Nuthetal]], [[Potsdam-Mittelmark]], then back to Oranienburg. After another brief stay in Argentina during 1924, he returned to Oranienburg in 1927. There, he died of [[pneumonia]] on 11 March 1930.

He promoted his ideas in [[German language|German]] and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

[[Villa Gesell]], a seaside town in [[Buenos Aires Province]], Argentina was founded by his son, Don Carlos Idaho Gesell, who named it after his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gesell.gov.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=244&amp;Itemid=74 |title= El Museo de Villa Gesell |website= Official website of Villa Gesell |language= Spanish |accessdate= 30 September 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130730061313/http://gesell.gov.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=244&amp;Itemid=74 |archivedate= 30 July 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic philosophy==
Gesell considered himself a [[world citizen]] and was inspired by [[Henry George]] to believe that the [[earth]] should belong to all people, regardless of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[Social class|class]], [[wealth]], [[religion]], or age and that [[border]]s should be made obsolete. But his land reform proposal was different from [[Georgism]]. He believed that taxes could not solve the problem of rent on land,&lt;ref&gt;http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Natural_Economic_Order/Part_I/Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; as taxes could be transferred to tenants.&lt;ref name="wikilivres.ca"&gt;http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Natural_Economic_Order/Part_I/Chapter_11&lt;/ref&gt; He thought we must abolish the private ownership of land and put free-land reform, a sort of public lease of land, into effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Natural_Economic_Order/Part_II/Chapter_3&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Silvio Gesell, it is not effective to establish welfare systems without abolishing private ownership of land because the proceeds of the labor of workers are determined by the proceeds of labor that they can obtain on free land.&lt;ref&gt;https://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Natural_Economic_Order/Part_I/Chapter_13&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits gained by the welfare system are not to increase the proceeds of labor that workers can obtain on free land, but rather to increase the proceeds of labor that they can obtain on the lands of landowners. Private ownership of land converts all the advantages of using one's land into cash and it belongs to the landowner.&lt;ref&gt;https://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Natural_Economic_Order/Part_II/Chapter_4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wikilivres.ca"/&gt; In order not to cancel the effects of welfare policies, Silvio Gesell's Free-Land reform is needed.

Gesell based his economic thought on the self-interest of individuals, which he saw as a "natural" and healthy motive, in satisfying their needs and being productive. Gesell believed that an economic system must do justice to individual proclivities; otherwise the system would fail. He believed that this stance put him in opposition to [[Marxism]], which, Gesell considered, proposed an economic system that was against human nature.

Believing that the talent and selfishness of individuals must be taken into account, Gesell called for free, fair business competition, with equal chances for all. This included the removal of all legal and inherited [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]. Everyone should rely only on their abilities to make a living. In the "natural economic order" which Gesell recommended, the most talented people would have the greatest income, without distortion by [[interest]] and [[rent charge]]s. The economic status of the less-talented would improve because they would not be forced to pay interest and rent charges. According to Gesell, this would result in less difference between the poor and the rich. Furthermore, greater [[average income]]s would mean that the poor would have a greater chance of escaping poverty, in part because other poor people would have greater disposable income and spending power.

Some regard Gesell's idea as a negative interest rate policy. The difference between them is that, with the free-money reforms of Gesell, hoarding money becomes impossible because the face-value of money is depreciated regularly. This forces the circulation of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bershidsky|first1=Leonid|title='Neglected Prophet' of Economics Got It Right| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-07-03/-neglected-prophet-of-economics-got-it-right|website=Bloomberg View|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With negative interest, on the contrary, there is the possibility of hoarding money because the face value of money is constant and people can use their money as a means of saving. For example, Japan's negative interest rates are driving up the sales of safes and strongboxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shen|first1=Lucinda|title=Japan’s Negative Interest Rates Are Driving up Sales of Safes|url=http://fortune.com/2016/02/23/japans-negative-interest-rate-driving-up-safe-sales/|accessdate=1 June 2017|work=Fortune|date=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gesell denied value theory in economics. He thought that value theory is useless and prevents economics from becoming science and that a currency administration guided by value theory is doomed to sterility and inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;https://biblio.wiki/wiki/The_Natural_Economic_Order/Part_III/Chapter_3&lt;/ref&gt;

|Free money may turn out to be the best regulator of the velocity of circulation of money, which is the most confusing element in the stabilization of the price level. Applied correctly it could in fact haul us out of the crisis in a few weeks ... I am a humble servant of the merchant Gesell.
|Prof. Dr. [[Irving Fisher]], economist, [[Yale University]]&lt;ref&gt;Stamp Scrip, New York: 1933, p. 67 and Mail and Empire, Toronto: 21 November 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote
|Gesell's chiefwork is written in cool and scientific terms, although it is run through by a more passionate and charged devotion to social justice than many think fit for a scholar. I believe that the future will learn more from Gesell’s than from Marx’s spirit.
|[[John Maynard Keynes]], economist, Fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;''General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money'', London (1957), p. 355 (whole text on Gesell p. 353–358 and 379).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote
|Gesell's standpoint is both anticlassical and antimarxist... The uniqueness of Gesell's theory lies in his attitude to social reform. His theory can only be understood considering his general point of view as a reformer ... His analysis is not completely developed in several important points, but all in all his model shows no fault.
|Prof. Dr. Dudley Dillard, economist, [[University of Maryland]]
&lt;ref&gt;"Gesell's Monetary Theory of Social Reform", ''American Economic Review'' (AER), Vol 32 (1942), p. 348–349.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote
|We would especially like to certify our great esteem for pioneers such as Proudhon, Walras, and Silvio Gesell, who accomplished the great reconciliation of individualism and collectivism that the economic order we are striving for must rest upon.
|Prof. Dr. [[Maurice Allais]], economist, [[University of Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;''Economie et Intérêt'', Paris 1947, p. 613.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote
|Academic economists are ready to ignore the 'crackpots', especially the monetary reformers. Johannsen, [[Foster and Catchings]], Hobson and Gesell all had brilliant contributions to make in our day, but could receive no audience. It is hoped, that in the future economists will give a sympathetic ear to those who possess great economic intuition.
|Prof. Dr. [[Lawrence Klein]], economist, [[University of Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Keynesian Revolution'' (1949–1968), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote
|Economic science owes Silvio Gesell profound insights into the nature of money and interest, but Silvio Gesell has always been considered a queer fellow by economic circles. To be sure, he was no professor, which already raises suspicion... The decisive fact is that Silvio Gesell's fundamental ideas with regard to an economic order are correct and exemplary. Exemplary is furthermore, that in the creation of a functional monetary order he should see the 'nervus rerum' of a functional economic and social order.
|Prof. Dr. [[Joachim Starbatty]], economist, [[University of Tübingen]]&lt;ref&gt;Eine kritischeWürdigung der Geldordnung in Silvio Gesells utopischem Barataria (cheapland). Fragen der Freiheit Nr. 129 / 1977, pp. 6 and 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote
|Silvio Gesell managed to write clearly and make himself understood, a gift that most pure theorists and reformers as well as many practical experts of today lack. The Natural Economic Order makes worthwhile reading even in our days... Gesell developed brilliant concepts and was forgotten, while his less brilliant contemporaries ... dazzled several generations before the realization of their falseness could break through.
|Prof. Dr. [[Oswald Hahn]], economist, [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]]&lt;ref&gt;''In memoriam Silvio Gesell. Zeitschrift für das gesamte Kreditwesen'', Vol. 33 (1980), No. 6, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Gesell is a smart outsider, who ... treated the subjects of money and interest, the right to full proceeds from labor and suggestions for remedies, in a very original way ... The ideas he conceived regarding his problems and what he deemed appropriate for the crises of his times are worth considering with respect to a fundamental improvement of monetary conditions in general.
|Prof. Dr. [[Dieter Suhr]], jurist, [[University of Augsburg]]&lt;ref&gt;''Geld ohne Mehrwert – Entlastung der Marktwirtschaft von monetären Transaktionskosten''. Frankfurt 1983, pp. 17, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Gesell is the founder of the free economy, an economic outsider who nevertheless was recognized by Keynes, in a certain sense, as his forerunner. He is therefore still considered to be above all a Keynesian economist, even a kind of hyper-Keynesian, that is to say, an advocate of a school that propagates the lowest (nominal) interest rate possible as a means of avoiding crises. Gesell, however, also recognized that the problem of a crisis cannot be solved solely by reducing the rates of interest... Gesell suggests, therefore, as the necessary correlative to the introduction of 'free money' ... the introduction of ‘free land’... Gesell's chief work thus carries the title ‘A Natural Economic Order Through Free Land (!) and Free Money’. It proves that the real aspects of an economy – that is to say, the claim on land or resources – must never be lost from view, even if primary importance is attached to monetary factors. This was recognized more clearly by Gesell than by Keynes.
|Prof. Dr. [[Hans C. Binswanger]], economist, College of Economic and Social Sciences Academy at St. Gallen/Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;''Arbeit ohne Umweltzerstörung – Strategien einer neuen Wirtschaftspolitik''. Frankfurt 1983, pp. 246–248.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">The '''Color Association of the United States''' ('''CAUS'''), known until 1955 as the '''Textile Color Card Association of the United States''' (TCCA), is an independent color trend forecasting and color consulting service to the business community, known for its textile [[Textile sample|color swatch]] book, the [[Standard Color Reference of America]] (formerly the Standard Color Card of America).

==Purpose==
As industry exploded after the [[Industrial Revolution]] certain industries especially in the textiles trade found the need to be able to better predict and set upcoming color and style trends. The Color Association of the United States (CAUS), then the Textile Color Card Association of the United States (TCCA), was formed to accomplish this goal. By implementing a standard, business could then plan upcoming product releases and marketing with better hope of success.

===Mission===
#Issue color forecasts in the form of cards twice a year
#Give directions in color trends to the market
#Enable different segments of the market to coordinate their products by offering the formulas for the production of each forecast color
#Buy products worldwide knowing they would coordinate at the point of sale
#Serve as an information center for all kinds of color information.

The central purpose of setting trends and maintaining color standards is accomplished to this day in part through publication of the "[[Standard Color Reference of America]]", and other swatch books.

==History==
Prior to the creation of the TCCA in 1915, later to become The Color Association, hat makers took on the responsibility of color forecasting in the textile industry. Following [[World War I]] the information and supplies the milners were using from Europe, especially France, was cut off. Textile manufacturers who had grown dependent of these color decisions decided to form their own committee, the TCCA, which immediately published a Standard Color Card.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0CE3DF1038E633A25754C0A9609C946496D6CF “STANDARD COLOR CARD; Has 106 Shades for Use by Textile and Allied Trades.”] ''New York Times''. 7 June 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Hayden Rorke (1931). [http://www.opticsinfobase.org/josa/abstract.cfm?uri=josa-21-10-651 “The Work of the Textile Color Card Association”]. ''[[Journal of the Optical Society of America|JOSA]]'' '''21'''(10). 651–653.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on the TCCA set out to create what they termed "staple colors" that would facilitate the color coordination and consistency, especially among unrelated trades.

By 1930 the TCCA had built close ties to the United States government, especially in the military. The TCCA played a major role in defining the colors and their names for all manner of government related items such as uniforms, ribbons, medals, and flags. For example, the modern [[Flag of the United States#Design|Flag of the United States]] uses specific colors selected and named by the TCCA (Old Glory Red and Old Glory Blue).

Through the 1940s and 1950s the TCCA membership increased, including international companies. This expansion led to the creation of industry specific trends and color books sponsored by those industries and more direct consulting to individual companies.

To this day CAUS plays a major role in the determining of color trends for industry.

==Process of creating palettes==
Many Color Cards or palettes are created for various industries each year. For each area of focus a committee panel is formed, consisting of eight to twelve people, referred in the business as the "Color Czars." Each member of the committee performs their own research on what colors they feel will, should, dominate the next few years in that industry. The committee then convenes and they debate the merits of the member selections. In the end they choose 44 colors that will make it to the palette. According to Forecaster Ken Charbonneau, the process is a lot of debate before consensus.

==Publications==
===The Color Compendium===
by Augustine Hope and Margaret Walch

A fully illustrated encyclopedia focused entirely on color including scientific, technical, historical, and artistic concepts.

===Color &amp;amp; Human Response===
by [[Faber Birren]]

'''Wojciech Fibak''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈvojtɕɛx ˈfibak}}; popular '''Wojtek Fibak''' {{IPA-pl|ˈvojtɛk-|}}; born 30 August 1952) is a  [[Poland|Polish]] [[entrepreneur]], [[art collector]], [[businessman]] and former [[tennis]] player best known for his doubles success with [[Tom Okker]] and [[Kim Warwick]], but also for having reached the Top 10 in singles. He is currently believed one of the richest men in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lexpress.fr/informations/fibak-la-fortune-a-toute-volee_608386.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography and Personal Life==
Born in [[Poznań]], Poland, he won his first tournament in 1976, and between then and 1982 won 15 singles titles and 52 doubles titles. His best year was arguably 1980, when he reached the quarter-finals at the [[French Open]], the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and [[Wimbledon championships|Wimbledon]]. Fibak's career singles win-loss record was 520–310, and he reached his career-high singles ranking of World No. 10 on 25 July 1977. His highest doubles ranking was World No. 2, which he reached in February 1979. He was consistently ranked in the top 20 in singles, and earned [[US$|$]]2,725,403 in career prize money.

The highlight of his career was winning the [[Australian Open]] Men's Doubles in 1978 with [[Kim Warwick]]. They beat [[Paul Kronk]] and [[Cliff Letcher]] 7–6, 7–5 to take the title.

In 1983 he was banned from his local Poznań tennis club and faced reduced involvement from the Polish Tennis Federation and [[Davis Cup]] [[Poland Davis Cup team|national team]] for his opposition to the communist [[Polish United Workers' Party|PZPR]] government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/05/27/Polands-top-tennis-player-Wojtek-Fibak-banned-from-his/9434422856000/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1985, Fibak founded the Polish Tennis Club (''Polish Tennis Association of [[Southern California]]''), in the 90s he was head of the Polish Tennis Federation and widely credited with popularising the sport in his native country. After the fall of communism in early 90s his company ''Fibak Press'' acquired the regional former PZPR mouthpiece [[Gazeta Poznańska]], until it was acquired by rivals [[Głos Wielkopolski]] in 2006, and published several other newspapers and magazines as well as involvement in books related to tennis.

He is also a businessman and an avid [[art collector]] and used his tennis fortune to open the ''[[Art gallery|Galeria]] Fibak'' 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galeriafibak.com.pl&lt;/ref&gt;

Fibak divides his time between [[Warsaw]] and [[Monaco]], where he was Poland's [[honorary consul]].&lt;ref&gt;Kronika Wydarzeń. Część druga (kwiecień – czerwiec 1989), w: Kronika Miasta Poznania, nr 1-2/1991, s.229, ISSN 0137-3552&lt;/ref&gt; He is a self-declared local patriot and was close to fellow local multi-millionaire [[Jan Kulczyk]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gloswielkopolski.pl/artykul/6242824,wojciech-fibak-poznan-jest-wciaz-moj,id,t.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He has three daughters: Agnieszka, Paulina, and Nina.

'''Zurab Noghaideli''' ({{lang-ka|ზურაბ ნოღაიდელი}}) (born 22 October 1964) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] businessman and a politician who served as the [[Prime Minister of Georgia]] from February 2005 until he resigned, citing health problems, on 16 November 2007. In December 2008, Noghaideli withdrew into opposition, setting up the [[Movement for Fair Georgia]] party.&lt;ref name="nogha"&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=20068&amp;search=nogaideli Ex-PM Nogaideli Sets Up Party]. "[[Civil Georgia]]". 3 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Kobuleti]], [[Ajaria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Noghaideli graduated from the [[Moscow State University]] with a diploma in [[Physics]] in 1988. Before entering into national politics, he worked for the ''Institute of [[Geography]]'' of the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]] between 1988-1992. In 1989-1990, he was also trained at the Institute of [[Geology]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of Estonia|Academy of Sciences]] of [[Estonia]].

==Parliament==
He started his political career together with his friend, [[Zurab Zhvania]], in the [[Green Party (Georgia)|Green Party]] of Georgia in early 1990s. Noghaideli became a deputy in the [[Parliament of Georgia]] in 1992, elected following the overthrow of President [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]], and chaired the Parliamentary Committee on Environment Protection and Natural Resources during 1992-1995. He was again member of the successor Parliaments in 1995-1999 and 1999–2000, when he chaired the Parliamentary Tax and Income Committee.

==Minister of Finance==
He joined the government of [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] in the capacity of [[Ministry of Finance (Georgia)|Minister of Finance]] in May 2000. During these years, he was considered a member of a political team of young reformists headed by Zurab Zhvania and [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] and proved to be quite an effective minister.

In 2001, he left the President-run [[Union of Citizens of Georgia]] party which he had joined in 1995. He was sacked, in 2002, without explanation, though it appears that he had intended to resign in protest against the policies of Shevardnadze’s increasingly corrupted government (as the Minister of Justice Mikheil Saakashvili did a year before).

In a brief period of 2002-2003, he was involved in banking and investment ventures.

After Shevardnadze was ousted in the [[Rose Revolution]] of 21–23 November 2003, Noghaideli returned to government as the economic adviser to the acting president, [[Nino Burjanadze]]. He was re-appointed to his old post as Minister of Finance in February 2004 in the government of Prime Minister [[Zurab Zhvania]].

==Prime minister==
{{Commons category|Zurab Noghaideli}}
President [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] nominated Noghaideli for the post of Prime Minister on 11 February 2005 following the untimely death of Zhvania. He was confirmed by the Georgian Parliament on 17 February 2005 by a vote of 175 to 24, and was sworn in immediately. Noghaideli is not a member of any party and is regarded as a [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]] with a tough approach to the corruption that plagues Georgia's economy.

According to ''Financial'' weekly Georgian newspaper The World Bank Group and the U.S. Agency for International Development has honored Zurab Nogaideli, Prime Minister of Georgia, as top business environment reformer of the year 2007. The Prime Minister has led reforms which have catapulted Georgia from a ranking of 112 to 37th place in the World Bank Group’s 2007 global rankings on the regulatory ease of doing business.

==Resignation==
Noghaideli announced his resignation on 16 November 2007 due to his poor health condition. In April 2007, Noghaideli underwent elective [[open-heart surgery]] at [[St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital]] in [[Houston]], U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2007/07-04-20.rferl.html RFE/RL Newsline, 07-04-20].
