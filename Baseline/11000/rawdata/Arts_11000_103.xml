      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3345">'''48 Portraits''' is a group of works by the German painter [[Gerhard Richter]]. In the years {{nobr|1971{{ndash}}1972}} Richter created a series of portraits of personalities who influenced modernity in a [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] manner. Oriented towards a central imaginary observer, they give the impression of a modern painted [[frieze]] of portrait heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kunstforum.de/artikel/face-as-interface/|title=Face as Interface – www.kunstforum.de|work=www.kunstforum.de|access-date=2018-09-14|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richter participated in the 1972 edition of the [[Venice Biennale]] with this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macba.cat/en/48-portraits-1513|title=48 Portraits|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are exhibited in the [[Museum Ludwig]] in Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.museum-ludwig.de/de/ausstellungen/rueckblick/2017/gerhard-richter-neue-bilder.html|title=Gerhard Richter.

'''ACiD Productions''' ('''ACiD''') is a [[digital art]] group. Founded in 1990, the group originally specialized in [[ANSI art]]work for [[bulletin board system|BBSes]].&lt;ref name=textfiles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defacto2.net/documents.cfm?id=183 |title=Online Software Piracy of the Last Millennium |first=Ben |last=Garrett |date=2004-04-27 |publisher=defacto2.net |format=pdf |quote=ACID (ANSI Creators In Demand) where the first of these international groups, trend setters who originally specialised in ANSI art and ANSIMation ads. They earned their reputation at being one of the best groups by creating art for the best pirate boards of the time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, they have extended their reach into other graphical media and [[computer software]] development. During the BBS-era, their biggest competitor was [[iCE Advertisements]].&lt;ref name="citylights"&gt;Hargadon, Michael A. "[http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/7341/ Like City Lights, Receding: ANSi Artwork and the Digital Underground, 1985-2000]." ''Concordia University'', March 18, 2011. Retrieved October 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ACiD Productions was founded in 1990 as '''ANSI Creators in Demand'''&lt;ref name="bbsdoc"&gt;Sadofsky, Jason Scott. "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460402/ BBS: The Documentary]".  ARTSCENE Episode.  May 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  by five members: [[RaD Man]], Shadow Demon, Grimm, The Beholder, and Phantom. Their work originally concentrated in [[ANSI art|ANSI]] and [[ASCII art]], but the group later branched out into other artistic media such as [[Module file|tracker music]], [[Demo (computer programming)|demo]] coding, and multimedia [[software engineering|software development]] (e.g., image viewers).  Membership rose from five members in 1990 to well over seven hundred by 2003.&lt;ref name="eternal"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050208130916/http://www.acid.org/100/eternal.html ACiD-100 All-time memberlist] (1990–2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, ACiD created subsidiary groups responsible for these broader areas.  For example, [[Remorse ASCII|Remorse]] is the official ACiD sub-label responsible for ASCII art and other [[text mode|text-based]] graphics.  Similarly, pHluid is responsible for module tracking and music production, and ACiDic handles bulletin board software modification and enhancement.

Following the post dial-up BBS era, ACiD focused largely on the preservation of [[digital art]] history, [[talk radio]] news, the sale of their [[DVD]]-based artscene archives,&lt;ref&gt;http://cd.textfiles.com/darkdomain/whatisit.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defacto2.net/commercial/dark-domain&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsorship of [[demoparty|demoparties]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demoparty.net/news/13/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evoke.eu/2005/5757,partners.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080723165945/http://www.tmdc.scene.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[San Francisco]] gallery 20 goto 10 featured an exhibit of ACiD artists Somms and Lord Jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnettv.cnet.com/ansi-art-masses/9742-1_53-32159.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215102642/http://cnettv.cnet.com/ansi-art-masses/9742-1_53-32159.html |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blip.tv/getv/ansi-art-618816 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215101028/http://blip.tv/getv/ansi-art-618816 |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080221175728/http://www.ansigallery.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Early-computer-generated-art-revived-for-S-F-3232788.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, members from ACiD collaborated with 21st century ANSI art collective [[Blocktronics]] to produce "Blocktronics ACiD Trip", a scrolling ANSI measuring 3,266 lines tall.  This ANSI artwork debuted at [[Demosplash]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] where it was awarded first place in the ANSI and ASCII category.&lt;ref&gt;http://boingboing.net/2013/10/10/deeply-psychedelic-ansi-scroll.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/11/4827136/join-r2-d2-and-hitler-on-an-unforgettable-ansi-acid-trip&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rhizome.org/portfolios/artwork/57855/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://laughingsquid.com/blocktronics-acid-trip-a-super-long-piece-of-collaborative-ansi-art/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acclaimmag.com/arts/blocktronics-acid-trip/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Athena Promachos''''' (Ἀθηνᾶ Πρόμαχος "Athena who fights in the front line") was a colossal bronze statue of [[Athena]] sculpted by [[Pheidias]], which stood between the [[Propylaea]]&lt;ref name="Gaifman"/&gt; and the [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis]] of Athens. Athena was the [[tutelary deity]] of Athens and the goddess of wisdom and warriors. Pheidias also sculpted two other figures of Athena on the Acropolis, the huge gold and ivory ("[[chryselephantine]]") [[cult image]] of ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' in the Parthenon and the ''[[Lemnian Athena]]''.

The designation ''Athena Promachos'' is not attested before a dedicatory inscription of the early fourth century CE;&lt;ref&gt;Birte Lundgreen, "A Methodological Enquiry: The Great Bronze Athena by Pheidias" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''117''' (1997, pp. 190-197) p 198. Lundgreen usefully assembles the literature.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (1.28.2) referred to it as "the great bronze Athena" on the Acropolis.

== History ==
The ''Athena Promachos'' was one of the earliest recorded works by [[Phidias|Pheidias]] and was originally a well-known and famous Athenian landmark.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2013|title=Athena Promachos|url=|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|volume=56|pages=|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Greek traveler and geographer, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the top of Athena's helmet as well as the tip of her spear could be seen by sailors and anyone approaching Athens from [[Attica]], at [[Sounion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Classical World: The Foundations of the West and the Enduring Legacy of Antiquity|last=Spivey|first=Nigel|publisher=Pegasus Books|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originally stood between the [[Erechtheion]] and the [[Propylaea]].&lt;ref name="Gaifman"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaifman|first=Milette|date=2006-04-01|title=Statue, Cult and Reproduction|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8365.2006.00501.x/abstract|journal=Art History|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=258–279|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8365.2006.00501.x|issn=1467-8365}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Athena Parthenos Harpers.png|thumb|Illustration of the Athena Parthenos from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 1892 ]]
Erected around 456 BCE, the ''Athena Promachos'' was either to memorialize the Battle of Marathon or the Persian Wars which is possibly what the dedicatory inscription refers to; This inscription also mentions that the trophies won in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]] were once placed around the [[pedestal]] of the statue (Raubitschek, A. E., and Gorham P. Stevens). It took somewhere near nine years to construct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the Greek Byzantine historian, Niketas Choniates, the Athena Promachos stood at around thirty feet(10 meters) tall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is known that the statue was to be a ‘thanks’ after war but there are many disagreements about which war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has also been suggested that the ''Athena Promachos'' may have been a cult statue.&lt;ref name="Gaifman" /&gt; For a long time there was speculation if the ''Athena Promachos'' even existed, however most scholars now agree that it did as there is proof from Roman coins that depict it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;



Surviving accounts for the creation process for the sculpture cover nine years, but the dates are not identifiable, because the names of officials are missing.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart; Lundgreen 1997:191&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture may have commemorated Kimon's defeat of the Persians at the Eurymedon in 467 or the [[Peace of Callias|peace of Kallias]] in approximately 450 or 449.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Made entirely of bronze, the ''Athena Promacho''s was spoken of as both ‘the bronze Athena’ and ‘the great bronze Athena,’ in ancient times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term ‘Promachos’ meaning ‘fighting before’ or ‘in front of’ was not originally used when referring to the statue; this nickname came later, most notably being used by [[Pope Zosimus|Zosimus]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Athena Promachos'' stood&lt;ref&gt;Some references{{Who|date=June 2017}} casually refer to her as "sitting".&lt;/ref&gt; overlooking her city for approximately 1000 years, until shortly after 465 CE,&lt;ref&gt;Lundgreen 1997:190.&lt;/ref&gt; when the sculpture was transported to [[Constantinople]] (capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) as a trophy in the "Oval Forum", which became the last bastion and safe haven for many surviving Greek bronze sculptures under the protection of the Eastern Empire's Imperial court. Niketas Choniates documented a riot taking place in the Forum of Constantine in Constantinople in 1203 CE where a large, bronze, statue of Athena was destroyed by a “drunken crowd” of Crusaders which is now thought to have been the ''Athena Promachos.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Lemnia torso05 pushkin.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of Phidias' Athena Lemnia. [[File:Athena Varvakeion - MANA - Fidias.jpg|thumb|Athena Varvakeion, Roman copy of the Athena Parthenos by Phidias.]]]]
Of surviving models thought to represent the type, the two outstanding ones are the ''Athena Elgin'', a small bronze statuette in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;MMA acc. no. 50.11.1. Height 0.149 m.&lt;/ref&gt; who bears an owl in her outstretched hand (as among some coin types), and the ''Athena Medici'' torso in the [[Musée du Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;MA 3070. Height 2.6 m.&lt;/ref&gt; of which there are a number of replicas.

== Iconography ==

The engravings on the shield which Athena is holding were originally drafted by the great Greek painter, [[Parrhasius (painter)]] of [[Ephesus]]. Although he drafted them, the engravings were physically done by an engraver named, Mys. The engravings were not done during the time the statue was being made but actually added after.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A ‘molding pit’ from the fifth century BCE was found near the south side of the Acropolis and it is thought that the statue was made in a nearby workshop.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Niketas gives a vivid description of the Athena Parthenos: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The goddess wore an ankle-length garment tightly belted at the waist and over it an aegis, complete with gorgoneion. Her neck was uncovered. On her head she wore a helmet with a horse-hair crest and her hair could be seen escaping from beneath the helmet on to her forehead. At the back, the hair was plaited. Her left hand held the folds of her dress, while the right was outstretched towards the south."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* [[Lemnian Athena]], classical Greek statue also made by Phidias. 
* [[Varvakeion Athena]], a 3rd-century Roman copy of the ''Athena Parthenos''.

== Coinage depictions ==
The very first specific archaistic ''Athena Promachos'' coin image was depicted on coins that were issued by [[Alexander the Great]] in 326''.''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havelock|first=Christine Mitchell|date=1980|title=The Archaistic Athena Promachos in Early Hellenistic Coinages|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=84|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.2307/504393|jstor=504393}}&lt;/ref&gt; One side of this coin depicts [[Heracles]] while the other side shows the god, [[Zeus]], with Athena by his knee ready to fight with her spear in her right hand and a shield held in her left. Around ten years later, the ''Athena Promachos'' appears on coins issued by [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] in Alexandria before taking the title of king around 315 BCE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Attic coins from the second and third centuries CE show the only known images of Phidias' ''Athena Promachos''. On one side is the depiction of the view of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] from the north. Between the Propylaia and the Erechtheion, there is large female statue of Athena facing towards the west. As these images place the statue of the Athena Promachos in this specific location, there is no doubt that it existed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is another group of provincial Roman coins that depict the bust of Athena alone. In this depiction she is wearing a Corinthian helmet with a "wave" of hair upon her forehead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These coins date from the first half of the second century CE to the second half of the third century CE and are considered to be the most common. Since more coinage depictions of Athena wearing a Corinthian helmet have been found as opposed to those that depict her with an Attic helmet, it is thought that the Corinthian were a more popular representation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Bookbinding''' is the process of physically assembling a [[book]] of [[codex]] format from an ordered stack of [[paper]] sheets that are folded together into sections or sometimes left as a stack of individual sheets. The stack is then bound together along one edge by either sewing with thread through the folds or by a layer of flexible adhesive. Alternative methods of binding that are cheaper but less permanent include loose-leaf rings, individual screw posts or binding posts, twin loop spine coils, plastic spiral coils, and plastic spine combs. For protection, the bound stack is either wrapped in a flexible cover or attached to stiff boards. Finally, an attractive cover is adhered to the boards, including identifying information and  decoration. Book artists or specialists in book decoration can also greatly enhance a book's content by creating book-like objects with artistic merit of exceptional quality.

Before the computer age, the bookbinding trade involved two divisions. First, there was '''[[Stationery]]''' binding (known as [[vellum]] binding in the trade) that deals with books intended for handwritten entries such as accounting ledgers, business journals, blank books, and guest log books, along with other general office stationery such as [[notebook|note books]], manifold books, day books, diaries, portfolios, etc.  Computers have now replaced the pen and paper based accounting that constituted most of the stationery binding industry. Second was '''[[letterpress printing|Letterpress]]''' binding which deals with making books intended for reading, including [[library binding]], fine binding, edition binding, and publisher's bindings.{{sfn|Vaughan|1950|p=xi}} A third division deals with the repair, restoration, and conservation of old used bindings.

Today, modern bookbinding is divided between '''hand binding''' by individual craftsmen working in a shop and '''commercial bindings''' mass-produced by high-speed machines in a factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from one-of-a-kind custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large-run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. For the largest numbers of copies, commercial binding is effected by production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory.

==Overview==
Bookbinding is a specialized trade that relies on basic operations of measuring, cutting, and gluing. A finished book might need dozens of operations to complete, according to the specific style and materials. Bookbinding combines skills from other trades such as paper and fabric crafts, leather work, model making, and graphic arts. It requires knowledge about numerous varieties of book structures along with all the internal and external details of assembly. A working knowledge of the materials involved is required. A book craftsman needs a minimum set of hand tools but with experience will find an extensive collection of secondary hand tools and even items of heavy equipment that are valuable for greater speed, accuracy, and efficiency.

Bookbinding is an artistic craft of great antiquity, and at the same time, a highly mechanized industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.{{sfn|Robinson|1968|p=9}}

==History==
===Origins of the book===
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|The binding of a Chinese bamboo book ([[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'')]]
The craft of bookbinding probably originated in [[India]], where religious [[sutra]]s were copied on to palm leaves (cut into two, lengthwise) with a metal stylus. The leaf was then dried and rubbed with ink, which would form a stain in the wound. The finished leaves were given numbers, and two long twines were threaded through each end through wooden boards, making a [[Palm-leaf manuscript|palm-leaf book]]. When the book was closed, the excess twine would be wrapped around the boards to protect the manuscript leaves. Buddhist monks took the idea through Afghanistan to China in the first century BC.

Similar techniques can also be found in ancient Egypt where priestly texts were compiled on scrolls and books of papyrus. Another version of bookmaking can be seen through the ancient [[Mayan codex]]; only four are known to have survived the Spanish invasion of Latin America.

Writers in the Hellenistic-Roman culture wrote longer texts as [[scroll]]s; these were stored in boxes or shelving with small cubbyholes, similar to a modern winerack. Court records and notes were written on [[wax tablet]]s, while important documents were written on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]]. The modern English word ''book'' comes from the Proto-Germanic ''*bokiz'', referring to the beechwood on which early written works were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|book|accessdate=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was not needed in ancient times, as many early Greek texts—scrolls—were 30 pages long, which were customarily folded accordion-fashion to fit into the hand. Roman works were often longer, running to hundreds of pages. The Greeks used to call their books ''tome'', meaning "to cut". The Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]] was a massive 200 pages long and was used in funerary services for the deceased. [[Torah]] scrolls, editions of the Jewish holy book, were—and still are—also held in special holders when read.

Scrolls can be rolled in one of two ways. The first method is to wrap the scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text at the end of the scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is partially overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.

===Early book formats===
[[File:Ezra Codex Amiantinus.jpg|thumb|Early medieval [[bookcase]] containing about ten codices depicted in the ''[[Codex Amiatinus]]'' ({{circa}} 700)]]

In addition to the scroll, [[wax tablet]]s were commonly used in Antiquity as a writing surface.  [[Diptych]]s and later [[polyptych]] formats were often hinged together along one edge, analogous to the spine of modern books, as well as a folding ''concertina'' format.  Such a set of simple wooden boards sewn together was called by the Romans a [[codex]] (pl. codices)—from the Latin word ''caudex'', meaning "the trunk" of a tree, around the first century AD. Two ancient polyptychs, a ''pentaptych'' and ''octoptych'', excavated at [[Herculaneum]] employed a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on thongs or cords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pugliese Carratelli|first=Giovanni |encyclopedia=Pompeiana: raccolta di studi per il secondo centenario degli di Pompei |title=L'Instrumentum Scriptorium nei Monumenti Pompeiani ed Ercolanesi |year=1950 |pages=166–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the first century, a kind of folded parchment notebook called ''pugillares membranei'' in Latin, became commonly used for writing throughout the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Roberts|Skeat|1987|pp=15–22}} This term was used by both the pagan [[Roman literature|Roman poet]] [[Martial]] and [[Christian]] [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul the Apostle]]. Martial used the term with reference to gifts of literature exchanged by Romans during the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. According to T. C. Skeat, "in at least three cases and probably in all, in the form of codices" and he theorized that this form of notebook was invented in Rome and then "must have spread rapidly to the Near East".{{sfn|Skeat|2004|p=45}} In his discussion of one of the earliest pagan parchment codices to survive from [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat's notion when stating "its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory" and that "early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first= Eric |title=The Typology of the Early Codex |year=1977 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn= 0-8122-7696-5 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early intact codices were discovered at [[Nag Hammadi]] in Egypt.  Consisting of primarily Gnostic texts in Coptic, the books were mostly written on [[papyrus]], and while many are single-quire, a few are multi-quire.  Codices were a significant improvement over papyrus or vellum scrolls in that they were easier to handle. However, despite allowing writing on both sides of the leaves, they were still foliated—numbered on the leaves, like the Indian books. The idea spread quickly through the early churches, and the word ''Bible'' comes from the town where the Byzantine monks established their first [[scriptorium]], [[Byblos]], in modern Lebanon. The idea of numbering each side of the page—Latin ''pagina'', "to fasten"—appeared when the text of the individual testaments of the Bible were combined and text had to be searched through more quickly. This book format became the preferred way of preserving manuscript or printed material.

===Development===
[[File:Liber Landavensis binding.png|thumb|left|Decorative binding with figurehead of a 12th Century manuscript – ''[[Liber Landavensis]]''.]]

[[File:Sammelband CHF edge view.jpg|thumb|right|Sammelband of three alchemical treatises, bound in Strasbourg by Samuel Emmel ca.1568, showing metal clasps and leather covering of boards]]

The [[codex]]-style book, using sheets of either [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] (before the spread of Chinese [[papermaking]] outside of [[Imperial China]]), was invented in the [[Roman Empire]] during the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Colin H|last2=Skeat|first2=TC|title=The Birth of the Codex|year=1983|publisher=British Academy|location= London|isbn=0-19-726061-6|pages=15–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; First described by the poet [[Martial]] from [[Roman Spain]], it largely replaced earlier writing mediums such as [[wax tablet]]s and [[scroll]]s by the year 300 AD.&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"Codex" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 473. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century AD, the scroll and wax tablet had been completely replaced by the codex in the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skeat|first= T.C.|title=The Collected Biblical Writings of T.C. Skeat.|year=2004|publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden|isbn=90-04-13920-6|page=45|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=td_OLXo4RvkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Collected+Biblical+Writings+of+T.C.+Skeat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20at%20least%20three%20cases&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western books from the fifth century onwards{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} were bound between hard covers, with pages made from parchment folded and sewn onto strong cords or ligaments that were attached to wooden boards and covered with leather. Since early books were exclusively handwritten on handmade materials, sizes and styles varied considerably, and there was no standard of uniformity.  Early and medieval codices were bound with flat spines, and it was not until the fifteenth century that books began to have the rounded spines associated with hardcovers today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenfield |first=Jane |title=ABC of Bookbinding |year=2002 |publisher=Oak Knoll Press |location=New Castle, DE |isbn=1-884718-41-8 |pages=79–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the vellum of early books would react to humidity by swelling, causing the book to take on a characteristic wedge shape, the wooden covers of medieval books were often secured with straps or clasps. These straps, along with metal bosses on the book's covers to keep it raised off the surface that it rests on, are collectively known as furniture.{{sfn|Harthan|1950|p=8}}

The earliest surviving European bookbinding is the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] of about 700, in red goatskin, now in the [[British Library]], whose decoration includes raised patterns and coloured tooled designs.  Very grand manuscripts for liturgical rather than library use had covers in [[metalwork]] called [[treasure binding]]s, often studded with gems and incorporating [[ivory]] relief panels or enamel elements.  Very few of these have survived intact, as they have been broken up for their precious materials, but a fair number of the ivory panels have survived, as they were hard to recycle; the divided panels from the [[Codex Aureus of Lorsch]] are among the most notable.  The 8th century [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]] were given a new gold relief cover in about 1500, and the [[Lindau Gospels]] (now [[Morgan Library]], New York) have their original cover from around 800.{{sfn|Harthan|1950|pp=8–9}}

Luxury medieval books for the library had leather covers decorated, often all over, with tooling (incised lines or patterns), [[blind stamp]]s, and often small metal pieces of furniture.  Medieval stamps showed animals and figures as well as the vegetal and geometric designs that would later dominate book cover decoration.  Until the end of the period books were not usually stood up on shelves in the modern way. The most functional books were bound in plain white [[vellum]] over boards, and had a brief title hand-written on the spine. Techniques for fixing [[gold leaf]] under the tooling and stamps were imported from the Islamic world in the 15th century, and thereafter the gold-tooled leather binding has remained the conventional choice for high quality bindings for collectors, though cheaper bindings that only used gold for the title on the spine, or not at all, were always more common. Although the arrival of the printed book vastly increased the number of books produced in Europe, it did not in itself change the various styles of binding used, except that vellum became much less used.{{sfn|Harthan|1950|pp=8–11}}

===Introduction of paper===

Although early, coarse [[hemp]]en paper had existed in China during the [[Western Han]] period (202 BC - 9 AD), the [[Han dynasty|Eastern-Han]] Chinese court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] (ca. 50 AD&amp;nbsp;– 121 AD) introduced the first significant improvement and standardization of papermaking by adding essential new materials into its composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=38-41|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 8th century [[Arab]]s learned the arts of papermaking from the Chinese and were then the first to bind [[paper]] into books at the start of the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hassani, Woodcock and Saoud, "1001 Inventions, Muslim heritage in Our World", FSTC Publishing, 2006, reprinted 2007, pp.218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Particular skills were developed for [[Arabic calligraphy]], [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and bookbinding. The people who worked in making books were called ''Warraqin'' or paper professionals. The Arabs made books lighter—sewn with silk and bound with leather covered paste boards, they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use. As paper was less reactive to humidity, the heavy boards were not needed. The production of books became a real industry and cities like [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]], had a street named ''Kutubiyyin'' or book sellers, which contained more than 100 bookshops in the 12th century. The famous [[Koutoubia Mosque]] is named so because of its location on this street. Because the [[Qur'an]] itself was considered a sacred object, in order to beautify the book containing the holy scripture, a culture of calligraphy and lavish bookbinding developed.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Don, "The golden age of Islamic bookbinding", ''Ahlan Wasahlan'', (Public Relations Div., Saudi Arabian Airlines, Jeddah), 1984. pp. 13–15, at p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Traditional Chinese bookbinding|Bookbinding in medieval China]] replaced traditional Chinese writing supports such as [[bamboo and wooden slips]], as well as [[History of silk|silk]] and paper scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|page=227|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the codex in [[History of China|China]] began with folded-leaf [[pamphlet]]s in the 9th century AD, during the late [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD), improved by the 'butterfly' bindings of the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 AD), the wrapped back binding of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271-1368), the stitched binding of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368-1644 AD) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (1644-1912), and finally the adoption of Western-style bookbinding in the 20th century (coupled with the European [[printing press]] that replaced [[History of printing|traditional Chinese printing methods]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227-229|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial phase of this evolution, the accordion-folded palm-leaf-style book, most likely came from [[India]] and was introduced to China via [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist missionaries and scriptures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227-229|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the arrival (from the East) of [[Cotton paper|rag paper]] manufacturing in Europe in the late [[Middle Ages]] and the use of the [[printing press]] beginning in the mid-15th century, bookbinding began to standardize somewhat, but page sizes still varied considerably.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the early sixteenth century, the Italian printer [[Aldus Manutius]] realized that personal books would need to fit in saddle bags and thus produced books in the smaller formats of ''[[quarto]]s'' (one-quarter-size pages) and ''[[octavo]]s'' (one-eighth-size pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/libraries-books-and-printing-biographies/aldus-manutius|title=Aldus Manutius facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Aldus Manutius|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With printing, the books became more accessible and were stored on their side on long shelves for the first time. Clasps were removed, and titles were added to the spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/11/12/a-brief-history-of-shelving-and-other-news/ | first=Dan | last=Piepenbring | date=12 November 2015 | title=A brief history of shelving, and other news | work=The Paris Review | access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leipzig]], a prominent centre of the German book-trade, in 1739 had 20 bookshops, 15 printing establishments, 22 book-binders and three type-foundries in a population of 28,000 people.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|p=269}}

In the German book-distribution system of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the end-user buyers of books "generally made separate arrangements with either the publisher or a bookbinder to have printed sheets bound according to their wishes and their budget".&lt;ref&gt;

The reduced cost of books facilitated cheap lightweight Bibles, made from tissue-thin oxford paper, with floppy covers, that resembled the early [[Arabic]] [[Quran]]s, enabling missionaries to take portable books with them around the world, and modern wood glues enabled the addition of paperback covers to simple glue bindings.

Some older presses could not separate the pages of a book, so readers used a [[paper knife]] to separate the outer edges of pages as a book was read.

==Modern commercial binding==
There are various commercial techniques in use today. Today, most commercially produced books belong to one of four categories:

===Hardcover binding===
A [[hardcover]], hardbound or hardback book has rigid covers and is stitched in the spine. Looking from the top of the spine, the book can be seen to consist of a number of [[#Terms and techniques|signatures]] bound together. When the book is opened in the middle of a signature, the binding threads are visible. Signatures of hardcover books are typically [[Octavo (text)|octavo]] (a single sheet folded three times), though they may also be folio, quarto, or 16mo (see [[Book size]]). Unusually large and heavy books are sometimes bound with wire.

Until the mid-20th century, covers of mass-produced books were laid with cloth, but from that period onward, most publishers adopted clothette, a kind of textured paper which vaguely resembles cloth but is easily differentiated on close inspection. Most cloth-bound books are now half-and-half covers with cloth covering only the spine. In that case, the cover has a paper overlap. The covers of modern hardback books are made of thick cardboard.

Some books that appeared in the mid-20th century signature-bound appear in reprinted editions in glued-together editions. Copies of such books stitched together in their original format are often difficult to find, and are much sought after for both aesthetic and practical reasons.

A variation of the hardcover which is more durable is the calf-binding, where the cover is either half or fully clad in [[leather]], usually from a [[calf]]. This is also called full-bound or, simply, leather bound.

[[Library binding]] refers to the [[hardcover]] binding of books intended for the rigors of [[library]] use and are largely [[Serial (literature)|serials]] and [[paperback]] publications. Though many publishers have started to provide "library binding" editions, many libraries elect to purchase paperbacks and have them rebound as hardcover books, resulting in longer life for the material.

====Methods of hardcover binding====
There are a number of methods used to bind hardcover books, from them:
# '''Case binding''' is the most common type of hardcover binding for books. The pages are arranged in signatures and glued together into a "textblock." The textblock is then attached to the cover or "case" which is made of cardboard covered with paper, cloth, vinyl or leather. This is also known as cloth binding, or edition binding.
# '''[[oversewn binding|Oversewing]]''', where the signatures of the book start off as loose pages which are then clamped together. Small vertical holes are punched through the far left-hand edge of each signature, and then the signatures are sewn together with lock-stitches to form the text block. Oversewing is a very strong method of binding and can be done on books up to five inches thick. However, the margins of oversewn books are reduced and the pages will not lie flat when opened.
# '''Sewing through the fold''' (also called '''Smyth Sewing'''), where the signatures of the book are folded and stitched through the fold. The signatures are then sewn and [[Adhesive|glued]] together at the spine to form a text block. In contrast to oversewing, through-the-fold books have wide margins and can open completely flat. Many varieties of sewing stitches exist, from basic links to the often used Kettle Stitch. While Western books are generally sewn through punched holes or sawed notches along the fold, some Asian bindings, such as the Retchoso or Butterfly Stitch of Japan, use small slits instead of punched holes.
# '''Double-fan adhesive binding''' starts off with two signatures of loose pages, which are run over a roller—"fanning" the pages—to apply a thin layer of glue to each page edge. Then the two signatures are perfectly aligned to form a text block, and glue edges of the text block are attached to a piece of cloth lining to form the spine. Double-fan adhesive bound books can open completely flat and have a wide margin. However, certain types of paper do not hold adhesive well, and, with wear and tear, the pages can come loose.&lt;ref name="Parisi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parisi | first = Paul |date=February 1994 | title = Methods of Affixing Leaves: Options and Implications | journal = New Library Scene | volume = 13 | issue = 1  | pages = 8–11, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bookshop, Tokyo.JPG|thumb|Modern [[paperback]] spines]]

===Punch and bind===
Different types of the ''punch and bind'' binding include:
# [[Wire binding|'''Double wire''', '''twin loop''', or '''Wire-O''' binding]] is a type of binding that is used for books that will be viewed or read in an office or home type environment. The binding involves the use of a "C" shaped wire spine that is squeezed into a round shape using a wire closing device. Double wire binding allows books to have smooth crossover and is affordable in many colors. This binding is great for annual reports, owners manuals and software manuals. Wire bound books are made of individual sheets, each punched with a line of round or square holes on the binding edge. This type of binding uses either a 3:1 pitch hole pattern with three holes per inch or a 2:1 pitch hole pattern with two holes per inch. The three to one hole pattern is used for smaller books that are up to 9/16" in diameter while the 2:1 pattern is normally used for thicker books as the holes are slightly bigger to accommodate slightly thicker, stronger wire. Once punched, the back cover is then placed on to the front cover ready for the wire binding elements (double loop wire) to be inserted. The wire is then placed through the holes. The next step involves the binder holding the book by its pages and inserting the wire into a "closer" which is basically a vise that crimps the wire closed and into its round shape. The back page can then be turned back to its correct position, thus hiding the spine of the book.
# '''[[Comb binding]]''' uses a 9/16" pitch rectangular hole pattern punched near the bound edge. A curled plastic "comb" is fed through the slits to hold the sheets together. Comb binding allows a book to be disassembled and reassembled by hand without damage. Comb supplies are typically available in a wide range of colors and diameters. The supplies themselves can be re-used or recycled. In the United States, comb binding is often referred to as 19-ring binding because it uses a total of 19 holes along the 11-inch side of a sheet of paper.
# '''[[VeloBind]]''' is used to permanently rivet pages together using a plastic strip on the front and back of the document. Sheets for the document are punched with a line of holes near the bound edge. A series of pins attached to a plastic strip called a Comb feeds through the holes to the other side and then goes through another plastic strip called the receiving strip. The excess portion of the pins is cut off and the plastic heat-sealed to create a relatively flat bind method. VeloBind provides a more permanent bind than comb-binding, but is primarily used for business and legal presentations and small publications.
# '''[[coil binding|Spiral binding]]''' is the most economical form of mechanical binding when using plastic or metal. It is commonly used for atlases{{cn|date=January 2018}} and other publications where it is necessary or desirable to be able to open the publication back on itself without breaking the spine. There are several types but basically it is made by punching holes along the entire length of the spine of the page and winding a wire [[helix]] (like a spring) through the holes to provide a fully flexible hinge at the spine. Spiral coil binding uses a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common hole pattern used with this style is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.

===Thermally activated binding===
Some of the different types of thermally activated binding include:
# '''Perfect binding''' is often used for [[paperback]] books. It is also used for [[magazine]]s; ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' is one example of this type. Perfect-bound books usually consist of various sections with a cover made from heavier paper, glued together at the spine with a strong glue. The sections are milled in the back and notches are applied into the spine to allow hot glue to penetrate into the spine of the book. The other three sides are then face-trimmed. This is what allows the magazine or paperback book to be opened. [[Mass-market paperback]]s (pulp paperbacks) are small (''[[Duodecimo|16mo]]'' size), cheaply made with each sheet fully cut and glued at the spine; these are likely to fall apart or lose sheets after much handling or several years. [[Paperback#Trade paperback|Trade paperbacks]] are more sturdily made, with traditional gatherings or sections of bifolios, usually larger, and more expensive. The difference between the two can usually easily be seen by looking for the sections in the top or bottom sides of the book.
# '''Thermal binding''' uses a one-piece cover with glue down the spine to quickly and easily bind documents without the need for punching. Individuals usually purchase "thermal covers" or "therm-a-bind covers", which are usually made to fit a standard-size sheet of paper and come with a glue channel down the spine. The paper is placed in the cover, heated in a machine (basically a [[griddle]]), and when the glue cools, it adheres the paper to the spine. Thermal glue strips can also be purchased separately for individuals that wish to use customized/original covers. However, creating documents using thermal binding glue strips can be a tedious process, which requires a scoring device and a large-format printer.
# A '''cardboard article''' looks like a hardbound book at first sight, but it is really a paperback with hard covers. Many books that are sold as '''hardcover''' are actually of this type. The [[Modern Library]] series is an example. This type of document is usually bound with thermal adhesive glue using a perfect-binding machine.
# '''Tape binding''' refers to a system that wraps and glues a piece of tape around the base of the document. A tape-binding machine such as the PLANAX COPY Binder or Powis Parker Fastback system will usually be used to complete the binding process and to activate the thermal adhesive on the glue strip. However, some users also refer to tape binding as the process of adding a colored tape to the edge of a mechanically fastened (stapled or stitched) document.

===Stitched or sewn binding===
Types of stitched or sewn bindings:
# A ''sewn book'' is constructed in the same way as a hardbound book, except that it lacks the hard covers. The binding is as durable as that of a hardbound book.
# [[Stapling]] through the [[centerfold]], also called ''saddle-stitching'', joins a set of nested folios into a single magazine issue; most [[comic book]]s are well-known examples of this type.
# [[Magazine]]s are considered more ephemeral than books, and less durable means of binding them are usual. In general, the cover papers of magazines will be the same as the inner pages (self-cover)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt3010.html|accessdate=2008-10-22|title=A Dictionary of Descriptive Terminology: self-cover|publisher=Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; or only slightly heavier (plus cover). Most magazines are stapled or saddle-stitched; however, some are bound with perfect binding and use thermally activated adhesive.

Modern bookbinding by hand can be seen as two closely allied fields: the creation of new bindings, and the repair of existing bindings. Bookbinders are often active in both fields. Bookbinders can learn the craft through [[apprenticeship]]; by attending specialized trade schools;&lt;ref&gt;Such as the: [http://www.cbl-ascona.ch/html/english.html Centro del bel Libro], [[Camberwell College of Arts|The Camberwell College of Arts]], The London College of Communication, and [http://www.nbss.org/ The North Bennet Street School]&lt;/ref&gt; by taking classes in the course of university studies, or by a combination of those methods. Some European countries offer a ''Master Bookbinder'' certification, though no such certification exists in the United States. MFA programs that specialize in the 'Book Arts' (hand paper-making, printmaking and bookbinding) are available through certain colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Such as: [http://www.colum.edu/book_and_paper/ Columbia College Chicago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512143659/http://www.colum.edu/Book_and_Paper/ |date=12 May 2009 }}, the [http://www.bookarts.ua.edu/ University of Alabama], [http://www.nscad.ca – Nova Scotia College of Art and Design] and the [http://www.uarts.edu/academics/cad/bookarts.html/ University of the Arts in Philadelphia].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand bookbinders create new bindings that run the gamut from historical book structures made with traditional materials to modern structures made with 21st-century materials, and from basic cloth-case bindings to valuable full-leather fine bindings. Repairs to existing books also encompass a broad range of techniques, from minimally invasive conservation of a historic book to the full restoration and rebinding of a text.

Though almost any existing book can be repaired to some extent, only books that were originally sewn can be rebound by resewing. Repairs or restorations are often done to emulate the style of the original binding. For new works, some publishers print unbound manuscripts which a binder can collate and bind, but often an existing commercially bound book is ''pulled'', or taken apart, in order to be given a new binding. Once the textblock of the book has been pulled, it can be rebound in almost any structure; a modern suspense novel, for instance, could be rebound to look like a 16th-century manuscript. Bookbinders may bind several copies of the same text, giving each copy a unique appearance.

Hand bookbinders use a variety of specialized hand tools, the most emblematic of which is the [[bonefolder]], a flat, tapered, polished piece of bone used to crease paper and apply pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt1387.html | title = Etherington &amp; Roberts. Dictionary—folder | publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional tools common to hand bookbinding include a variety of knives and hammers, as well as brass tools used during [[Finishing (bookbinding)|finishing]].

When creating new work, modern hand binders often work on commission, creating bindings for specific books or collections. Books can be bound in many different materials. Some of the more common materials for covers are [[leather]], decorative [[paper]], and [[cloth]] (see also: [[buckram]]). Those bindings that are made with exceptionally high craftsmanship, and that are made of [[particularly]] high-quality materials (especially full leather bindings), are known as ''fine'' or ''extra'' bindings. Also, when creating a new work, modern binders may wish to select a book that has already been printed and create what is known as a 'design binding'. "In a typical design binding, the binder selects an already printed book, disassembles it, and rebinds it in a style of fine binding—rounded and backed spine, laced-in boards, sewn headbands, decorative end sheets, leather cover etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leslie|first=W.|date=2016|title=Bridging the Gap: Artist's Book and Design Bindings by Karen Hanmer.|url=|journal=Journal of Artists Books|volume=39|pages=47–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation and restoration==
Conservation and restoration are practices intended to repair damage to an existing book. While they share methods, their goals differ. The goal of conservation is to slow the book's decay and restore it to a usable state while altering its physical properties as little as possible. Conservation methods have been developed in the course of taking care of large collections of books. The term archival comes from taking care of the institutions archive of books. The goal of restoration is to return the book to a previous state as envisioned by the restorer, often imagined as the original state of the book. The methods of restoration have been developed by bookbinders with private clients mostly interested in improving their collections.

In either case, one of the modern standard for conservation and restoration is "reversibility". That is, any repair should be done in such a way that it can be undone if and when a better technique is developed in the future. Bookbinders echo the physician's creed, "[[Primum non nocere|First, do no harm]]". While reversibility is one standard, longevity of the functioning of the book is also very important and sometimes takes precedence over reversibility especially in areas that are invisible to the reader such as the spine lining.

[[File:restore.jpg|right|thumb|Rebacking saving original spine, showing one volume finished and one untouched]]
Books requiring restoration or conservation treatment run the gamut from the very earliest of texts to books with modern bindings that have undergone heavy usage. For each book, a course of treatment must be chosen that takes into account the book's value, whether it comes from the binding, the text, the [[provenance]], or some combination of the three. Many people choose to rebind books, from amateurs who restore old paperbacks on internet instructions to many professional book and paper conservators and restorationists, who often in the United States are members of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC).

Many times, books that need to be restored are hundreds of years old, and the handling of the pages and binding has to be undertaken with great care and a delicate hand. The archival process of restoration and conservation can extend a book's life for many decades and is necessary to preserve books that sometimes are limited to a small handful of remaining copies worldwide.

Typically, the first step in saving and preserving a book is its deconstruction. The text pages need to be separated from the covers and, only if necessary, the stitching removed. This is done as delicately as possible. All page restoration is done at this point, be it the removal of [[foxing]], ink stains, page tears, etc. Various techniques are employed to repair the various types of page damage that might have occurred during the life of the book.

The preparation of the "foundations" of the book could mean the difference between a beautiful work of art and a useless stack of paper and leather.

The sections are then hand-sewn in the style of its period, back into book form, or the original sewing is strengthened with new lining on the text-spine. New hinges must be accounted for in either case both with text-spine lining and some sort of end-sheet restoration.

The next step is the restoration of the book cover; This can be as complicated as completely re-creating a period binding to match the original using whatever is appropriate for that time it was originally created. Sometimes this means a new full leather binding with vegetable tanned leather, dyed with [[natural dye]]s, and [[Paper marbling|hand-marbled]] papers may be used for the sides or end-sheets. Finally the cover is hand-tooled in gold leaf. The design of the book cover involves such hand-tooling, where an extremely thin layer of gold is applied to the cover. Such designs can be lettering, symbols, or floral designs, depending on the nature of any particular project.

Sometimes the restoration of the cover is a matter of surgically strengthening the original cover by lifting the original materials and applying new materials for strength. This is perhaps a more common method for covers made with book-cloth although leather books can be approached this way as well. Materials such as Japanese tissues of various weights may be used. Colors may be matched using acrylic paints or simple colored pencils.

It is harder to restore leather books typically because of the fragility of the materials.

==Terms and techniques==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Leonhard Euler]] --&gt;

Most of the following terms apply only with respect to American practices:
* A ''leaf'' (often wrongly referred to as a ''folio'') typically has two pages of text and/or images, front and back, in a finished book. The Latin for ''leaf'' is ''folium'', therefore the ablative "folio" ("on the folium") should be followed by a designation to distinguish between recto and verso. Thus "folio 5r" means "on the recto of the leaf numbered 5". Although technically not accurate, common usage is "on folio 5r". In everyday speech it is common to refer to "turning the pages of a book", although it would be more accurate to say "turning the leaves of a book"; this is the origin of the phrase "to turn over a new leaf" i.e. to start on a fresh blank page.
** The ''[[recto]]'' side of a leaf faces left when the leaf is held straight up from the spine (in a paginated book this is usually an odd-numbered page).
** The ''[[verso]]'' side of a leaf faces right when the leaf is held straight up from the spine (in a paginated book this is usually an even-numbered page).
* A ''bifolium'' (often wrongly called a "bifolio", "bi-folio", or even "bifold") is a single sheet folded in half to make two leaves. The plural is "bifolia", not "bifolios".
* A ''[[Section (bookbinding)|section]]'', sometimes called a ''gathering'', or, especially if unprinted, a ''quire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt2766.html | title = Etherington &amp; Roberts. Dictionary—quire| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of bifolia nested together as a single unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt3005.html | title = Etherington &amp; Roberts. Dictionary—section| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a completed book, each quire is sewn through its fold. Depending of how many bifolia a quire is made of, it could be called:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/chapter3/index.html | title = Printing and Book Designs| publisher = National Diet Library, Japan | accessdate = 2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''duernion''&amp;nbsp;– two bifolia, producing four leaves;
** ''ternion''&amp;nbsp;– three bifolia, producing six leaves;
** ''quaternion''&amp;nbsp;– four bifolia, producing eight leaves;
** ''quinternion''&amp;nbsp;– five bifolia, producing ten leaves;
** ''sextern'' or ''sexternion''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt2766.html | title = Etherington &amp; Roberts. Dictionary—sexternion| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– six bifolia, producing twelve leaves.
* A ''[[codex]]'' is a series of one or more quires sewn through their folds, and linked together by the sewing thread.
* A ''signature'', in the context of printed books, is a section that contains text. Though the term ''signature'' technically refers to the [[signature mark]], traditionally a letter or number printed on the first leaf of a section in order to facilitate collation, the distinction is rarely made today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt3109.html | title = Etherington &amp; Roberts. Dictionary—signature| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Folio'', ''quarto'', and so on may also refer to the size of the finished book, based on the size of sheet that an early paper maker could conveniently turn out with a manual press. Paper sizes could vary considerably, and the finished size was also affected by how the pages were trimmed, so the sizes given are rough values only.
** A [[folio (printing)|folio]] volume is typically {{Convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} or more in height, the largest sort of regular book.
** A [[quarto]] volume is typically about {{Convert|9|by|12|in|cm|abbr=on}}, roughly the size of most modern magazines. A sheet folded ''in quarto'' (also 4to or 4º) is folded in half twice at right angles to make four leaves. Also called: eight-page signature.
** An [[octavo]] volume is typically about {{Convert|5|to|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} by {{Convert|8|to|9|in|cm|abbr=on}}, the size of most modern [[digest magazine]]s or [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperbacks]]. A sheet folded ''in octavo'' (also 8vo or 8º) is folded in half 3 times to make 8 leaves. Also called: sixteen-page signature.
** A sextodecimo volume is about {{Convert|4+1/2|by|6+3/4|in|cm|abbr=on}}, the size of most mass market paperbacks. A sheet folded ''in sextodecimo'' (also 16mo or 16º) is folded in half 4 times to make 16 leaves. Also called: 32-page signature.
** ''Duodecimo'' or 12mo, 24mo, 32mo, and even 64mo are other possible sizes. Modern paper mills can produce very large sheets, so a modern printer will often print 64 or 128 pages on a single sheet.
* ''Trimming'' separates the leaves of the bound book. A sheet folded in quarto will have folds at the spine and also across the top, so the top folds must be trimmed away before the leaves can be turned. A quire folded in octavo or greater may also require that the other two sides be trimmed. ''[[Deckle edge]]'', or ''Uncut'' books are untrimmed or incompletely trimmed, and may be of special interest to [[book collecting|book collectors]].

===Paperback binding===
Though books are sold as hardcover or paperback, the actual binding of the pages is important to durability.
Most paperbacks and some hard cover books have a "perfect binding".  The pages are aligned or cut together and glued.  A strong and flexible layer, which may or may not be the glue itself, holds the book together.  In the case of a paperback, the visible portion of the spine is part of this flexible layer.

== Spine ==

=== Orientation ===
[[File:bookspine.jpg|thumb|The spine of the book is an important aspect in book design, especially in cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, what's on the spine is the only visible information about the book. In a book store, the details on the spine are what initially attract attention.]]

In languages written from left to right, such as English, books are bound on the left side of the cover; looking from on top, the pages increase counter-clockwise. In right-to-left languages, books are bound on the right. In both cases, this is so the end of a page coincides with where it is turned. Many translations of [[manga|Japanese comic books]] retain the binding on the right, which allows the art, laid out to be read right-to-left, to be published without mirror-imaging it.

In China (only areas using Traditional Chinese), Japan, and Taiwan, literary books are written top-to-bottom, right-to-left, and thus are bound on the right, while text books are written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and thus are bound on the left. In mainland China the direction of writing and binding for all books was changed to be like left to right languages in the mid-20th century.

=== Titling ===
Early books did not have [[title (publishing)|titles]] on their spines; rather they were shelved flat with their spines inward—as is still common in Republic of South Africa{{according to whom|date=March 2016}}—and titles written with ink along their fore edges. Modern books display their titles on their spines.

In languages with Chinese-influenced writing systems, the title is written top-to-bottom, as is the language in general. In languages written horizontally, conventions differ about the direction in which the title on the spine is rotated:
*In the United States, the Commonwealth, Scandinavia and for books in Dutch, titles are usually written top-to-bottom on the spine. This means that when the book is placed on a table with the front cover upwards, the title is oriented left-to-right on the spine. This practice is reflected in the industry standards ANSI/NISO Z39.41&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niso.org/kst/reports/standards?step=2&amp;gid=None&amp;project_key%3Austring%3Aiso-8859-1=adf940d30971d49c34abb475530b58b9cefd0ffa ANSI/NISO Z39.41 – Printed Information on Spines] NISO Standards – National Information Standards Organization. Section 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO 6357.&lt;ref&gt;''Spine titles on books and other publications'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In most of continental Europe and Latin America, titles are conventionally printed bottom-to-top on the spine so, when the books are placed vertically on shelves, the title can be read by tilting the head to the left.&lt;ref name="Drösser"&gt;{{cite news|last=Drösser|first=Christoph|title=Linksdrehende Bücher|url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/15/Stimmts|accessdate=9 April 2011|newspaper=[[Die Zeit]]|date=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the reader to read spines of books shelved in alphabetical order in accordance to the usual way left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

{{Byzantine culture}}
'''Byzantine art''' refers to the body of Christian Greek artistic products of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] (Byzantine) Empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michelis|1946}}; {{harvnb|Weitzmann|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the nations and states that inherited culturally from the empire. Though the empire itself emerged from Rome's decline and lasted until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitzinger|1977|pp=1‒3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the start date of the Byzantine period is rather clearer in art history than in political history, if still imprecise. Many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the [[Muslim world|Muslim]] states of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward.

A number of states contemporary with the [[Byzantine Empire]] were culturally influenced by it, without actually being part of it (the "[[Byzantine commonwealth]]"). These included the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]], as well as some non-Orthodox states like the [[Republic of Venice]], which separated from the Byzantine empire in the 10th century, and the [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Kingdom of Sicily]], which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire and had also been a Byzantine possession until the 10th century with a large Greek-speaking population persisting into the 12th century. Other states having a Byzantine artistic tradition had oscillated throughout the Middle Ages between being part of the Byzantine empire and having periods of independence, such as [[History of Medieval Serbia|Serbia]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. After the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople]] in 1453, art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was often called "post-Byzantine." Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.

==Introduction==
[[File:Encaustic Virgin.jpg|thumb|200px|Icon of the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints and angels, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], Sinai]]

Byzantine art originated and evolved from the Christianized Greek culture of the Eastern Roman Empire; content from both Christianity and classical Greek mythology were artistically expressed through Hellenistic modes of style and iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michelis|1946}}; {{harvnb|Ainalov|1961|loc="Introduction", pp. 3‒8}}; {{harvnb|Stylianou|Stylianou|1985|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Hanfmann|1962|loc="Early Christian Sculpture", p. 42}}; {{harvnb|Weitzmann|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of Byzantium never lost sight of its classical heritage; the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]], was adorned with a large number of classical sculptures,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bassett|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although they eventually became an object of some puzzlement for its inhabitants&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cyril|1965|pp=53‒75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (however, Byzantine beholders showed no signs of puzzlement towards other forms of classical media such as wall paintings&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ainalov|1961|loc="The Hellenistic Character of Byzantine Wall Painting", pp. 185‒214}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). The basis of Byzantine art is a fundamental artistic attitude held by the Byzantine Greeks who, like their ancient Greek predecessors, "were never satisfied with a play of forms alone, but stimulated by an innate rationalism, endowed forms with life by associating them with a meaningful content."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weitzmann|1981|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the art produced in the Byzantine Empire was marked by periodic revivals of a classical aesthetic, it was above all marked by the development of a new aesthetic defined by its salient "abstract", or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach.

[[File:Byzantine - Saint Arethas - Walters 4820862.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian]] Saint Arethas depicted in traditional Byzantine style (10th century)]]

The nature and causes of this transformation, which largely took place during [[late antiquity]], have been a subject of scholarly debate for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brendel|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Vasari]] attributed it to a decline in artistic skills and standards, which had in turn been revived by his contemporaries in the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Although this point of view has been occasionally revived, most notably by [[Bernard Berenson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berenson|1954}}.&lt;/ref&gt; modern scholars tend to take a more positive view of the Byzantine aesthetic. [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]], writing in the early 20th century, were above all responsible for the revaluation of late antique art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsner|2002|pp=358‒379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Riegl saw it as a natural development of pre-existing tendencies in Roman art, whereas Strzygowski viewed it as a product of "oriental" influences. Notable recent contributions to the debate include those of [[Ernst Kitzinger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitzinger|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who traced a "dialectic" between "abstract" and "Hellenistic" tendencies in late antiquity, and [[John Onians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Onians|1980|pp=1‒23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who saw an "increase in visual response" in late antiquity, through which a viewer "could look at something which was in twentieth-century terms purely abstract and find it representational."

In any case, the debate is purely modern: it is clear that most Byzantine viewers did not consider their art to be abstract or unnaturalistic. As [[Cyril Mango]] has observed, "our own appreciation of Byzantine art stems largely from the fact that this art is not naturalistic; yet the Byzantines themselves, judging by their extant statements, regarded it as being highly naturalistic and as being directly in the tradition of [[Phidias]], [[Apelles]], and [[Zeuxis]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mango|1963|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister von Nerezi 001.jpg|thumb|260px|Frescoes in Nerezi near [[Skopje]] (1164), with their unique blend of high tragedy, gentle humanity, and homespun realism, anticipate the approach of [[Giotto]] and other proto-Renaissance Italian artists.]]

The subject matter of monumental Byzantine art was primarily religious and imperial: the two themes are often combined, as in the portraits of later Byzantine emperors that decorated the interior of the sixth-century church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople. These preoccupations are partly a result of the pious and autocratic nature of Byzantine society, and partly a result of its economic structure: the wealth of the empire was concentrated in the hands of the church and the imperial office, which had the greatest opportunity to undertake monumental artistic commissions.

Religious art was not, however, limited to the monumental decoration of church interiors. One of the most important genres of Byzantine art was the [[icon]], an image of Christ, the Virgin, or a saint, used as an object of veneration in Orthodox churches and private homes alike. Icons were more religious than aesthetic in nature: especially after the end of iconoclasm, they were understood to manifest the unique "presence" of the figure depicted by means of a "likeness" to that figure maintained through carefully maintained canons of representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belting|Jephcott|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The illumination of manuscripts was another major genre of Byzantine art. The most commonly illustrated texts were religious, both scripture itself (particularly the Psalms) and devotional or theological texts (such as the ''[[Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' of [[John Climacus]] or the homilies of [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]). Secular texts were also illuminated: important examples include the [[Alexander Romance]] and the history of [[John Skylitzes]].

The Byzantines inherited the [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] distrust of [[monumental sculpture]] in religious art, and produced only [[relief]]s, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in sharp contrast to the medieval art of the West, where monumental sculpture revived from [[Carolingian art]] onwards. Small ivories were also mostly in relief.

The so-called "minor arts" were very important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation [[Consular diptych]]s or caskets such as the [[Veroli casket]], [[hardstone carving]]s, [[Byzantine enamel|enamels]], [[Byzantine glass|glass]], jewelry, metalwork, and [[Byzantine silk|figured silks]] were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era. Many of these were religious in nature, although a large number of objects with secular or non-representational decoration were produced: for example, ivories representing themes from classical mythology. Byzantine ceramics were relatively crude, as pottery was never used at the tables of the rich, who ate off [[Byzantine silver]].

==Periods==
[[File:Abside 00311.JPG|thumb|180px|Interior of the [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda#Rotunda of Galerius|Rotunda of St. George]], [[Thessaloniki]], with remnants of the mosaics]]

Byzantine art and architecture is divided into four periods by convention: the Early period, commencing with the [[Edict of Milan]] (when Christian worship was legitimized) and the transfer of the imperial seat to Constantinople, extends to AD 842, with the conclusion of [[Iconoclasm]]; the Middle, or high period, begins with the restoration of the icons in 843 and culminates in the Fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204; the Late period includes the eclectic osmosis between Western European and traditional Byzantine elements in art and architecture, and ends with the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The term post-Byzantine is then used for later years, whereas "Neo-Byzantine" is used for art and architecture from the 19th century onwards, when the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire prompted a renewed appreciation of Byzantium by artists and historians alike.

=== Early Byzantine art ===
[[File:IvoireJeuxCirqueConstantinopleMuséeCluny.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Leaf from an ivory diptych of [[Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus]], consul in Constantinople, 506. Areobindus is shown above, presiding over the games in the Hippodrome, depicted beneath ([[Musée national du Moyen Âge]])]]

Two events were of fundamental importance to the development of a unique, Byzantine art. First, the [[Edict of Milan]], issued by the emperors [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] in 313, allowed for public Christian worship, and led to the development of a monumental, Christian art. Second, the dedication of [[Constantinople]] in 330 created a great new artistic centre for the eastern half of the Empire, and a specifically Christian one. Other artistic traditions flourished in rival cities such as [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], and [[Rome]], but it was not until all of these cities had fallen - the first two to the [[Arabs]] and Rome to the [[Goths]] - that Constantinople established its supremacy.

Constantine devoted great effort to the decoration of Constantinople, adorning its public spaces with ancient statuary,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bassett|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and building a [[Forum of Constantine|forum]] dominated by a porphyry column that carried a statue of himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowden|1991|pp=119‒131}}; {{harvnb|Bauer|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Major Constantinopolitan churches built under Constantine and his son, [[Constantius II]], included the original foundations of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1971}}; {{harvnb|Henck|2001|pp=279‒304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major building campaign in Constantinople was sponsored by [[Theodosius I]]. The most important surviving monument of this period is the obelisk and base erected by Theodosius in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kiilerich|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which, with the large silver dish called the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]], represents the classic examples of what is sometimes called the "Theodosian Renaissance". The earliest surviving church in Constantinople is the Basilica of St. John at the [[Stoudios]] Monastery, built in the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RabulaGospelsFol13vAscension.jpg|thumb|200px|Miniatures of the 6th-century [[Rabula Gospel]] (a Byzantine Syriac Gospel) display the more abstract and symbolic nature of Byzantine art.]]

Due to subsequent rebuilding and destruction, relatively few Constantinopolitan monuments of this early period survive. However, the development of monumental early Byzantine art can still be traced through surviving structures in other cities. For example, important early churches are found in Rome (including [[Santa Sabina]] and [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Thessaloniki]] (the [[Arch and Tomb of Galerius|Rotunda]] and the [[Church of the Acheiropoietos|Acheiropoietos Basilica]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spieser|1984}}; {{harvnb|Ćurčić|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of important illuminated manuscripts, both sacred and secular, survive from this early period. Classical authors, including [[Virgil]] (represented by the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vergilius Romanus]])&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Homer]] (represented by the [[Ambrosian Iliad]]), were illustrated with narrative paintings. Illuminated biblical manuscripts of this period survive only in fragments: for example, the [[Quedlinburg Itala fragment]] is a small portion of what must have been a lavishly illustrated copy of [[1 Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levin|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Byzantine art was also marked by the cultivation of [[ivory carving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Volbach|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory [[diptych]]s, often elaborately decorated, were issued as gifts by newly appointed [[consul]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Delbrueck|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver plates were another important form of luxury art:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dodd|1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt; among the most lavish from this period is the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Almagro-Gorbea|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarcophagi]] continued to be produced in great numbers.

===Age of Justinian I===
[[File:The mosaic of Emperor Justinian and his retinue.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Mosaic from San Vitale in [[Ravenna]], showing the Emperor [[Justinian]] and Bishop Maximian, surrounded by clerics and soldiers.]]
[[File:Byzantine ivory 801.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Archangel ivory]] of the early 6th century from Constantinople]]

Significant changes in Byzantine art coincided with the reign of [[Justinian I]] (527–565). Justinian devoted much of his reign to reconquering Italy, North Africa and Spain. He also laid the foundations of the imperial absolutism of the Byzantine state, codifying its laws and imposing his religious views on all his subjects by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maas|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant component of Justinian's project of imperial renovation was a massive building program, which was described in a book, the ''Buildings'', written by Justinian's court historian, [[Procopius]].&lt;ref&gt;Tr. H.B. Dewing, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Buildings/home.html  Procopius VII]'' (Cambridge, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian renovated, rebuilt, or founded anew countless churches within Constantinople, including [[Hagia Sophia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mainstone|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which had been destroyed during the [[Nika riots]], the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dark|Özgümüş|2002|pp=393‒413}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bardill|2000|pp=1‒11}}; {{harvnb|Mathews|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian also built a number of churches and fortifications outside of the imperial capital, including [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forsyth|Weitzmann|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Basilica of St. John in [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thiel|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major churches of this period were built in the provinces by local bishops in imitation of the new Constantinopolitan foundations. The [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]], was built by Bishop [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Maximianus]]. The decoration of San Vitale includes important mosaics of Justinian and his empress, [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], although neither ever visited the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deichmann|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also of note is the [[Euphrasian Basilica]] in [[Poreč]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nickerson.icomos.org/euf/euf-idx.htm Eufrasiana Basilica Project.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeological discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries unearthed a large group of [[Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East]]. The eastern provinces of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] and later the [[Byzantine Empire]]s inherited a strong artistic tradition from the [[Late Antiquity]]. Christian mosaic art flourished in this area from the 4th century onwards. The tradition of making mosaics was carried on in the [[Umayyad]] era until the end of the 8th century. The most important surviving examples are the [[Madaba Map]], the mosaics of [[Mount Nebo]], Saint Catherine's Monastery and the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now [[Umm ar-Rasas]]).

The first fully preserved illuminated biblical manuscripts date to the first half of the sixth century, most notably the [[Vienna Genesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wellesz|1960}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rossano Gospels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cavallo|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sinope Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grabar|1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Dioscurides]] is a lavishly illustrated botanical treatise, presented as a gift to the Byzantine aristocrat [[Julia Anicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazal|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important ivory sculptures of this period include the [[Barberini ivory]], which probably depicts Justinian himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cutler|1993|pp=329‒339}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Archangel ivory]] in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1986|pp=75‒79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver plate continued to be decorated with scenes drawn from classical mythology; for example, a [[:Image:Hercule et le Lion de Némée 01.JPG|plate]] preserved in the Cabinet des Médailles, Paris, depicts [[Hercules]] wrestling the [[Nemean lion]].

===Seventh-century crisis===
[[File:Meister der Demetrius-Kirche in Saloniki 002.jpg|thumb|200px|Mosaic from the church of [[Hagios Demetrios]] in [[Thessaloniki]], late 7th or early 8th century, showing [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|St. Demetrios]] with the bishop and the eparch]]
The Age of Justinian was followed by a political decline, since most of Justinian's conquests were lost and the Empire faced acute crisis with the invasions of the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Slavs]], Persians&lt;!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, "Persians"; link to a specific iteration of this topic. --&gt; and [[Arabs]] in the 7th century. Constantinople was also wracked by religious and political conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haldon|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant surviving monumental projects of this period were undertaken outside of the imperial capital. The church of [[Hagios Demetrios]] in Thessaloniki was rebuilt after a fire in the mid-seventh century. The new sections include mosaics executed in a remarkably abstract style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brubaker|2004|pp=63‒90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The church of the Koimesis in Nicaea (present-day [[Iznik]]), destroyed in the early 20th century but documented through photographs, demonstrates the simultaneous survival of a more classical style of church decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barber|1991|pp=43‒60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The churches of Rome, still a Byzantine territory in this period, also include important surviving decorative programs, especially [[Santa Maria Antiqua]], [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura]], and the Chapel of San Venanzio in [[San Giovanni in Laterano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthiae|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine mosaicists probably also contributed to the decoration of the early [[Umayyad]] monuments, including the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Creswell|1969}}; {{harvnb|Flood|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important works of luxury art from this period include the silver [[David Plates]], produced during the reign of Emperor [[Heraclius]], and depicting scenes from the life of the Hebrew king [[David]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leader|2000|pp=407‒427}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable surviving manuscripts are [[Syriac language|Syriac]] gospel books, such as the so-called [[Syriac Bible of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leroy|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[London Canon Tables]] bear witness to the continuing production of lavish gospel books in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nordenfalk|1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The period between Justinian and iconoclasm saw major changes in the social and religious roles of images within Byzantium. The veneration of [[acheiropoieta]], or holy images "not made by human hands," became a significant phenomenon, and in some instances these images were credited with saving cities from military assault. By the end of the seventh century, certain images of saints had come to be viewed as "windows" through which one could communicate with the figure depicted. [[Proskynesis]] before images is also attested in texts from the late seventh century. These developments mark the beginnings of a theology of [[icon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brubaker|1998|pp=1215‒1254}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the debate over the proper role of art in the decoration of churches intensified. [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/trullo.html Three canons] of the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692 addressed controversies in this area: prohibition of the representation of the cross on church pavements (Canon 73), prohibition of the representation of Christ as a lamb (Canon 82), and a general injunction against "pictures, whether they are in paintings or in what way so ever, which attract the eye and corrupt the mind, and incite it to the enkindling of base pleasures" (Canon 100).

===Crisis of iconoclasm===
{{Main|Byzantine iconoclasm}}
[[File:Helios in His Chariot.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Helios]] in his chariot, surrounded by symbols of the months and of the zodiac. From Vat. Gr. 1291, the "Handy Tables" of [[Ptolemy]], produced during the reign of [[Constantine V]]]]

Intense debate over the role of art in worship led eventually to the period of "[[Byzantine iconoclasm]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryer|Herrin|1977}}; {{harvnb|Brubaker|Haldon|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic outbreaks of iconoclasm on the part of local bishops are attested in Asia Minor during the 720s. In 726, an underwater earthquake between the islands of Thera and Therasia was interpreted by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] as a sign of God's anger, and may have led Leo to remove a famous icon of Christ from the [[Chalke Gate]] outside the imperial palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|1980}}; The story of the Chalke Icon may be a later invention: {{harvnb|Auzépy|1990|pp=445‒492}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, iconoclasm probably did not become imperial policy until the reign of Leo's son, [[Constantine V]]. The [[Council of Hieria]], convened under Constantine in 754, proscribed the manufacture of icons of Christ. This inaugurated the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic period]], which lasted, with interruptions, until 843.

While iconoclasm severely restricted the role of religious art, and led to the removal of some earlier apse mosaics and (possibly) the sporadic destruction of portable icons, it never constituted a total ban on the production of figural art. Ample literary sources indicate that secular art (i.e. hunting scenes and depictions of the games in the hippodrome) continued to be produced,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grabar|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the few monuments that can be securely dated to the period (most notably the manuscript of Ptolemy's "Handy Tables" today held by the Vatican&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1985|pp=355‒362}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) demonstrate that metropolitan artists maintained a high quality of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryer|Herrin|1977|loc=Robin Cormack, "The Arts during the Age of Iconoclasm"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major churches dating to this period include [[Hagia Irene|Hagia Eirene]] in Constantinople, which was rebuilt in the 760s following its destruction by an earthquake in 740. The interior of Hagia Eirene, which is dominated by a large mosaic cross in the apse, is one of the best-preserved examples of iconoclastic church decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peschlow|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The church of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki was also rebuilt in the late 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theocharidou|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain churches built outside of the empire during this period, but decorated in a figural, "Byzantine," style, may also bear witness to the continuing activities of Byzantine artists. Particularly important in this regard are the original mosaics of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] (since either destroyed or heavily restored) and the frescoes in the Church of Maria foris portas in [[Castelseprio]].

===Macedonian art===
{{Main|Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian Renaissance}}
[[File:Nea Moni 01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mosaics of [[Nea Moni of Chios]] (11th century)]]
[[File:Relieftafel 40 Märtyrer von Sebaste Bodemuseum.jpg|thumb|180px|An example of Macedonian-era ivorywork from Constantinople: the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]], now in the [[Bode Museum]], [[Berlin]]]]

The rulings of the Council of Hieria were reversed by a new church council in 843, celebrated to this day in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the "Triumph of Orthodoxy." In 867, the installation of a new apse mosaic in Hagia Sophia depicting the Virgin and Child was celebrated by the Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]] in a famous homily as a victory over the evils of iconoclasm. Later in the same year, the Emperor [[Basil I]], called "the Macedonian," acceded to the throne; as a result the following period of Byzantine art has sometimes been called the "[[Macedonian Renaissance]]", although the term is doubly problematic (it was neither "[[Macedonia (terminology)|Macedonian]]", nor, strictly speaking, a "[[Renaissance]]").

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Empire's military situation improved, and patronage of art and architecture increased. New churches were commissioned, and the standard architectural form (the "[[cross-in-square]]") and decorative scheme of the Middle Byzantine church were standardised. Major surviving examples include [[Hosios Loukas]] in [[Boeotia]], the [[Daphni Monastery]] near [[Athens]] and [[Nea Moni]] on [[Chios]].

There was a revival of interest in the depiction of subjects from classical mythology (as on the Veroli Casket) and in the use of a "classical" style to depict religious, and particularly Old Testament, subjects (of which the [[Paris Psalter]] and the [[Joshua Roll]] are important examples).

The Macedonian period also saw a revival of the late antique technique of [[ivory]] carving. Many ornate ivory [[triptych]]s and [[diptych]]s survive, such as the [[Harbaville Triptych]] and a triptych at [[Luton Hoo]], dating from the reign of [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nicephorus Phocas]].

===Komnenian age===
[[File:Anastasi Dafnis.jpg|thumb|200px|Mosaic of [[Daphni Monastery]] (ca. 1100)]]

The Macedonian emperors were followed by the [[Comnenus|Komnenian dynasty]], beginning with the reign of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in 1081. Byzantium had recently suffered a period of severe dislocation following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071 and the subsequent loss of Asia Minor to the Turks. However, the Komnenoi brought stability to the empire (1081–1185) and during the course of the twelfth century their energetic campaigning did much to restore the fortunes of the empire. The Komnenoi were great patrons of the arts, and with their support Byzantine artists continued to move in the direction of greater humanism and emotion, of which the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]], the cycle of mosaics at [[Daphni Monastery|Daphni]], and the murals at [[Church of St. Panteleimon (Nerezi)|Nerezi]] yield important examples. Ivory sculpture and other expensive mediums of art gradually gave way to frescoes and icons, which for the first time gained widespread popularity across the Empire. Apart from painted icons, there were other varieties - notably the mosaic and [[ceramic]] ones.

Some of the finest Byzantine work of this period may be found outside the Empire: in the mosaics of [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati]], [[Kiev]], [[Torcello]], [[Venice]], [[Monreale]], [[Cefalù]] and [[Palermo]]. For instance, Venice's [[San Marco di Venezia|Basilica of St Mark]], begun in 1063, was based on the great [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople, now destroyed, and is thus an echo of the age of Justinian. The acquisitive habits of the Venetians mean that the basilica is also a great museum of Byzantine artworks of all kinds (e.g., [[Pala d'Oro]]).

===Palaeologan age===

Centuries of continuous Roman political tradition and Hellenistic civilization underwent a crisis in 1204 with the sacking of Constantinople by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Kingdom of France|French]] knights of the [[Fourth Crusade]], a disaster from which the Empire recovered in 1261 albeit in a severely weakened state. Steven Runciman, a noted 20th-century historian of the Crusades, would write in 1954: "There was never a greater crime against humanity than the Fourth Crusade."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1987|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction by sack or subsequent neglect of the city's secular architecture in particular has left us with an imperfect understanding of Byzantine art.

Although the Byzantines regained the city in 1261, the Empire was thereafter a small and weak state confined to the Greek peninsula and the islands of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].  During their half-century of exile, however, the last great flowing of Anatolian Hellenism began. As [[Nicaea]] emerged as the center of opposition under the [[Laskaris]] emperors, it spawned a renaissance, attracting scholars, poets, and artists from across the Byzantine world.  A glittering court emerged as the dispossessed intelligentsia found in the Hellenic side of their traditions a pride and identity unsullied by association with the hated "latin" enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ash|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the recapture of the capital under the new [[Palaeologus|Palaeologan Dynasty]], Byzantine artists developed a new interest in landscapes and pastoral scenes, and the traditional mosaic-work (of which the [[Chora Church]] in [[Constantinople]] is the finest extant example) gradually gave way to detailed cycles of narrative frescoes (as evidenced in a large group of [[Mystras]] churches). The icons, which became a favoured medium for artistic expression, were characterized by a less austere attitude, new appreciation for purely decorative qualities of painting and meticulous attention to details, earning the popular name of the Paleologan Mannerism for the period in general.

[[Republic of Venice|Venice]] came to control [[Byzantine Crete]] by 1212, and Byzantine artistic traditions continued long after the Ottoman conquest of the [[Empire of Trebizond|last Byzantine successor state]] in 1461. The [[Cretan school]], as it is today known, gradually introduced Western elements into its style, and exported large numbers of icons to the West. The tradition's most famous artist was [[El Greco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Byron |author-link=Robert Byron |title=Greco: The Epilogue to Byzantine Culture |pages=160–174 |magazine=[[The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs]] |volume=55 |issue=319 |date=October 1929 |jstor=864104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Angelo G. |last=Procopiou |title=El Greco and Cretan Painting |page=74 |magazine=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=94 |issue=588 |date=March 1952 |jstor=870678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Veneza118.jpg|thumb|[[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]], where imported Byzantine mosaicists were succeeded by Italians they had trained]]
[[File:Mural - Birth of Christ.jpg|thumb|Modern Orthodox mural from [[Israel]] using a depiction of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]] little changed in over a millennium]]

The splendour of Byzantine art was always in the mind of early medieval Western artists and patrons, and many of the most important movements in the period were conscious attempts to produce art fit to stand next to both classical Roman and contemporary Byzantine art. This was especially the case for the imperial [[Carolingian art]] and [[Ottonian art]].  Luxury products from the Empire were highly valued, and reached for example the royal [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Sutton Hoo burial]] in [[Suffolk]] of the 620s, which contains several pieces of silver. [[Byzantine silk]]s were especially valued and large quantities were distributed as diplomatic gifts from Constantinople.  There are records of Byzantine artists working in the West, especially during the period of iconoclasm, and some works, like the frescos at [[Castelseprio]] and miniatures in the [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]], seem to have been produced by such figures.

In particular, teams of [[mosaic]] artists were dispatched as diplomatic gestures by emperors to Italy, [[Late Antique and medieval mosaics in Italy|where they often trained locals]] to continue their work in a style heavily influenced by Byzantium. [[Venice]] and [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Norman Sicily]] were particular centres of Byzantine influence. The earliest surviving panel paintings in the West were in a style heavily influenced by contemporary Byzantine icons, until a distinctive Western style began to develop in Italy in the [[Trecento]]; the traditional and still influential narrative of [[Vasari]] and others has the story of Western painting begin as a breakaway by [[Cimabue]] and then [[Giotto]] from the shackles of the Byzantine tradition.  In general, Byzantine artistic influence on Europe was in steep decline by the 14th century if not earlier, despite the continued importance of migrated [[Byzantine scholars in the Renaissance]] in other areas.

[[Islamic art]] began with artists and craftsmen mostly trained in Byzantine styles, and though figurative content was greatly reduced, Byzantine decorative styles remained a great influence on Islamic art, and Byzantine artists continued to be imported for important works for some time, especially for [[mosaic]]s.

The Byzantine era properly defined came to an end with the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, but by this time the Byzantine cultural heritage had been widely diffused, carried by the spread of Orthodox Christianity, to [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]] and, most importantly, to [[Russia]], which became the centre of the Orthodox world following the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. Even under Ottoman rule, Byzantine traditions in icon-painting and other small-scale arts survived, especially in the Venetian-ruled Crete and [[Rhodes]], where a "post-Byzantine" style under increasing Western influence survived for a further two centuries, producing artists including [[El Greco]] whose training was in the [[Cretan School]] which was the most vigorous post-Byzantine school, exporting great numbers of icons to Europe. The willingness of the Cretan School to accept Western influence was atypical; in most of the post-Byzantine world "as an instrument of ethnic cohesiveness, art became assertively conservative during the ''Turcocratia''" (period of Ottoman rule).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kessler|1988|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian icon]] painting began by entirely adopting and imitating Byzantine art, as did the art of other Orthodox nations, and has remained extremely conservative in iconography, although its painting style has developed distinct characteristics, including influences from post-Renaissance Western art.  All the Eastern Orthodox churches have retained highly protective of their traditions in terms of the form and content of images and, for example, modern Orthodox [[Nativity of Jesus in art|depictions of the Nativity of Christ]] vary little in content from those developed in the 6th century.

[[image:CK Diagram.png|thumb|A graphical representation of a Design Process using C-K Design Theory.]]

'''C-K design theory''' or '''concept-knowledge theory''' is both a [[design]] theory and a [[theory]] of reasoning in design. It defines design reasoning as a [[Mathematical logic|logic]] of expansion processes, ''i.e.'' a logic that organizes the generation of unknown objects. The theory builds on several traditions of design theory, including [[systematic design]], [[axiomatic design]], [[creativity]] theories, general and formal [[Design#Design approaches and methods|design theories]],&lt;ref name="FDT"&gt;Braha D. and Maimon O. 1998. ''A Mathematical Theory of Design: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications.'' Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[artificial intelligence]]-based design models. Claims made for C-K design theory include that it is the first design theory that:

# Offers a comprehensive formalization of design that is independent of any design domain or object
# Explains invention, creation, and discovery within the same framework and as design processes.

The name of the theory is based on its central premises: the distinction between two spaces:
*a space of concepts '''C'''
*a space of knowledge '''K'''.

The process of [[design]] is defined as a ''double expansion'' of the C and K spaces through the application of four types of operators: C→C, C→K, K→C, K→K

==Genesis of C-K theory==

C-K theory was a response to three perceived limitations of existing design theories:&lt;ref&gt;Hatchuel, A and Weil, B 2003, [http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/design/docs/HatchuelWeil2003CKICED.pdf A new approach of innovative design: an introduction to C-K theory]. Proceedings of the international conference on engineering design (ICED’03), Stockholm, Sweden, pp 109–124&lt;/ref&gt;

# Design theory when assimilated to [[problem solving]] theory is unable to account for innovative aspects of design.
# Classic design theories dependent on object domains, machine design, architecture or industrial design favored design theories that were tailored to their specific knowledge bases and contexts. Without a unified design theory these fields experience difficulties over cooperation in real design situations.
# Design theories and creativity theories have been developed as separate fields of research. But design theory should include the creative, surprising and serendipitous aspects of design; while creativity theories have been unable to account for intentional inventive processes common in design fields.&lt;ref&gt;Hatchuel, Armand, Le Masson, Pascal, and Weil, Benoit. (2008) [http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/design/docs/HatchuelLeMassonWeil2008NSFrevised.pdf Studying creative design: the contribution of C-K theory]. Studying design creativity: Design Science, Computer Science, Cognitive Science and Neuroscience Approaches, Aix-en-Provence, France, 10&amp;ndash;11 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

C-K theory claims to have overcome these three limitations.{{lopsided|date=June 2010}} It uses an approach which is domain-independent and which allows acting on unknown objects, and changes of the definitions of known objects during the process (''revision of objects' identities'').&lt;ref name="RED2009"&gt;Hatchuel A. and Weil B., [http://www.springerlink.com/content/u073n68w34548501/ C-K design theory: An advanced formulation], Research in Engineering Design, 19(4):181&amp;ndash;192, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; C-K theory was shown by Hatchuel and Weil&lt;ref name="RED2009"/&gt; to be closely related to Braha's Formal Design Theory &lt;ref name="FDT"/&gt; and its clarification by Braha and Reich’s Coupled Design Theory,&lt;ref&gt;Braha D. and Reich Y. 2003. [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/RED03_Topology.pdf ''Topological Structures for Modeling Complex Engineering Design Processes.''] Research in Engineering Design 14(4): 185-199.&lt;/ref&gt; which are both based on topological structures for design modeling.

==Structure of C-K theory ==
The core idea behind C-K theory is to define rigorously a design situation. A brief is an incomplete description of objects that do not exist yet and are still partly unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eris|first=Ozgur|title=Effective inquiry for innovative engineering design|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in C-K theory is to define a brief as a concept, through the introduction of a formal distinction between concept and knowledge spaces; the second step is to characterize the operators that are needed between these two spaces.

===Knowledge===
The knowledge space is defined as a set of propositions with a logical status, according to the knowledge available to the designer or the group of designers. The knowledge space (i.e. K-Space) describes all objects and truths that are established from the point of view of the designer. Then K-Space is expandable as new truths may appear in it as an effect of the design process. Conversely, the structure and properties of the K-Space have a major influence on the process.&lt;ref name="RED2009" /&gt;

===Concept ===
A concept is defined as a proposition without a logical status in the K-Space. A central finding of C-K theory is that concepts are the necessary departure point of a design process. Without concepts, design reduces to standard [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] or [[problem-solving]]. Concepts assert the existence of an unknown object that presents some properties desired by the designer. Concepts can be partitioned or included, but not searched nor explored.&lt;ref name="RED2009" /&gt;

===C-K operators===
Building on these premises, C-K theory shows the design process as the result of four operators: '''C→K''', '''K→C''', '''C→C''', '''K→K'''.

*The initial concept is partitioned using propositions from K: '''K→C'''
*These partitions add new properties to the concepts and create new concepts: '''C→C'''
*Thanks to a conjunction '''C→K''' this expansion of C may in return provoke the expansion of the K space: '''K→K'''

The process can be synthesized through a '''design square'''. One design solution for a first concept '''C0''' will be a path in the '''C'''-space that forms a new proposition in '''K'''. There may exist several design paths for the same '''C0'''.

==Central findings==
The following graphical representation summarises the design process using C-K theory.
[[File:CK Diagram.png|center|border|500px]]

;Crazy concepts
Crazy concepts are concepts that seem absurd as an exploration path in a design process. Both C-K theory and practical applications have shown that crazy concepts can benefit the global design process by adding extra knowledge, not to be used to pursue that "crazy concept" design path, but to be used to further define a more "sensible concept" and lead to its eventual conjunction. The following image is a graphical representation of this process.
[[File:Crazy Concept.png|border|500px|center]]

;Design creativity
The creative aspect of Design results from two distinct expansions: C-expansions which may be seen as "new ideas", and K-expansions which are necessary to validate these ideas or to expand them towards successful designs.&lt;ref name="RED2009" /&gt;

;Unification of design theories
Domain dependent design theories are built on some specific structure of the K-space, either by assuming that some objects have invariant definitions and properties (like in all engineering fields), or by assuming that the K-space presents some stable structure (e.g. that the functions of an object can be defined independently from its technical realization, as in [[systematic design]] theory).

It is suggested that a science of design is possible, and complementary to the more traditional [[bounded rationality]].&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;Hatchuel A. &amp; Weil B.

;Mathematical modelling
Mathematical approaches to design have been developed since the 1960s by scholars such as [[Christopher Alexander]], Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, Dan Braha and Yoram Reich. They tended to model the dynamic co-evolution between design solutions and requirements. Within the field of engineering design, C-K theory opens new modelling directions that explore connections with basic issues in logic and mathematics; these are different from the classic use of scientific models in design. It has been argued&lt;ref name="forcing2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatchuel|first=Armand|author2=B. Weil|title=Design as Forcing: Deepening the foundations of Ck theory|place=16th International Conference on Engineering Design|year=2007|url=http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/design/docs/Hatchuel-Weil-ICED07paperVdef21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that C-K theory has analogies with [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] in [[set theory]], and with [[intuitionistic]] mathematics.&lt;ref name="kazakci2009"&gt;Kazakci, Akin, and Hatchuel, Armand,[http://www.cgs.ensmp.fr/design/docs/Kazakci.Intuitionism.Brouwer.ICED09.pdf Is "creative subject" of Brouwer a designer? &amp;ndash; an Analysis of Intuitionistic Mathematics from the Viewpoint of C-K Design Theory?], International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED'09, Stanford CA, 24&amp;ndash;27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Industrial applications
C-K theory has been applied in several industrial contexts since 1998, mainly in France, [[Sweden]] and Germany. It is generally used as a method that increases the innovative capacity of design and [[Research and development|R&amp;D departments]].{{lopsided|date=June 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} C-K theory has also inspired new management principles for collaborative innovation, with the aim of overcoming the limitations of standard design management methods.&lt;ref&gt;Hatchuel, A. ; Le Masson, P. and Weil, B.

'''Catharsis''' (from Greek {{lang|el|[[wikt:κάθαρσις|κάθαρσις]]}} {{transl|el|''katharsis''}} meaning "purification" or "cleansing") is the purification and purgation of emotions—particularly pity and fear—through art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA217 |title=catharsis |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1995 |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2XgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= | last = Berndtson | first = Arthur | title = Art, Expression, and Beauty | publisher = Krieger | year = 1975 | page = 235|isbn=9780882752174 | quote=The theory of catharsis has a disarming affinity with the expressional theory, since it emphasizes emotion, asserts a change in emotion as a result of aesthetic operations, and concludes on a note of freedom in relation to the emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvZYaJmH6LcC&amp;dq= | title=Looking for an Argument: Critical Encounters with the New Approaches to the Criticism of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries | first=Richard | last=Levin |year=2003 | page=42 | quote=Catharsis in Shakespearean tragedy involves ... some kind of restoration of order and a renewal or enhancement of our positive feelings for the hero.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a metaphor originally used by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]],'' comparing the effects of [[tragedy]] on the mind of a spectator to the effect of a [[cathartic]] on the body.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b 1449b]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99492/catharsis |title=catharsis (criticism) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic uses==
Catharsis is a term in [[drama|dramatic art]] that describes the effect of tragedy (or [[comedy]] and quite possibly other artistic forms)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Catharsis in Healing, Ritual, and Drama | first=Thomas J. | last = Scheff | authorlink=Thomas J. Scheff | isbn=0-595-15237-6|publisher=University of California Press | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally on the audience (although some have speculated on characters in the drama as well). Nowhere does [[Aristotle]] explain the meaning of "catharsis" as he is using that term in the definition of tragedy in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449b21-28). G.&amp;nbsp;F. Else argues that traditional, widely held interpretations of catharsis as "purification" or "purgation" have no basis in the text of the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', but are derived from the use of catharsis in other Aristotelian and non-Aristotelian contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Catharsis | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | first = Leon | last = Golden | volume = 93 | pages = 51–60 | jstor = 283751 | doi = 10.2307/283751}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a number of diverse interpretations of the meaning of this term have arisen. The term is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[anagnorisis]].

D.&amp;nbsp;W. Lucas, in an authoritative edition of the ''Poetics'', comprehensively covers the various nuances inherent in the meaning of the term in an Appendix devoted to "Pity, Fear, and Katharsis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristotle: Poetics|last=Lucas|first=D. W.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1977|isbn=978-0198140245|pages=276–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas recognizes the possibility of catharsis bearing some aspect of the meaning of "purification, purgation, and 'intellectual clarification'" although his discussion of these terms is not always, or perhaps often, in the precise form with which other influential scholars have treated them. Lucas himself does not accept any one of these interpretations as his own but adopts a rather different one based on "the Greek doctrine of Humours" which has not received wide subsequent acceptance. Purgation and purification, used in previous centuries, as the common interpretations of catharsis are still in wide use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catharsis in Psychotherapy | first1=Michael P. | last1=Nichols | first2=Melvin | last2=Zax |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, New York|year=1977|isbn=978-0470990643}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the twentieth century, the interpretation of catharsis as "intellectual clarification" has arisen as a rival to the older views in describing the effect of catharsis on members of the audience.

===Purgation and purification===
In his works prior to the ''Poetics,'' Aristotle had used the term ''catharsis'' purely in its medical sense (usually referring to the evacuation of the ''katamenia''—the [[menstrual]] fluid or other reproductive material).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Belifiore | first = Elizabeth S. | title = Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion | page = 300 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, however, he employs it as a medical [[metaphor]].
[[F. L. Lucas]] maintains, therefore, that ''purification'' and ''cleansing'' are not proper translations for ''catharsis''; that it should rather be rendered as ''[[Purgatory|purgation]]''. "It is the human soul that is purged of its excessive passions."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald F. Else made the following argument against the "purgation" theory: "It presupposes that we come to the tragic drama (unconsciously, if you will) as patients to be cured, relieved, restored to psychic health. But there is not a word to support this in the "Poetics", not a hint that the end of drama is to cure or alleviate pathological states. On the contrary it is evident in every line of the work that Aristotle is presupposing 'normal' auditors, normal states of mind and feeling, normal emotional and aesthetic experience."&lt;ref&gt;Else, Gerald F. ''Aristotle's Poetics: The Argument'', p. 440. Cambridge, Massachusetts (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] sidesteps the medical attribution. He translates ''catharsis'' as a purification, an experience that brings pity and fear into their proper balance: "In real life", he explained, "men are sometimes too much addicted to pity or fear, sometimes too little; tragedy brings them back to a virtuous and happy mean."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;23. Hogarth, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;
Tragedy is then a corrective; through watching tragedy, the audience learns how to feel these emotions at proper levels.

===Intellectual clarification===
In the twentieth century a paradigm shift took place in the interpretation of catharsis with a number of scholars contributing to the argument in support of the intellectual clarification concept.&lt;ref&gt;The following works can be usefully consulted in this regard: L. Golden, "Aristotle on Tragic and Comic Mimesis," Atlanta, 1992; S. Halliwell, "Aristotle's Poetics," London, 1986; D. Keesey, "On Some Recent Interpretations of Catharsis, "The Classical World", (1979) 72.4, 193–205.&lt;/ref&gt; The clarification theory of catharsis would be fully consistent, as other interpretations are not, with Aristotle's argument in chapter 4 of the ''Poetics'' (1448b4-17) that the essential pleasure of [[mimesis]] is the intellectual pleasure of "learning and inference".

It is generally understood that Aristotle's theory of mimesis and catharsis are responses to [[Plato]]'s negative view of artistic mimesis on an audience. Plato argued that the most common forms of artistic mimesis were designed to evoke from an audience powerful emotions such as pity, fear, and ridicule which override the rational control that defines the highest level of our humanity and lead us to wallow unacceptably in the overindulgence of emotion and passion. Aristotle's concept of catharsis, in all of the major senses attributed to it, contradicts Plato's view by providing a mechanism that generates the rational control of irrational emotions. All of the commonly held interpretations of catharsis, purgation, purification, and clarification are considered by most scholars to represent a homeopathic process in which pity and fear accomplish the catharsis of emotions like themselves. For an alternate view of catharsis as an [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] process in which pity and fear produce a catharsis of emotions unlike pity and fear, see E. Belfiore, ''Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion.'' Princeton, 1992, 260 ff.

===Literary analysis of catharsis===
The following analysis by [[E. R. Dodds]], directed at the character of [[Oedipus]] in the paradigmatic Aristotelian tragedy, ''[[Oedipus Rex]],'' incorporates all three of the aforementioned interpretations of catharsis: purgation, purification, intellectual clarification:{{quote|...what fascinates us is the spectacle of a man freely choosing, from the highest motives a series of actions which lead to his own ruin. Oedipus might have left the plague to take its course; but pity for the sufferings of his people compelled him to consult Delphi. When Apollo's word came back, he might still have left the murder of Laius uninvestigated; but piety and justice required him to act. He need not have forced the truth from the reluctant Theban herdsman; but because he cannot rest content with a lie, he must tear away the last veil from the illusion in which he has lived so long. Teiresias, Jocasta, the herdsman, each in turn tries to stop him, but in vain; he must read the last riddle, the riddle of his own life. The immediate cause of Oedipus' ruin is not "fate or "the gods"—no oracle said that he must discover the truth—and still less does it lie in his own weakness; what causes his ruin is his own strength and courage, his loyalty to Thebes, and his loyalty to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=E. R. | last=Dodds | authorlink=E. R. Dodds | title=On Misunderstanding the 'Oedipus Rex' | journal=Greece and Rome |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1966 |pages=37–49 |jstor=642354 | doi=10.1017/s0017383500016144}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Attempts to subvert catharsis===
There have been, for political or aesthetic reasons, deliberate attempts made to subvert the effect of catharsis in theatre.
For example, [[Bertolt Brecht]] viewed catharsis as a pap (pabulum) for the [[bourgeois]] theatre audience, and designed dramas which left significant emotions unresolved, intending to force social action upon the audience. Brecht then identified the concept of catharsis with the notion of identification of the spectator, meaning a complete adhesion of the viewer to the dramatic actions and characters. Brecht reasoned that the absence of a cathartic resolution would require the audience to take political action in the real world, in order to fill the emotional gap they had experienced vicariously. This technique can be seen as early as his [[agit-prop]] play ''[[The Measures Taken]],'' and is mostly the source of his invention of an ''epic theatre'', based on a [[distancing effect]] (Verfremdungseffekt) between the viewer and the representation or portrayal of characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht, Bertold]], "La dramaturgie non aristotélicienne", ''Théâtre épique, théâtre dialectique'', éd. Jean-Marie Valentin, Paris, Éditions de L'Arche, 1999, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=="Catharsis" before tragedy==
Catharsis before the sixth-century rise of tragedy is, for the [[Western World]], essentially a historical footnote to the Aristotelian conception. The practice of [[Ritual purification|purification]] had not yet appeared in [[Homer]], as later Greek commentators noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter | last = Burkert | authorlink = Walter Burkert | year = 1992 | title = The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age | page = 56 | publisher = Harvard University Press | ref=harv}} This sub-section depends largely on Burkert.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Aithiopis]]'', an [[epic (poetry)|epic]] set in the [[Epic Cycle|Trojan War cycle]], narrates the purification of [[Achilles]] after his murder of [[Thersites]]. Catharsis describes the result of measures taken to cleanse away blood-guilt—"blood is purified through blood",{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=56}} a process in the development of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] culture in which the [[Delphi|oracle of Delphi]] took a prominent role. The classic example—[[Orestes]]—belongs to tragedy, but the procedure given by [[Aeschylus]] is ancient: the blood of a sacrificed piglet is allowed to wash over the blood-polluted man, and running water washes away the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert notes parallels with a bilingual [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ritual text: "the knowledgeable specialist, the sacrificial piglet, slaughter, contact with blood, and the subsequent cleansing with water" {{harvtxt|Burkert|1992|page=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The identical ritual is represented, Burkert informs us, on a ''[[krater]]'' found at Canicattini, wherein it is shown being employed to cure the daughters of [[Proetus]] from their madness, caused by some ritual transgression.{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}} To the question of whether the ritual obtains [[atonement (penal substitution view)|atonement]] for the subject, or just [[healing]], Burkert answers: "To raise the question is to see the irrelevance of this distinction".{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}}

==Therapeutic uses==&lt;!-- 'Cathartic method' redirects here --&gt;
In [[psychology]], the term was first employed by [[Sigmund Freud]]'s colleague [[Josef Breuer]] (1842–1925), who developed a '''cathartic method'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of treatment using [[hypnosis]] for persons suffering from intensive [[hysteria]]. While under hypnosis, Breuer's patients were able to recall [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] experiences, and through the process of expressing the original emotions that had been repressed and forgotten, they were relieved of their hysteric symptoms. Catharsis was also central to Freud's concept of [[psychoanalysis]], but he replaced hypnosis with [[Free association (psychology)|free association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Strickland | editor-first=Bonnie | editor-link=Bonnie Strickland | title=Catharsis | publisher=Gale | year=2001 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[cathexis|catharsis]]'' has also been adopted by modern [[psychotherapy]], particularly Freudian psychoanalysis, to describe the act of expressing, or more accurately, ''experiencing'' the deep emotions often associated with events in the individual's past which had originally been repressed or ignored, and had never been adequately addressed or experienced.

There has been much debate about the use of catharsis in the reduction of anger.

== Social catharsis ==
Emotional situations can elicit physiological, behavioral, cognitive, expressive, and subjective changes in individuals. Affected individuals often use social sharing as a cathartic release of emotions. Bernard Rimé studies the patterns of social sharing after emotional experiences. His works suggest that individuals seek social outlets in an attempt to modify the situation and restore personal homeostatic balance.

Rimé found that 80–95% of emotional episodes are shared. The affected individuals talk about the emotional experience recurrently to people around them throughout the following hours, days, or weeks. These results indicate that this response is irrespective of emotional valence, gender, education, and culture. His studies also found that social sharing of emotion increases as the intensity of the emotion increases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotion Elicits the Social Sharing of Emotion: Theory and Empirical Review|journal = Emotion Review|year=2009|issn = 1754-0739|pages = 60–85|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/1754073908097189|first = Bernard|last = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages ===
[[Émile Durkheim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The elementary forms of the religious life, a study in religious sociology | last = Durkheim | first = Émile |url = https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durk | publisher = George Allen &amp; Unwin | translator-first = Joseph Ward | translator-last = Swain | year = 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed emotional stages of social sharing:
# Directly after emotional effects, the emotions are shared. Through sharing, there is a reciprocal stimulation of emotions and emotional communion.
# This leads to social effects like social integration and strengthening of beliefs.
# Finally, individuals experience a renewed trust in life, strength, and self-confidence.

=== Motives ===
Affect scientists have found differences in motives for social sharing of positive and negative emotions.

'''(1) Positive emotion'''

A study by Langston&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Capitalizing on and coping with daily-life events: Expressive responses to positive events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 1112–1125|volume = 67|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1112|first = Christopher A.|last = Langston}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that individuals share positive events to capitalize on the positive emotions they elicit. Reminiscing the positive experience augments positive affects like temporary mood and longer-term well-being. A study by Gable et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Do You Do When Things Go Right? The Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Benefits of Sharing Positive Events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 228–245|volume = 87|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.228|first = Shelly L.|last = Gable|first2 = Harry T.|last2 = Reis|first3 = Emily A.|last3 = Impett|first4 = Evan R.|last4 = Asher|pmid=15301629}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed Langston's "capitalization" theory by demonstrating that relationship quality is enhanced when partners are responsive to positive recollections. The responsiveness increased levels of intimacy and satisfaction within the relationship. In general, the motives behind social sharing of positive events are to recall the positive emotions, inform others, and gain attention from others. All three motives are representatives of capitalization.

'''(2) Negative emotion'''

Rimé studies suggest that the motives behind social sharing of negative emotions are to vent, understand, bond, and gain social support. Negatively affected individuals often seek life meaning and emotional support to combat feelings of loneliness after a tragic event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The grapevine effect ===
If emotions are shared socially and elicits emotion in the listener then the listener will likely share what they heard with other people. Rimé calls this process "secondary social sharing". If this repeats, it is then called "tertiary social sharing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Collective catharsis ===
Collective emotional events share similar responses. When communities are affected by an emotional event, members repetitively share emotional experiences. After the 2001 New York and the 2004 Madrid terrorist attacks, more than 80% of respondents shared their emotional experience with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social sharing of emotion, post-traumatic growth, and emotional climate: Follow-up of Spanish citizen's response to the collective trauma of March 11th terrorist attacks in Madrid| journal = European Journal of Social Psychology| year=2009|issn = 1099-0992|pages = 1029–1045|volume = 40|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.700|first = Bernard|last = Rimé|first2 = Darío|last2 = Páez|first3 = Nekane|last3 = Basabe|first4 = Francisco|last4 = Martínez}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rimé, every sharing round elicits emotional reactivation in the sender and the receiver. This then reactivates the need to share in both. Social sharing throughout the community leads to high amounts of emotional recollection and "emotional overheating".

Pennebaker and Harber&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Social Stage Model of Collective Coping: The Loma Prieta Earthquake and The Persian Gulf War|journal = Journal of Social Issues | year = 1993 |issn = 1540-4560|pages = 125–145|volume = 49|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1993.tb01184.x|first = James W.|last = Pennebaker|first2 = Kent D.|last2 = Harber}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined three stages of collective responses to emotional events.

In the first stage, a state of "emergency" takes place in the first month after the emotional event. In this stage, there is an abundance of thoughts, talks, media coverage, and social integration based on the event.

In the second stage, the "plateau" occurs in the second month. Abundant thoughts remain, but the amount of talks, media coverage, and social integration decreases.

In the third stage, the "extinction" occurs after the second month. There is a return to normalcy.

=== Effect on emotional recovery ===
This cathartic release of emotions is often believed to be therapeutic for affected individuals. Many therapeutic mechanisms have been seen to aid in emotional recovery. One example is "interpersonal emotion regulation", in which listeners help to modify the affected individual's affective state by using certain strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Social Regulation of Emotion: An Integrative, Cross-Disciplinary Model|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=20|issue=1|pages=47–63|year=2016|issn = 1879-307X|pmid = 26564248|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2015.09.003|first = Crystal|last = Reeck|first2 = Daniel R.|last2 = Ames|first3 = Kevin N.|last3 = Ochsner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive writing is another common mechanism for catharsis. Joanne Frattaroli&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental disclosure and its moderators: A meta-analysis|journal = Psychological Bulletin|pages = 823–865|volume = 132|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.823|first = Joanne|last = Frattaroli}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a meta-analysis suggesting that written disclosure of information, thoughts, and feelings enhances mental health.

However, other studies question the benefits of social catharsis. Finkenauer and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Flashbulb memories and the underlying mechanisms of their formation: Toward an emotional-integrative model|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1998|issn = 0090-502X|pages = 516–531|volume = 26|issue = 3|doi = 10.3758/BF03201160|first = Catrin|last = Finkenauer|first2 = Olivier|last2 = Luminet|first3 = Lydia|last3 = Gisle|first4 = Abdessadek|last4 = El-Ahmadi|first5 = Martial Van Der|last5 = Linden|first6 = Pierre|last6 = Philippot|pmid=9610122}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that non-shared memories were no more emotionally triggering than shared ones. Other studies have also failed to prove that social catharsis leads to any degree of emotional recovery. Zech and Rimé&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is talking about an emotional experience helpful? effects on emotional recovery and perceived benefits|journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy|year = 2005|issn = 1099-0879|pages = 270–287|volume = 12|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/cpp.460|first = Emmanuelle|last = Zech|first2 = Bernard|last2 = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked participants to recall and share a negative experience with an experimenter. When compared with the control group that only discussed unemotional topics, there was no correlation between emotional sharing and emotional recovery.

Some studies even found adverse effects of social catharsis. Contrary to the Frattaroli study, Sbarra and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Expressive Writing Can Impede Emotional Recovery Following Marital Separation|url = http://cpx.sagepub.com/content/1/2/120|journal = Clinical Psychological Science|year = 2013|issn = 2167-7026|pmc = 4297672|pmid = 25606351|pages = 120–134|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/2167702612469801|first = David A.|last = Sbarra|first2 = Adriel|last2 = Boals|first3 = Ashley E.|last3 = Mason|first4 = Grace M.|last4 = Larson|first5 = Matthias R.|last5 = Mehl}}&lt;/ref&gt; found expressive writing to greatly impede emotional recovery following a marital separation. Similar findings have been published regarding trauma recovery. A group intervention technique is often used on disaster victims to prevent trauma-related disorders. However, meta-analysis showed negative effects of this cathartic "therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Single session debriefing after psychological trauma: a meta-analysis|journal = Lancet|year = 2002|issn = 0140-6736|pmid = 12241834|pages = 766–771|volume = 360|issue = 9335|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09897-5|first = Arnold A.

When applied to [[cultural heritage]], held by either museums or private collectors, this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]. South Asian shrines held in museum collections around the world are principally shrines relate to [[Hinduism|Hindu,]] [[Jainism|Jain,]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] households. Due to their original use and sacred nature, these shrines present unique [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] challenges for those tasked with their care.

==Household shrines==
===Usage===
[[File:Svu kerala.jpg|thumb|A modern Srividya adept performs Tantric puja at his home shrine. Kerala, India, 2006.]]
In all three of these religions, daily ritual devotion is a central aspect.&lt;ref name="BCentre"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Buddhism?|url=https://thebuddhistcentre.com/buddhism|website=The Buddhist Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AsianArt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Worship of the Goddess in South Asia|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/worship-goddess-south-asia|website=Asian Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrines facilitate this practice by offering a sacred space within the home, serving as a focal point for [[meditation]] and [[Offering (Buddhism)|offerings]] to the gods and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] ones. Daily rituals at household shrines can take many forms, but often feature some of the following practices: meditation and/or [[prayer]],&lt;ref name="BCentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt; ritual bathing of sculptures in water, anointing with oils,&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Samuel K.|title=Renovation, Disposal, and Conservation of  Hindu Temples and Images:  The Institutionalization of Creativity in South Indian and American Art Worlds|journal=Museum Anthropology Review|date=Fall 2009|volume=3|issue=2|pages=107–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; lighting of candles or burning of [[incense]],&lt;ref name="BCentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JainCenter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Traditions|url=http://www.nyjaincenter.org/Traditions|website=Jain Center of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offering of flowers and/or food. Devotional practices vary not only from religion to religion, but also from person to person. The above list contains common actions, but the form of daily ritual is set by the individual. 
===Appearance and materials===
Shrines for household use vary in size, from simple tabletop setups with room for a sculpture and a few offerings&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt; to full shrines taking up entire walls.&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conserving a Tibetan Altar|url=https://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/243.html|website=Philadelphia Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional items and smaller shrines are typically purchased ready-made, though wealthier households often commissioned elaborate custom shrines.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Jain Shrine from India|url=https://nelson-atkins.org/events/a-jain-shrine-from-india/|website=Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though primarily made of wood and paint, household shrines sometimes feature extra adornment such as [[gold leaf]]&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WRV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Butsudan|url=http://www.wrvmuseum.org/journal/journal_ftbr_0799.htm|website=White River Journal: A Newsletter of the White River Valley Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; or leather fittings.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; In far Eastern countries, like [[China]] and [[Japan]], such shrines are often [[lacquer]]ed.&lt;ref name="WRV" /&gt;

==Damage and deterioration==
Household shrines can suffer damage from two overall sources: the materials used are at risk of deterioration particular to their nature, and the ways the shrines are used can cause specific types of wear and tear.

===Humidity=== 
As discussed, the majority of household shrines are made of painted wood, and both wood and paint are susceptible to the effects of humidity.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite book|title=NPS Museum Handbook: Appendix N, Curatorial Care of Wooden Objects|date=2002|publisher=National Park Service|pages=N1-N28|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/Appendix%20N.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections|date=2009|publisher=The Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum, Inc.|location=Delaware|isbn=0-912724-52-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the [[relative humidity]] of the wood’s environment can cause it to swell (in increased humidity) or shrink (in decreased humidity). Extreme or prolonged swelling can result in [[Wood warping|warping]], while excess shrinkage can lead to cracks, particularly around nail or screw holes.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; In addition to damaging the wood, fluctuations in humidity can also deteriorate paint and other surface decoration: changes in humidity can result in loosening, flaking, and cracking paint.&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;{{cite book|title=Painted Wood: History and Conservation; Part Four: Investigations and Treatment|date=1998|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute Publications|pages=278–397|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/paintedwood4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold leaf can dissolve in water, especially if applied with a water-soluble adhesive.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Lacquer, a layer of shellac creating a clear, hardened surface, can delaminate from the underlying paint and wood layers if changes in humidity cause the wood to flex too much.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

===Pests===
[[Pest (organism)|Pests]] can be attracted to the wood itself, or, in the case of shrines, to the offerings that are left on it. [[Insects]] feed on wood or burrow into it to build nests, weakening the structure and causing unsightly holes.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; The types of insects vary by region, but can include species of ants, bees, or termites.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; [[Fungi]] also feed on wood, albeit on a smaller scale, and depending on the type can cause everything from discoloration to disintegration.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

A family shrine is in less danger of [[rat]]s than the presence of food would lead one to believe, as the offerings are replaced on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; However, rats are attracted to food, and will gnaw through wood to get it,&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; leaving holes.

===Light===
Direct sunlight or artificial light, both present in a home environment, can bleach wood and paint colors and, over a long period of time, weaken or deteriorate the wood’s cellular structure.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

===Pollutants===
Humans are, unfortunately, a source of [[pollutant]]s that can damage a family shrine. Touching the surface can leave behind oils, salts, and acids present in skin, which over time can build up on the shrine and cause staining and surface erosion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[Dirt]] and [[dust]], if not frequently removed, can scratch and erode the wood.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Ancient shrines have been found buried and accumulated significant damage from being encased in the soil.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; The most common pollutant for home shrines, particular in Buddhist households, is [[smoke]]: burning incense or candles is a standard component of daily prayer, and the smoke blackens the shrine over time.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Superficial burns to the wood, though unlikely, are also possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Preventative conservation==
Protecting household shrines from further deterioration requires considering each of the agents of decay in terms of the activities of storage, handling, and display.

===Storage===
The ideal relative humidity for wooden objects is 50%; museums aim to keep the environment’s relative humidity within a few percentage points of this target; typically with no more than 10% fluctuation within a 24 hour period.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; A stable [[Temperature|temperature]] is also considered preferable, as any fluctuations directly affects relative humidity.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Conservators use an [[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated Pest Management]] policy to reduce the threats of pests and vermin to collections, pest eradication processes are carefully selected to take into account the sacred nature of the shrines. For some religious groups, certain pest control methods such as freezing and anoxia are considered just as deadly to the sacred nature of the object as to pests;&lt;ref name="Paine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paine|first1=Crispin|title=Religious Objects in Museums: Private Lives and Public Duties|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for sacred and culturally sensitive objects|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/care-objects/indigenous-materials/caring-sacred-culturally-sensitive-objects.html|website=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, they should not be undertaken if the appropriate religious community forbids them. Lights should only be used when needed, and should be kept as dim as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Frequent careful cleanings, combined with dust covers, will reduce the danger of pollutants.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Cleaning should be done with a soft cotton cloth or cosmetic brush, and a mild [[detergent]] and water if necessary.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt;

===Handling===
Best practice in museum handling of collection objects, such as shrines, dictates that objects be moved as little as possible. Shrines are frequently large, with intricate carvings, and there is significant risk of breakage through moving them.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;  When handling or moving is necessary, it is done with careful planning - gloves, typically [[nitrile]] or cotton, are worn to prevent transferring pollutants on the hands to the shrine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Display===
Lighting presents an additional challenge, since the object must be visible to viewers. Lights are kept as low as possible while still being bright enough to allow visitors to navigate the room and see the shrine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Sometimes lights will only be turned on when the shrine display is open to the public.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[UV filter]]s are typically installed on artificial lights and window glass to prevent UV light from sun causing damage.

==Treatment==
===Research===
Due to the religious nature of household shrines, in addition to determining the extent of the damage, [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] professionals advocate researching the spiritual nature of the shrine before restoration work begins. A recommended starting point is to ask why something is being conserved.&lt;ref name="WAAC"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Conservator's Approach to Sacred Art|journal=WAAC Newsletter|date=September 1995|volume=17|issue=3|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn17/wn17-3/wn17-310.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple approaches to conservation and restoration, and this initial question is a preferred guideline for deciding which approach to take. There are two possible approaches to restoration of household religious objects: materials-based and values-based.&lt;ref name="Jakobi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuh Jakobi|first1=Davina|title=Choices and Decision-making in Conservation: The Implications of Conserving Religious Icons|journal=Tropos|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=14–25|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1420196/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials-based restoration refers simply to fixing what is broken: the materials are damaged, so they will be fixed.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; Values-based restoration is concerned with preserving the “intangible” qualities of an object—in this case, its religious properties.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; This approach involves not removing evidence of use on the object as long as it is not contributing to its deterioration.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; Values-based is the approach most often argued for, but it is noted that a combination of the two types is frequently the most appropriate.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt;

===Wood restoration===
Wood restoration can be an invasive process: to repair warping, for example, shallow cuts are often made in the surface of the wood to allow it to be pulled back into its original position and secured in place.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt; Cracks can be filled with adhesive to both disguise them and prevent them from expanding,&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt; while holes or missing pieces are typically patched with [[replica]] parts.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Wood that has been bleached may be [[Wood stain|re-stained]] or inpainted to match the undamaged areas.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

===Paint restoration===
Loosened or flaking paint can be consolidated by injecting it with adhesive.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Scratches can be [[Inpainting|inpainted]],&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation and Care of Museum Collections|date=2011|publisher=MFA Publications|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-87846-729-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or repainted to reduce their appearance. Painted surfaces may be carefully cleaned with [[solvent]]s to ensure that only the grime is removed and not the paint layer underneath.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Lacquer that has delaminated from the paint layer may be glued back into place.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

==Ethics==
===Conflicting ideals===
Conservation and museum display of religious objects, like household shrines, represents two [[Ideology|ideologies]] in conflict. [[Museum]]s are secular spaces, and restoration is secular work, but family shrines are sacred.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Imogen|title=Exhibiting the Exotic, Simulating the Sacred: Tibetan Shrines at British and American Museums|journal=Ateliers d'Anthropologie|date=2016|volume=43|url=http://journals.openedition.org/ateliers/10300#text}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[education]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]]-focused missions of museums and conservators are inherently at odds with the religious, family, and social functions of household altars.&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=Ronald|title=Sacred objects in museum spaces|journal=Studies in Religion|date=December 1, 1992|volume=21|issue=4|pages=419–460|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000842989202100404?journalCode=sira}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoring a shrine for museum display and putting it on [[Exhibition|exhibit]] affects its function: it becomes art to those outside its subject religion,&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; but to adherents it can retain its status as an object of veneration even after being removed from its original context.&lt;ref name="Caple"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caple|first1=Chris|title=Conservation Skills: Judgement, Method and Decision Making|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-18880-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to these differing principles that affect how a shrine is perceived, religious communities may have restrictions on what actions are appropriate for storage, restoration, and exhibition.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caple" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadongei|first1=Alyce|title=What about Sacred Objects?|journal=WAAC Newsletter|date=May 2006|volume=28|issue=2|pages=14–15|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn28/wn28-2/wn28-205.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Buddhist writings and inscriptions show evidence of ongoing upkeep on ancient shrines and [[temple]]s, indicating a prescription within the faith to maintain holy objects.&lt;ref name="ICCROM"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Conservation of Living Religious Heritage|journal=ICCROM Conservation Studies|date=2003|url=https://www.iccrom.org/sites/default/files/ICCROM_ICS03_ReligiousHeritage_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jainic texts indicate that building a new shrine gives karmic reward, but a larger karmic reward is given for restoring an old shrine.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Hinduism, by contrast, commands that shrines and statues be worthy receptacles for the gods: if they become damaged, some Hindu groups believe, they should be ritually destroyed and replaced.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism not only vary from each other in their approaches to restoration, but groups and individuals within the religions may differ as well. As such, ethical standards state that the conservation methods undertaken for one object should not be applied to another, however similar, without consultation with the source religious community.&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;

===Consultation and care===
====Traditional care====
Multiple conservation organizations, including the [[Western Association for Art Conservation]] (WAAC) and the International Centre for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments (ICCROM), state that a goal of conservation is to preserve the intangible qualities of an object as well as the tangible, physical qualities.&lt;ref name="WAAC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICCROM" /&gt; To fully understand these intangible qualities, consultation with members of the religious community is necessary.

In addition to the preventative conservation methods described earlier, consultation with religious communities may disclose traditional or ritual care practices that the subject religion requires for sacred objects.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; These measure could include directives on how objects can be stored, who can handle them, and what—if any—restorative measures can be taken.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; Ritual care has the potential to prescribe religious practices to museum staff members who are not adherents of the subject religion; to avoid this, a recommended practice is active practice and passive accommodation: active practice refers to actions and behaviors with the object that can only be undertaken by a knowledgeable practitioner, while passive accommodation refers to the museum staff allowing the practitioner to conduct the practice within the museum space.&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt; Conservators and other museum professionals should be prepared to conduct restoration best practices within the confines of what the religious representatives allow.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAAC" /&gt;

====Varying approaches====
Museum and conservation professionals take several different stances on how best to approach the care of religious objects. [[The Victoria and Albert Museum]] in the United Kingdom, for example, provides all of its staff conservators with an Ethics Checklist that, among other measures, prescribes consultation with a number of interested parties before conservation begins, and asks conservators to consider how their actions will affect the “identity and significance of the object(s)”.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Appendix 1: Victoria &amp; Albert Museum Conservation Department Ethics Checklist|journal=Conservation Journal|date=Summer 2005|issue=50|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-50/appendix-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Government of Canada]] promotes an imperative of “respectful care”, wherein conservators fit their best practices into standards of care required by cultural representatives.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt; ICCROM takes an even more culturally-centered approach, stating that the entire conservation process, including the decision to conserve, should originate with and be directed by the source religious community.&lt;ref name="ICCROM" /&gt; Others suggest that consultation can go both ways, with religious representatives educating conservationists on proper care of the shrines, while conservationists can education the faithful on what their work entails to ensure that no boundaries are overstepped.&lt;ref name="Cotte"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cotte|first1=Sabine|title=Reflections Around the Conservation of Sacred Thangkas|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|url=https://www.jcms-journal.com/articles/10.5334/jcms.1021207/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an exhibition standpoint, some recommend advocating for the religious aspects of these objects by creating more immersive museum displays that promote and explain the devotional qualities of the shrines instead of reducing them to aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Grimes" /&gt; The WAAC, for its part, advocates presenting the source community with all possible options regarding care and treatment of the object in question and letting the final decision rest with the community.&lt;ref name="WAAC" /&gt; As this illustrates, although the bulk of museum and conservation organizations recommend consultation with religious representatives, as yet there is no complete consensus on the best ways to ethically care for and restore religious objects.

==Case studies==
===Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art===
The [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] spent more than a year restoring a Jain household shrine that had been in storage for over 70 years.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Analysis of the shrine revealed two paint layers underneath the surface dirt: the original layer from the 16th century, and a later coating from the 1800s.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; The decision was made by the conservators to remove only the surface grime and not attempt to remove the later paint layer: Jainism gives greater spiritual reward for restoring an old shrine than building a new one, so the conservators opted not to undo the spiritual work of the individual(s) who did the 1800s repainting.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; The shrine has been on display in the Nelson-Atkins Asian Art gallery since 2014.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

===Philadelphia Museum of Art===
The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] acquired a one-hundred-year-old Tibetan home altar in 2004.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; At the time of acquisition, [[soot]] and oil from incense and lamp burning had built up on the surface.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; Consulting with Tibetan Buddhist sources revealed that such surface grime, though a direct result of ritual, is not in and of itself religiously significant and thus was safe to remove.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; The altar is on display in the museum’s Asian Art gallery.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt;

===Newark Museum===
The [[Newark Museum]] is also in possession of a Tibetan Buddhist altar; however, this one was built for the museum after the ritual destruction of a shrine dating from 1935.&lt;ref name="Newark"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Altar|url=https://www.newarkmuseum.org/tibetan-buddhist-altar|website=Newark Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; That shrine had also been built as a display piece for the museum and was never [[Consecration|consecrated]], but the presence of Tibetan ritual objects surrounding it had, in the opinion of religious representatives, sanctified the altar nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; When the decision was made to replace it, a deconsecration ceremony was held by a Buddhist official, and the shrine was dismantled.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; The new shrine was designed and built by a Tibetan artist.&lt;ref name="Newark" /&gt;

"'''Crossing the Bar'''" is an 1889 poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]. It is considered that Tennyson wrote it in [[elegy]]; the poem has a tone of finality and the narrator uses an [[extended metaphor]] to compare death with crossing the "[[sandbar]]" between river of life, with its outgoing "flood", and the ocean that lies beyond [death], the "boundless deep", to which we return.

==Overview==
Tennyson is believed to have written the poem (after suffering a serious illness) while on the sea, crossing the [[Solent]] from [[Aldworth]] to Farringford on the [[Isle of Wight]]. Separately, it has been suggested he may have written it on a yacht anchored in [[Salcombe]]. "The words", he said, "came in a moment".&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;Hill, Robert W., Jr., ed. (1971). ''Tennyson's poetry; authoritative texts, juvenilia and early responses, criticism''. New York:W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-09953-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before he died, Tennyson told his son [[Hallam Tennyson|Hallam]] to "put 'Crossing the Bar' at the end of all editions of my poems".&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

The poem contains four [[stanza]]s that generally alternate between long and short lines. Tennyson employs a traditional ABAB [[rhyme scheme]]. Scholars have noted that the form of the poem follows the content: the wavelike quality of the long-then-short lines parallels the narrative thread of the poem.

The extended metaphor of "crossing the bar" represents travelling serenely and securely from life through death. The Pilot is a metaphor for God, whom the speaker hopes to meet face to face. Tennyson explained, "The Pilot has been on board all the while, but in the dark I have not seen him…[He is] that Divine and Unseen Who is always guiding us."&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

The words have been set to music by [[Hubert Parry|Sir Hubert Parry]], [[Joseph Barnby|Sir Joseph Barnby]] Geoffrey Shaw and Dr. George Hewson, organist at St Patrick's Cathedral Dublin.

In 2014,  Ian Assersohn wrote a new setting of the words for male voices.  Assersohn's piece "Crossing the Bar" won the Composers' Competition at the Cornwall International Male Voice Choir Festival, from a field of 40 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimvcf.org.uk/2014composers.html|title=Festival20112|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assersohn is the Musical Director of Epsom Male Voice Choir,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epsommalevoicechoir.org.uk/|title=EMVC Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the choir sang the world première of "Crossing the Bar" in Truro Cathedral at the Festival Opening International Gala Concert on Thursday 30 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimvcf.org.uk/|title=cimcf.uk home page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A folk music inspired setting for the poem with a refrain was created by Rani Arbo, an American bluegrass musician. The music was written at the time her husband's grandmother was passing away. Peter Amidon has used her melody to create a choral setting.

In August 2018, the writer [[V. S. Naipaul]] died after reading "Crossing the Bar" on his deathbed in [[London]]; his family and friends citing the poem as having always held a great resonance to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-08-12/vs-naipaul-died-peacefully-after-reading-tennyson-geordie-greig/|title=VS Naipaul died peacefully after reading Tennyson – Geordie Greig|work=ITV News|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
&lt;poem&gt;
Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea,

But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crost the bar.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crossing the Bar by  Alfred, Lord  Tennyson  : The Poetry Foundation|url = http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174588|website = www.poetryfoundation.org|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1201">'''Decadentism''' (also called '''Decadentismo''') was an Italian artistic style based mainly on the [[Decadent movement]] in the arts in France and England around the end of the 19th century.  The main authors associated with decadentism were [[Antonio Fogazzaro]], [[Italo Svevo]], [[Giovanni Pascoli]] and [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].  Although differing stylistically, they championed idiosyncrasy and irrationality against scientific rationalism.  A later critic, [[Walter Binni]], analyzed the style favorably in his 1936 book ''La poetica del decadentismo'' and distinguished between moral and aesthetic decadence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Drake | first = Richard | year = 1982 | title = Decadence, Decadentism, and Decadent Romanticism in Italy: Toward a Theory of ''Décadence'' | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 17 | pages = 69–92 | doi = 10.1177/002200948201700104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another scholar of decadentism was [[Norberto Bobbio]], noted especially for his 1945 book, ''La filosofia del decadentismo''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2641">'''Design education''' is the teaching of theory and application in the [[design]] of products, services and environments. It encompasses various disciplines of design, such as [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[graphic design]], [[user interface design]], [[web design]], [[packaging design]], [[industrial design]], [[fashion design]], [[information design]], [[interior design]], [[sustainable design]], [[transgenerational design]], and [[universal design]]. The [[Architectural design values|values and attitudes]] which underlie modern design schools differ among the different design schools.

Design is about problem solving. Design education is learning how to apply practical methods, prior knowledge, and natural talent to solve new problems.&lt;ref&gt;Casakin, Hernan &amp; Goldschmidt, Garbiela. Expertise and the use of visual analogy: implications for design education. Israel Institute of Technology, 1999, p.1 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142694X98000325]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also referred to as [[Creative Education]].

Having a complete design education can lead to professions such as [[architect]], [[graphic designer]], [[User experience design|UX designer]], [[creative director]], [[art director]], [[content strategy|content strategist]], [[web designer]], [[web developer]], [[illustrator]], [[information architect]], [[interior designer]], [[visual designer]], [[service designer]], [[UI designer]] and [[wireframe architect]].

In 1970, in Japan, South Korea, and Singapore there were no design schools.  However, as of the early 2000s there are more than 23 design schools within the three Asia countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prostel|first1=Virginia|title=The Substance of Style|date=2003|publisher=Harper Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], '''dihedral symmetry in three dimensions''' is one of three infinite sequences of [[point groups in three dimensions]] which have a [[symmetry group]] that as abstract group is a [[dihedral group]] Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ( ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 ).

== Types==
There are 3 types of dihedral symmetry in three dimensions, each shown below in 3 notation: [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies|Schönflies]] notation, [[Coxeter notation]], and [[orbifold notation]].

;Chiral:
*''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', [''n'',2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, (22''n'') of order 2''n'' – '''dihedral symmetry''' or '''para-n-gonal group''' (abstract group [[Dihedral group|''Dih&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']])
;Achiral:
*''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'', [''n'',2], (*22''n'') of order 4''n'' – '''prismatic symmetry''' or '''full ortho-n-gonal group''' (abstract group ''Dih&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' × ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
*''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or ''D&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;''), [2''n'',2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], (2*''n'') of order 4''n'' – '''antiprismatic symmetry''' or '''full gyro-n-gonal group''' (abstract group ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)

For a given ''n'', all three have ''n''-fold [[rotational symmetry]] about one axis ([[rotation]] by an angle of 360°/''n'' does not change the object), and 2-fold about a perpendicular axis, hence about ''n'' of those. For ''n'' = ∞ they correspond to three [[frieze group]]s. [[Schoenflies notation|Schönflies notation]] is used,  with [[Coxeter notation]] in brackets, and [[orbifold notation]] in parentheses. The term horizontal (h) is used with respect to a vertical axis of rotation.

In 2D the symmetry group ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes reflections in lines. When the 2D plane is embedded horizontally in a 3D space, such a  reflection can either be viewed as the restriction to that plane of a reflection in a vertical plane, or as the restriction to the plane of a rotation about the reflection line, by 180°. In 3D the two operations are distinguished: the group ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' contains rotations only, not reflections. The other group is [[pyramidal symmetry]] ''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the same order.

With [[reflection symmetry]] with respect to a plane perpendicular to the ''n''-fold rotation axis we have ''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' [n], (*22''n'').

''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or ''D&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;''), [2''n'',2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], (2*''n'') has vertical mirror planes between the horizontal rotation axes, not through them. As a result the vertical axis is a 2''n''-fold [[rotoreflection]] axis.

''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the symmetry group for a regular ''n''-sided [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]] and also for a regular n-sided [[bipyramid]]. ''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the symmetry group for a regular ''n''-sided [[antiprism]], and also for a regular n-sided [[trapezohedron]]. ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the symmetry group of a partially rotated prism.

''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is not included because the three symmetries are equal to other ones:
*''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: group of order 2 with a single 180° rotation
*''D''&lt;sub&gt;1''h''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2''v''&lt;/sub&gt;: group of order 4 with a reflection in a plane and a 180° rotation through a line in that plane
*''D''&lt;sub&gt;1''d''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2''h''&lt;/sub&gt;: group of order 4 with a reflection in a plane and a 180° rotation through a line perpendicular to that plane

For ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 there is not one main axes and two additional axes, but there are three equivalent ones.

*''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [2,2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, (222) of order 4 is one of the three symmetry group types with the [[Klein four-group]] as abstract group. It has three perpendicular 2-fold rotation axes. It is the symmetry group of a [[cuboid]] with an S written on two opposite faces, in the same orientation.
*''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''h''&lt;/sub&gt;, [2,2], (*222) of order 8 is the symmetry group of a cuboid
*''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''d''&lt;/sub&gt;, [4,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], (2*2) of order 8 is the symmetry group of e.g.:
**a square cuboid with a diagonal drawn on one square face, and a perpendicular diagonal on the other one
**a regular [[tetrahedron]] scaled in the direction of a line connecting the midpoints of two opposite edges (''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''d''&lt;/sub&gt; is a subgroup of [[tetrahedral symmetry|''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'']], by scaling we reduce the symmetry).

'''Drybar''' is a [[California]]-based chain of salons that solely provides a hair styling service, known as "[[Blowout (haircut)|blowout]]s." The company was founded in 2008 by Alli Webb.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meghan|first1=Casserly|title=Drybar: How One Woman And A Hair Dryer Became A $20 Million Operation|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/11/01/drybar-how-one-woman-and-a-hair-dryer-became-a-20-million-operation/|work=Forbes|date=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 2008, Alli Webb began a side business called Straight At Home, which provided an in-home hair experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.thedrybar.com/about-us/|website=Drybar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb quickly outgrew the one-woman operation and noticed a "huge hole" in her local market for just blowouts&lt;ref name="eonline"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Jennifer|title=Trendsetters at Work: Drybar Founder Alli Webb|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/441320/trendsetters-at-work-drybar-s-founder-alli-webb|work=E Online|date=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a concept{{explain|date=November 2018}} which had already gained traction in larger cities such as New York City with brands like Blo.&lt;ref name="Modern Salon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moratto|first1=Anne|title=Modern Exclusive: An Interview with the CEO of Blo Blow Dry Bar|url=https://www.modernsalon.com/article/36303/modern-exclusive-an-interview-with-the-ceo-of-blo-blow-dry-bar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with her brother Michael Landau, former Vice President of Brand Marketing at [[Yahoo!]], and her husband, Cameron Webb, former Creative Director at Secret Weapon Marketing, an ad agency,&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petrecca|first1=Laura|title=No Haircuts or color: Blowdry bars are a booming business|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/story/2012-08-12/drybar-blowdry-bar/56939214/1|work=USA Today|date=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alli co-founded what would become Drybar with a salon in Brentwood, California in 2010. The following year, along with the help of friends, they were able to raise $2.5 million in order to expand the business.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bronner|first1=Sasha|title=Drybar’s Alli Webb Talks Borrowing Money and How to Make a Blowout Last: My LA|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/19/drybar-alli-webb-borrowing-money_n_3460941.html|work=Huffington Post|date=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the business expanded, Drybar looked to add investors as well as add to their board of trustees. They added Castanea Partners, a [[Boston]]-based private equity firm, to their list of investors in January 2012. [[Paul Pressler]], former [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Gap Inc.|GAP]] and President of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], became an investor and board member. [[Janet Gurwitch]], the founder and former CEO of [[Laura Mercier Cosmetics]], also became an investor and board member at Drybar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drybar Announces New Investment- Appointment of Paul Pressler and Janet Gurwitch to Board|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/drybar-announces-new-investment---appointment-of-paul-pressler-and-janet-gurwitch-to-board-137748663.html|website=PR Newswire|date=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drybar's motto is "No cuts. No color. Just blowouts."&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; which is a reference to their primary service offering.{{explain|date=November 2018}}

Everything at Drybar is designed with the “bar vernacular” in mind. The cashiers are aptly called “bartenders” and hairstyles are named after cocktails such as the [[Cosmopolitan (cocktail)|Cosmo]], [[Mai Tai]], or [[Manhattan (cocktail)|Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="Huffington Post" /&gt; The idea behind this came from Webb who believed that “women [should want] to come in and have fun” and "what's more fun than going to your local bar?"&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; Webb’s vision are present in the designs brought to life by architect, Josh Heitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/business/a-curly-haired-girls-global-war-on-frizz.html|title=With Drybar, a Curly-Haired Girl Wages a Global War on Frizz|date=2015-04-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heitler, principal of a boutique architectural firm and now partner in the company,&lt;ref name="Huffington Post" /&gt; came up with the design elements and look of Drybar.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; Instead of the typical salon set up, clients at Drybar “sit facing a U-shaped or single-stretch bar, with their backs to the mirrors,” which brings to mind sitting at a bar rather than being at a salon.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; Aesthetically, all Drybars look roughly the same, due mainly in part to Heitler.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post" /&gt;

== Locations ==

Drybar revenue grew from $1.5 million in 2010 to a revenue of  $19 million in 2012 to $39 million in 2013.&lt;ref name="beast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meany|first1=Kelsey|title=Blow Dry Bars Are a Thriving Industry Disrupting the Salon Business|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/13/blow-dry-bars-are-a-thriving-industry-disrupting-the-salon-business.html|work=The Daily Beast: Business|date=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2016, Drybar has 66&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; locations in 11 states, [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]] and [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="eonline" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Find a Drybar Near You|url=http://www.thedrybar.com/locations/|website=Drybar}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2017, the number of locations has expanded to almost 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drybar Founder: Life is too short to work someplace lame|url=http://www.wbir.com/article/news/nation-now/drybar-founder-life-is-too-short-to-work-someplace-lame/465-280477be-b8a8-47f0-a9dc-929dda366274|date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2018, Drybar has opened 100 stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2018/05/15/alli-webb-drybar/amp/ |title=How Alli Webb Turned Drybar Into A $100M Business |date=May 15, 2018 |accessdate=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of October 2018, the company has over 100 locations and 3000 employees. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.whowhatwear.com/female-founded-alli-webb-drybar&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

Webb, a longtime professional stylist, spent several years developing a complete line of products. This came about “after trying nearly every existing product line." She just couldn't find what she was looking for to meet her very specific styling needs, so she “partnered with some of the best labs in the world to create exactly what [was] needed at Drybar."&lt;ref name="beast" /&gt;

After being frustrated with the product and tool choices available, Webb (along with the help of Board member and investor Janet Gurwitch) developed a line specifically for Drybar and blowouts. In 2013, after testing the line in about 70 [[Sephora]] locations, Drybar then went ahead with 300+ Sephora shops and [[QVC]] to launch their line of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Staff|title=Drybar Launches Product Line, Names New CFO|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2013/01/03/drybar-launches-product-line-names.html?page=all|work=New York Business Journal|date=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These products range from brushes to a blow dryer to hair accessories to various spritzes, sprays, and creams, and are encouraged for at-home use. Buttercup, the official blow dryer used at Drybar, is the Drybar mascot and is also sold for at-home use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6578">'''Ecofeminist art''' emerged in the 1970s in response to [[ecofeminism|ecofeminist]] philosophy, that was particularly articulated by writers such as [[Carolyn Merchant]], [[Val Plumwood]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Starhawk]], [[Greta Gaard]], [[Karen J. Warren]] and [[Rebecca Solnit]]. Those writers emphasized the significance of relationships of cultural dominance and ethics (Merchant, Plumwood, [[Donna Haraway]]) expressed as [[sexism]] (Haraway), spirituality ([[Starhawk]]), [[speciesism]] (Warren, Gaard), capitalist values that privilege objectification and the importance of [[vegetarianism]] in these contexts (Gaard). The main issues Ecofeminism aims to address revolve around the effects of a "Eurocentric capitalist patriarchal culture built on the domination of nature, and the domination of woman 'as nature.'&lt;ref name="Salleh 1997 12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecofeminism as Politics: nature, Marx, and the postmodern|last=Salleh|first=Ariel|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer Luke Martell in the ''Ecology and Society'' journal writes that 'women' and 'nature' are both victims of patriarchal abuse and "ideological products of the Enlightenment culture of control." &lt;ref name="Salleh 1997 12"/&gt; Ecofeminism argues that we must become a part of nature, living with and among it. We must recognize that nature is alive and breathing and work against the passivity surrounding it that is synonymous with the passive roles enforced upon women by patriarchal culture, politics, and capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767502886|title=Ecofeminist Approaches to Early Modernity.|last=Jennifer.|first=Munroe,|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Laroche, Rebecca.|isbn=9781137001900|location=Basingstoke|oclc=767502886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevance of Ecofeminism was discussed in feminist art programs at the college and university level, including at the [[Institute for Social Ecology]] at [[Goddard College]], Vermont. In the USA, as far back as 1962, an overwhelming series of lawsuits against the corporate world came from the kitchens of mothers and grandmothers.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In 1964, Brazilian women set up the ''Acào Democràtica Feminina Gaucha'' which soon evolved into an advocacy group for sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women around the world were coming together in an effort to break the "continuum of Eurocentric patriarchal capitalist exploitation of natural resources, women, and of indigenous peoples." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview==
The work of ecofeminist writers helped inspire many early male and female practitioners in the ecological art movement to imitate their concerns about a more horizontal relationship to environmental functions in their own practices. The feminist art writer [[Lucy Lippard]], writing for the ''Weather Report Show'' she curated, which included many ecological artists and some ecofeminist artists from the list below (2007 Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art), commented on how many of those artists were women.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy, Lippard Weather Report 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors who have written about ecofeminist artists most prominently include [[Gloria Feman Orenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, Gloria; Diamond, Irene "Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Ecofeminism"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orenstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orenstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orenstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orenstein|first=Gloria Feman|title=The Greening of Gaia: Ecofeminist Artists Revisit the Garden|journal=Ethics &amp; the Environment|date=Spring 2003|volume=8|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1353/een.2003.0009|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/ethics_and_the_environment/v008/8.1orenstein.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Progressions in Ecofeminist Art: The Changing Focus of Women in Environmental Art |first=Jade |last=Wildy |url=http://magazin.cultura21.de/piazza/english/between-art-and-science.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Women's Environmental Art Directory'' (''WEAD'') is a compendium of women who self-identify as environmental artists, initiated by [[Jo Hanson]] and [[Susan Leibovitz Steinman]] in the 1990s, to credit women artists who might not otherwise be recognized by the mainstream art world. In addition to artists, some curators were influenced by ecofeminist thinking, such as [[Amy Lipton]], co-curator of ecoartspace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liptonarts.com/ecoart|title=ecoartspace  -  LiptonArts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Tricia Watts.  Lipton initiated two relevant shows in her Soho gallery;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liptonarts.com/gallery-history] Amy Lipton gallery history&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shapeshifters'' (1992) which included 22 women artists to commemorate the women who were [[Salem witch trials|tried and killed for witchcraft in Salem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=164239483173&amp;set=a.157645103173.116112.597928173&amp;type=3&amp;theater|title=Amy Lipton - Amy Lipton gave hundreds of then emerging... - Facebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Abortion Project'', a [[pro-choice]] art exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=164239353173&amp;set=a.157645103173.116112.597928173&amp;type=3&amp;theater|title=Amy Lipton - Amy Lipton gave hundreds of then emerging... - Facebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Experimental Television Center (ETC)''' (1969-2011) was a nonprofit [[Electronic art|Electronic]] and [[Media art|Media Art]] center located in [[upstate New York]].

==History==

The Experimental Television Center (ETC) was founded in 1971 by Ralph Hocking. The center was the result of the expansion of a media access program that Ralph Hocking established as Professor of video and computer art at [[Binghamton University]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=High, Kathy|last2=Hocking|first2=Sherry Miller|last3=Jimenez|first3=Mona|title=The emergence of video processing tools : television becoming unglued|date=2014|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=184150663X|page=xvii|authorlink1=Kathy High}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some years later, in July 1979, the center was moved from [[Binghamton]] to [[Owego, New York]].

The ETC, directed by Ralph Hocking and Sherry Miller Hocking, was devoted to the exploration and development of potential uses of new technology in video and [[media art]]. Artists, social, cultural and educational organizations and also interested individuals worked in innovative image processing tools, using all the equipment and the studio facilities with no charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hocking|first1=Ralph|title=Experimental Television Center: A brief History|url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/etc-history|website=Experimental Television Center|accessdate=11 May 2015}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20150209021443/http://experimentaltvcenter.org/etc-history-1968-1971 Archived] by [[Internet Archive]] on 9 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for more than 40 years had provided a residency program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Experimental Television Center |url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/ExhTWO/ExpTeleCenter/general.pdf |website=[[Vasulka|VASULKA.ORG]] |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406022736/http://www.vasulka.org/archive/ExhTWO/ExpTeleCenter/general.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2008 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 14 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residency Program |url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/residency-program |website=Experimental Television Center |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322085511/http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/residency-program |archivedate=22 March 2015 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 22 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; that emphasized the aesthetic experimentation of electronic and media art though new technologies. Artists from around the world and students were trained and worked with rare and unique analog and digital devices for creating video artworks and had access to the media art library of the center. For Ralph Hocking, the center was "a learning place [...], where artists and engineers worked in tandem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the center organized exhibitions, workshops, cultural events, conferences and provided grand programs to support artists and non-profit media art programs.

In 2011, the Residency and Grants Program of the center was closed. The center’s media arts collection has since been archived and housed at the [[Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]] through [[Cornell University Library]]’s Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video library and archives of the Experimental Television Center|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813.001/8946249|website=[[Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]], ETC|publisher=[[Cornell University Library]]}}[http://goldsen.library.cornell.edu/etc/Archived] by [[Internet Archive]] on 20 May 2015.{{dead link|date=February 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center, through the Video History Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video History Project|url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/video-history-project|website=Experimental Television Center|accessdate=11 May 2015}}

&lt;/ref&gt; an ongoing research initiative, offers to the public a wealth of often unpublished documents  related to the early historical development of [[video art]] and [[community television]], with a particular focus on [[upstate New York]] during the period 1968-1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=High, Kathy |last2=Tennant |first2=Carolyn |title=The Experimental Television Center (An abstract) |url=http://www.mediaarthistory.org/replace/replacearchives/high_tennant_abstract.htm |website=Media Art History |accessdate=11 May 2015 |authorlink1=Kathy High |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218060756/http://www.mediaarthistory.org/replace/replacearchives/high_tennant_abstract.htm |archivedate=18 December 2011 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 18 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the closing of ETC’s art residency program in 2011, Signal Culture -a new nonprofit media arts organization located in the same small village of [[Owego Village, NY|Owego]]- aims to support the creation of experimental media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Tools==
One of the early projects at the center (1972), a research program aiming to develop a more flexible set of imaging tools for artists, involved the construction of the "Paik/Abe video synthesizer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief overview of the Paik-Abe video synthesizer|url=http://www.audiovisualizers.com/toolshak/vidsynth/paik_abe/paik_abe.htm|website=AudioVisualizers.com|accessdate=11 May 2015|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103100214/http://audiovisualizers.com/toolshak/vidsynth/paik_abe/paik_abe.htm|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=}} by [[Internet Archive]] on 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paik-Abe Screening Not Still Art Festival Catalog |url=http://www.improvart.com/nsa/paik_abe.htm |website=ImprovArt.com |accessdate=11 May 2015 |archivedate=2011-01-10 |location=Cherry Valley, NY |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110054013/http://www.improvart.com/nsa/paik_abe.htm |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 10 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[video synthesizer]] was designed by Shuya Abe and [[Nam June Paik]] and built at the center by David Jones and Robert Diamond, for the TV Lab at [[WNET-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fifield |first1=George |title=The Paik/Abe Synthesizer |url=http://davidsonsfiles.org/paikabesythesizer.html |website=The Early Video Project |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411014509/http://davidsonsfiles.org/paikabesythesizer.html |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 11 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Dunn|editor1-first=David|title=Nam June Paik and Shuya Abe: Paik/Abe video Synthesizer (Keyer and Colorizer) and Scan Modulator (aka "the Wobbulator"), 1970|journal=Eigenwelt Der Apparate-Welt: Pioneers of Electronic Art; [[Ars Electronica]], 1992 (Catalogue)|date=1994|pages=126–129|url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/eigenwelt/pdf/126-129.pdf|accessdate=11 May 2015|publisher=[[Vasulka|The Vasulkas, Inc]].|location=Francisco Carolinum, [[Linz]]|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024223034/http://vasulka.org/archive/eigenwelt/pdf/126-129.pdf|archivedate=24 October 2004|df=}} by [[Internet Archive]] on 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was funded by [[New York State Council on the Arts|the New York State Council on the Arts]].

In the early of 1970s, the center was the home to many innovative tools that artists in residency took advantage of to make complex and technologically progressive artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=ed. by Jon|title=The end of cinema as we know it : American cinema in the nineties|date=2002|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=9780745318790|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Abe colorizer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hocking |first1=Sherry Miller |last2=Brewster |first2=Richard |last3=Peer |first3=Bode |last4=Rudolph |first4=Hank |last5=Schlanger |first5=Matthew |title=Paik/Abe Colorizer - Experimental Television Center Studio System Manual |url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/paikabe-colorizer-experimental-television-center-studio-system-manual |website=Experimental Television Center |accessdate=11 May 2015 |date=1980 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520153922/http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/paikabe-colorizer-experimental-television-center-studio-system-manual |archivedate=20 May 2015 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 20 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, "an image processing device, was the precursor of many of special effects that nowadays are taken for granted", as [[Bill T. Jones]] pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones, Bill T|authorlink1=Bill T.

[[Gary Hill]], artist-in-residence at the Experimental Television Center from 1975 to 1977, explained that this scan processor "allowed one to manipulate the video image, providing an enormous amount of flexibility in altering a video input or in generating new images by using other inputs like waveforms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Robert C.|title=Gary Hill|date=2000|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=9780801864025|pages=194–195|chapter=Lucinda Furlong, A Manner of Speaking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the center started a long-term collaboration with the artist and engineer Dave Jones, who was repairing, modifying and building video equipment for the center. After becoming the ETC’s full-time technician, Jones designed a series of tools for video image processing to be used at the Center by a number of video artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones |first1=Dave |title=Bio |url=http://www.djdesign.com/davebio.html |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610201058/http://www.djdesign.com/davebio.html |archivedate=10 June 2012 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 10 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the tools available in the ETC studio included the "Jones colorizer" (1974, 1975), the "Jones 8-input sequencer" (1984, 1985), the "Jones keyer" (1985), the "Jones buffer" (1986), the "Voltage control", and the "Raster manipulation unit–wobbulator".

In mid- 1970s, the center started to research the interface of an "LSI-11 computer" with a video processing system with the collaboration of [[Vasulka|Steina and Woody Vasulka]] and the support of [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hocking |first1=Sherry Miller |title=The Evolution of Thinking Machines |journal=The Squealer, Squeaky Wheel/ Buffalo Media Resources |date=2004 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=9 |url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/sites/default/files/history/pdf/HockingThinkingMachines_1802.pdf |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520154524/http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/sites/default/files/history/pdf/HockingThinkingMachines_1802.pdf |archivedate=20 May 2015 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 27 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to make a digital imaging system more user-friendly to the artists. In the late of 1970s and the beginning of 1980s, the ETC’s research programs shifted from the hardware building to artist-oriented software development and to completing new and old tools and systems.&lt;ref name="Experimental Television Center DVD compilation collection 1969-2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=High, Kathy|last2=Hocking|first2=Ralph|last3=Hocking|first3=Sherry Miller|title=Experimental Television Center DVD compilation collection 1969-2009|date=2009|publisher=Experimental Television Center, LTD|location=Owego, NY|pages=24–25|url=http://kathyhigh.com/pdfs/writing-video-history/ETC.pdf|chapter=Radical Learning, Radical Perception: The History of the Experimental Television Center|authorlink1=Kathy High|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520151443/http://kathyhigh.com/pdfs/writing-video-history/ETC.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-20|df=}} by [[Internet Archive]] on 9 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 1980s, the center’s interest transitioned to the new "[[Amiga computer]]". Subsequently, in the 1990s, the available image processing system was enriched by commercially available tools. According to Ralph and Sherry Miller Hocking, the image processing system became through the years “a hybrid tool set, permitting the artist to create interactive relationships between older historically analog instruments and new digital technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=High|first1=Kathy|last2=Hocking|first2=Ralph|last3=Hocking|first3=Sherry Miller|title=Experimental Television Center DVD compilation collection 1969-2009|date=2009|publisher=Experimental Television Center, LTD|location=Owego, NY|pages=24–25|url=http://kathyhigh.com/pdfs/writing-video-history/ETC.pdf|chapter=Radical Learning, Radical Perception: The History of the Experimental Television Center|authorlink1=Kathy High}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, at the beginning of the 1990s, using a [[Relational database|computerized relational database]], the center started to catalog the antique equipment, all the video and audio tapes and also the printed material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">'''Extra-illustration''' is the process whereby texts, normally in their published state, are customized by the incorporation of thematically linked prints, watercolors, and other visual materials.&lt;ref name=Ashmolean&gt;{{cite web|title=Extra-illustration (also known as ‘Grangerization’)|url=http://sutherland.ashmolean.museum/Grangerization.shtml|publisher=[[Ashmolean]]|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Extra-illustration was a vibrant and widespread fashion in Britain and America during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. While there was no set canon of titles chosen for extra-illustration, certain themes and subjects occur repeatedly. From the 1770s to the 1830s, most of the books selected were patriotic in tone and antiquarian or historical in subject. Titles ranged from biography, county histories, and topography to travel, natural history, and Shakespeare. As the pastime became more popular, the genre became more diverse but the scope remained the same: places and people, chronicles of contemporary life, the lives of artistic and theatrical celebrities, and a variety of then-modern writers, notably Byron and Dickens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Peltz]], ''Facing the Text: Extra-Illustration, Print Culture, and Society in Britain, 1769-1840''. San Marino, California: [[Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens]], 2017. Distributed in the UK by [[Manchester University Press]]. [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780873282611/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In Britain, extra-illustration is frequently called "Grangerising" or "Grangerisation," after [[James Granger]] whose seminal book ''Biographical History of England from Egbert the Great to the Revolution''—published in 1769 without illustrations—quickly prompted a fashion for portrait-print collecting and the incorporation prints and drawings into the printed text. However, the term "Grangerising" only came into use from the 1880s, more than a century after Granger's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Peltz]], ''Facing the Text: Extra-Illustration, Print Culture, and Society in Britain, 1769-1840''. San Marino, California: [[Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens]], 2017. Distributed in the UK by [[Manchester University Press]]. [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780873282611/]&lt;/ref&gt; And ironically for the process of book customization that carries his name, Granger never "grangerized" a book.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jackson, ''Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001): pp. 186-87.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Page from James Granger illustrated by A. M. Storer.jpg|thumb|Page from [[James Granger]]'s ''Biographical History'', extra-illustrated by [[Anthony Morris Storer]] with prints of Edward III dating to the 17th and 18th centuries. [[Eton College]] Library.]]

==Leading examples==
There are many examples of extra-illustration, especially Granger's ''Biographical History''.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the practice is given in [[Lucy Peltz]], ''Facing the Text: Extra-Illustration, Print Culture, and Society in Britain, 1769-1840''. San Marino, California: [[Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens]], 2017. Distributed in the UK by [[Manchester University Press]]. [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780873282611/]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and certainly the most influential example was made by [[Richard Bull (MP)]] who corresponded regularly with James Granger about his print collection and its organisation according to Granger's typologies.&lt;ref&gt;Their letters are preserved at Eton and published entire in [[Lucy Peltz]], "Engraved Portrait Heads and the Rise of Extra-illustration: The Eton Correspondence of the Revd James Granger and Richard Bull, 1769–1774," ''Walpole Society'' 66 (2004), pp. 1–161, see http://www.walpolesociety.org.uk/publications/publications.php retrieved 03 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bull-Granger, as Richard Bull's extra-illustrated copy is often called, is now in the collection of the [[Huntington Library]] in California. A large collection of extra-illustrated books was formed during the same period by [[Anthony Morris Storer]] who bequeathed them to [[Eton College]] in 1799. In the [[British Museum]], a particularly impressive and early example is the copy of ''Some Account of London'' by [[Thomas Pennant]], extra-illustrated by [[John Charles Crowle]]. Crowle filled fourteen folio volumes, bound in gold-tooled red leather, with a collection of over 3347 prints and drawings of London topography and of portrayals of historical events and people connected with the history of London. It was bequeathed to the British Museum in 1811 where it is registered under number G,1.1.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3316454&amp;partId=1&amp;images=true&amp;museumno=G,1.1&amp;page=1 Retrieved 03 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the largest project in the genre are the extra-illustrated books and related materials produced by Alexander Hendras Sutherland and his wife Charlotte, née Hussey, between c.1795 and 1839. The Sutherland collection is now shared between the [[Ashmolean Museum]] and the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sutherland.ashmolean.museum/intro.shtml Retrieved 03 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9003">The '''female gaze''' is a feminist film theoretical term representing the gaze of the female viewer. It is a response to feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]]'s term, "[[Male gaze|the male gaze]]", which represents not only the gaze of the male viewer but also the gaze of the male character and the male creator of the film.  In contemporary usage, the ''female gaze'' has been used to refer to the perspective a female filmmaker (screenwriter/director/producer) brings to a film that would be different from a male view of the subject.   

== History ==
Mulvey discusses aspects of voyeurism and fetishism in the Male Gaze in her article, "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]".  She draws from [[Alfred Hitchcock|Alfred Hitchcock's]] film, ''[[Rear Window]]'', applying terms from [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] theories of psychoanalysis to discuss camera angle, narrative choice, and props in the movie while focusing on the concept of the male gaze. From what Jeffries, the protagonist in ''Rear Window'', looks at through his camera to the camera angles in his discussion with his girlfriend, the Male Gaze is accentuated by each move in Mulvey's article. Mulvey's article focused on the concept of "scopophilia", or a pleasure in gazing and placed women as spectacles to be objectified and viewed, unable to return a gaze and dismissing women in film as adequate representations of human beings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|title=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|journal=Screen|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical implementation ==
The female gaze looks at three viewpoints.
# The individual filming
# The characters within the film
# The spectator 
These three viewpoints also concern Mulvey's male gaze but focuses, instead, on females. Viewpoints expanded alongside diversity in film genres. [[Woman's film]]s were a genre that focused on female leads, showing the female as a diegetic story-teller rather than that of a spectacle. Movies such as ''[[Rebecca]]'' and [[Stella Dallas (1925 film)|''Stella Dallas'']] are examples of such films in which the traditional narrative is told through the female protagonist. This genre of film has evolved into modern day "chick flicks" such as ''[[27 Dresses]]'' and ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]''. The films are meant to represent the desires of female protagonists and, therefore, are to represent the desires of the female movie-viewer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Zoe Dirse looks at the female gaze through the [[documentary film]] genre, analyzing aspects of pleasure and viewer identification. She analyzes the gaze at the points of production and reception. She notes that if the cinematographer is female and the subject is also female, the object of the film takes on a different role.  Dirse argues that by having a female cinematographer allows females to be viewed as they really are and not the voyeuristic spectacle that the male gaze makes them out to be. While filming in [[Cairo]], Dirse was in a crowd and observed being noticed by the males around her. At first they seemed curious, and Dirse wondered if it was because of her gender or the fact that she had a camera. It was not long before they began to push past her, and she felt a sense of danger that she felt other females in Cairo shared. This is depicted in her film, ''Shadow Maker''. She said that her gender allowed her to be an unobtrusive observer – unlike a man – when filming gypsies singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dirse|first=Zoe|title=Gender in Cinematography|journal=Journal of Research in Gender Studies|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paula Marantz Cohen]] discusses the female gaze in the [[chick flick]] genre, with specific attention to the attire women wear. Spectacle overrules plot in films such as ''[[The Awful Truth]]''. [[Irene Dunne|Irene Dunne's]] wardrobe is regarded as a central aspect of the film. The different dresses that Dunn wears are extravagant but not sexualized. While the clothing may be regarded as comical, they are also supportive to Dunn's independence and femininity. Cohen notes that in the film ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'', [[Jennifer Lopez]] is fully clothed throughout the entire film. The clothes, as in ''The Awful Truth'', are regarded as comical yet they catch the viewer's eye without sexualizing her. Cohen also analyzes the relationship between the female lead stars of these films and their male co-stars. She states that these films truly depict what women want, that they are accentualized in a positive manner and have a partner who amplifies this accentuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Paula Marantz|title=What Have Clothes Got to Do with It?: Romantic Comedy and the Female Gaze|journal=Southwest Review|volume=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage == 

Critics have focused attention on the presence of the female gaze in cinema and television, in works such as ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[I Love Dick (TV series)|I Love Dick]]'' and ''[[Fleabag]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Meredith|title=From 'The Handmaid's Tale' to 'I Love Dick,' the female gaze is thriving on television|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-female-gaze-television-20170505-htmlstory.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial [[lesbian]] drama film ''[[Blue Is the Warmest Colour]]'' received considerable critical comment for the dominance of the [[male gaze]] and lack of female gaze, with some reviewers calling it a "patriarchal gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/blue-is-the-warmest-color-the-male-gaze-reigns-supreme-203158/|title=Blue Is The Warmest Color: The Male Gaze Reigns Supreme|date=2013-11-06|work=Autostraddle|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/11/08/blue_is_the_warmest_color_gets_lesbian_sex_wrong_partner/|title=“Blue Is the Warmest Color” gets lesbian sex wrong|last=Juergen|first=Michelle|date=2013-11-08|website=Salon|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/10/feminists-debate-cannes-winner-blue-is-the-warmest-colors-patriarchal-gaze-195397/|title=Feminists Debate Cannes-Winner ‘Blue is the Warmest Color”s Patriarchal Gaze {{!}} IndieWire|last=Hanna|first=Anne Thompson,Beth|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/movies/the-trouble-with-blue-is-the-warmest-color.html|title=The Trouble With ‘Blue Is the Warmest Color’|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|date=2013-10-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the book upon which the film was based was among the harshest critics, saying, "It appears to me this was what was missing on the set: lesbians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/05/blue-is-the-warmest-color-author-julie-maroh-not-pleased-with-graphic-sex-in-film-calls-it-porn-97557/|title=‘Blue Is The Warmest Color’ Author Julie Maroh Not Pleased With Graphic Sex In Film, Calls It “Porn” {{!}} IndieWire|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[April Mullen]] has said, "Women have this vulnerability and connection to a depth of emotions that I can see and feel in certain moments of truth in the films we create. To me, the female gaze is transparency – the veil between audience and filmmaker is thin, and that allows people in more."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/movies/511655-director-april-mullen-mouth-female-gaze|title=Director April Mullen on how “Below Her Mouth” is all about the female gaze - AfterEllen|date=2016-09-12|work=AfterEllen|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://girltalkhq.com/below-her-mouth-dir-april-mullen-talks-about-the-female-gaze-working-with-an-all-female-crew/|title='Below Her Mouth' Dir.

[[File:Flag of Milan.svg|thumb|right|300px|The flag of the City of Milan.]]
The '''flag of [[Milan]]''' consists of a red cross inside a white field or cloud, and inspired the [[Flag of Genoa]]. The flag of Milan is attributed to [[St. Ambrose]], who was Bishop of Milan from 374 to 397, the city patron and also the saint to whom the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] is dedicated. The flag has supposedly been in use from as early as the 10th century, well before the emergence of [[heraldry]] during the [[crusades]].

[[File:Flag of the Duchy of Milan (1450).svg|thumb|right|260px|The flag of the Duchy of Milan.]]
The [[Duchy of Milan]] used the emblem of the [[House of Visconti]], the ''[[biscione]]'', a great serpent shown devouring a [[Saracen]], from 1395 quarted with the [[Reichsadler|imperial eagle]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5035">'''Hinke Maria Osinga''' (born 25 December 1969, [[Dokkum]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://alba.ub.rug.nl/promotorum/?page=showPerson&amp;promovendus_id=5193 Hinke Maria Osinga] at the Album Promotorum - Bibliotheek der Rijksuniversiteit Groningen&lt;/ref&gt; is a Dutch mathematician and an expert in [[dynamical system]]s. She works as a professor of [[applied mathematics]] at the [[University of Auckland]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~hinke/cv.html|title=Curriculum vitae: Hinke Osinga|accessdate=2015-10-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as for her research, she is known as a creator of [[mathematical art]].

==Education and career==
Osinga earned a master's degree in 1991 and a Ph.D. in 1996 from the [[University of Groningen]].&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; Her doctoral dissertation, jointly supervised by [[dynamical system]]s theorist Hendrik Broer and [[computational geometry|computational geometer]] Gert Vegter, was on the computation of [[invariant manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=50983}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After postdoctoral studies at [[The Geometry Center]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]], and a short-term lecturership at the [[University of Exeter]], she became a lecturer at the [[University of Bristol]] in 2001, and was promoted to reader and professor there in 2005 and 2011, respectively. She moved to Auckland in 2011,&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; becoming the first female mathematics professor at Auckland and the second in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/news-and-events/news/news-2011/2011/12/22/Staff-arrivals-and-departures-in-semester-two.html|title=Staff arrivals and departures in semester two|publisher=University of Auckland Department of Mathematics|date=21 December 2011|accessdate=2015-10-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical art==
In 2004 Osinga created a [[crochet]]ed visualization of the Lorenz manifold, an invariant manifold for the [[Lorenz system]], and published the crochet pattern for her work with her husband Bernd Krauskopf; the resulting [[Mathematics and fiber arts|mathematical textile artwork]] involved over 25,000 crochet stitches, and measured nearly a meter across.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/dec/16/research.highereducation3|title=Scientists crochet chaos|first=Donald|last=McLeod|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 December 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/18/AR2007031801483.html|title=In the loop|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=19 March 2007|first=Paul|last=Richard}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Osinga and Krauskopf later collaborated with artist Benjamin Storch on a stainless steel sculpture that provides another interpretation of the same mathematical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/1718.pdf|title=Lorenz system offers manifold possibilities for art|first=Barry A.|last=Cipra|authorlink=Barry Arthur Cipra|journal=SIAM News|volume=43|issue=2|date=March 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hüsn ü Aşk''''' (literally: ''Beauty and Love'') is the [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] of [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevî]] [[poet]] [[:tr:Şeyh Galip|Şeyh Galip]]. ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' consists of 2101 [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s and has a very strong [[Sufi]] theme. 

''Hüsn ü Aşk'' tells the tale of two lovers, ''Hüsn'' (lit. "Beauty") and ''Aşk'' ("Love"). According to the story, ''Hüsn'' and ''Aşk'' were born on the same night to the same [[clan]]. Eventually they fall for each other but when ''Aşk'' intends to ask for her hand in marriage from elders of the clan, he is ridiculed by the elders and asked to bring ''kimyâ'' ("chemistry") from the land of ''Kalb'' ("Heart") if he intends to be with ''Hüsn''. As a result of this request, ''Aşk'' sets for a journey to the land of Kalb along with his servant ''Gayret'' ("perseverance"). ''Aşk'' and ''Gayret'' encounter many obstacles during their journey and face numerous dangers.

In the end, all the trials ''Aşk'' had to go through were due to his belief that ''Hüsn'' was a different person than himself when actually ''Aşk'' and ''Hüsn'' are one and the same.

All of the names used in the story, including the names of characters and places, are [[Sufi]] terms. The story is full of [[Religious symbolism|symbolism]] and is meant to be taken, not for its literal meaning but rather, for its symbolic meaning; one's journey towards [[God]], where one sees at the end that he himself is actually a reflection of God, hence is one with God because there is no [[being]] other than God.

'''Johanna Helena Herolt''' (1 May 1668 – 1723) was an 18th-century botanical artist from Germany.

==Biography==
Herolt was the eldest daughter of the painters [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] and [[Johann Andreas Graff]], and learned to paint from them along with her sister [[Dorothea Maria Graff]].&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/37866 Johanna Helena Herolt] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; Though she was born in Frankfurt, in 1670 the family moved to Nuremberg, where she was raised.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; In 1681 her mother returned to Frankfurt without her father, in order to live with her mother after her stepfather [[Jacob Marrel]]'s death.&lt;ref name=DVN&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/DVN/lemmata/data/graff Johanna Helena Herolt] in the Instituut voor Nederlandse Geschiedenis&lt;/ref&gt; Though Johann Graff joined his family later, in 1686 Merian left her husband and moved with her two daughters and her mother to a religious community of [[Labadist]]s in [[Wieuwerd]], Friesland.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; Johann Graff made various attempts at reconciliation but eventually returned to Germany.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; In 1691 the four women moved to [[Amsterdam]], where they set up a studio painting flowers and botanical subjects, continuing Merian's work on "The Caterpillar Book".&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; Johanna married the merchant Jacob Hendrik Herolt, also an ex-Labadist, on 28 June 1692.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; They had two children and Johanna began to take on her own commissions, working for [[Agnes Block]] and the [[Amsterdam Hortus]] like her mother.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt;

Johanna moved with her husband to [[Surinam]] in 1711 where she died sometime after 1723.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

==Works==
A numbered series of 49 drawings signed by Herolt on vellum are in the collection of the [[Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum]], in Brunswick.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; This series was possibly commissioned by the Mennonite botanist and collector [[Agnes Block]]. Other drawings by Herolt are in the British Museum.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt;

The '''''Madonna of the Book''''', or the '''''Madonna del Libro''''', is a small painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] artist [[Sandro Botticelli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/sandro-botticelli|title=Sandro Botticelli|publisher=www.nationalgallery.org.uk|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universalium.academic.ru/237120/Botticelli,_Sandro|title=Botticelli,_Sandro|publisher=/universalium.academic.ru|accessdate= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is preserved in the [[Museo Poldi Pezzoli|Poldi Pezzoli Museum]] in Milan. The painting is executed in [[tempera]] on panel. It dates from between 1480 and 1483.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museopoldipezzoli.it/en/node/631 |title=Madonna of the Book |publisher=www.museopoldipezzoli.it|accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Malaguzzi|Botticelli|2004|page=40}}

==Description==
The ''Madonna of the Book'' is a soft and elegant work, in which [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[Child Jesus|Child]] are seated by a window in the corner of a room. She holds a [[Book of Hours]], the Horae Beatae Mariae Virginis, prayer books for laymen common in the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries. The infant is gazing at his mother whilst she is absorbed in reading the book. The hands of both mother and son are positioned similarly, with the right hands open as in a gesture of blessing, and left hands closed.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt;
 
Symbolizing the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], the Christ Child is holding the three [[Nail (relic)|nails]] of the [[Christian cross|cross]], and the [[crown of thorns]]. These are probably later additions, added to make the message more explicit.&lt;ref name="milano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCI"/&gt; This is the conventional representation in the Christian [[iconography]]. In addition, the fruit in the bowl has an emblematic meaning. The [[cherry|cherries]] represent the [[blood of Christ]] or are an allusion to Paradise, [[plum]]s indicate the tenderness between Mary and the Child, and the [[Common fig|figs]] are characteristic of the Resurrection.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt;

Mary's blue robe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/questions/faq/faq12.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904024808/http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/questions/faq/faq12.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-04 |title=The Dayton University - The Marian Library International Marian research Institute |publisher=campus.udayton.edu |accessdate=November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a color she is often depicted wearing, has the symbolic meanings of purity, heaven, and royalty.&lt;ref name="madonna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madonnaandchild.wordpress.com/jasons-essay/|title=Madonna and Child /The artist here depicts Mary clad in her trademark blue robe.

The characters in Botticelli's work are displayed as melancholy and thoughtful."&lt;ref name="artble"/&gt;}}
&lt;!-- A more intellectual relationship between mother and son, rather than a loving one, so unlike the works painted by [[Raphael|Raphael Sanzio]], in which often she looks at her child smiling.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totallyhistory.com/madonna-and-child-with-the-book/|title=Madonna and Child with the Book, by Raphael Sanzio|publisher=totallyhistory.com|accessdate= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Botticelli interprets the scene with a sensitivity and love for small details: the set of boxes and the [[maiolica]] bowl of lush fruits are depicted as a [[still life]]; the pages of the book, the garments, and the transparent veils exhibit a realistic tactile quality.&lt;ref name="Gallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/botticel/22/2libro.html |first1=Emil |last1=Krén |first2=Daniel |last2=Marx |publisher=Web Gallery of Art |title=Madonna of the Book (Madonna del Libro) |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition is refined with a good balance. Botticelli painted with subtle differences in colour, and he was able to put colours together so that they complement each other admirably. The painting is adorned with gold [[filigree]] decorating the clothes and objects. The use of gold was the result of the contractual agreement he made with the commissioner, and was included in the price of the painting.&lt;ref name="GCI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-virgin-and-child-the-madonna-of-the-book/cgHULpr5dnz9JA?hl=en#!asset-viewer:l.id=cgHULpr5dnz9JA&amp;hl=en|title=The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book)1480 |publisher=[[Google Cultural Institute]] |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;{{efn-ua|"Known also as the Madonna of the Book, this painting represents the Virgin and Child in a domestic setting, intent on reading a volume, perhaps a Book of Hours. A window is open on the landscape at twilight, but the diffused light which transforms the space into a mystical setting seems to emanate from the figures themselves.}}&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt; Dating from about 1480, the painting shows all the elements of Botticelli's mature poetic style: a delicate, elegant linearity, a style which is still far from the intense pathos of his late work."&lt;ref name="GCI"/&gt;  The identity of his patron is unknown.{{sfn|Malaguzzi|Botticelli|2004|page=40}}

The interrelationship of light, shapes and voids confers an ethereal quality to the work.{{efn-ua|"The glimmer which pervades them seems to be unleashed by these figures and it spreads throughout the surrounding spaces. Besides the light, even the pyramid-like layout of the two sacred figures feeds the perception of an absolutely perfect moment."&lt;ref name="milano"/&gt;}} Indeed, the painting might be considered as newly rediscovered, as a recent restoration revealed a luminescent sky and bright morning aura, which had been obscured by layers of centuries-old varnish.&lt;ref name="Backus"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lagazzettadelmezzogiorno.it/GdM_traduci_notizia.php?IDNotizia=386348&amp;IDCategotia= |title=Botticelli exhibit unveils surprises for art scholars: Show at Milan's Poldi Pezzoli museum gathers eight key works |first1=Emily |last1=Backus |newspaper=[[La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno]] |location=Milan |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Onuchina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artinvestment.ru/en/news/exhibitions/20110104_boticelli_milan.html |title=Eight masterpieces by Botticelli in Milan |date=1 April 2011 |first1=Maria |last1=Onuchina |publisher=ARTinvestment.RU |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One is reminded of other Marian images made prior to the year 1470. Botticelli might have been influenced by [[Filippo Lippi]]'s ''Madonna and Child with an Angel'' from the [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]] in Florence.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt; &lt;!-- The painting has a rectangular shape, which is rare in the later production of Botticelli in the 1470s. --&gt;

Botticelli and the ''Madonna of the Book'' were the subject of renewed interest in the 19th century. In its "extraordinary beauty" it appealed to Italians in particular who saw in it a source of national identity, during Italian unification ("[[Risorgimento]]").&lt;ref name="Sidney"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=8813 |title=New light on Botticelli's beauty: Discoveries at the Poldi Pezzoli Museum, Milan |date=13 March 2012 |publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Botticelli's admirers was [[Gian Giacomo Poldi Pezzoli]], who bequeathed his private collection and his apartment to the public.&lt;ref name="Sidney"/&gt;  Dr Annalisa Zanni, the Poldi Pezzoli Museum director, recently discovered more about Botticelli's technique and use of materials, as exemplified in the ''Madonna of the Book''. For example, she discovered that Botticelli's top layer of blue was [[lapis lazuli]], a "very precious and very expensive ingredient, indicating it was commissioned by a highly prestigious patron".&lt;ref name="Backus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Onuchina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sidney"/&gt;

The first incarnation of American toy company [[Hasbro]]'s '''[[My Little Pony]]''' [[toy]]line began in 1982 as a successor of [[My Little Pony#My Pretty Pony|My Pretty Pony]] toys. It went on to expand into a [[media franchise]], beginning with the airing of a [[Rescue at Midnight Castle|22-minute syndicated animated television special]] in 1984 in the United States. This incarnation is unofficially known among collectors as "Generation One" or "G1".

After the relative lack of success of the [[My Little Pony#My Pretty Pony|My Pretty Pony]] toy line, Hasbro introduced six smaller and colorful versions of the toy in 1982, sold under the title ''My Little Pony''. The toy line lead to many more merchandise under the ''My Little Pony'' brand. The pony toys were followed by [[Pegasus|winged ponies]], [[Unicorn|Unicorn ponies]], Flutter Ponies and Sea Ponies. Flutter Ponies were smaller and thinner than Pegasus Ponies, and had fluttering wings. Windy Wing and the Summer Wing Ponies were smaller than the Flutter Ponies and were proportioned in a similar way, with larger, butterfly-like wings. The Sea Ponies resembled [[seahorse]]s, and were produced as both adults and babies. There were also male ponies called 'Big Brother Ponies', which had slightly larger bodies and feathered hooves resembling those of [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]] horses.

Many different sets of My Little Pony variations were produced, the first being the Rainbow Ponies in 1983. Other variations included the So-Soft Ponies (covered in [[Flocking (texture)|flocking]]), Twinkle-Eyed Ponies which had rhinestones in place of eyes, Twice-As-Fancy Ponies with patterns covering most of the body, Brush 'n' Grow Ponies which had a longer-than-usual mane and tail stored inside the body, Pony Friends - animals designed in the same style as the ponies, such as a lion, giraffe, kangaroo and zebra, among others - and Baby Ponies, some of which were smaller versions of previously released ponies and presented as those ponies' foals. The first generation of My Little Pony toys was sold in the U.S. until 1992, and was marketed internationally until 1995. The final year of sales in the U.S. was advertised as the "celebration year" of My Little Pony.

===Mail-order ponies===
All packaging came with Horseshoe Points, which could be used to obtain discounts on special ponies available only through [[mail order]]. The Horseshoe Point program was offered in both the US and UK, although the items available for purchase varied by country. Mail-order ponies were generally reissues like Majesty, which was previously available only with the Dream Castle Playset, or unique ponies such as the first boy pony, Lucky the stallion. Another line of exclusively mail-order ponies was the Birthflower ponies, which featured a pony for every month of the year. All had white bodies with pink hair and tails; their names were Carnation, Violet, Daffodil, Daisy, Lily of the Valley, Rose, Water Lily, Poppy, Morning Glory, Cosmos, Chrysantheum and Holly. Special baby ponies, such as the Pearlized Baby Ponies and Twice-As-Fancy babies, were also available by mail order. Some mail-order ponies, such as Sweet Scoops, Goldilocks and Rapunzel are rare and sought after by collectors.

===International ponies===
Some companies were licensed under Hasbro to produce their own line of ponies instead of shipping them from China or Hong Kong, where the vast majority of ponies were produced; these companies were located in Argentina, Brazil, France, Greece, India, Italy, Macau, Mexico and Spain. Some of these ponies are very similar to their Asian counterparts. For example, the Italian Clio looks very similar to Glory, with the most obvious difference being a non-glittery symbol. Some, such as the Mexican Twilight are a variation on existing colors, poses or species, while others, such as the Greek Ladybird, are completely unique to their region.

Due to factors such as limited production and their condition, international ponies tend to bring a higher price than their more-common counterparts.  Ponies from certain countries are also easier to find, while others, such as those made in Greece and Brazil, are more difficult. There are also international ponies which were distributed from China or Hong Kong, but made exclusively for a particular region, either a variant of the local ponies or completely new types.

Most ponies released in the United States were found in Western Europe as well. The majority of US domestic mail-order ponies never appeared overseas, although many countries had their own mail-order systems. Many of the excess ponies offered by mail order in the US were bagged, carded and sold overseas. Some of the ponies and playsets were given different names abroad; for example, the Big Brother Ponies were known as Adventure Boy Ponies in the UK.

;Petite Ponies
Petite Ponies were tiny pony figures sold in sets. Some had different characteristics, such as brushable hair, pearlized or [[Phosphorescence|glow-in-the-dark]] bodies. Under the base of each was an engraved hoof, which allowed the pony to function as a key to the Petite Playsets. Most of these smaller ponies had no official name, and many had the same symbols. They were sold from 1989 to 1991; only Earth Ponies and Pegasus Ponies were produced.

;Dream Beauties
These larger figures made of hard plastic were advertised as "grown up" ponies and called Dream Beauties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ponylandpress.com/dreambeauties/ |title=Dream Beauties - My Little Pony |publisher=Ponyland Press |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike My Little Pony toys, they looked more like real horses in proportions and musculature. The Dream Beauties came in a range of decorated and accessorized styles, including plastic beads along the base of their manes, ornamentation in the style of carousel horses, glitter or pearlescent finishes, and elaborate symbols, some extending the full length of the body.  All were Earth Ponies, except for the three Highflying Beauties, which had large, multicolored wings. They were sold from 1989 to 1990.

;My Little Kitty/Puppy/Bunny
Cat, dog and rabbit sets were sold under the Hasbro MLP logo during the early 1990s. Each Lil' Litters set consisted of a mother, two babies and a plastic comb. The mothers had flocked bodies, and the babies were miniature plastic figures. Kitty mothers had cottony tails, puppy mothers had either silky or cottony ears and bunny mothers had cottony tails and silky forelocks. There were also Nursery Family sets, featuring the puppy and kitty characters.

;Takara Variants
In 1984, [[Takara]] (Later merged with [[Tomy]] to form a single company) released a line of My Little Pony toys, which were released in two types: {{nihongo|'''Osharena Pony'''|おしゃれなポニー|Osharena ponī}} and {{nihongo|'''Kawaii Pony'''|かわいいポニー|Kawaī ponī}}. Only released in Japan, these are a more anthropomorphic take on the toyline and considered as the most rare of the "G1" collection due to how they were released.

===Mid-1980s animated features===

As a part of Hasbro's media strategy, My Little Pony, along with their other properties like [[Transformers]] and [[G.I. Joe]], was adapted into following animated features:
* ''My Little Pony'' (later retitled ''[[Rescue at Midnight Castle]]''), the first 22-minute [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] prime-time special premiered in 1984
* ''[[Escape from Catrina|My Little Pony: Escape from Catrina]]'', the second 22-minute syndicated special premiered in 1985, in which [[Tammy Grimes]] voiced the title character.
* ''[[My Little Pony: The Movie (1986 film)|My Little Pony: The Movie]]'', the first and only theatrical feature film released in [[1986 in film|1986]]. Directed by Michael Joens, it featured the voices of [[Rhea Perlman]], [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Tony Randall]] and [[Danny DeVito]]. It had mediocre box-office earnings, grossing almost $6 million in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mylittlepony.htm |title=Boxofficemojo -My Little Pony (1986) |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received mostly negative reviews from critics.
* ''My Little Pony 'n Friends'', a half-hour syndicated television series that featured various characters from Hasbro's properties by having ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]'' in its first segment and either ''[[Glo Friends]]'', ''[[Potato Head Kids]]'' or ''[[MoonDreamers]]'' in the second segment. The ''My Little Pony'' segment promoted many of the toys available in 1986–1987, featuring a regular cast of Earth, Pegasus and Unicorn ponies with guest appearances by new lines, such as the Flutter and Princess Ponies. It also used the jingles for each brand, as did other series tied into Hasbro properties. Consist of 65 episodes, it had the version of the first two specials, each edited into two episodes respectively.&lt;!--UNCERTAIN. PLEASE CHECK: When exported outside USA, the serials would broadcast under separate brands.--&gt;

The TV specials, the film, and the TV series were all set in the same milieu: Dream Valley, a land inhabited by witches, goblins and other magical creatures with whom the ponies, their human friend Megan, and their dragon friend Spike interacted.

In 2004, the first season of the original ''My Little Pony'' television series was released on DVD. The four-DVD collection features the two prime-time television specials and 50 episodes from the original series. Some songs from the original airing of the two specials have been cut, leaving the specials as they appeared when syndicated as part of the cartoon series. The ten-episode miniseries ''The End of Flutter Valley'' was released on DVD in 2005. 2006 brought the release of episodes from the second season, with two DVD releases: ''Flight to Cloud Castle and Other Stories'' and ''Quest of the Princess Ponies and Other Stories'', as well as a DVD entitled ''Two Great Pony Tales'' with ''The Magic Coins'' and ''The Glass Princess'' available in eight episodes.

===''My Little Pony Tales'' (1992)===
{{Main|My Little Pony Tales}}
''[[My Little Pony Tales]]'', premiered on July 3, 1992 on [[Disney Channel]], was set in a different environment. This series [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] the ponies further than the works from the mid-1980s, as the ponies lived in a town, went to school, ran businesses, went on vacation and exchanged currency for goods.

===Publications===
{{Main|My Little Pony (Egmont comics)}}
[[My Little Pony (Egmont comics)|Two British comic series]] were published by [[Egmont Group|Egmont]] during the era.

==Other merchandises==
Besides the toys, merchandise included children's bedding and room decorations, plush toys, puzzles, clothing, books and playsets. There were also unusual items such as a [[pomander]] and toy sewing machines. In 1985, a picture disc featuring songs by Tony Markey was released.

During the 2000s, like other fictional characters of the 1980s, My Little Pony merchandise aimed at young women has also appeared, including T-shirts depicting "G1" ponies in a "retro" style, featuring slogans such as "Livin' in the 80s" or "I Love Rainbows".

* To celebrate the 25th anniversary of My Little Pony, [[Hasbro]] reproduced the original 1982 ''My Little Pony'' collection. The ponies reproduced were Blue Belle, Butterscotch, Cotton Candy, Snuzzle, Blossom and Minty. Hasbro has also reproduced the Generation One Rainbow Ponies, Moonstone, Parasol, Skydancer, Starshine, Sunlight and Windy.
* Generation One Ponies key chains were sold in Japan. Ponies sold as key chains were Milky Way, Dancing Butterflies, Sugarberry, Starbow, Rainribbon, Sunribbon and Baby Stockings, which came in either red or green. They had comb-able hair, and came with a small comb. The key chains are rare, and valued by collectors.

The '''Passover Seder plate''' ({{lang-he|קערה}}, ''ke'ara'') is a special [[Plate (dishware)|plate]] containing symbolic foods eaten or displayed at the [[Passover Seder]].

==Significance==
Each of the six items arranged on the plate has special significance to the retelling of the story of [[Passover]] — [[the exodus]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] — which is the focus of this ritual meal. A seventh symbolic item used during the meal — the three [[matzah|matzos]] — is not considered part of the seder plate proper.

==Symbolic foods==
The six traditional items on the Seder Plate are as follows:

*''[[Maror]]'' and ''[[Chazeret]]'' — Bitter herbs symbolizing the bitterness and harshness of the slavery the Hebrews endured in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. In Ashkenazi tradition, fresh romaine lettuce or endives (both representing the bitterness of the Roman invasions) or [[horseradish]] may be eaten as [[Maror]] in the fulfillment of the [[mitzvah]] of eating bitter herbs during the Seder. [[Chazeret]] is additional bitter herbs, usually romaine lettuce, used in the [[korech]] sandwich.
*''[[Charoset]]'' — A sweet, brown mixture representing the mortar and brick used by the Hebrew slaves to build the storehouses or pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. In [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jew]]ish homes, Charoset is traditionally made from chopped nuts, grated apples, [[cinnamon]], and sweet red wine
[[File:Seder Plate.jpg|300px|right|thumb]]
*''[[Karpas]]'' — A vegetable other than bitter herbs representing hope and renewal, which is dipped into salt water at the beginning of the Seder. Parsley or another green vegetable.&lt;ref&gt;A Passover Haggadah: As Commented Upon by Elie Wiesel and Illustrated by Mark Podwal (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993, {{ISBN|0671799967}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some substitute parsley to slice of green onion (representing the bitterness of slavery in Egypt) or potato (representing the bitterness of the ghetto in Germany and in other European countries), both commonly used. The dipping of a simple vegetable into salt water, and the resulting dripping of water off of said vegetables visually represents tears and is a symbolic reminder of the pain felt by the Hebrew slaves in Egypt. Usually in a [[Shabbat]] or [[Jewish holiday|holiday]] meal, the first thing to be eaten after the [[kiddush]] over wine is bread. At the Seder table, however, the first thing to be eaten after the kiddush is a vegetable. This leads immediately to the recital of the famous question, ''Ma Nishtana'' — "Why is this night different from all other nights?" It also symbolizes the spring time, because Jews celebrate Passover in the spring.
*''[[Zeroa]]h'' — Also transliterated ''Z'roa'', it is special as it is the only element of meat on the Seder Plate. Roasted chicken neck or shankbone; symbolizing the Paschal Lamb (Passover sacrifice), which was a lamb that was offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], then roasted and eaten as part of the meal on Seder night. Since the destruction of the Temple, the ''z'roa'' serves as a visual reminder of the Pesach sacrifice; it is not eaten or handled during the Seder. Vegetarians often substitute a [[beet]], quoting ''Pesachim 114b'' as justification; other vegetarians substitute a [[sweet potato]], allowing a "Paschal yam" to represent the Paschal lamb.
*''[[Beitza]]h'' — A roasted hard-boiled egg, symbolizing the ''[[korban chagigah]]'' (festival sacrifice) that was offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and roasted and eaten as part of the meal on Seder night. Although both the Pesach sacrifice and the ''[[chagigah]]'' were meat offerings, the ''chagigah'' is commemorated by an egg, a symbol of mourning (as eggs are the first thing served to mourners after a funeral), evoking the idea of mourning over the destruction of the Temple and our inability to offer any kind of sacrifices in honor of the Pesach holiday. Since the destruction of the Temple, the ''beitzah'' serves as a visual reminder of the ''chagigah''; it is not used during the formal part of the seder, but some people eat a regular hard-boiled egg dipped in saltwater as the first course of the meal.
[[File:SederPlate.jpg|thumb|right|Sterling silver seder plate]]
Many decorative and artistic Seder plates sold in [[Judaica]] stores have pre-formed spaces for inserting the various symbolic foods.
[[File:Seder Table.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Table set for the seder with a seder plate, salt water, matza, kosher wine and a copy of the [[Haggadah]] for each guest]]

The sixth symbolic item on the Seder table is a plate of three whole [[matzo]]t, which are stacked and separated from each other by cloths or napkins. The middle matzah will be broken and half of it put aside for the ''[[afikoman]]''. The top and other half of the middle matzot will be used for the ''hamotzi'' (blessing over bread), and the bottom matzah will be used for the ''korech'' ([[Hillel the Elder#Hillel Sandwich|Hillel sandwich]]).

A bowl of salt water, which is used for the first "dipping" of the Seder, is not traditionally part of the Seder Plate, but is placed on the table beside it. However, it sometimes is used as one of the six items, omitting chazeret.

==Variants==
*[[Vinegar]] — German Jews traditionally included vinegar on the seder plate, closest to the leader next to the ''karpas''. The ''karpas'' was dipped in the vinegar rather than in salt water during the seder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moreshesashkenaz.org/en/guide|title=Guide to Minhag Ashkenaz|last=Hamburger|first=Rav Binyomin Shlomo|date=2009|website=Machon Moreshes Ashkenaz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Pesach has often been used as an occasion for political or social commentary. This was often the case when the departure of Soviet Jews was compared to the departure of the Jews from Egypt.

'''Philadelphia/Tri State Artists Equity Association, Inc.''', commonly known as '''Philadelphia Artists Equity''', became an independent organization in 1997. It was founded as a chapter of a national organization of professional fine artists in 1949. Artists Equity works for the protection of artists’ rights and improved working and economic conditions for fine artists.&lt;ref name='Artists Equity'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.artistsequity.org/about.html | title = Committed to service: OUR HISTORY | accessdate = 2010-07-02 | date = 2010-07-02 | work = Organization web site | publisher = Philadelphia/Tri State Artists Equity Association, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists Equity worked behind the scenes for the establishment of a [[Philadelphia]] City ordinance, entitled “Aesthetic Ornamentation of City Structures,” which was sponsored by Councilman Henry Sawyer, III, and adopted on his last day as a member of [[Philadelphia City Council|City Council]] in the final months of 1959. This ordinance established a requirement for [[Percent for Art|one percent for art]] for city building projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bach | first = Penny Balkin | title = Public Art in Philadelphia | publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|year= 1992|isbn=0-87722-822-1|pages= 130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Philip Magnus, 1st Baronet''' (7 October 1842 – 29 August 1933) was a British educational reformer and politician, who represented the [[London University (UK Parliament constituency)|London University constituency]] as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Unionist]] from 1906 to 1922. He had previously been appointed director of the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]], from where he helped oversee the creation of a modern system of technical education in the United Kingdom. He was married to the writer and teacher [[Katie Magnus]], and was father of the publisher [[Laurie Magnus]]. Laurie predeceased him, and on Philip's death in 1933 he was succeeded in the baronetcy by Laurie's eldest son [[Philip Magnus-Allcroft|Philip]].

==Biography==
After studying at [[University College School]] and [[University College London]], where he took [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first-class honours]] in both arts and science, Magnus chose to take up a religious career. An active member of the [[Reform Judaism (United Kingdom)|Reform Judaism in Britain]], he spent three years studying at the [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]] in Berlin and returned to London to take up a post as assistant rabbi at the [[West London Synagogue]] in 1866.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;Bailey (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as rabbi, Magnus supplemented his income by teaching private students, which grew steadily into a regular occupation. He held a lectureship at Stockwell teacher training college, taught at University College London, and examined prospective teachers for the [[College of Preceptors]]. In 1880, he finally left his rabbinical work to become director of the newly formed [[City and Guilds of London Institute]]. He oversaw the rapid growth of the institute, focusing his attentions on the technical education departments, of which he became Superintendent in 1888; he would hold this post until retiring in 1915.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2004; Who Was Who"&gt;Bailey (2004); ''Who Was Who''&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the Institute, Magnus was influential in setting national education policy; he sat on the [[Samuelson Commission]] (the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction) of 1884, and for his work here was knighted in 1886.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; The Commission's report led to the [[Technical Instruction Act 1889]], which supported local authorities in creating technical schools around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical colleges and further education: Science and Art Department|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/technical-further-education.htm|publisher=[[The National Archives (UK)]]|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged the reform of primary and secondary state education in London, and helped oversee the merger of the City and Guilds Institute into the newly formed [[Imperial College of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election]], he was elected to Parliament as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]], representing the [[London University (UK Parliament constituency)|London University constituency]].&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; He narrowly defeated Sir [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]], a prominent Cambridge physiologist, by twenty-four votes. Foster was a Liberal, who on his initial election had joined the Liberal Unionists and supported [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Salisbury's]] Conservative government; however, he later [[crossed the floor]] to rejoin the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], in large part due to his opposition to the [[Education Act 1902|1902 educational reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Romano (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Magnus was re-elected in 1910, and on the demise of the Liberal Unionists in 1912 joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. He held the seat in 1918 – where he defeated [[Sidney Webb]] – but did not seek re-election in 1922.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

In retirement, he continued to sit as a member of the Senate of the University of London, and chaired the council of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. He was a governor of the [[Northampton Institute]] and [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]], and a vice-president of the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]], the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], and [[Jews' College]].&lt;ref name="Bailey 2004; Who Was Who"/&gt; In 1917, he co-founded the anti-Zionist [[League of British Jews]].

'''Philosophy of Architecture''' is a branch of [[philosophy of art]], dealing with aesthetic value of [[architecture]], its [[semantics]] and relations with development of [[culture]].

==History ==

=== Early history ===

[[Plato]], whose influence on architecture is widely documented (e.g., 'idealism', 'neo-Platonic' architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendrix | first=John Shannon | authorlink=John Shannon Hendrix | date=1999 | title=Neoplatonic Philosophy and Roman Baroque Architecture | journal=The European Studies Journal | publisher=University of Northern Iowa | volume=16 | issue=1 |pages=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;), may be counted as part of a classical geometric model of cosmology, the popularity of which could be attributed to earlier thinkers such as [[Pythagoras]]. In early history, philosophers distinguished architecture ('technion') from building ('demiorgos'), attributing the former to mental traits, and the latter to the divine or natural. It was only with Socratic irony that the name craftsman could become representative of a religious deity. The presence of some degree of formalism ala Platonism continues to be an important trait in distinguishing one architectural style from another, and thus in distinguishing the philosophy of a style.

Due to the nature of critique, the philosophy of architecture is an outgrowth of the [[philosophy of art]], which began to be expressed in books on architecture and history of architecture during the latter half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Harries K. | title= Philosophy and the Task of Architecture | journal=Journal of Architectural Education | volume=40 | issue=2 | date=Winter 1987 | pages=29 | doi=10.2307/1424928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, largely because of its reliance on technology and engineering, architecture was seen as incompatible, or beneath, the proper subject areas of classical aesthetics as delimited by, notably, [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], with their ideal of "pure art."&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29" /&gt;

=== Modern period ===

As it was noted by [[Michel Foucault]], the architecture is able to set the life of society, and therefore it is particularly important for understanding of the person's values and culture. In "[[Discipline and Punish]]" Foucault analized contemporary culture through architecture project of principally new prison [[Panopticon]]. The point of this project by [[Jeremy Bentham]] was to create a special transparent environment for prisoners, where everyone would be under constant surveillance. Although the project was not realized, Bentham's thought deeply influenced ideology of prisons, changing social practices of punishment. Simultaneously with its main conclusions Foucault reached other goal - his instrumental use of architecture in cultural studies showed the potential of this philosophical theme.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

However, philosophy of architecture as a full-fledged part of the Philosophy of Art, would not have been possible without the [[Avant-garde]]`s shift of the aesthetic paradigm. Art, set in the conditions of [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|mechanical reproduction of the image]], was forced to look for new ways. Around the same time architectural styles of [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] find way to justify new, totally engineering aesthetics. Side of the architecture, which had been considered a shame (as a sign of its connection with the pragmatic needs of man and society), became a major advantage, central part of new system of aesthetic values. [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] set aesthetic, full of mechanized, slaughtered, brutal forms, what was very close to the same engineering ideal. All this created more than favorable environment to change status of architecture in our system of art, as well as our understanding of art by itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Postmodernism ===
[[File:Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village crop.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photography "[[Stuyvesant Town - Peter Cooper Village]]," according to Martin R.&lt;ref name="Martin R."&gt;Martin R. "Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern." ''Grey Room,'' No. 22 (Winter, 2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an architectural work, which may serve as one of the first manifestations of postmodernism]]
Architecture assumed much more significant role after establishing of the phenomenon of [[Postmodernism]]. According to R. Martin "it remains surprising how many influential accounts of cultural postmodernism make reference to architecture."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt;
Some scholars go so far as to claim that the entire post-modernism comes from the practice of architecture, and the rejection of "[[Art Nouveau|style of Modern]]" as an architectural style, and by so architects terminologically formulated postmodernism. Thus, F. Jameson writes that "it is in the realm of architecture, however, that modifications in aesthetic production are most dramatically visible, and that their theoretical problems have been most centrally raised and articulated (...) it was indeed from architectural debates that my own conception of post-modernism (...) initially began to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was noted by researchers, "Barthes and Eco, taking their cue from Russian Formalism, see norm breaking as the mark of the aesthetic (sc., the aesthetic code). Art is characteristically inventive in its capacity to have signs do duty as signifier of further meanings in a potentially endless play upon convention as well as within it or on its margin."&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"&gt;Donougho M. The Language of Architecture // Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Autumn, 1987), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; So important to postmodern writers like [[Barthes, Roland|R. Bart]] and [[Eco, Umberto|U. Eco]], saw architecture as a source of revolutionary innovations in art.&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"/&gt;
[[File:The Luxor From Airport.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photo of casino "Luxor", an example of architecture of "Las Vegas", which formed the basis for post-modernist manifesto of [[Robert Venturi]] and has played a key role in the development of post-modernism according to F. Jameson]]F. Jameson believes that there is a special relationship between postmodernism and American architecture, in which the birth of a national architecture coincided, in his opinion, with the emergence of the terminology or even the reality of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all researchers agree with his post-modern "architectural origins," so [[Andreas Huyssen]], suggests that the conceptual frame of postmodernism has been defined within certain movements of literature. However, this researcher also notes the special role of architecture in the development of post-modernism. Martin describes, that "Huyssen credits architecture with helping to disseminate the term postmodernism, originally from literature, into the expanded aesthetic sphere during the 1970s."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] contends that postmodern architects have nothing in common with true Postmodernism &lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; and, as Lyotard states it in his article, ''Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism?'': "under the name of postmodernism, architects are getting rid of the Bauhaus project, throwing out the baby of experimentation with the bathwater of functionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard J.-F. Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism? // Lyotard J.-F. The Posmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. 1984. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special figure for the philosophy of architecture can be considered the architect [[Robert Venturi]], whose books may have played a no lesser role in the development of [[postmodernism]], than his stylistic experiments in architecture. R. Venturi first lead attention of architects to [[pop-art]]. In his rejection of architectural modernism Venturi  gave rise to the new cultural setting. By this Venturi showed a deep connection between civilization and architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin R. Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern // Grey Room, No. 22 (Winter, 2006), pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wittgenstein and philosophy of architecture ==
[[File:Wittgenstein haus.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo of Wittgenstein House]]
The [[Wittgenstein House]] is considered one of the most important examples of interactions between philosophy and architecture. Built by renowned [[Austria]]n philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], the house has been the subject of extensive research about the relationship between its stylistic features, Wittgenstein's personality, and his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb G.

'''''Play''''' is a [[symphony]] for [[orchestra]] in three movements by the American composer [[Andrew Norman (composer)|Andrew Norman]]. The work was commissioned by the [[Boston Modern Orchestra Project]], for whom Norman was then [[Artist-in-residence|composer-in-residence]].  It was first performed on May 17, 2013 by the orchestra under the conductor [[Gil Rose]].&lt;ref name="Boston Classical Review"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=David |title=BMOP celebrates youngish composers in season closer |work=Boston Classical Review |date=May 18, 2013 |url=http://bostonclassicalreview.com/2013/05/bmop-celebrates-youngish-composers-in-season-closer/ |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised version was premiered by the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] conducted by [[Gustavo Dudamel]] October 28, 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lanzilotti|first=Anne|date=October 25, 2016|title="Cut to a Different World": Andrew Norman|url=http://www.musicandliterature.org/features/2016/10/25/cut-to-a-different-world-andrew-norman|journal=Music &amp; Literature|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
''Play'' has a duration of roughly 45 minutes and is composed in three [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Level 1
#Level 2
#Level 3
Norman scholar and collaborator Anne Lanzilotti writes, "Structured in three movements—or 'Levels,' as they are titled—it is an intricately planned work dealing with themes of control, free will, hidden messages, and of course, playfulness. The key elements of ''Play'' are the things that inspire me in Norman’s music: physicality, the use of form to create narrative, and an interest in the experience of live performance."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The composition also utilizes various [[Bowed string instrument extended technique|extended techniques for strings]]''.[http://www.shakennotstuttered.com]''

==Reception==
''Play'' has received an extremely positive critical response.  Reviewing the world premiere, David Wright of the ''Boston Classical Review'' wrote, "No matter how complex and seemingly chaotic the music became, Norman's contrapuntal skill and imaginative handling of the large orchestra were evident throughout."  He added, "A single hearing can hardly do a piece like ''Play'' justice, but the work's ambition and brilliant performance earned it warm and prolonged applause."&lt;ref name="Boston Classical Review" /&gt;  Reviewing a recording of the work, the music critic [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] called it "a sprawling, engulfing, furiously unpredictable piece in three symphonic movements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Ross (music critic) |title=CD of the Week: Andrew Norman's Play |work=The Rest is Noise |date=January 5, 2015 |url=http://www.therestisnoise.com/2015/01/cd-of-the-week-andrew-normans-play.html |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tom Huizenga of [[NPR]] similarly called it "witty, playful, surprisingly transparent — aside from the bazillion little things going on — and probably thrillingly difficult to pull off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huizenga |first=Tom |title=Bach, Brits And A Bodacious Boston Orchestra: New Classical Albums |work=Deceptive Cadence |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 31, 2015 |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2015/01/31/382130287/bach-brits-and-a-bodacious-boston-orchestra-new-classical-albums |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Weininger of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote:{{quote|''Play'' [...] is being talked about as the most important long orchestral work of the 21st century. That kind of hype can often be misleading, but in this case it's quite likely accurate. The 45-minute, three-movement work, which encompasses various meanings of play — some lighthearted, some sinister — begins in an almost spastic fit of energy; musical ideas ricochet off one another furiously, almost too quickly. But embedded in the chaos are two scales: one ascending, the other descending. Their interaction and gradual transformation create the piece's overarching structure as the music progresses through three "levels," though it never loses its reckless feel.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{cite web |last=Weininger |first=David |title=Andrew Norman, 'Play' |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=March 15, 2015 |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2015/03/14/andrew-norman-play/P1wguypapg0twdPwjXDUuL/story.html |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Recording==
The Boston Modern Orchestra Project launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign on June 13, 2013 to raise $8,000 for a recording of ''Play'', in addition to Norman's orchestral work ''Try''.  The campaign closed on June 30, 2013 having successfully raised $9,525.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew Norman - Play |work=[[Kickstarter]] |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bmopsound/andrew-norman-play |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recording of the work was subsequently released through the orchestra's label BMOP/Sound.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe" /&gt;  The BMOP recording was later named one of the best classical music recordings of 2015 by David Allen of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and was nominated for the 2016 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition|Best Classical Contemporary Composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Best Classical Music Recordings of 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 10, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/arts/music/best-classical-recordings-2015.html |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2016 Grammy Awards: Complete list of nominees |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 7, 2015 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-grammys-2016-nominees-winners-list-story.html |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oteri |first=Frank J. |title=About Those 2016 Grammy Nominations |work=[[NewMusicBox]] |date=December 7, 2015 |url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/about-those-2016-grammy-nominations/ |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earth government==
[[Image:Futurama flag of Earth.svg|thumb|right|The Earth flag, "Old Freebie".]]
The most significant change in global politics presented in ''Futurama'''s view of the 31st century is that the whole of [[Earth]] is governed by a single united government. This united government has many similarities to the present-day [[United States]]' political system; its capital is [[Washington, D.C.]], it is a [[two-party system]] of the "Fingerlican" and "Tastycrat" parties with a number of inconsequential [[third party (politics)|third parties]], the government is headed by a [[president]], and there are references to a [[constitution]] and an expanded [[bill of rights]]. In the episodes "[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]" and a "[[A Head in the Polls]]" third parties mentioned include the "Rainbow Whigs", "Antisocialists", the "Voter Apathy Party", "Reform Party", the "Green Party", "Brain Slug Party", "Dudes for the Legalation of of Hemp" [sic], "Bull Space Moose Party", "National Ray-Gun Association", "People for the Ethical Treatment of Humans", and "One Cell, One Vote".

Citizens of Earth are referred to as "Earthicans". In the episodes "[[When Aliens Attack]]" and "[[Anthology of Interest II]]" there is evidence that the Countries of Earth are still bound to the [[U.N.]] (the UN New York Offices appear in "When Aliens Attack"), headed by the Earth President. Each member appears to remain individual, sending their own representative to the UN and maintaining many of their own cultures and languages, but also show evidence of [[multiculturalism]] (France now speaks [[English language|English]] and French is apparently a [[Extinct language|dead language]], for example). It is not clear how much power the countries actually have in the Earthican government, though it appears that remnants of many U.S. states, for example, have survived into the 31st century, including "New New York", "New New Jersey", "[[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Nukevada]]", [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|"Penn Republic" and "Sylvania"]].

"Old Freebie", the name of Earth's flag, contains the thirteen stripes of the [[Flag of the United States]] and the [[Grand Union Flag]] but instead of the 50 stars or the [[Union Flag]] in the [[Flag terminology|canton]] it has a picture of the globe, with North and South America prominently centered. In the episode "[[A Taste of Freedom]]", [[Doctor Zoidberg]] eats the flag, causing an interplanetary incident. This reflects several controversies surrounding the desecration of the American flag.

The former [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has become the Earth's Supreme Court. According to Richard Nixon's head, the Earth's Supreme Court is the "one place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat". The current Chief Justice is [[Snoop Dogg]] while the other members of the Supreme Court are several preserved, jar heads of the members of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1990s, like Scalia, Thomas or Ginsberg, while the other members are singers or actresses such as [[Björk]] or [[Katey Sagal]] (who voices [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]]). Myrtle Fu, a female judge who resembles [[Judge Judy]], was the last non-head in jar Justice at the Supreme Court.  [[Abe Vigoda]] was also a member of the Court. In "[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]", Leela and her environmentalist cohorts are convicted of various crimes because, while all five female justices vote to acquit, each female justice has only half a vote.

===Presidency===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Futurama nixons head.png|thumb|left|''[[Futurama]]'''s fictional president of Earth, the preserved head of [[Richard Nixon]] in a jar.]] --&gt;
The President of Earth is introduced in the episode "[[When Aliens Attack]]", in the person of President McNeal. In a case of mistaken identity, McNeal is vaporized by invading Omicronians. In a later episode, "[[A Head in the Polls]]", a presidential election is held. Initially two [[cloning|clone]]s, John Jackson and Jack Johnson, run for the presidency, representing the "Fingerlican" and "Tastycrat" parties respectively. Later in the episode, [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon]] enters the running, his living head preserved in a glass jar and mounted on [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]]'s previously [[pawnbroker|pawned]] body.&lt;ref name="Drawn to TV"&gt;{{cite book| last=Booker| first=M. Keith |title=Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first Nixon's head is presented in a positive light, an effort by the writers to point out laudable elements of the real [[Richard Nixon]]'s political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2002 |title=[[Futurama]] season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "[[A Head in the Polls]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=[on Leela's line about Nixon opening up relations with China] A positive comment about Richard Nixon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Cohen, David X |date=2002 |title=[[Futurama]] season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "[[A Head in the Polls]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=We went through everything about Nixon that we all remembered from about eighth grade history.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is soon revealed that Nixon's head has evil intentions, planning to "sell children's organs to zoos for meat" and "go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!" His campaign is almost undone after [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]], [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] and Bender record his confession and use it to blackmail him into giving back Bender's body, but he wins by a single vote after overwhelming support from Earth's robotic voters in response to his [[Super Robot|colossal new robot body]].&lt;ref name="inverse" /&gt;

Nixon's head reappears as President of Earth in numerous subsequent episodes. Nixon runs for office a third time in "[[Decision 3012]]" against a candidate from the future, [[Chris Travers]], sent back to prevent Nixon from destroying the world with his political decisions (Nixon demands the candidate's "earth certificate", parodying the [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|controversy over Barack Obama's birth certificate]]).&lt;ref name="decision3012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gandert |first=Sean |title=Futurama: "Decision 3012" (7.3) |work=[[Paste Magazine]] |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/06/futurama-decision-3012-73.html |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon loses, but this causes a time paradox causing his challenger to disappear, and he wins by default. Series creator [[Matt Groening]] has expressed pleasure at being able to continue poking fun at Nixon thirty or forty years after he was in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people=Groening, Matt |date=2002 |title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Space Pilot 3000]]"| medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=If I could have known back then that in 1999 I would still get to make fun of [Nixon]...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's head's subsequent appearances in ''Futurama'' are often used for satirical humor. An example is the episode "[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]", where Nixon gives a $300 [[tax rebate]] to every Earthican, spoofing the rebate that was part of the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Cohen, David X |date=2003 |title=[[Futurama]] season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=At the time Eric Kaplan and I first met to discuss this episode, there was a very big story in the news that President George W. Bush had decided to refund $300 in tax money like this to all the taxpayers in America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other themes include voting and participating in the political process. In "[[A Head In The Polls]]", Fry debates  if he should vote, saying "like one vote ever made a difference” after which Leela tells him about a robot candidate who won an election by one vote.&lt;ref name="inverse" /&gt; Later in the episode, neither Fry, Bender, or Leela end up voting after Fry and Leela forgot Bender meanwhile cannot vote as he is a registered felon, and Nixon, with a "gigantic missile-firing bionic body" wins the presidency by one robot vote.

==Democratic Order of Planets (D.O.O.P.)==
The ''Futurama'' universe has a cooperative interplanetary organization known as the '''Democratic Order of Planets''' or '''D.O.O.P.'''.&lt;ref name="motherjones" /&gt; First mentioned in the episode "[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]", it is explored in more detail in "[[Brannigan Begin Again]]", in which it is compared to the present-day [[United Nations]] and the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] from ''[[Star Trek]]''.&lt;ref name="Drawn to TV" /&gt; The D.O.O.P. flag is styled on the [[flag of the United Nations]] with two olive branches representing peace, replacing the globe image with an atom diagram with the word [[Ambigram|"doop"]] in lowercase in the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/fic%5Efutr.html |title=Flags of the World: Futurama (television series)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D.O.O.P. maintains a military capability, most often led by Zapp Brannigan. The typography of D.O.O.P. is identical to that used by the [[Doop (band)|one-hit wonder of the same name]]. Combating this group are a "rampaging alien race" that wants to take over Earth for commercial purposes named the Omicronians.&lt;ref name="motherjones" /&gt;

==Environmentalism==
Episodes with environmental themes include "[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]", "[[The Problem with Popplers]]", "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]", "[[Crimes of the Hot]]", "[[Fun on a Bun]]", "[[Attack of the Killer App]]" (partially), and "[[Fry Am the Egg Man]]."

Former [[Vice President of the United States]] and prominent [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] [[Al Gore]] is a recurring guest star, due in part to his daughter [[Kristin Gore]]'s involvement in the show as a staff writer and story editor. He has appeared as himself in story segments set in the early 21st century ("[[Anthology of Interest I]]" and ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'') and as his own head in a jar in the 31st century ("[[Crimes of the Hot]]" and ''[[Bender's Big Score]]''). His portrait also adorns the $500 bill (written prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2000|controversial election in 2000]]), and he is described as the "inventor of the environment, and first "[[Emperor]] of the [[Moon]]."

===Global warming===
The episode "[[Crimes of the Hot]]" centers around the issue of [[global warming]]. The temporary solution of cooling the Earth with giant ice cubes dropped periodically into the ocean is no longer possible because [[Halley's Comet]], the source of the ice, has been mined completely hollow. At a scientific conference, led by Al Gore, Professor Farnsworth reveals that beer-powered robots, including Bender, are the source of current global warming, and President Nixon and Professor Wernstrom attempt to destroy all robots on Earth by tricking them to convene on the Galapagos Islands for a party, and then bathe the islands in electromagnetic waves from a satellite in space. Fry, Leela, and Farnsworth arrive in time, and Farnsworth tells every robot to aim their exhaust ports upward and expel their gasses, creating a makeshift engine that pushes Earth away from the sun, thus cooling Earth and causing the electromagnetic beams to miss.  
The episode was nominated for the [[Environmental Media Award]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="ema-online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema-online.org/awards_13th_annual.php |title=Thirteenth Annual Media Awards |publisher=Environmental Media Association |year=2003 |accessdate=2007-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213211900/http://www.ema-online.org/awards_13th_annual.php |archivedate=2009-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Gore's appearance in the episode was also listed as one of the 20 best animated politicians by ''The Phoenix''.&lt;ref name="Phoenix" /&gt;

[[Al Gore]]'s involvement with the show continued after it was cancelled in 2003. In promoting the documentary film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', the producers of ''Futurama'' were approached to make a short animated trailer, starring Al Gore and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]]. This trailer was released online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXP8Qwp5JRk |title=A Terrifying Message from Al Gore |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is included as an extra on the DVD of ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'', with a commentary track by Al Gore, David X. Cohen and Series creator [[Matt Groening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=19939 |title=Toon Zone: "Futurama: Bender's Big Score" Still a Winner for Casual Fans |last=Liu |first=Ed |date=2007-11-24 |accessdate=2007-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126005529/http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=19939 |archivedate=2007-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''An Inconvenient Truth'' used a clip from the episode "Crimes of the Hot" to humorously explain how global warming works.&lt;ref name="ireland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2006/0915/1158001563481.html |title=YOU GO, GORE |publisher=The Irish Times |date=September 15, 2006 |accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Xmas Story]]" Leela explains that snow still exists in the future because, even though global warming occurred, "[[nuclear winter]] canceled it out."

===Conservationism===
The episode "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]" tackles the issues of [[pollution]] and its effect on wildlife. In a parody of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|Exxon ''Valdez'' oil spill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Cohen, David X |date=2003 |title=[[Futurama]] season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=I like the idea that it was like the Exxon Valdez, except Bender crashed it because he ''wasn't'' drinking.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tanker spaceship  (piloted by a sober Bender) spills its cargo of "[[dark matter]] oil" on a [[penguin]] colony on [[Pluto]]. The dark matter actually functioned as an [[aphrodisiac]], or as the environmentalist puts it "a Penguin [[Spanish fly]]", so rather than killing the penguin population, the pollution vastly increases the speed and rate of their breeding, as even the males were producing eggs. This leads the conservationists, who originally set out to save the wildlife and clean up the oil spill, to resort to [[hunting]] the penguins to prevent them starving from [[Overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]]. The episode's stance on the issue of hunting was influenced by some of the writers on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which has also presented multiple viewpoints on controversial issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2003 |title=[[Futurama]] season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=One thing which I heard from some of the senior writers of ''The Simpsons'' when I used to work there was that if you discuss a real topic like this on the show, it works much better if you give both sides a somewhat reasonable argument at the base of it...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode "[[The Problem with Popplers]]" addresses conservationism in a similar fashion: it focuses primarily on the [[animal rights movement]], parodying [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] with Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment (M.E.A.T.) a vegan activist group that, among other things, attempt to teach carnivorous animals to eat tofu. This episode won an [[Environmental Media Award]] in 2000.

The ''Futurama'' movie ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder|Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'' showcases the fight between conservationism and the interests of big business; the construction of the universe's largest giant [[mini golf]] course (headed by Amy's father, Leo Wong) threatens to destroy 12% (an entire branch) of the [[Milky Way]]. An environmental survey headed by [[Professor Farnsworth]] and the ''Futurama'' crew discovers an asteroid full of primitive life, orbiting a violet dwarf star. However, Farnsworth has been bribed by Leo, and declares the destruction 'environmentally friendly', leading to plans for the dwarf star to be imploded, creating a black hole. This leads to two groups trying to sabotage this plan – a group of [[Eco-feminism|eco-feminists]], who are joined by [[Amy (Futurama)|Amy]], [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] and [[LaBarbara Conrad]], who start destroying equipment, machines and sections of the golf course, and even accidentally kill Nixon's beloved vice-president, Agnew. The second group is the Legion of Madfellows, a secret organization of mind readers, of which [[Fry (Futurama)|Fry]] joins. They prophesize a new green age, headed by a resurgence in the life force Chi, which they believe will be started by the asteroid and the dwarf star. A resurgence in the Chi would halt the extinction rate, and increase the diversity of life by preserving endangered species DNA and reintroducing extinct life forms through the Encyclopod. Fry is given the responsibility to preserve and protect it at all costs.

==Social and other issues==
The episode "[[Proposition Infinity]]" depicts an attempt to legalize "robosexual marriage," or marriage between robots and humans, after Bender and Amy fall in love. It closely parodies the events surrounding, as well as arguments for and against, [[Proposition 8]] of [[California]] from the 2008 election. Ultimately, "robosexual marriage" is legalized with this "future civil rights movement."&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite news |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |title=In 'Futurama,' robots follow 'Bender's Law,' not Asimov's |work=[[CNet]] |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/in-futurama-robots-follow-benders-law-not-asimovs/ |date=2013-09-12 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Futurama episodes there is a theme of, as Series creator [[Matt Groening]] put it in 1999, a "corporate, commercial, confusing world where the military is just as stupid as it is currently" with a "corrupt megacorporation" named MomCorp which is run by a "scrawny elderly woman" who is very rich "from manufacturing Mom's Old-Fashioned Robot Oil." &lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Wired |title=One-Eyed Aliens! Suicide Booths! Mom’s Old-Fashioned Robot Oil! |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/1999/02/futurama/ |date=1999-02-01|accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is expanded by characters being "thoroughly inundated by advertising, especially subliminal advertising that comes out of your pillow into your dreams" and having "ridiculous-but-cool tech gadgets" that don't work as they were expected to, not improving the economy.&lt;ref name="washpo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Basulto |first=Dominic |title=The Jetsons vs. Futurama: Which one will be our innovation future? |work=[[Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2013/08/16/the-jetsons-vs-futurama-which-one-will-be-our-innovation-future/ |date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, people are tested to find out what they would be "best at in life," as shown in "[[Space Pilot 3000]]" and other episodes, a choice that Bender, Fry, and other characters reject, wanting to "go against their programming, whether or not they will be successful."&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;

The show also criticized [[jingoism]] in "[[A Taste Of Freedom]]", lampooned groups like [[Parents Television Council]] and Parents Against Media Violence with groups like "Fathers Against Rude Television" and criticized the [[Star system (filmmaking)|star system]] in "[[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV]]" and "[[Calculon 2.0]]" while addressing the controversy around [[genetically-modified]] food in "[[Leela and the Genestalk]]".&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite news |last=Handlen |first=Zack |title=Futurama: "A Taste Of Freedom"/"Bender Should Not Be Allowed On Television" |work=[[The A.V.

Elsewhere in the show, the place of robots in human society and [[sentient]] robots are also addressed as issues which fit with the [[science fiction]] genre.&lt;ref name="cnet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paste3"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gandert |first=Sean |title=Futurama: "31st Century Fox"/"Naturama" (6.12/6.13) |work=[[Paste Magazine]] |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/08/futurama-31st-century-foxnaturama-612613.html |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paste4"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gandert |first=Sean |title=Futurama: "Free Will Hunting" (Episode 7.9) |work=[[Paste Magazine]] |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/08/futuram-free-will-hunting-79.html |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paste5"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gandert |first=Sean |title=Futurama: "The Bots and the Bees"/"A Farewell to Arms" (7.1 &amp; 7.2) |work=[[Paste Magazine]] |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/06/futurama-the-bots-and-the-beesa-farewell-to-arms-7.html |date=2012-06-12 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paste6"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gandert |first=Sean |title=Futurama Review: "Overclockwise" (6.25) |work=[[Paste Magazine]] |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/09/futurama-review-overclockwise-625.html |date=2011-09-11 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than this, numerous episodes address the themes of time travel, including "[[Mobius Dick]]", "[[All the Presidents' Heads]]", "[[Roswell That Ends Well]]" and "[[Space Pilot 3000]]", plagiarism and exploitation in "[[Yo Leela Leela]]", and 3-D printing in "[[Forty Percent Leadbelly]]". Additionally, in "[[The Mutants Are Revolting]]", the "mutants" engage in a revolution to demand their rights to live on the surface, an event which may reference the [[Stonewall riots]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2817">'''Pouncing''' is an art technique used for transferring an image from one surface to another.  It is similar to tracing, and is useful for creating copies of a sketch outline to produce finished works.
[[File:Tracing wheel - 01.jpg|thumb|A pounce wheel, also known as a tracing wheel]]
Pouncing has been a common technique for centuries, used to create copies of portraits and other works that would be finished as oil paintings, engravings, and so on. The most common method involves laying semi-transparent paper over the original image, then tracing along the lines of the image by creating pricked marks on the top sheet of paper.  This pounced drawing made of pricked holes is laid over a new working surface. A powder such as chalk, graphite or pastel is forced through the holes to leave an outline on the working surface below, thus transferring the image. The powder is applied by being placed into a small bag of thin fabric such as cheesecloth, then dabbed onto the pricked holes of the pounced drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Calligraphy in black ''nasta'liq'' script on a beige paper decorated with bird and leaf designs painted in gold. The main text panel is bordered by a number of other verses in both diagonal and vertical registers forming a frame. The entire composition is pasted to a larger sheet of paper decorated with a pounced vegetal motif in green and backed by cardboard.

2. Black chalk over pounce marks, traces of stylus, watermark of encircled Saint Anthony's cross.

3. Ink and color on paper, pounced for transfer.

4. The original drawing, which has been reinforced in ink and wash by other hands, was used as the pattern for a number of copies, including this example. Pounce marks on the outlines reveal that this copy was traced not from the original but from another copy. It was previously mounted on thin paper, which was cut out and stuck onto thicker paper.

The Illyrian '''Tombs of Selca e Poshtme''' ({{sq|Varret e Selcës së Poshtme}}) are located near the town of [[Pogradec]] in [[Albania]] near the village of ''Selcë e Poshtme''. On the right bank of the river Shkumbin at an elevation of 1040&amp;nbsp;m above sea level, lie the remains of the ancient city of [[Pelion (Chaonia)|Pelion]] and the accompanying necropolis. The Roman [[Via Egnatia]] led past it towards [[Thessaloniki]]. Though there are traces of human activity in Neolithic times, the settlement proper dates to the Iron Age (Illyrian proto-urban) through to the Illyrian urban period (5th to 2nd centuries BC),&lt;ref&gt;Gilkes, O., Albania An Archaeological Guide, I.B.Tauris 2012, {{ISBN|1780760698}}, p263&lt;/ref&gt; and reached its height under settlement by the Illyrian tribe of [[Enchele]] in the later Iron Age and was also occupied in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period as traces of a municipal building show. From the 4th to 1st centuries BC the city was the royal residence of Illyrian kings and therefore, also probably an important political and economic centre.&lt;ref name="Elsie2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PA405|date=19 March 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7380-3|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Albania]] included the Royal tombs of Selca e Poshtme in the [[UNESCO]] World heritage list of proposals.

==The settlement==
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Village.jpg|thumb|250px|Selcë e Poshtme]]
From 1969 to 1972 excavations were conducted by the Albanian archaeologist [[Neritan Ceka]].&lt;ref name="Gloyer2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillian Gloyer|title=Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCAt8ghUEzAC&amp;pg=PA139|year=2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-387-0|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Ceka, the settlement has five phases of occupation. Selcë I to III are divided into: late Neolithic, early [[Bronze Age]] and Late Bronze Age, all represented by different ceramic forms. The settlement was continuously inhabited from the Bronze Age into the Iron Age. During the 6th to 5th centuries BC the settlement developed as a proto-urban center on the road that ran along the river Shkumbin connecting the coast of Albania to Macedonia. From the Iron Age there is a permanent settlement at the site.
Around 570 BC/550 BC we arrive at the phase of Selcë IV, evidenced by traces of burnt dwellings, pottery, including imports from Corinth in the lower horizon, and some Ionian wares. In the upper horizon, local, red-brown painted pottery, wheel made pottery with two handles and Ionic and Attic products were found. The local potters copied Greek models and were also influenced by their style. During the 4th century the acropolis was fortified by an encircling wall of well-cut stone. The city occupied an area of 30,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In the 4th and 3rd centuries BC Selca was an important trading centre and was the administrative centre of the Illyrian region of the Dassaretae. Terraces were created in order to develop the settlement across the hilly terrain. In the 3rd century monumental tombs were cut into the rock around the acropolis, some with Ionic columns. One of these tombs was reused at the end of the 2nd century and a wide array of finds were discovered therein, including weapons, bronze vessels, ceramics and gold jewellery. 
The construction of the Via Egnatia, which bypassed the city, led to its decline. During the 4th century AD Selca, as a military and administrative centre, was re-fortified with stone walls bound with mortar. Houses were constructed from reused Roman and Illyrian masonry. On the basis of coin finds two elements phases of construction can be determined. The first from the time of [[Valentinian I]] (364-375), the second from the time of Justinian I (518 - 565) to the years 547/548. The city was of economic and political importance before being conquered by the [[Slavs]] who destroyed the last remains of the Illyrian city.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/909/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tombs==
The royal tombs are located under the Acropolis, carved into the rock, and created during the reign of the Illyrian kings (4th to 3rd centuries BC)

===Tomb I - Rock chamber burial with Ionic order (4th to 3rd centuries BC) ===
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb1.jpg|thumb|150px|Tomb I]]
Tomb I consists of a rectangular burial chamber with an antechamber or forecourt. A [[barrel vault]] covers the burial chamber, whose height is 2.10m. Outside the door there is a rain gutter and mortises. The facade of the tomb has a colonnade of Doric pilasters with capitals resembling the [[Ionic order]] decorate the facade on which traces of painting can still be seen, with an entablature above. The doorway is substantial. In the burial chamber, there are two rock-cut couches, one against the side wall and the other against the rear wall. This tomb is oriented towards the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] monumental tomb from the second half of the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Outline of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZS4AAAAIAAJ|year=1978|publisher=8 Nentori Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb II - Theatre burial (mid-3rd century BC)===
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb2.jpg|thumb|Tomb II]]
Tomb II has two elements: below is a rectangular burial chamber with stairs leading down. It would originally have been sealed with stone slabs. Above there is a theatre-like complex with two stepped rows of seats that could have served for any rituals or family visits to do with the deceased.

===Tomb III - Central burial (mid-3rd century BC) ===
This tomb is on two levels. The upper level is a rock cut exedra as an Ionic hemicycle, with eight pilasters whose capitals were made separately flanking the entrance. To the left there is a niche with a relief engraved with a Bucranium and a helmet of the Pergamene type. To the right is a relief of an Illyrian-Macedonian [[shield]]. The floor of the tomb had a mosaic, but nothing of this remains. The door, which would have been sealed, leads to a narrow chamber. Gilkes&lt;ref&gt;Gilkes, 2012, op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; considers that this chamber may have been abandoned due to the irregularity of the rock, and that the chamber below may have been cut as a result. A fault in the rock, and rough pick marks, are visible. 
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb3_ApparentGrave.jpg|thumb|Tomb III]]
The second chamber has a high barrel vault and contained two beautifully carved sarcophagi in the form of couches. 10 burials were recovered from this chamber, some in the sarcophagi and others in the floor. A second burial period is attested. These date to the last decades of the 3rd century and produced many grave goods, now on display in Tirana. Some scholars believe that this may have been the tomb of a royal family or dynasty. Among the grave goods are golden earrings, necklaces, pins, rings, all of the [[Hellenistic]] type, belt fittings, iron, a silver ornament depicting a battle scene, armour, spear points and 30 ceramic vessels.&lt;ref&gt;A. Eggebrecht: ''Albanien, Schätze aus dem Land der Skipetaren. Ausstellungskatalog'', Mainz 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb IV (second half of the 3rd century BC)===
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb4_Facade2.jpg|thumb|Part of the facade of Tomb IV]]
Tomb IV has a 5&amp;nbsp;m high facade with two separately carved Ionic columns and the entablature and tympanum of a temple. It is the most monumental of all. The facade is no longer in situ, though some parts can be seen on the ground. There was originally a double leaved stone door. The slots in the threshold are clearly visible. The burial chamber roofed is carved into a barrel vault and was originally covered in painted plaster. The chamber contains a single [[sarcophagus]] of stone slabs, which was robbed in antiquity. The grave dates from the second half of the 3rd century BC. Seven niches are carved into the rock of the long facade, partially covered with inscriptions that could have been made by the builder or the work supervisor, according to archaeologists. They date from the 1st century BC&lt;ref&gt;Neritan Ceka: ''Qyteti ilir; Prane Selces se Poshtme'', Tirana 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Frommer: ''Illyrer'', in: H. Ament (Hrsg.): ''Frühe Völker Europas'', Leipzig-Mannheim 1997, 16 – 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb V (late 3rd century)===
[[File:Selca_e_Poshtme_Tomb5.jpg|thumb|180px|Tomb V]]
The last tomb has the shape of a Macedonian built tomb and consists of an antechamber and the actual burial chamber, both covered and built in ashlar construction. A stone slab with relief serves as a false door to the grave chamber. In the chamber itself are the remains of three sarcophagi in the form of ''[[klinai]]'', built of upright stone blocks. They were used primarily for body burials. Later, urns and grave goods were laid in the sarcophagus. The tomb was robbed in antiquity.

Stone has worked in and written about film, music, experimental [[neurology]], writing, [[engineering]], and [[computer programming]]. Stone is [[transgender]] and is considered a founder of the academic discipline of [[transgender studies]].

==Early life and career==

Stone was born in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="goodeve1995"&gt;Goodeve, Thyrza Nichols (September 1995). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_n1_v34/ai_17501987/?tag=content;col1 How like a goddess.] ''[[ArtForum]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Stone is [[Jewish]] and has stated her original name was "'''Zelig Ben-Nausaan''' Cohen in Hebrew."&lt;ref name="goodeve1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cusset2008"&gt;Cusset, François (2008). ''French theory: how Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, &amp; Co. transformed the intellectual life of the United States,'' p. 256. University of Minnesota Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-4733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone has stated that she disliked formal education and preferred [[Academic audit|auditing classes]] with university professors whose work she admired. She has stated she worked at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]], then worked odd jobs to support her own research. She later graduated from [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], receiving a B.A. in 1965.&lt;ref name="jones2003"&gt;Graduation year is disputed. 1965 in Stone's [http://sandystone.com/pupik/full-cv.txt self-published c.v.]; 1964 in Jones, Steve (2003). ''Encyclopedia of new media: an essential reference to communication and technology.'' SAGE, {{ISBN|978-0-7619-2382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recording engineer, science fiction, and computing===

In the late 1960s Stone moved to New York City and embarked on a career as a [[recording engineer]], initially on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], and later on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. In 1969, Stone wrote about an April 7 recording session at [[Record Plant Studios]] with [[Jimi Hendrix]] for ''Zygote'' magazine.&lt;ref name="shapiro1995"&gt;Shapiro, Harry; Glebbeek, Caesar (1995). ''Jimi Hendrix, electric gypsy.'' Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-0-312-13062-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist David S. Bennahum, Stone "used to wear a long black cape and full beard."&lt;ref name="bennahum1997"&gt;Bennahum, David S. (February 1997). Just Gaming: Three Days in the Desert with Jean Baudrillard, DJ Spooky, and the Chance Band. ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' 7(2):59-63&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, Stone published several science fiction pieces under the [[pen name]] Sandy Fisher in ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' and ''Galaxy'' magazine.

In 1974 Stone withdrew from mainstream recording, settled in [[Santa Cruz, California]], and underwent [[gender reassignment]] with [[Donald Laub]] at  the Stanford Gender Dysphoria Program in [[Palo Alto]].&lt;ref name="levy2000"&gt;Levy, Dawn (May 3, 2000). [http://news.stanford.edu/news/2000/may3/sexchange-53.html Two transsexuals reflect on university's pioneering gender dysphoria program.] ''Stanford Report''&lt;/ref&gt; Later she became a member of the [[Olivia Records]] collective, a popular [[women's music]] label, and began collaboration within lesbian feminist circles. She was Olivia's sound engineer from ca. 1974-1978, recording and mixing all Olivia product during this period. 

In the early 1980s, Stone built a small computer, taught herself programming, and became a freelance coder, eventually becoming recognized as a computer expert.&lt;ref name="ulmer2005"&gt;Ulmer, Gregory L. (2005). ''Electronic monuments.'' University of Minnesota Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-4583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==

===Attacks by Janice Raymond in ''The Transsexual Empire''===

In 1979, the lesbian feminist scholar [[Janice Raymond]] mounted an ''ad hominem'' attack on Stone in ''[[The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male]]''.&lt;ref name="raymond1979"&gt;Raymond, Janice (1979). ''The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.'' Teachers College Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8070-2164-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raymond accused Stone by name of plotting to destroy the Olivia Records collective and womanhood in general with "male energy." In 1976, prior to publication, Raymond had sent a draft of the chapter attacking Stone to the Olivia collective "for comment", apparently in anticipation of outing Stone.  Raymond appeared unaware that Stone had informed the collective of her transgender status before agreeing to join.  The collective did return comments to Raymond, suggesting that her description of transgender and of Stone's place in and effect on the collective was at odds with the reality of the collective's interaction with Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transadvocate.com/terf-violence-and-sandy-stone_n_14360.htm|title=TERF hate and Sandy Stone|date=16 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raymond responded by increasing the virulence of her attack on Stone in the published version of the manuscript:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Masculine behavior is notably obtrusive.  It is significant that transsexually constructed lesbian feminists have inserted themselves into positions of importance and/or performance in the feminist community. Sandy Stone, the transsexual engineer with Olivia Records, an "all-women" recording company, illustrates this well. Stone is not only crucial to the Olivia enterprise but plays a very dominant role there.  The...visibility he achieved in the aftermath of the Olivia controversy...only serves to enhance his previously dominant role and to divide women, as men frequently do, when they make their presence necessary and vital to women. As one woman wrote: "I feel raped when Olivia passes off Sandy...as a real woman. After all his male privilege, is he going to cash in on lesbian feminist culture too?"&lt;ref name="raymond1979"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The collective responded in turn by publicly defending Stone in various feminist publications of the time. Stone continued as a member of the collective and continued to record Olivia artists until political dissension over her transgender status, exacerbated by Raymond's book, culminated in 1979 in the threat of a boycott of Olivia products. After long debate, Stone left the collective and returned to Santa Cruz.

===The ''Empire'' Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto===

In 1983 Stone befriended cultural theorist [[Donna Haraway]], a faculty member in the [[History of Consciousness]] program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Haraway was in the process of writing the watershed essay "A Manifesto for Cyborgs".  While Stone was studying for her doctorate with Haraway and James Clifford, she produced the seminal 1987 essay "The ''Empire'' Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto". After considerable discussion with Haraway, she began writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Donna and I discussed it several times, and Donna was amazing.  Not once did she say I should or shouldn't. What she did say was that it was my choice, and nobody else's. During those discussions I realized very powerfully that I was in the presence of a person who in her own time had made her own hard choices, and sometimes paid a terrible price, but kept on stepping up to the plate and hitting them out of the park, and that's what I was learning from her. Theory, of course theory.  But courage, how do you teach courage?  American academics give plenty of lip service to speaking truth to power, and then they run like scared rabbits, but here I was, gifted with being in the presence of an astonishingly courageous person.  Now it was my turn, and I had to stand up to that level of self-honesty and be equal to it.  We both knew that publishing the ''Posttranssexual Manifesto'' could be a career-ending move.  But I think Donna knew, as I knew, that if I didn't publish I wouldn't be able to live with myself afterward.  So I published.  You know the rest.&lt;ref name="brillo"&gt;Brillo interview&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The work was influenced by early versions of Haraway's "[[A Cyborg Manifesto]]" and first published in ''[[Social Text]]'', and by the turbulent political foment in [[cultural feminism]] of that period. [[Susan Stryker]] and [[Stephen Whittle]] situate Stone's work in the turbulent events of the time as a response to Raymond's attack:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stone exacts her revenge more than a decade later, not by waging an anti-feminist counterattack on Raymond, but by undermining the foundationalist assumptions that support Raymond's narrower concept of womanhood, and by claiming a speaking position for transsexuals that cannot be automatically dismissed as damaged, deluded, second-rate, or somehow inherently compromised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Stryker]] and [[Stephen Whittle]], ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important point of the essay was that transgender persons were ill-served by hiding their status, and that coming out—which Stone called "reading oneself aloud"—would inevitably lead to self-empowerment.  Thus "The ''Empire'' Strikes Back" rearticulated what was at the time a radical gay-lesbian political statement into a transgender voice. During this period, mainstream gay and lesbian activists generally suppressed [[transgender]] issues and visible transgender activists, fearing that they would frighten the uncertain and still shaky liberal base during a delicate period of consolidation. "The ''Empire'' Strikes Back" galvanized young transgender scholars and focused their attention on the need for self-assertion within a largely reactionary institutional structure. "The ''Empire'' Strikes Back" later became the center of an extensive citation network of transgender academics and a foundational work for transgender researchers and theorists.&lt;ref name="riddell2006"&gt;Carol Riddell's "Divided Sisterhood: A Critical Review of Janice Raymond's ''The Transsexual Empire'', reprinted in [[Susan Stryker]] and [[Stephen Whittle]], ''The Transgender Studies Reader'', New York: Routledge 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Stryker|Stryker]] and [[Stephen Whittle|Whittle]], writing in ''The Transgender Studies Reader'', refer to "The ''Empire'' Strikes Back" as

&lt;blockquote&gt;the protean text from which contemporary transgender studies emerged...In the wake of (the) article, a gradual but steady body of new academic and creative work by transgender people has gradually taken shape, which has enriched virtually every academic and artistic discipline with new critical perspectives on gender.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 2007, "The ''Empire'' Strikes Back" had been translated into twenty-seven languages and had been cited in hundreds of publications.

In 2011, [[Indiana University Bloomington]] hosted a conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~gender/postposttranssexual-conference.html&lt;/ref&gt; honoring the twentieth anniversary of the publication of "The ''Empire'' Strikes Back".  Stone was guest of honor, and while onstage commented "Last year I was invited to a conference about my work on four days' notice.  I asked why they waited until the last minute, and they said they would have invited me sooner, but because I was considered a founder of the field they assumed I was dead. I'm not."&lt;ref name="bloomington2011"&gt;Transcript of opening discussion, "Post-Posttranssexual: Transgender Studies and Feminism," 8 April 2011, Indiana University Bloomington.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to academia===

From 1987 to 1993 Stone was Haraway's student, marking Stone's return to academia.&lt;ref name="goodeve1995"/&gt; At Haraway's suggestion Stone visited [[University of California, San Diego]] campus as an exchange student in the newly formed Science Studies program. Following a dispute between progressive and conservative faculty factions, Stone was offered a job as Instructor in the Department of Sociology, teaching courses in sociology, anthropology, political science, English, communications, and the experimental program "The Making of the Modern World.", In 1992, she took an appointment as an Assistant Professor at the [[University of Texas, Austin]].

Stone received her doctorate in 1993. Her dissertation, "Presence", which Haraway supervised, was published in 1996 by [[MIT Press]] as ''The War of Desire and Technology at the Close of the Mechanical Age''. Stone described the work as "creat(ing) a discourse which contains all the elements of the original discourse but which is quite different from it...remember that at heart I am a narrator, a shameless teller of stories."{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In the years following the book's publication, several major social science departments fractured into separate departments along lines that in part came to be drawn by reference to "Desire and Technology" and other, similar publications.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;In an interview for the publication ''Switch'' (need issue &amp; date) Stone mentions that she once received a midnight phone call from a faculty member in the anthropology department at Rice University during which the caller urged her to repudiate ''Desire and Technology''.  Stone asked why and was told that the book "was destroying the department". Not long afterward the Rice University anthropology department did, in fact, break apart into two separate departments, seemingly along lines including, among other factors, who believed ''Desire and Technology'' was legitimate scholarship and who did not.&lt;/ref&gt;

===UT Austin ACTLab===

Beginning in 1993, Stone established the New Media program she named ACTLab&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actlab.utexas.edu {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970509122811/http://www.actlab.utexas.edu/ |date=1997-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Advanced Communication Technologies Laboratory) in the Radio-Television-Film department.  This work, and research in virtual communities, social software, and novel methods of presenting academic topics, drew wide attention, and contributed to the establishment and legitimation of what is now generally called New Media Art.

Stone's work and presence in the RTF department has been bitterly contested by powerful conservative faculty members, who have repeatedly tried to remove or marginalize her. In 1998 this small but vocal group issued a negative departmental report recommending that Stone be denied tenure. The university overruled this report, citing Stone's  contributions to multiple fields and reaffirming its commitment to original or unusual scholarship.

Granting Stone tenure had the negative effect of provoking attacks on her work and credibility by powerful conservative faculty within the RTF department, which for years has responded to inquiries with the statement that there is no New Media program or program called ACTLab within the department. (Based on university course listings and rosters, as of 2007 there were approximately 70 ACTLab students in active courses, 400 former students, and 2500 student webpages on the ACTLab website. The program attracts students from a broad range of departments and from other institutions.) In a 2006 talk at Arizona State University, Stone compared the RTF department's attempts to erase her work and presence to previous efforts by conservative administrators to deny voice to any unfamiliar or emergent disciplines or unusual people, and said it was merely to be expected.

Stone's career has been controversial.  In the mid-1990s she gave several highly publicized interviews during which she suggested that the era of academic scholarship, as the term was generally understood, was over:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reality of the situation is that academicians are no longer the sole privileged custodians of objects of knowledge called books...in an era in our developed nations when the ubiquity of almost instantaneous communication puts us in a situation where almost everything is everywhen, the imperial mandate of the university as a privileged site of truth and an authorization for guild membership has evaporated; though, like the dinosaur, it may take a while for that knowledge to reach the central nervous system.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since that time, although Stone continued to tour extensively, to present "theoryperformances" and formal theatrical performances, and to address her work to a wide variety of audiences across broad sampling of disciplines and skills, she has published less and less in print journals. This reached the extent that a group of her students took up the practice of recording, transcribing and printing her in-class lectures for their own use.

In 1999, she appeared in [[Gendernauts|Gendernauts: A Journey Through Shifting Identities]] a film by [[Monika Treut]] featuring Texas Tomboy, [[Susan Stryker]], and [[Hida Viloria]], a group of artists in [[San Francisco]] who live between the poles of conventional gender identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Release Info|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0192069/releaseinfo|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Stone began touring a theatrical performance titled ''The Neovagina Monologues'', modeled on the work of [[Spalding Gray]], although the title is a tribute to a work by [[Eve Ensler]].

In 2010 Stone retired from her position at the University of Texas, becoming Professor Emerita and continuing her ACTLab work by launching several programs based on the ACTLab model, most notably the ACTLab@EGS program at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. The ACTLab pedagogical model brought her international recognition; subsequently the ACTLab framework for education in the arts and technology has been adopted by many other programs such as the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the New Media Innovation Lab at Arizona State University at Tempe.  As of 2011 she was actively touring, speaking and performing, and had mounted several gallery installations of interactive art.

==Personal life==

During online virtual community research in 1994 Stone met [[Cynbe ru Taren]] (Jeffrey Prothero), a researcher, programmer and virtual worlds creator, who authored ''[[Citadel (software)|Citadel]]'', an influential bulletin board system. Stone and ru Taren were married in 1995. Currently Stone and ru Taren divide their time between [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. His extended family and her daughter, Tanith Stone Thole, also live in Santa Cruz.

The '''State Seal of Myanmar''' ({{lang-my|ပြည်ထောင်စုသမ္မတမြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော်အထိမ်းအမှတ်တံဆိပ်}}) is used in all official government documents, including publications.

==Description==
A red background with the golden Map of [[Myanmar]] surrounded by the laurel or olive branches in between two [[chinthe]], the mythical lions, facing opposite one another and the large yellow five-pointed star on top of the map and the entire Arms were surrounded by the traditional Burmese flower and the scroll on the bottom with the Name of the State: {{my|ပြည်ထောင်စု သမ္မတ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော်}} (PYIDAUNZU THANMĂDA MYĂMA NAINNGANDAW) (In [[Burmese language|Burmese]] for, '''REPUBLIC OF THE UNION OF MYANMAR'''). The new State Seal, as stipulated by Chapter XIII of the 2008 Constitution, was adopted in the [[Burmese constitutional referendum, 2008|2008 Burmese constitutional referendum]].

==History==
The original coat of arms contained the Burmese text {{my|ပြည်ထောင်စုမြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော်}} on the banner, which translates "Union of Burma", as well as three [[chinthe]] (the chinthe at the top was replaced by a star). Additionally, the cogwheel was a circle surrounded by Verse 194 of the Buddhavagga in the [[Dhammapada]] in Pali: {{my|သမဂ္ဂါနံ တပေါ သုခေါ}} (''samagganam tapo sukho''), which translates to "happiness through harmony" or "well-being through unity."

However, during [[Ne Win]]'s Socialist rule, the 1974 Constitution adopted a new state seal with the following changes: the coat of arms was modified to accommodate Socialist symbols: a cogwheel, a star at the top, and dual olive wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;1974 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma, Chapter XIV.&lt;/ref&gt; The words on the banner were also changed to {{my|ပြည်ထောင်စု ဆိုရှယ်လစ်သမ္မတ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော်}}, which translates "Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma". In 1988, when the [[State Peace and Development Council|State Law and Order Restoration Council]] staged a coup, the words {{my|ဆိုရှယ်လစ်သမ္မတ}} ("Socialist Republic") were removed.

The previous state symbol of Burmese monarchs was the [[green peacock]]. The use of the green peacock was continued during British colonial times and the State of Burma. The peacock also featured on [[Burmese rupee]]s as a national symbol.

===New state seal===
In 2008 a [[Constitution of Burma#2008 Constitution|new constitution]] for Burma was adopted in a controversial [[Burmese constitutional referendum, 2008|referendum]]. In this new constitution, changes have been made to the coat of arms. The new coat of arms removes the colours blue and dark gold/orange and instead just uses the colours red and gold/yellow. Also, the gear wheel has been removed and replaced with laurel or olive branches and the words on the central portion of the scroll have been changed to {{my|ပြည်ထောင်စု သမ္မတ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော်}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://missions.itu.int/~myanmar/pressrelease_PMGev/NationalConstitution(Draft)2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429180706/http://missions.itu.int/~myanmar/pressrelease_PMGev/NationalConstitution(Draft)2008.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Stephen Eastaugh''' (born 1960) is an Australian contemporary artist from [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]], Australia. He is known for producing semi-[[Abstract art|abstract]], [[mixed media]]  art, and his work is often informed by his experiences traveling.

== Career ==
Eastaugh studied at the [[University of Melbourne Faculty of VCA and MCM|Victorian College of the Arts]] from 1979 to 1981. After completing his Bachelors of Fine Art, he began to travel, first to New Zealand and Norway,&lt;ref&gt;Hor-Chung Lau, J. “Stitches and stays”, ''South China Morning Post'', 8 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  and since then has not settled anywhere for more than a few months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Jonathan. “The Art of Travel”, ''Asian Art News'', Vol. 14 No.6, November/December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1980s, he has participated in over 100 solo exhibitions and 100 group exhibitions in Australia and internationally. He is represented in many of Australia’s state and national art collections including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and Parliament House Canberra.

In 2012 Eastaugh self-published ''Unstill Life'', a book with a limited-edition of 500 copies, documenting his 30 years of traveling which he wrote over the winter of 2009 at [[Mawson station]] in Antarctica.

=== Artistic Style and Influences ===
Each of Eastaugh's semi-abstract, mixed-media artworks tells a story based on his travels&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley. “Wandering star”, The Australian, 26 June 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;, such as passing out after his drink was spiked in Peru (''Drugs'', 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Wardell, M “East(augh), West, North and South”, ''Stephen Eastaugh: Antarctica'', international touring exhibition catalogue, 2000-1&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Antarctichinoiserie-scape'' (2004), for example, was inspired by the rafting sea ice found in Antarctica while reminiscent of depictions of distance in Chinese landscape paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Jonathan. “The Art of Travel”, ''Asian Art News'', Vol. 14 No.6, November/December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  

Eastaugh calls his art of travel an ‘Unstill Life’.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lucinda. “Everysomewherever”, Mercedes magazine, Autumn 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He has made nine trips to Antarctica: three trips as the official [http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/antarctic-arts-fellowship/alumni/2000-2009/2000-stephen-eastaugh Australian Antarctic Arts fellow] (2000, 2002–3, 2009), and six times as an artist-in-residence on tourist ships. He travelled twice to the [[North Pole]] as part of a Polar art residency on Russian icebreakers.&lt;ref&gt;Hor-Chung Lau, J. “Stitches and stays”, ''South China Morning Post'', 8 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Ulan Bator (Mongolia), Nuuk (Greenland), Nufa Alofa (Tonga), Ushuaia (Argentina) are among the 80 plus countries Eastaugh has visited.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Jonathan. “The Art of Travel”, ''Asian Art News'', Vol. 14 No.6, November/December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; His 2006 Summer studio at Australia’s [[Davis Station]] in Antarctica was the subject of the [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]] documentary ''AntarcticArt''.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lucinda. “Everysomewherever”, ''Mercedes magazine'', Autumn 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On Eastaugh's third official trip to Antarctica he over-wintered at Mawson station.&lt;ref&gt;Raw, Kristin. “Ice in your paintbrush”, ''Australian Antarctic Magazine'', Issue 29, December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The work Eastaugh produces in each country regularly uses materials that resonate with, or are particular to, the local culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Jonathan. “The Art of Travel”, ''Asian Art News'', Vol. 14 No.6, November/December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These materials have a strong textural quality: encaustic wax, oilsticks, medical bandages, rugs, fabric, embroidery, damaged paper and pearl shells.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lucinda. “Everysomewherever”, ''Mercedes magazine'', Autumn 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rooted (Mongolia)'', 2004, for example, abstracts various Mongolian objects and views in 30 panels made from acrylic paint and embroidered medical bandages, wool and cotton thread.&lt;ref&gt;Hor-Chung Lau, J. “Stitches and stays”, ''South China Morning Post'', 8 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Personal life ==
An adopted child born in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lucinda. “Everysomewherever”, ''Mercedes magazine'', Autumn 2008 &lt;/ref&gt; Eastaugh made contact with his biological parents when he was 28.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley. “Wandering star”, ''The Australian'', 26 June 2010 &lt;/ref&gt; His biological father is a former Dutch sailor, based in Broome, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley. “Wandering star”, ''The Australian'', 26 June 2010 &lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Eastaugh married Argentinian photographer and vigneron Carolina Furque in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley. “Wandering star”, ''The Australian'', 26 June 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2683">{{About|the symphony by Howard Hanson|the symphony by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]|A Sea Symphony}}

The seventh [[symphony]] by [[Howard Hanson]], subtitled '''''A Sea Symphony''''', is a [[choral symphony]] commissioned by the [[National Music Camp]] in 1974 to commemorate its fiftieth season at [[Interlochen]], Michigan in 1977. It was first performed at the 1977 Interlochen Summer Music Camp by the International Youth Orchestra with singers made up of other students, staff and faculty. It was conducted by the composer.

Dedicated to Joseph. E. Maddy, founder of Interlochen and a close friend of Hanson, this was the last major symphonic work written by Hanson. Like [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s first symphony and the symphony for voices by [[Roy Harris]], Hanson's symphony is set to texts from ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' by [[Walt Whitman]] describing the a voyage of ocean exploration as a metaphor of life transiting into death.

About composing the work, Hanson remarked, "I had wanted to write the piece all my life and when I finally got at it — I was eighty — I had no trouble. It came out just as if I were thirty or even twenty-five, and I had no inhibitions about it. I didn't work on it, I didn't go over it, I didn't redo it — whoosh — it came like that!"&lt;ref&gt;David Russell Williams in ''Perspectives of New Music'', Vol. 20, No. 1/2 (Autumn, 1981 - Summer, 1982), pp. 12-25,&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony is set in three movements:
*"Lo! The Unbounded Sea" (largamente);
*"The Untold Want" (Adagio);
*"Joy! Shipmate, Joy!" (Allegretto molto).

'''''The Human Stain''''' is a 2003 [[drama film]] directed by [[Robert Benton]]. Its screenplay, by [[Nicholas Meyer]], is based on the [[The Human Stain|novel of the same name]] by [[Philip Roth]]. The film stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Nicole Kidman]].

==Plot==
In the late 1990s, writer [[Nathan Zuckerman]] ([[Gary Sinise]]) has settled in a lakeside [[New England]] cabin following his second divorce and a battle with [[prostate cancer]]. His quiet life is interrupted by Coleman Silk ([[Anthony Hopkins]]), a former dean and professor of classics at local Athena College, who was forced to resign after being accused of making a [[racist]] remark in class. Coleman's wife died suddenly following the scandal, and he wants to avenge his loss of career and companion by writing a book about the events with Nathan's assistance.

The project is placed on the back burner when Coleman has an affair with Faunia Farley ([[Nicole Kidman]]), a considerably younger, semi-literate woman who supports herself by working menial jobs, including at the college. Their relationship is threatened by the faculty members who forced Coleman from his job and by Faunia's [[stalker]] ex-husband Lester ([[Ed Harris]]), a mentally unbalanced [[Vietnam War]] veteran who blames her for the deaths of their children in an accident. Flashbacks of Coleman's life reveal to the audience his secret: he is an African American who has "[[passing (sociology)|passed]]" as a white Jewish man for most of his adult life.

===Critical response===
''The Human Stain'' received mixed reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 41% of 148 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with a [[rating average]] of 5.5 out of 10. The site's consensus is that "Though the acting is fine, the leads are miscast, and the story is less powerful on screen than on the page."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/human_stain/ "The Human Stain"], Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', A.O. Scott called it "an honorable B+ term paper of a movie: sober, scrupulous and earnestly respectful of its literary source . . . The filmmakers explicate Mr. Roth's themes with admirable clarity and care and observe his characters with delicate fondness, but they cannot hope to approximate the brilliance and rapacity of his voice, which holds all the novel's disparate elements together. Without the active intervention of Mr. Roth's intelligence . . . the story fails to cohere . . . At its best - which also tends to be at its quietest - ''The Human Stain'' allows you both to care about its characters and to think about the larger issues that their lives represent. Its deepest flaw is an inability to link those moments of empathy and insight into a continuous drama, to suggest that the characters' lives keep going when they are not on screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= |author= A.O. Scott |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9505E4D81430F932A05753C1A9659C8B63|title=Movie Review - FILM REVIEW; Secrets of the Skin, And of the Heart | work = NYTimes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' observed, "We have to suspend disbelief over the casting, but that's easier since we can believe the stories of these people. Not many movies probe into matters of identity or adaptation. Most movie characters are like [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek gods]] and [[comic book]] heroes: We learn their roles and powers at the beginning of the story, and they never change. Here are complex, troubled, flawed people, brave enough to breathe deeply and take one more risk with their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031031/REVIEWS/310310303/1023|title=The Human Stain Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2003) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[Mick LaSalle]] called it "a mediocre movie . . . [that] falls victim to a fatal lack of narrative drive, suspense and drama. Kidman and Hopkins are wrong for their roles, and that, combined with a pervading inevitability, cuts the film off from any sustained vitality. The result is something admirable but lifeless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/10/31/DD231134.DTL|title='Human Stain' doesn't quite wash / Philip Roth adaptation a nice effort but ultimately unbelievable|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Stratton]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as "an intelligent adaptation of Philip Roth's arguably unfilmable novel powered by two eye-catching performances . . . A key problem Benton is unable to avoid is that Hopkins and Miller don't look (or talk) the least bit like one another. Miller, who gives a strong, muted performance, convinces as a light-skinned African-American in a way Hopkins never does, which is not to suggest that the Welsh-born actor doesn't give another intelligent, powerful portrayal. It's just that the believability gap looms large."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117921675.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0|title=Review: ‘The Human Stain’|first=David|last=Stratton|date=3 September 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] said, "Hopkins and Kidman . . . are both as mesmerizing as they are miscast . . . ''The Human Stain'' is heavy going. It's the flashes of dramatic lightning that make it a trip worth taking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/_/id/5947821/rid/5947822/|title=Movie Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' of London called it "sapping and unbelievable [[melodrama]] . . . an unforgivably turgid lecture about [[political correctness]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7943-971961,00.html|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Western Story Magazine''''' was a [[pulp magazine]] published by [[Street &amp; Smith]], which ran from 1919 to 1949.&lt;ref name="ah"&gt;Doug Ellis, John Locke, and John Gunnison, (editors),''The Adventure House Guide to the Pulps'', Adventure House, 2000. (pp. 311–12).{{ISBN|978-1886937451}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of numerous pulp magazines devoted to [[Western (genre)|Western]] fiction. In its heyday, ''Western Story Magazine'' was one of the most successful pulp magazines; in 1921 the magazine was selling over half a million copies each issue.&lt;ref name="hulse"&gt;Ed Hulse, ''The Blood 'n' Thunder Guide to Collecting Pulps''. Murania Press, 2009. {{ISBN|0-9795955-0-9}} (pp. 137–141)&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters was in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street &amp; Smith Records|url=http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/s/street_smith.htm|publisher=Syracuse University Library|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Western Story Magazine'' began when Street &amp; Smith executive Henry Ralston decided to convert one of the company's [[Dime novel|nickel weeklies]], ''New Buffalo Bill Weekly'', into a pulp.&lt;ref name="ah" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Tuska, ''The Western Story: A Chronological Treasury'', University of Nebraska Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9439-4}} (p. xxiii).&lt;/ref&gt; Ralston installed Frank Blackwell as editor of the new magazine. The magazine attracted a number of famous Western authors, including [[Charles Alden Seltzer]], [[H. Bedford-Jones]], [[Stewart Edward White]], [[W. Ryerson Johnson]] and [[William MacLeod Raine]].&lt;ref name="hulse" /&gt; The November 25, 1920 issue was the first issue to carry the work of [[Max Brand]] (writing under the pseudonym George Owen Baxter). Brand's work would dominate the magazine in the next decade; he would write dozens of stories for ''Western Story Magazine'' both under his own name and several pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Nolan]], ''Max Brand, western giant: the life and times of Frederick Schiller Faust'', Popular Press, 1985 {{ISBN|978-0-87972-291-3}} (p. 67)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Western Story Magazine'' was also prominent in publishing material
by women writers, including [[B. M. Bower]] and Cherry Wilson.&lt;ref name="hulse" /&gt;

In the 1930s, the publication's roster of authors expanded to include [[Walt Coburn]], [[William Colt MacDonald]] and [[W. C. Tuttle]],&lt;ref name="hulse" /&gt; while noted pulp illustrator [[Walter M. Baumhofer]] contributed several covers.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Carr, ''The Western Pulp Hero'', Starmont House, 1989, {{ISBN|978-1-55742-032-9}} (pp. 119–120).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, Blackwell was succeeded as editor by John Burr, who edited the magazine until it ceased publication in 1949.&lt;ref name="hulse" /&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3186">:''See also [[Wigner–Weyl transform]], for another definition of the Weyl transform.''

In [[theoretical physics]], the '''Weyl transformation''', named after [[Hermann Weyl]], is a local rescaling of the [[metric tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ab}\rightarrow e^{-2\omega(x)}g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

which produces another metric in the same [[conformal class]].  A theory or an expression invariant under this transformation is called [[conformally invariant]], or is said to possess '''Weyl invariance''' or '''Weyl symmetry'''.  The Weyl symmetry is an important [[symmetry]] in [[conformal field theory]].  It is, for example, a symmetry of the [[Polyakov action]].

The ordinary [[Levi-Civita connection]] and associated [[spin connection]]s are not invariant under Weyl transformations. An appropriately invariant notion is the '''Weyl connection''', which is one way of specifying the structure of a [[conformal connection]].

==Conformal weight==
A quantity &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has [[conformal weight]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; if, under the Weyl transformation, it transforms via 

:&lt;math&gt;
   \varphi \to \varphi e^{k \omega}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus conformally weighted quantities belong to certain [[density bundle]]s; see also [[conformal dimension]].  Let &lt;math&gt;A_\mu&lt;/math&gt; be the [[connection one-form]] associated to the Levi-Civita connection of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.  Introduce a connection that depends also on an initial one-form &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\omega&lt;/math&gt; via

:&lt;math&gt;
   B_\mu = A_\mu + \partial_\mu \omega.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;D_\mu \varphi \equiv \partial_\mu \varphi + k B_\mu \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is covariant and has conformal weight &lt;math&gt;k - 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formulas==
For the transformation
:&lt;math&gt; 
    g_{ab} = f(\phi(x)) \bar{g}_{ab} 
&lt;/math&gt;    
We can derive the following formulas

'''''A Wheatfield with Cypresses''''' is any of three similar 1889 oil paintings by [[Vincent van Gogh]], as part of his [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|wheat field]] series.  All were exhibited at the [[Saint-Paul-de-Mausole]] mental asylum at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]] near [[Arles]], France, where Van Gogh was voluntarily a patient from May 1889 to May 1890.  The works were inspired by the view from the window at the asylum towards the [[Alpilles]] mountains.

The painting depicts golden fields of ripe wheat, a dark fastigiate [[Provence|Provençal]] [[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress]] towering like a green obelisk to the right and lighter green [[olive tree]]s in the middle distance, with hills and mountains visible behind, and white clouds swirling in an azure sky above.  The first version (F717)  was painted in late June or early July 1889, during a period of frantic painting and shortly after Van Gogh completed ''[[The Starry Night]]'', at a time when he was fascinated by the cypress.  It is likely to have been painted "[[en plein air]]", near the subject, when Van Gogh was able to leave the precincts of the asylum.  Van Gogh regarded this work as one of his best summer paintings.  In a letter to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], written on 2 July 1889, Vincent described the painting: "I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some poppies, a blue sky like a piece of [[tartan|Scotch plaid]]; the former painted with a thick impasto like the [[Adolphe Monticelli|Monticelli]]'s, and the wheat field in the sun, which represents the extreme heat, very thick too."

Van Gogh had to take time off painting in order to deal with some severe problems due to mental illness in late July and early August, but was able to resume painting in late August and early September 1889.  After making a [[Reed pen|reed-pen]] drawing of the work, now held by the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam, he copied the composition twice in oils in his studio, one approximately the same size (F615) and a smaller version (F743).  The larger studio version was probably painted in a single sitting, with a few minor later adjustments adding touches of yellow and brown.  Van Gogh sketched out the design with [[charcoal]] [[underdrawing]]; he applied thin paint on the cypress trees and sky, with the ground allowed to show in places, and thick [[impasto]] for the foreground wheat and the clouds above.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Van Gogh's A Cornfield, with Cypresses, John Leighton, Anthony Reeve, Ashok Roy and Raymond White, National Gallery Technical Bulletin, 1987, Volume 11, pp 42–59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Characteristically, he preferred the brilliant white of [[zinc white]] (zinc oxide) for the white clouds rather than [[lead white]], despite its poor drying qualities, with his [[Palette (painting)|palette]] also including [[cobalt blue]] for the sky, shades of [[chrome yellow]] for the wheat field, [[viridian]] and [[emerald green]] for the bushes and cypresses, and touches of [[vermilion]] for the poppies in the foreground and also synthetic [[ultramarine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/van-gogh-wheatfield-cypresses/ Vincent van Gogh, A Wheatfield with Cypresses], illustrated pigment analysis at ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;  The July "plein air" version was much more heavily worked, and may be considered a study for the more considered September studio painting.  He sent the smaller and less accomplished studio version to his mother and sister as a gift.

Vincent sent the larger July and September versions to his brother in Paris later in September 1889.  The July version was sold by Theo's widow in 1900 to artist [[Émile Schuffenecker]].  It passed through the hands of collector [[Alexandre Louis Philippe Marie Berthier, 4th Prince of Wagram|Alexandre Berthier]] and art dealer [[Paul Cassirer]] in Paris, where it was first exhibited and photographed at Galerie [[Eugène Druet]] in November 1909.  It was sold to banker [[Franz von Mendelssohn]] (1865–1935) in Berlin in 1910 and remained with the Mendelssohn family in Germany and Switzerland until it was sold to industrialist [[Emil Bührle]] in Zurich in 1952.  His son, [[Dieter Bührle]], sold the painting in 1993 to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York for $57 million using funds donated by publisher, diplomat and philanthropist [[Walter Annenberg]].

The [[National Gallery]] in London holds a similar version painted in Van Gogh's studio in September 1889, bought with the [[Courtauld Fund]] in 1923.  It is unlined, and was never varnished or waxed.  The third smaller version is held by a private collection (sold at [[Sotheby's]] in London in 1970; in the US in 1987).

'''William Hooker''' (1779&amp;ndash;1832) was a [[Great Britain|British]] illustrator of [[natural history]].

Hooker studied under [[Franz Bauer]] (1758&amp;ndash;1840), becoming the official artist of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]], whose publications he illustrated. He also worked on the "Oriental Memoirs" of [[James Forbes (botanist)|James Forbes]] and ''[[The Paradisus Londinensis]]'' with descriptions by [[Richard Anthony Salisbury]] (1761&amp;ndash;1829).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blunt|first1=Wilfrid|last2=Stearn|first2=William Thomas|authorlink2=William Thomas Stearn|year=1994|title=The Art of Botanical Illustration.

{{quote|William Hooker (no relation to Sir William) served as botanical artist to the Horticultural Society (now the Royal Horticultural Society) from 1812 until he retired in 1820. The present work includes a good selection of plates taken from his fruit paintings which, according to Blunt and Stearn, reveal him to have been "one of the greatest pomological artists of all time" (''The Art of Botanical Illustration'', p. 233).|[http://www.donaldheald.com/pages/books/29434/horticultural-society-of-london/transactions-of-the-horticultural-society-of-london-bound-with-transactions-second-series The Horticultural Society of London]}}
